,EVs,2025-05-28 10:24:00+00:00,Fast Company,Trump wants to kill EVs—but he's just giving BYD an advantage over Detroit - Fast Company,Adele Peters,,,,,https://www.fastcompany.com/91341030/trump-wants-to-kill-evs-but-all-hes-really-doing-is-giving-byd-a-leg-up-on-detroit,"In Thailand, another Chinese company called Changan is quickly gaining market share with its electric cars.
By 2023, around 60% of electric cars in China were cheaper than their gas equivalents without subsidies, the IEA says.
Despite all of this, the long-term strategy for U.S. automakers isn’t likely to change.
Meanwhile, Chinese EVs are spreading around the rest of the world.
For a growing middle class in emerging countries, “their first car might be a Chinese electric vehicle.”","The fastest-growing car brand in the U.K. is BYD, the Chinese automaker behind electric cars like the new £16,000 ($21,600) Surf. Last month, the brand outsold Tesla in Europe for the first time.

BYD is also the fastest-growing car brand in Brazil, where EV sales jumped up 85% last year. In the capital city of Brasilia, BYD now outsells all other cars, whether they’re gas or electric. In Nepal, where seven out of every 10 cars imported last year was an EV, BYD’s electric models vie with those from Tata, an Indian brand. In Thailand, another Chinese company called Changan is quickly gaining market share with its electric cars.

The world is going electric: The International Energy Agency recently projected that one in four cars sold this year will be an EV. But the U.S. is lagging behind, and the Trump administration’s assault on EVs will slow down the industry more. That doesn’t bode well for the future of American automakers.

“Probably the most dire scenario is that the U.S. becomes somewhat isolated in an idiosyncratic market, with lots of big pickups and SUVs that don’t sell in any other market, and that are still predominantly fossil fuel,” says John Paul MacDuffie, a management professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. “And we’re not exposed to competition from some of the new manufacturers or some of the new technologies—not only electric but autonomous and connected.”

China already had a long head start

Even before Trump—who has said that Biden’s support for EVs was a “Marxist hoax”—American car companies were behind their Chinese counterparts on the path to electrification. One factor was China’s continuous support, which started more than 15 years ago. “There were changes to the policy and subsidies, but generally it [was clear] that the government thinks this is good technology,” says Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan think tank. “So if you’re going to buy an electric vehicle, it’s not like in two years things are going to change dramatically.”

Before China started pouring billions into the sector and made EV competitiveness a national priority, BYD was already innovative and lobbying for government support. The company, which had been founded in 1995 as a battery manufacturer, was “entrepreneurial and ready to take up the challenge,” Mazzocco says.

Electric cars also got early support in the U.S.—Tesla got a $465 million low-interest loan from the Department of Energy in 2009, benefitted from EV tax credits for consumers, and got a major boost from California’s zero-emission vehicle credits. But China’s support went farther and faster. Around 60% of new car models sold in China are now electric, five times more than what’s available in the U.S., according to the IEA.

From the beginning, Chinese automakers were laser-focused on the cost of EVs. By 2023, around 60% of electric cars in China were cheaper than their gas equivalents without subsidies, the IEA says. In many cases, the technology is more advanced than EV tech from some Western automakers, as Chinese companies race to improve batteries and software.

Chinese companies are 30% faster than legacy automakers at developing new EV models, according to one analysis. Ford CEO Jim Farley admitted last year that he’d been driving an electric car from Xiaomi—a Chinese smartphone manufacturer that started making EVs—and said he “doesn’t want to give it up.”

“There’s no doubt” the future is electric

Still, American automakers know that their future is electric. “There’s no doubt about it,” says Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, the former chief economist at Ford. Companies have already spent billions on the transition. But right now, the legacy automakers face cost challenges. Engineering new batteries and new vehicles obviously has a steep capital cost, versus the depreciated capital costs for continuing to make internal combustion engine cars. And although EV sales grew faster last year than gas car sales, they aren’t growing as quickly as automakers hoped.

“I’ve done the math,” Hughes-Cromwick says. “It’s not great right now for our domestic manufacturers, because they’ve got low volume but high fixed costs on the new technology, and low capital costs and high volume on the old tech.”

As more EVs sell, companies can get to cost and pricing parity. Policies could help make the transition easier, she says, such as keeping tax credits in place for EVs. Instead, the federal government is pushing hard in the other direction.

Trump froze billions in spending on EV charging infrastructure, and blocked subsidies for factories making batteries, despite the fact that those factories were creating American jobs. Congress is trying to get rid of the consumer tax credit and add a new annual fee for EV owners (though the fee is meant to replace the gas tax, the total cost would be higher than drivers with gas cars currently spend on it). Congress is also trying to block California’s plans to transition to zero-emissions vehicles. Tariffs have added to the economic pressure.

Despite all of this, the long-term strategy for U.S. automakers isn’t likely to change. “The time horizon for product cycles, facility planning, and supply chain planning is very long,” says MacDuffie. “They’re global companies, so they’re not just planning for the U.S. market. I have been predicting that U.S. companies will continues to pursue a long-term strategy which is premised on electrification hitting most markets and most products. I think it would take years of a hostile economic and policy environment for them to back away from that in a big way.”

It’s too early to count out American automakers, Hughes-Cromwick says, noting that they could pull forward on software, for example. But as Trump pushes for anti-EV policy, companies are slowing some electric investments, and are likely to keep falling behind as Chinese companies race forward. A year ago, the IEA predicted that EVs would hit 50% of car sales in the U.S. by 2030; the agency has now revised that to 20%.

With steep tariffs keeping cheap Chinese EVs out of the U.S., there’s less incentive for American automakers to innovate as quickly on electric vehicles. The current tax bill also reduces support for EV battery makers and slashes funding for research and development of new battery tech through the Department of Energy.

Meanwhile, Chinese EVs are spreading around the rest of the world. Last year, BYD surpassed Tesla in global vehicle sales. BYD’s stock price has climbed around 59% on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since the beginning of 2025, while Tesla’s has declined around 11% on the Nasdaq, despite some recovery in recent weeks. In Brazil, BYD is now rebuilding a former Ford factory, on a street that a local politician wants to rename from Henry Ford Avenue to BYD Avenue.

“Once consumers have access to these vehicles, they’re really interested,” says Mazzocco. For a growing middle class in emerging countries, “their first car might be a Chinese electric vehicle.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/05/p-1-91341030-us-lagging-on-evs.jpg",N,,2025-05-28 07:04:05.959566

This time of year reminds us that while one season ends, another begins. Although the 2025 Regular Session concluded in March, back in Frankfort, the work on behalf of Kentuckians does not pause. The way the legislature proceeds will look quite different.

Since adjourning the session, it has been a particularly busy time in the district—from graduations, to agriculture events, to groundbreakings, from finalizing long-awaited projects to celebrating new investments in our district. Several notable events occurred across the district over the past month, including two exciting ribbon cuttings, spotlighting the value of local partnerships and public investment in our schools.

At Cannonsburg Elementary, students, educators, families, and local leaders gathered to celebrate the reopening of the school following a two-year, $11.8 million renovation. With expanded classrooms, a new cafeteria and library, upgraded safety infrastructure, and long-overdue facility improvements, this project marks a significant step forward for education in the region. The majority of the funding—over $7 million—was awarded through state investment, reinforcing the importance of our shared commitment to public education. When students took the stage to thank us, it was a powerful reminder of why this work matters.

That same day, I joined community leaders at Boyd County High School for the ribbon cutting of the new Career and Technical Center, which is another critical investment in our region’s future. This facility will offer students hands-on training and career preparation in a range of fields, equipping them with the tools they need to pursue opportunities right here at home. I was proud to support this project alongside Boyd County Schools and local government partners. Together, these efforts reflect our determination to invest in infrastructure that uplifts students, strengthens families, and builds the foundation for long-term economic growth throughout the district.

Looking toward June, legislators will soon return to Frankfort as we enter what is known as the Interim Joint Session. This phase of the legislative calendar is not a break from duty. It is a period of deeper focus before the next session commences. This is when lawmakers review past legislation, examine pressing issues, and study the policy decisions that shape everyday life across the Commonwealth.

For me, this interim is a time to listen, ask better questions, and prepare. With a 60-day budget session on the horizon in 2026, the work we do over the next several months will influence how we invest in education, health care, public safety, and rural economic opportunity. This is where the foundation is built. I plan to take an active role in that process.

During the regular session, the General Assembly debates and votes on bills. The pace is fast and decisions move quickly. The interim slows that pace down. It gives us time to look closely at the effects of laws already passed and to gather information about the challenges ahead.

Interim committees meet jointly with members of both the House and Senate. They hear from experts, review data, and consider testimony from Kentuckians affected by state policy. This is when ideas are refined. This is when better policy begins to take shape.

I serve on five Interim Joint Committees. These are not ceremonial roles. Each committee meets regularly to consider real issues that affect families, workers, and communities across the Commonwealth. Below is a summary of the work ahead.

Interim Joint Committee on Agriculture

In our part of the state, agriculture is more than a job. It is a way of life. This committee focuses on farm safety, conservation programs, food systems, and rural economic development. We also review policies involving crop insurance, disease control, and livestock health. I will be watching closely how recent changes in funding affect access to grants and loans that support small and family-owned farms. This includes attention to the administration of the Tobacco Master Settlement funds and the role of the Kentucky Office of Agricultural Policy. Rural prosperity begins with smart investment in agriculture, and I will continue to advocate for that.

Interim Joint Committee on Appropriations and Revenue

This committee reviews how Kentucky raises and spends public dollars. We examine budget forecasts, tax structures, and state investments in infrastructure, education, and health services. Every policy depends on how the budget is constructed. This interim will be critical in shaping the next biennial budget. I will continue pushing for equitable funding across regions and fairness in state resource distribution. The needs of rural communities deserve full consideration.

Budget Review Subcommittee on Justice and Judiciary

The justice system involves real people and serious decisions. This subcommittee reviews funding for the courts, public defenders, corrections, and law enforcement. I will focus on access to justice in rural areas. That includes ensuring our courthouses are funded, our victims are supported, and our mental health services for justice-involved individuals are not overlooked. Budgeting for justice requires more than numbers. It requires a commitment to fairness and dignity.

Interim Joint Committee on Families and Children

This committee focuses on services that help Kentuckians meet their basic needs. That includes support for children and adults in crisis, nutrition programs, foster care, and child protection. These services are essential in rural areas where access can be limited by geography, staffing shortages, or weak infrastructure. I will work to ensure federal dollars are used effectively and that state policies meet the real-world needs of families in my district.

Interim Joint Committee on Natural Resources and Energy

Kentucky’s future depends on responsible management of our natural resources. This committee reviews issues tied to water systems, utilities, environmental protections, and energy development. I continue to support a balanced approach. We must protect our land and water while also recognizing the role of energy and natural resource jobs. Flood mitigation and water infrastructure investment will be key issues in this interim. I will be a strong voice for smarter, forward-looking policy in these areas.

In addition to interim joint committees, I serve on several statutory committees established under Kentucky law or authorized as permanent subcommittees of the Legislative Research Commission. These committees meet regularly to review complex financial, infrastructure, and agricultural matters. Their proceedings are open to the public and the press.

Capital Projects and Bond Oversight Committee

This committee is tasked with reviewing how state dollars are spent on capital construction and public infrastructure. That includes oversight of emergency repair accounts, the leasing or purchase of state-owned properties, and bond issuances for both state government and local school districts. I will continue to monitor how capital investments are allocated and whether they are serving the long-term needs of our communities.

2026–2028 Budget Preparation and Submission Committee

As Kentucky prepares for the biennial budget, this committee plays an important role in setting the framework for how agencies draft and submit their spending plans. The committee provides guidance on budget instructions, formats, and requirements, ensuring consistency and accountability across government. This work will help shape the foundation of the 2026 budget session, and I intend to approach it with the seriousness it deserves.

Tobacco Settlement Agreement Fund Oversight Committee

This committee reviews the use of Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement funds, with a focus on agricultural development, public health, and early childhood investments. We evaluate grants and loans issued by the Agricultural Development Board and examine how those resources are being used to diversify farm income, support rural communities, and advance long-term planning for Kentucky agriculture. I remain committed to preserving the original intent of these funds and ensuring they reach the people and programs they were designed to help.

The legislative process works best when people are involved. Interim Joint Committee meetings are open to the public. They are also streamed online and archived for review. Anyone can watch, read, or participate.

Over the next few months, these issues will be a focus, and listening to constituents to hear what is working and what is not, is vital to how we move forward on them. That feedback shapes how I serve. Being a public servant means showing up, following through, and carrying local voices into every conversation in Frankfort. Whether we are talking about roads, rivers, classrooms, or courtrooms, the goal is good policies that serve the people where they live.

The interim session may not make the headlines, but it is where thoughtful work begins. I look forward to continuing that work with care and with the same commitment I brought to the regular session.

Some of the announced investments in Kentucky have yet to come to fruition, and without tax credits, companies may pull back.

Companies and clean energy advocates have cautioned lawmakers against the cuts, which they say would complicate efforts to bolster domestic manufacturing and clean energy supply chains.

In Kentucky, more than 11,000 jobs and billions of dollars in economic development hang in the balance as Congress considers axing clean energy tax credits approved in the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, according to an analysis from Rhodium Group and MIT — threatening a key pillar of what's widely considered the most comprehensive climate legislation in U.S. history.

Dozens of projects are still pending or under construction around the state, from battery manufacturing to solar facilities and more, the analysis found. If Congress decides to slash tax incentives for these industries, the companies behind the incomplete projects could scale back plans for investment.

Modifying or repealing the tax credits “is a huge risk,” said Hannah Hess, an associate director at Rhodium Group who worked on the analysis — and is piling on uncertainty for companies already facing tariffs and other macroeconomic headwinds.

Kentucky has more operational jobs at stake in these projects than almost any other state, according to the analysis, excluding construction jobs. Nearly 2% of Kentucky’s economy was made up of the ""clean investments"" tracked in the analysis in the past year — tied for the largest portion of any state east of the Mississippi River.

In the early hours of May 22, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a version of a bill experts said would cripple or eliminate most of the clean energy tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act.

The cuts would impact key credits for manufacturers, but also those for consumers looking to buy electric vehicles, heat pumps and more. This could flatten demand for clean technologies, in turn impeding plans for new factories, like those coming to Kentucky.

The bill passed the House by a one-vote margin, sending it to the Senate, where it is expected to face further resistance and revision.

Following the vote, Gov. Andy Beshear encouraged the Senate to reverse the House’s cuts to the clean energy tax credits, ""if not for the original reasons that it was passed, but for the fact that it’s really good for our economy.""

Beshear has voiced his support of several large manufacturing projects in Kentucky poised to benefit from federal tax credits, including the $5.8 billion BlueOval SK Battery Park in Hardin County, which is only partially constructed but is expected to offer 5,000 jobs when complete.

Other potentially vulnerable Kentucky projects with outstanding investments include battery manufacturing facilities in Shelbyville and Bowling Green, and another project near Hopkinsville — which had already announced plans to partially scale back its investment in February, citing ""changing market conditions.""

""The credits worked. They worked. And whether you like a green job because it’s better for the environment, or because it provides a really good living for people, it was working,"" Beshear said at a press briefing. ""It was pushing unemployment down, and it was really helping families.""

Republicans divided on clean energy credits

In Kentucky's 2nd Congressional District, an estimated $2.7 billion in outstanding investment is on the line, the analysis found — the most in the state. The district contains the incomplete BlueOval SK project, in addition to some solar developments and the AESC battery project near Bowling Green.

Republican Brett Guthrie represents the district in Congress, and chairs the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. In a Wall Street Journal Op-Ed, Guthrie lauded his committee’s efforts to curb what he called ""Green New Deal-style waste,"" and said the proposed legislation would ""reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act, returning $6.5 billion in unspent funds.""

Guthrie's office did not respond to a request for comment.

In April, a group of companies with major clean energy investments in Kentucky, including Ford Motor Co., Ascend Elements, BrightNight Power and others, wrote a letter to Guthrie ""to emphasize the importance of preserving tax credits that are energizing advanced energy production and manufacturing in our state.""

""We have seen firsthand the benefits that these tax credits are bringing to our communities: providing investment certainty for our manufacturing economy, creating opportunities for our workers, and maintaining our pre-eminent role in providing the energy that powers a dominant American economy,"" the letter said.

Republicans in both chambers of Congress have been divided on various pieces of President Donald Trump’s sprawling tax and policy proposal, including whether to preserve key tax credits for clean energy investments. In the Senate, four Republicans wrote a letter cautioning ""against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.""

A sizeable majority of the clean energy investments that stand to benefit from the embattled IRA tax credits are in Republican congressional districts. Kentucky's five Republican-represented districts have seen nearly $16 billion in planned investment tied to these projects; more than $9 billion has been spent so far, the MIT and Rhodium Group analysis estimates.

""These districts have been awarded billions for economic development projects that provide exactly the energy transition investments needed to advance renewables and storage at a pace that is more in line with national trends,"" Lane Boldman, executive director of the Kentucky Conservation Committee, said in an email. ""These outstanding investment dollars would not only diversify and modernize our energy portfolio, but have the added benefit of bringing on cleaner energy technologies that are proven and available right now.""

In recent years, some Kentucky Republicans have been dubious about the rush of ""green"" investment in the commonwealth. But the thousands of new jobs have been hard to ignore.

Although some projects have faced setbacks or are still in construction, Kentucky has already seen the creation of more than 14,000 clean energy jobs, spanning ""battery manufacturing, automotive, grid infrastructure, critical minerals, and clean energy industries,"" according to the companies' letter to Guthrie.

In some cases, these jobs offer relief to communities that have suffered from a contraction in domestic manufacturing or other industries, like coal mining.

The gargantuan Toyota Motor plant in Georgetown, for one, has announced plans to invest more than $1 billion in electric vehicle manufacturing. As the plant has geared up for the expansion, it has made a point of hiring former coal workers, the area's former state senator previously told The Courier Journal.

The Republican supermajority in Kentucky's state legislature has approved generous incentives for electric vehicle battery manufacturing and other major clean energy investments, even as the party has criticized the federal programs upholding those investments.

Several of the companies with large outstanding investments in Kentucky, including BlueOval SK, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ascend Elements, which has plans to produce materials for battery manufacturing near Hopkinsville, was among the companies calling for sustained federal support, and cited estimates of its project having ""a positive $4.4 billion economic impact on southwest Kentucky over 10 years.""

""We believe it’s critical for the United States to build a domestic critical minerals and lithium-ion battery manufacturing infrastructure in North America,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement. ""Beyond creating jobs in Kentucky, it’s a matter of national security and energy independence.""

Bridging 'the valley of death'

Businesses are facing significant uncertainty in clean tech investments, and there are some indicators in the data around the country.

""Since the IRA was passed, we’ve seen a huge amount, dollar-wise, of companies announcing projects in the vein of these advanced new technologies,"" Hess said. ""In the first quarter of last year, there was $16 billion worth of projects announced that fit into this emerging climate technologies category,"" and billions of dollars more were announced as recently as late 2024.

But in the first quarter of this year, ""that really fell off a cliff,"" she said.

About $79 million was announced nationally — a 99% drop.

""That's the pipeline of how much is going to be invested in the future,"" Hess said. ""It points to, potentially, a big slowdown in these kinds of advanced technologies.""

Many of the projects that stood to benefit from IRA tax credits were relatively cutting-edge, or at least not yet mainstream in the U.S. — battery factories of unprecedented scale, or mass decarbonization of manufacturing in emissions-intensive industries.

These large capital investments were ""de-risked by federal incentives,"" as companies put it in the letter to Guthrie.

""Decarbonizing those processes like aluminum, clean cement, clean steel ... that's a really gnarly thing to figure out how you're going to get reduced emissions from those,"" Hess said.

Incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, now under siege by Congress, included tax credits for ""advanced manufacturing production,"" which applied to components for solar, wind and batteries, in addition to critical minerals. Other credits bolstered grid modernization or energy generation.

These incentives were designed, in part, to help the U.S. clean energy industry compete with China, where costs are far lower. And the U.S. fossil fuel industry has received federal tax breaks for more than a century. In recent years, the coal, petroleum and natural gas industries have collectively benefited from billions of dollars in subsidies, according to accounting from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

By offering various subsidies to the clean technology projects, Hess said, the federal government was attempting to bridge what venture capitalists call the ""valley of death"" — the early period of startups or other new business endeavors, before a positive cash flow is achieved.

And the clean energy sector has found some success. U.S. electric vehicle sales have generally increased over time, and last year, renewable energy made up more than 90% of new power capacity in the grid.

Kentuckians have taken part in these trends. Since the beginning of last year, consumers and businesses in the state have spent about $1 billion on electric vehicles, heat pumps, and ""distributed electricity and storage,"" such as rooftop solar systems, according to MIT and Rhodium Group estimates.

Tax credit cuts could also stymy projects eyeing Kentucky, but yet to be announced — like Century Aluminum's planned ""green aluminum"" smelter. The company has described Eastern Kentucky as a preferred location for the smelter, but has not confirmed a site and is considering other states.

If brought to fruition, the project would create 1,000 permanent, union jobs, and would single-handedly double domestic production of primary aluminum, powered primarily by renewable energy. Century has previously praised the IRA's advanced manufacturing production tax credit for its benefits to U.S. aluminum producers.

If the U.S. Senate preserves the House's cuts to such credits, plans set in motion by the previous administration to decarbonize the U.S. economy and create domestic supply chains for EVs, clean energy and low-carbon manufacturing could be further slowed.

""It's really concerning, if you care about climate,"" Hess said, ""to see these kinds of projects kind of circling the drain.""","https://www.courier-journal.com/gcdn/presto/2022/04/13/PLOU/902cb6b7-b1e3-41a4-a1f5-53eb0cf3ece8-EnvisionGigafactory_1.jpg?crop=4161,2341,x0,y233&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-28 06:02:45.638231

This leaves me with some questions: Is the elimination of those renewable energy tax credits worth the slowdown in those high-wage manufacturing jobs?
Is there a way to spur that job growth in clean energy manufacturing without those tax credits?","President Donald Trump wants to boost American manufacturing, a goal that has eluded other presidents in the so-called “post-industrial” era but a laudatory one nonetheless.

However, many of the manufacturing jobs that he and other administration officials talk most prominently about are likely minimum-wage or other low-wage positions. Meanwhile, the “big, beautiful” bill now moving through Congress would likely slow the growth of one fast-growing manufacturing sector where the average annual income is $81,600. Furthermore, those jobs are concentrated in places that voted for Trump in 2024, meaning that some Republican members of Congress are finding themselves in the position of potentially slowing manufacturing growth in their own districts.

What we have here is a conflict between political ideology that is often quite clear and economic realities that are more complicated and don’t fit easily into standard left-right political alignments. Some of this conflict is playing out in Virginia, most notably in Pittsylvania and Pulaski counties. Let’s walk through what’s going on here.

Manufacturing jobs in the United States started falling in 1979, then fell dramatically after 2000 (which coincides with both the North American Free Trade Agreement and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization) and bottomed out in 2010. Since then, their numbers have grown sluggishly, no matter which president or which party was in power. There are lots of factors at play, but generally speaking, many jobs have gone overseas to lower-wage countries and many others have been automated.

Trump’s solution to this 21st-century problem is to bring back a tax most popular in the 19th century: tariffs, or taxes on imports. The theory is that if imported goods cost more, companies will be encouraged to reshore their manufacturing to the United States so they don’t lose customers.

Last week, Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Apple’s iPhones if they’re not manufactured in the United States. This is not the first time those devices — and other consumer technology — have been singled out. Earlier this year, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick declared: “The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones — that kind of thing is going to come to America.”

If they did, though, that iPhone would cost a whole lot more than it does now. Workers at one assembly plant in China make $244 a month, or $2,928 a year. Let’s assume Apple opened an assembly line in the United States and paid workers at the same rate that I see being advertised for some convenience store employees — $15 an hour. That’s $31,200 a year, or more than 10 times what those China iPhone assemblers are making. It is simply unrealistic to expect American consumers to pay that much more for their cherished phones, and unrealistic to expect Apple shareholders to make do with lower dividends. American consumers demand inexpensive products and American investors demand a return, which is why low-skilled manufacturing has gone overseas and will stay there. The economics just don’t work otherwise. Americans don’t get paid enough money to afford the prices that companies would have to charge if they made their products with American labor.

The manufacturing that can — and is — growing in the United States involves more high-skilled work. Conveniently, we have some — but some of the provisions in the Republican tax bill put those jobs in jeopardy.

The bill sets out to roll back certain tax credits for renewable energy that were enacted under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which was really more of a climate bill than an anti-inflation bill. Both the politics and the economics seem simple: Republicans have never been as keen on renewable energy as Democrats have been, and they want to get rid of those tax credits to make it easier to cut spending elsewhere. Here’s where things get complicated for them and interesting to those of us who follow politics: Those tax credits have created green manufacturing jobs in red states and red districts. The stereotype of an electric vehicle driver might be a Democrat, but those vehicles — and especially their batteries — are being built by Republicans. A study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Denver-based research firm, the Rhodium Group, found that since the Inflation Reduction Act was passed, the U.S. has seen $662 billion invested in clean energy projects, with $115 billion of that in manufacturing. Of that, almost 82% of those projects have been in Republican congressional districts. In terms of jobs, CNBC reports that about 86,700 clean energy manufacturing jobs are in Republican districts, nearly triple the 30,400 in Democratic districts; that’s 74% of clean tech manufacturing jobs going to Republican districts.

Furthermore, the manufacturing news website Manufacturing Dive reports that in 2024 clean energy was one of the three biggest drivers of manufacturing investment in the U.S. — the others were semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. Of those three, clean energy manufacturing appears to have added the most new jobs. At a time when overall manufacturing growth is sluggish (and actually declined in 2024), these are the growth areas that you’d think the federal government would want to encourage further.

In politics, this is called cross-pressure, where an officeholder is pulled two different ways — the desire to cut renewable energy credits versus the desire to grow manufacturing jobs.

Some more numbers:

1. Under the overall umbrella of clean energy technology, battery manufacturing has been a particularly strong growth sector, and about 90% of that growth has been due to electric vehicles, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. About 84% of the investment in electric vehicle-related facilities (and electric vehicles are basically big batteries on wheels) has come in 10 states. Last year, all but one of them voted for Trump. The one exception was Illinois. In all, the battery-related jobs in those 10 states account for 72,500 jobs. Lead-acid batteries account for about 60% of the market; the average wage at those jobs is $81,600, according to the Battery Council.

2. Over the past two years, solar panel manufacturers have announced more than 44,000 jobs in the United States. Of the 10 states with the most solar jobs, six voted for Trump, according to the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. Solar manufacturing jobs average about $60,000 a year, according to Indeed.com.

3. The single fastest-growing job in the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is that of wind turbine technician, for which the median pay is about $62,000 a year. Of the eight states with the biggest demand, six voted for Trump.

Republicans would not dare call this the Green New Deal, but this is the Green New Deal — the premise that the transition to renewable energy can and will create jobs. The catch, of course, is that it’s not creating those jobs in the same places where fossil fuel jobs are going away, such as Appalachia, but that’s a topic I’ve harped on before. Nonetheless, renewable energy is creating manufacturing jobs and doing so mostly in Republican areas, largely because Republicans govern the states in the Sunbelt where manufacturing of all types is growing fastest (a topic for a future column), although in the case of wind, it’s because the windiest states are Republican ones in the Midwest.

Republicans may not like the economics involved — they may prefer to see a more free-market approach without any tax credits to goose a particular sector — but as a practical matter, a bill they didn’t like is helping to create jobs for their constituents. You can see why some Republican senators are now starting to raise questions about the House bill, with a particular focus on the phaseout of many of these renewable energy credits. In the coming weeks, as these details get debated, we’re not going to hear about carbon emissions or melting ice caps or rising sea levels, we’re going to hear about investment dollars and job counts, which makes for a very different discussion.

Last week, Virginia’s Commission on Electric Utility Regulation — known by the unflattering acronym of CEUR, pronounced “sewer” — heard from Ben Norris of the Solar Energy Industries Association. He warned that the U.S. House bill would cripple further growth of solar energy. That might seem good news for those in rural areas who think solar “farms” are an ugly, industrial blight on the landscape but not such good news for those who want the lights to come on: Norris spelled out how much solar wouldn’t be developed — enough to supply the entire state of Pennsylvania is how he measured it. That might bother those who wonder how we’re going to meet rising power demands but might not bother those who think we should just power the grid with natural gas and coal, anyway.

However, Norris also said doing away with the tax credit would eliminate more than 300,000 solar-related jobs over the next three years, with 86,000 of those in manufacturing and more than 200,000 in construction. While doing away with those credits may satisfy one set of Republican goals, they seem to run directly counter to other Republican goals — specifically creating manufacturing jobs, particularly good-paying ones (and good-paying ones in rural areas). As William Shakespeare once observed, “aye, there’s the rub.”

The Rhodium Group recently came up with a data set of all the energy-related jobs eligible for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, and organized that data set by congressional district. Here’s what it shows for Virginia, with congressional districts ranked by order of investment announced:

Whether you go by investment already in the ground, or investment promised, the two districts with the most investment, and four of the top five, are Republican districts. The bottom five districts, including three with zero IRA-eligible districts, are all Democratic districts. Going simply by that, you’d think these tax credits were a Republican invention, not a Democratic one.

Personally, I’m not especially moved by these investment numbers. The 2nd District ranks so high because of Dominion Energy’s offshore wind project off the coast of Virginia Beach. (Disclosure: Dominion is one of our donors, but donors have no say in news decisions; see our policy.) The 5th District ranks next highest because of all the solar development across Southside. In the case of solar, there is a lot of investment across Southside, but, after construction is completed, those solar farms don’t create many jobs. That’s why I’m much more interested in the jobs analysis:

The order of the districts is different here, but the pattern is the same: The top two districts, and five of the top six, are all Republican districts. Southside’s 5th District represented by John McGuire has more than twice as many IRA-eligible jobs as the next biggest district, the 9th District represented by Morgan Griffith.

Why is this, since I just said all those solar farms don’t create many jobs? Now we’re into the details, but we need to understand these details if we want to understand what’s going on. One of the more interesting energy policy debates is on the left, between those who think nuclear energy is dangerous and dirty and those who think it may be the only way to retire a lot of fossil fuel sources. The Biden administration was pro-nuclear, so the Inflation Reduction Act has a lot of incentives for nuclear energy. That’s why the 5th District ranks so high — all those nuclear-related jobs with BWX Technologies and Framatone in Lynchburg, plus Dominion’s existing North Anna nuclear plant in Louisa County. Some might look at these rankings and think, wow, the 5th District has a lot of green energy; others who know more about the district will look at these rankings and say there sure are a lot of nuclear jobs there.

The Republicans who want to strip out the tax credits for renewables want to keep the incentives for nuclear, so the number of jobs in the district potentially at risk if the lack of tax credits dries up the renewable energy sector isn’t nearly that high. Alas, the data doesn’t give further breakdowns, so consider those 5th District numbers with an asterisk beside them to account for all the nuclear-related jobs that aren’t endangered.

However, even if we take out nuclear, the 5th District still has at least 2,000-plus jobs potentially at risk — the jobs that Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced last year would be coming to Pittsylvania County in the form of a Microporous battery plant. Virginia, for multiple reasons, had fallen just outside the so-called “battery belt” that has arisen in the Southeast — until that Microporous announcement. The company hasn’t commented, but that firm has been counting on growth in the battery sector. If the end of these renewable energy tax credits slows that growth, well, you can do the math. Furthermore, the Trump administration has yet to deliver a $100 million grant to Microporous that was promised by the Biden administration. In Virginia, Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax County, last week posted a New York Times story that reported the Republican tax bill “would gut subsidies for battery manufacturing.” Surovell’s comment on X, formerly known as Twitter: “Why does the GOP hate Pittsylvania County?” I don’t think they hate Pittsylvania County, but they hate the tax credits that Pittylvania might benefit from.

It is curious that after a Republican-voting locality, and a Republican governor, worked so hard to lure a major employer whose arrival would be transformative for the region, a Republican Congress and a Republican president might undo all that economic development. The same is true for some other places. Volvo Trucks in Pulaski County and Mack Trucks in Roanoke County now produce a lot of electric vehicles; they also were promised grants that the Trump administration hasn’t followed through on. The Microporous plant in Pittsylvania has yet to come, but Volvo and Mack are already here; the green economy is very real to the shift workers there.

Here’s where we start to tie all this together.

Microporous said the average wage for those jobs would be $60,000, above the county’s median household income of $54,115.

Trump’s basic instincts aren’t wrong on this one: The United States could do with more manufacturing jobs. However, why is he focused on people turning “little screws” for low wages when we already have a one manufacturing sector that’s not only growing but is growing high-wage jobs? Shouldn’t that one be the one we try to grow even more? This leaves me with some questions:

Is the elimination of those renewable energy tax credits worth the slowdown in those high-wage manufacturing jobs? Or, put another way, is philosophy more important than practicality?

Is there a way to spur that job growth in clean energy manufacturing without those tax credits?

Given how most congressional districts are either strongly Republican or strongly Democratic, would there be any political price to be paid if that clean energy manufacturing job growth in Republican districts slows down or comes to a halt?

Is this even a sector we want to grow? If you believe that renewable energy isn’t something we need, then perhaps not, even if it is producing high-paying manufacturing jobs.

Notice that none of this has to do with how you feel about carbon emissions and “saving the planet,” but everything to do with creating high-wage manufacturing jobs and building a new economy in many rural areas. Pittsylvania County may be ground zero for this debate, with Pulaski County a close second.

Elon Musk has voiced his disapproval of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" citing concerns over its potential to increase the federal deficit and hinder government efficiency efforts. The proposed legislation, backed by President Trump, includes tax cuts, stricter Medicaid rules, and reduced clean energy incentives.

Elon Musk has expressed disappointment over a sweeping domestic policy bill backed by President Donald Trump and passed by House Republicans last week. He warned that it could worsen the federal deficit and undermine efforts to improve government efficiency.

Dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” by Trump, the legislation includes an extension of his hallmark 2017 tax cuts, stricter Medicaid work requirements, increased border security funding, and a proposed rollback of clean energy tax credits.

It now moves to the Senate, where its prospects remain uncertain.

“I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,” Musk told CBS Sunday Morning in an interview airing June 1. He was referring to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which the billionaire recently stepped back from.

Musk’s comments also highlight a broader philosophical split. As the former head of the DOGE, Musk once led a sweeping push to trim federal spending. The current bill’s deficit-heavy profile contradicts DOGE’s original mission.

“I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful,” he added. “But I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion.”

According to the Congressional Budget Office, the legislation would add $3.8 trillion to the federal deficit by 2034, an outcome at odds with Musk’s stated goal of improving fiscal discipline in Washington.

Tesla could suffer from clean energy cuts

Although Musk did not mention Tesla directly, the proposed rollback of clean energy tax credits has raised concerns for the company. Tesla and other clean technology firms currently benefit from incentives that reduce the cost of electric vehicles (EVs) and solar installations for consumers.

According to a Bloomberg report, under the Inflation Reduction Act, EV buyers are eligible for up to $7,500 in tax credits. Solar systems qualify for a 30% investment tax credit. Reducing or eliminating these incentives could affect both pricing and consumer demand across the clean energy sector.

Tesla, General Motors, and other EV manufacturers, as well as their customers, could be among the hardest hit. Former President Biden’s climate law expanded the $7,500 credit to include new, used, and commercial EVs.

As per the report, the Republican plan would scale back or repeal the consumer EV credit by the end of 2025. Beginning in 2026, only manufacturers that have sold fewer than 200,000 EVs by the end of this year would remain eligible. Tesla and GM have already surpassed that threshold. The bill would also eliminate credits for used and commercial EVs. Congressional estimates suggest the total rollback would save the government more than $190 billion over the next decade.

These changes could reduce demand for Tesla’s popular models such as the Model Y and Cybertruck. They may also weaken the appeal of EVs more broadly. Tesla’s volume-led growth strategy could suffer, along with its competitive edge, especially as traditional carmakers and Chinese rivals continue to benefit from local incentives.

Musk has not yet publicly addressed how these proposed changes could impact Tesla’s business.

Solar incentives also at risk

The bill also targets clean energy tax breaks that support Tesla’s solar and energy storage divisions, along with the wider green technology sector.

Bloomberg reported that homeowners would no longer be eligible for a 30% tax credit on solar panel installations and other clean energy systems after this year. This change would be a setback for consumers planning to invest in sustainable energy solutions.

The rollback would affect not only Tesla’s products like the Powerwall and Megapack, but also companies such as Enphase Energy and SolarEdge Technologies. The measure is expected to save the government $77 billion over a ten-year period, as per the report.

Musk’s remarks also point to growing distance between him and Trump, despite their earlier cooperation. The bill faces significant opposition in the Senate, where its final form remains uncertain.

“We are so far away from an acceptable bill, it’s hard to say,” said Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, according to Bloomberg.

The new unit, Tokio Marine GX (TMGX), will provide advisory and risk transfer services to companies across a range of sectors looking to decarbonise, and build on the existing work of its GCube renewable energy team, Fraser McLachlan said.
Parent Tokio Marine is the largest property and casualty insurer in Japan with a market value of around $70 billion.
“It’s a pretty quick win… it allows you instant access to a market,” McLachlan said.
“Unless people start coming to the table with more creative insurance solutions … we’re going to see a lot of these projects stall,” he said.","Japanese insurer Tokio Marine has set up a unit to insure activities linked to the low-carbon transition such as green hydrogen, shipping and cement and is targeting $1 billion in revenues by the end of the decade, its chair told Reuters.

The new unit, Tokio Marine GX (TMGX), will provide advisory and risk transfer services to companies across a range of sectors looking to decarbonise, and build on the existing work of its GCube renewable energy team, Fraser McLachlan said.

TMGX will offer up to $500 million in cover on any single risk and is targeting at least a 10% share of the global premium income market in 2030, estimated at around $10 billion, he said.

While some peers had already begun to write more transition-linked business, most had done so using existing sectoral teams rather than creating a dedicated unit, he said.

“We’re going to rip up the rule-card a little bit here,” McLachlan said.

“We’re going to look at some new technologies, we’re going to look at more sophisticated ways of being able to risk transfer business,” such as offering insurance for tax credits and surety guarantees.

Launching with existing GCube headcount of around 50 and revenue of around $200 million, both would likely double over the next couple of years, he said. Parent Tokio Marine is the largest property and casualty insurer in Japan with a market value of around $70 billion.

Among the new technologies TMGX would look to cover include small and middle market nuclear, hydrogen, fuel cells, new solar technologies including floating solar and electric vehicles, he said.

“There’s a lot of sectors that really haven’t been served by the insurance space,” McLachlan said.

Another area ripe for extra help was the market for tax credit insurance, where businesses get cover in case they are unable to access the credits as planned, thereby lowering their risk to bank lenders and the interest rate on borrowing.

“It’s a win-win. Lenders love it as it transfers their risk; we like it, we’re getting a premium for a risk we’re comfortable with; and it allows the project to be financed at more equitable terms.”

The company could also look to strike deals with managing general agents, intermediaries given authority by the insurer to write business in their name, saving them the time and expense of building out a team.

“It’s a pretty quick win… it allows you instant access to a market,” McLachlan said.

Finding more innovative ways to finance the risks associated with the transition was critical if the world is to hit its climate goals.

“Unless people start coming to the table with more creative insurance solutions … we’re going to see a lot of these projects stall,” he said.

The company’s board replaced the CEO and CFO in a decision announced May 1, when Li-Cycle publicized that it was looking for buyers. A potential deal with mining giant and lead creditor Glencore evidently had not come to fruition: Two weeks later, a Canadian bankruptcy court appointed Alvarez & Marsal Canada Securities to oversee a sale of Li-Cycle’s assets. A Li-Cycle spokesperson referred Canary Media to the company’s public bankruptcy announcements.

Prospective buyers for the partially completed recycling empire can state their intent by early June. In the meantime, Glencore has loaned $10.5 million to keep things going during the proceedings. Glencore also entered a ​“stalking horse” offer of $40 million for most of Li-Cycle’s holdings, setting a floor for bidding (if any other investors want a piece of the action). Glencore could emerge with a real deal on its hands, but it won’t be recouping the $275 million it previously invested in Li-Cycle.

“The Company represents a compelling investment opportunity, uniquely positioned to benefit from rapid growth in the battery materials and [lithium-ion battery] recycling market, amid increasing global focus on sustainability and critical raw material supply chain resilience,” Alvarez & Marsal pitch in a flyer for the sale.

That ​“compelling” opportunity amounts to five battery shredding plants, a massive unfinished recycling center in Western New York, and a business predicated on the growth of a nascent North American EV supply chain that currently faces far-reaching disruption from the Trump administration. A buyer would not be able to fully recycle any batteries without spending a few hundred million dollars more, and even then, it’s not clear they would make any money doing so.

The startup’s collapse underscores the struggles of the fledgling battery recycling industry in general. A few years ago, the sector was flush with venture capital and charting out rapid timelines for commercializing breakthrough technologies that would enable the transition to EVs while minimizing mining. The sector was also seen as a way to achieve the bipartisan goal of reducing dependence on China, which dominates the global battery supply chain.

Li-Cycle was founded in Canada in 2016 and went public in 2021 through a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC (generally a red flag for early-stage cleantech companies). Its engineers developed a technique for shredding whole lithium-ion battery packs while they’re submerged in liquid; this prevented fires and saved considerable effort compared with painstakingly discharging and dismantling the packs for processing.

Li-Cycle successfully built five ​“spoke” facilities to collect and shred whole electric vehicle battery packs, turning them into the powdery mixture known as black mass. The spoke operations have paused in Arizona, Alabama, New York, and Ontario, while a German outpost continues to function during bankruptcy proceedings. Collectively, these facilities can break down up to 40 kilotons of batteries a year.

The spokes were supposed to feed their black mass to Li-Cycle’s hub in Rochester, New York, which would refine it and isolate useful battery materials to reintroduce into the supply chain. This never came to pass because Li-Cycle halted construction in fall 2023, citing runaway costs. It became clear that Li-Cycle needed to find a lot more cash to complete the nearly 2-million-square-foot site.

The company hoped for a lifeline from the Biden-era Department of Energy: In November, its Loan Programs Office finalized a $475 million loan for Li-Cycle to complete the recycling hub. But Li-Cycle never drew on that federal money because it couldn’t secure additional private funding to hold in reserve, as stipulated in the loan terms.

Li-Cycle is not the only battery recycling firm in a tough spot. Since last year, a number of challenges have beset the industry.

The adjacent U.S. EV sector has seen slower growth than expected, which has in turn reduced the urgency of building out a North American battery supply chain. Core battery materials like lithium, nickel, and cobalt have plummeted in price, lessening the value of whatever recyclers might glean. And battery makers have increasingly turned to lithium iron phosphate, a cheaper alternative to nickel- and cobalt-based chemistries, further reducing the value of recycling these batteries.

In the past year, a fire destroyed the largest battery shredding plant in the U.S., Interco’s Critical Mineral Recovery site in Missouri. Reno, Nevada–based Aqua Metals ran low on funds and laid off staff while it searched for financing to build a commercial-scale recycling line. Ascend Elements delayed construction of its flagship recycling plant in Kentucky, citing a customer’s decision to postpone buying the recycled materials. In March, Ascend canceled plans to make cathode active materials in Kentucky to focus on precursor materials and lithium carbonate.

Redwood Materials is the rare bright spot. The venture by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel raised a couple billion dollars and has been building out a major compound in the desert outside Reno, not far from Tesla’s factory there. In 2024, Redwood Materials broke down 20 gigawatt-hours of batteries and earned $200 million in revenue from recycled materials.

The industry’s challenges come as the Trump administration says it aims to expand U.S. mineral supplies. Paradoxically, the administration has taken steps to undermine the fledgling U.S. EV and battery industries, which are the big drivers of demand growth for rare earth metals.

The legislation, SB 1723, aims to prevent “carbon sequestration activity within a sequestration facility that overlies, underlies, or passes through a sole source aquifer.”

The bill specifically targets CCS activities near the Mohomet Aquifer, a groundwater source that serves as the sole source of drinking water for central Illinois residents. Bill language specifies that the CCS activities would continue to be allowed in other areas of the state. In addition, the legislation creates a study commission that would investigate the safety of allowing CCS projects near the Mohomet Aquifer.

In its first quarter earnings call, held May 7, Alto Ingredients President and CEO Bryan McGregor briefly referenced SB 1723, noting the bill was complicating plans to add CCS capabilities at the company’s campus in Pekin, Illinois. At that time, McGregor indicated the company was working with elected officials to minimize the potential legal impact of the legislation on its CCS initiative. He also said Alto is also working to develop options to ensure the company can optimize the value of its CO2 production no matter what the outcome of the legislation, including plans to relocate the proposed CO2 storage location.

[53] U.S. Department of Energy, “TESLA,” 2024, https://www.energy.gov/lpo/tesla.","In 2025, federal workforce reductions disrupted several core agencies under the Department of Energy (DOE), igniting renewed concerns over the resilience of the United States’ energy systems and the integrity of national security protocols. These cuts, enacted under the broader reorganization agenda of the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), were promoted as necessary cost-saving measures within Donald Trump’s fiscal reform campaign.1 However, the nature and scope of the reductions have raised questions about the federal government’s ability to maintain stable energy governance, respond to emerging threats, and support the nation’s long-term transition toward a more secure and sustainable energy future.

As a central pillar of U.S. energy and security policy, the DOE is tasked with safeguarding nuclear materials, guiding clean energy innovation, and ensuring the reliability of the national power grid. The sudden contraction of its workforce has disrupted these functions, exposing serious vulnerabilities in operational capacity, regulatory oversight, and interagency coordination.2 Agencies deemed essential to national interest have also faced institutional uncertainty, prompting concerns about how strategic energy functions can continue under diminished staffing. While the administration’s rationale emphasizes efficiency, the uneven application of these cuts, particularly their concentration in departments linked to climate and energy policy, suggests a deeper politicization of bureaucratic restructuring. These developments highlight a growing disconnect between fiscal ideology and functional governance, demanding closer scrutiny of how workforce decisions shape the future of U.S. energy security.

This paper evaluates the impact of the 2025 federal workforce reductions, measuring the extent of weakened U.S. energy infrastructure. In analyzing the potential for nuclear oversight, regional grid instability, and the undermining of long-term clean energy initiatives, these developments could present a disconnect between the pursuit of administrative efficiency and the functional imperatives of national energy security. From a stability standpoint, the reductions in workforce affect institutional coherence while leaving essential agencies unprepared for emerging challenges. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for the federal government’s role in energy governance and policy frameworks to safeguard public safety, energy sovereignty, and long-term environmental resilience.

Undermining of Nuclear Security

To streamline federal operations, the U.S. has restructured key oversight mechanisms in its energy sector, most notably in governing nuclear infrastructure. The 2025 wave of federal workforce reductions, introduced under the pretext of administrative efficiency and fiscal responsibility, has impacted the oversight mechanisms for safeguarding nuclear energy systems, suggesting a misalignment between governance efficiency and the federal responsibility to uphold energy sovereignty and public safety.3 Of particular concern are the cuts to the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a semi-autonomous agency under the DOE tasked with ensuring the safety, security, and effectiveness of the nation’s civilian nuclear energy systems and nuclear materials management.4 The loss of personnel within this agency, particularly at high-level energy research institutions including Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, signals not merely administrative downsizing but a substantive degradation of national energy security capacity and institutional operational readiness.5

The layoffs have affected both long-term federal employees and probationary staff, including nuclear safety engineers, emergency energy response planners, and compliance auditors whose roles were central to protecting nuclear materials, enforcing regulatory standards, and managing energy-related emergencies. Their abrupt removal has disrupted essential regulatory timelines and left critical facilities without adequate personnel to ensure compliance, monitoring, and emergency response. Furthermore, around 2,000 DOE employees, with some working for the NNSA, were removed from their positions.6 Although Trump reversed the layoffs, the agency was unable to contact former employees who needed to be rehired.7

The impact is already visible in the Pacific Northwest region, where layoffs at the Hanford nuclear site and the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) have delayed critical infrastructure projects, safety audits, and radioactive waste management protocols. Hanford now operates under reduced regulatory supervision, exacerbating risks tied to unresolved nuclear waste storage issues.8 Meanwhile, Bonneville’s role in stabilizing the grid and integrating nuclear generation sources has been undercut by personnel losses, increasing the likelihood of operational disruptions during periods of peak electricity demand or cyber intrusions targeting nuclear-grid interdependencies.9 Given the challenges surrounding nuclear systems, ensuring safety requires skilled personnel and real-time judgment, factors that automation alone cannot substitute. As demonstrated by the 2012 Y-12 breach, over-reliance on automated systems can compromise even the most secure energy sites.10 This dynamic parallels key lessons from the 2011 Fukushima disaster, where institutional paralysis and delayed decision-making were more consequential than the physical damage itself in escalating the crisis.11 According to DOE-affiliated workforce data, the reductions have interrupted energy costs while impacting energy security.12 Emergency preparedness has also been affected, with workforce reductions impacting interagency energy response drills, including simulations of large-scale nuclear grid failures or targeted attacks on power plants.13 Budget constraints and staffing shortages led to the cancellation of vital contingency exercises in 2025, leaving the nation exposed in the event of a real crisis.14 Analysts warn that this lack of coordinated practice risks a dangerous false sense of readiness.

Institutionally, layoffs have disrupted oversight and research programs central to nuclear energy innovation, including nonproliferation, medical isotope production, and safety training. The suspension of contracts at the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations highlights the breakdown of linkages between energy innovation and oversight.15 These offices not only advanced clean nuclear technologies but also ensured compliance with projects funded under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The U.S. Government Accountability Office highlights a broader constitutional dilemma, arguing that the executive branch’s impoundment of appropriated clean energy funds may constitute a violation of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974.16 If deemed unlawful, the policy decisions driving workforce reductions could be challenged for undermining statutory energy objectives.

From a national security perspective, the strategic cost of dismantling federal nuclear energy capacity outweighs any short-term fiscal gains. Energy securitization theory underscores that energy systems, especially those tied to nuclear governance, are not just technical infrastructures but existential assets requiring state protection.17 In this light, the erosion of staffing and oversight at critical agencies compromises the state’s ability to treat energy as a matter of national survival, diminishing both resilience and global credibility in the energy domain.

While appeals to bureaucratic efficiency may satisfy short-term budgetary priorities, the resultant degradation of nuclear oversight institutions has exposed critical vulnerabilities in national energy governance. The resulting institutional thinning at the NNSA and affiliated DOE bodies has not only delayed key regulatory functions but also fractured long-term policy frameworks, eroding the federal government’s capacity to uphold its obligations under clean energy legislation and nuclear safety mandates.18 At a time of intensifying geopolitical threats and growing energy demand, the attrition of nuclear oversight capacity signals not only bureaucratic miscalculation but also a structural failure to integrate resilience, continuity, and security into national energy governance.

Threats to Power Grid Reliability and Regional Infrastructure

The U.S. energy transition, while strategically essential, now faces mounting operational risks as federal workforce reductions undermine the centralized institutions historically responsible for grid oversight and national energy coherence. Recent large-scale reductions in the federal workforce, executed under the Trump administration’s DOGE, have imposed a shift on the institutions historically tasked with sustaining and modernizing America’s energy infrastructure.19 This disruption has weakened BPA’s ability to manage the Pacific Northwest grid, particularly in high-voltage transmission and outage response.20

Roughly 420 workers were terminated from BPA alone, accounting for 13% of 3,100 managing the Pacific Northwest’s electricity supply.21 Such reductions are not limited to BPA; over 2,000 employees in the Department of the Interior, including those in the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, both of which are instrumental in issuing permits and maintaining power generation infrastructure, have also been dismissed.22 Nationwide, more than 60,000 federal workers have been laid off since February 2025, with an additional 75,000 taking buyouts.23 This unprecedented downsizing threatens the federal government’s ability to uphold energy security mandates, maintain infrastructure continuity, and coordinate the integration of clean energy technologies. While advocates of a leaner government argue that states and private firms can compensate for federal pullback, the consequences suggest delayed energy integration, increased cyber vulnerabilities, and administrative bottlenecks across critical grid infrastructure.24 Particularly at risk are regionally integrated energy systems that rely on interjurisdictional coordination, which only the federal government is positioned to provide, highlighting a growing disconnect between administrative retrenchment and the functional imperatives of energy governance.

The operational challenges facing the BPA exemplify these broader systemic vulnerabilities. Operating over 15,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines, BPA’s efficient performance depends on skilled staff capable of real-time grid monitoring, outage response, and long-term infrastructure planning.25 With a drastically reduced workforce, routine maintenance is being delayed, grid modernization initiatives are stalling, and project backlogs are swelling. These challenges reduce grid stability today and compromise future upgrades needed for a decarbonized economy.

Federal workforce reductions have also hindered progress in renewable energy integration, a cornerstone of the nation’s decarbonization strategy. The pause in disbursements under the IRA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), mandated by Section 7 of Trump’s “Unleashing American Energy” executive order, has paralyzed projects designed to expand grid capacity through the integration of utility-scale solar arrays.26 These federal investments were foundational to many state and local efforts, especially in areas that lack the capital or regulatory capacity to deploy such technologies independently.27 As a result, energy transition timelines are slipping, and states that once stood at the forefront of clean energy leadership are now scrambling to reconfigure their development plans.

Moreover, the BPA and other regional transmission organizations are facing a compounding crisis in cybersecurity. The attrition of federal cybersecurity personnel and reduced funding for grid resilience initiatives have resulted in delayed software patching, limited breach response capacity, and increased exposure to SCADA system vulnerabilities across smart grid platforms.28 These cybersecurity vulnerabilities are emerging amid escalating geopolitical tensions and documented cyber intrusions by state-linked actors, including those affiliated with Russia, Iran, and China. A diminished federal presence hampers not just detection and mitigation, but also the ability to coordinate across jurisdictions in response to a breach. Without cohesive governance from agencies like the DOE and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, America’s grid grows more fragmented and less prepared for coordinated attacks or natural disasters.

Critics of the federal workforce model have argued that state governments and private actors can fill the operational vacuum. However, this perspective neglects the integrative function federal agencies perform in coordinating across state boundaries and ensuring standardization in disaster response. For instance, interstate electricity transmission projects, particularly high-voltage direct current lines, require unified oversight to align environmental reviews, synchronize technical standards, and allocate costs.29 Additionally, many states simply lack the technical workforce, regulatory infrastructure, or financial resources to absorb the sudden departure of thousands of experienced federal workers. This is particularly evident in rural and tribal communities, such as those in Alaska and New Mexico, where energy permitting and mineral extraction are not just economic drivers but essential to public service delivery.30 New Mexico’s federal land offices, which oversee drilling on federal land, contributing over one-third of the state’s general fund, are experiencing permitting delays.31 More than 22 tribes and nonprofits from Alaska to the Midwest, having around $350 million in federal funding, were impacted by frozen infrastructure projects.32 Furthermore, the BLM office in Utah has lost over 55 employees, including engineers, park rangers, and geologists since early 2025 due to mass resignations, firings, and rescinded job offers under federal workforce reductions.33 This bureaucratic inertia jeopardizes everything from clean energy projects and transmission upgrades to environmental safeguards and Indigenous land rights.

From a macroeconomic lens, the federal government’s role in sustaining local energy economies cannot be overstated. According to recent findings published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, approximately 86% of U.S. jobs are in sectors vulnerable to disruptions from the energy transition, with carbon-intensive communities exhibiting disproportionately high employment vulnerability.34 The concept of an Employment Carbon Footprint reveals that even regions not traditionally associated with fossil fuel extraction, such as manufacturing-heavy counties in the Great Plains, may suffer job losses due to federal divestment from energy and environmental services.35 Workforce reductions at agencies like the DOE risk compounding these vulnerabilities, especially in communities already excluded from just transition protections under the IRA.

There is also a profound distributive justice dimension to this problem. According to the Center for American Progress, every congressional district in the U.S. employs over 3,000 federal workers, the vast majority of whom are embedded within their local economies.36 These jobs support families, fund schools through income taxes, and sustain small businesses through consumption. Consequently, the dismissal of federal employees involved in grid oversight, regulatory review, and environmental enforcement has triggered economic contractions in local economies, particularly in rural regions. Moreover, the loss of institutional knowledge, particularly among senior civil servants and specialized engineers, cannot be easily or quickly replaced.

The erosion of institutional capacity in the energy sector compromises not only the domestic resilience but also the U.S. geopolitical credibility in advancing clean energy leadership. This institutional degradation risks impeding innovation in renewable integration and diminishing U.S. strategic competitiveness vis-à-vis global leaders, such as China and the European Union, in clean energy deployment and export capacity. Furthermore, a degraded federal apparatus limits America’s ability to respond effectively to climate-related disasters, such as wildfires, heatwaves, or hurricanes that increasingly threaten energy infrastructure in regions like the Gulf Coast and the Southwest.

Impact on Clean Energy Initiatives

The scale and speed of federal workforce reductions enacted in early 2025 under the “Workforce Optimization Initiative” have significantly impaired the operational capacity of several critical U.S. agencies, with particularly acute effects on the Loan Programs Office (LPO).37 Although publicly justified as efforts to streamline bureaucracy and limit regulatory capture, the reductions have materially constrained the federal government’s capacity to administer and implement clean energy. At the center of the disruption is the erosion of institutional oversight, particularly in the financing, administration, and monitoring of renewable energy projects that constitute a core component of the nation’s long-term strategy for energy independence and economic resilience.38

The LPO has historically played a pivotal role in catalyzing clean energy innovation, having facilitated over $35 billion in financing for projects across the solar, wind, nuclear, and hydrogen sectors.39 This core mandate has been structurally weakened, diminishing the LPO’s ability to evaluate proposals, manage disbursements, and conduct performance reviews across clean energy portfolios. Layoffs implemented in February 2025 reportedly resulted in the termination of approximately 45 employees from the LPO, an agency already operating with limited staff capacity.40 The effects of these reductions have been both immediate and structurally consequential, delaying the disbursement of IRA and IIJA funds and weakening the federal apparatus essential to maintaining the energy infrastructure. These delays disrupt the capital deployment timeline for renewable projects, disproportionately affecting rural and underserved regions where private-sector financing is contingent on federal loan guarantees. In parallel, the diminished capacity for program monitoring and oversight raises the risk of financial mismanagement, cost overruns, and inadequate compliance enforcement, thereby weakening public trust and policy effectiveness.41

Effective clean energy transitions depend on stable federal coordination, particularly during foundational stages of infrastructure deployment, interagency governance, and regulatory oversight, functions now affected by workforce instability. The loss of federal institutional capacity impairs the coordination mechanisms, due diligence processes, and co-financing structures necessary for effective public-private collaboration in clean energy deployment. From the standpoint of liberal institutionalism, which emphasizes the necessity of transparent and stable governance mechanisms,42 this institutional attrition constitutes a significant barrier to coherent climate governance while undermining the state’s ability to align national energy planning with long-term economic modernization strategies.

The stated rationale for the reductions, outlined in the 26 February 2025 memorandum issued by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), was to eliminate non-statutory functions and prioritize the removal of positions not legally required.43 While the LPO is not a standalone statutory agency, its role is grounded in legislative mandates under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.44 Despite this, the LPO was not granted any exemptions under the new policy. The decision to target the agency as “non-essential” during funding lapses disregarded its strategic importance to national energy goals. As of mid-February 2025, approximately 1,000 probationary employees had been dismissed, more than 300 from the NNSA.45 Despite the partial reinstatement of staff in other DOE branches, more than 2,700 employees have applied for buyouts under the department’s deferred resignation program.46 These reductions coincided with the Department’s initial efforts to implement over $500 billion in clean energy investments authorized under the IRA.47 With limited personnel, the LPO now faces mounting bottlenecks in the approval and disbursement of funds for utility-scale solar farms, green hydrogen hubs, and advanced nuclear reactor projects. Prolonged project financing delays not only undermine investor confidence and emissions goals but also erode the strategic foundations of U.S. energy sovereignty and its credibility as a global leader in climate and energy diplomacy.

One such example is the DOE’s Hydrogen Hub program, designed to stimulate regional hydrogen economies. Due to staffing constraints at the LPO, project selection and fund disbursement have been delayed in key states such as Texas, Ohio, and Louisiana, regions where hydrogen infrastructure is critical to decarbonizing industrial sectors.48 Furthermore, the layoffs have significantly stalled review and approval processes within the DOE’s conditional loan portfolio, which includes over $200 billion in pending applications.49 Despite progress under the IRA, current projections indicate that the United States will fall 23% to 37% short of its 2030 emissions reduction target, undermining both national climate commitments and the credibility of its international leadership on climate action.50

The LPO’s role in de-risking early-stage clean energy technologies by providing critical financial guarantees that catalyze private sector investment has also been significantly weakened. With the dismissal of technical reviewers, legal experts, and environmental compliance officers, the agency is now less able to assess whether funded projects are meeting benchmarks for emissions reductions, economic development, and technological advancement. This institutional erosion is especially concerning given the historical lessons of prior clean energy cycles, where lack of oversight capacity, such as the Solyndra case, resulted in political backlash, diminished public trust, and weakened regulatory integrity.51 During the loan guarantee cycle under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2008-2012, high-profile project failures, most notably Solyndra, were attributed to insufficient due diligence.52 In response, the LPO instituted multiple layers of risk assessment and accountability mechanisms. These safeguards are now at risk of being dismantled, exposing both federal funds and taxpayer confidence to renewed uncertainty.

The potential consequences of diminished LPO capacity can also be illustrated by its past success stories. A prominent example is the LPO’s 2010 loan to Tesla Motors, which enabled the company to scale its electric vehicle production during a financially precarious period.53 This underscores how federal support for nascent technologies can yield transformative outcomes, a dynamic now threatened by the erosion of institutional capability. A further complication is the loss of institutional knowledge. Numerous reports confirm that the affected employees included mid-career specialists with extensive experience navigating the technical, legal, and regulatory complexities of the clean energy sector. The hiring constraints imposed by the January 2025 Presidential Memorandum, restricting recruitment to one position per four departures, have structurally impeded the agency’s ability to regenerate lost institutional capacity.54 President Donald Trump has extended the ongoing federal hiring freeze through mid-July, preventing agencies from filling vacant positions or establishing new roles for three months. 55

The broader policy implications extend beyond federal agencies. The National Governors Association has publicly raised concerns over the erosion of intergovernmental coordination frameworks, emphasizing the resultant delays in multi-level energy governance and implementation.56 Internationally, the workforce reductions may also impair the U.S. standing in global climate diplomacy. Whereas the previous administration had positioned green infrastructure as a cornerstone of foreign policy, the retrenchment under the current administration marks a strategic retrenchment that weakens the U.S. negotiating position at international climate forums and undermines its normative influence in multilateral climate finance structures. At forums such as COP29, the loss of federal momentum weakens the credibility of U.S. climate commitments and risks emboldening other major emitters to delay their own energy transitions. Undermining this model through domestic retrenchment compromises U.S. influence in shaping global finance norms and limits efforts to mobilize private capital for global decarbonization.

Critics, including energy policy experts, bipartisan stakeholders, and environmental NGOs, have argued that the decision to target the LPO was not merely a cost-saving measure but one rooted in ideological opposition to clean energy. This framing disregards the cross-partisan support historically enjoyed by clean energy programs, which are widely recognized for their contributions to national security, technological leadership, and economic growth. In response to growing legal challenges, multiple federal judges have issued rulings declaring aspects of the reduction-in-force (RIF) process unlawful, particularly in cases involving probationary employees.57 However, these decisions have not mandated full reinstatement of affected personnel, and future rounds of layoffs remain possible. Agency leaders now face legal uncertainty and mounting responsibilities without the staff fulfilling them. Congressional staff briefings obtained by the Congressional Research Service further suggest that applying RIF procedures to statutorily grounded agencies may have overstepped executive authority, raising legal and constitutional concerns regarding the balance between fiscal control and governance.58

Conclusion

The 2025 federal workforce reductions have revealed a profound misalignment between administrative efficiency initiatives and the structural imperatives of U.S. energy governance. While framed as a necessary response to fiscal constraints, the scale and concentration of these reductions in critical energy agencies have produced destabilizing effects across nuclear oversight, power grid reliability, and clean energy program implementation. The disruption to agencies such as the NNSA, the BPA and the LPO has not only weakened operational capacity but also affected the institutional continuity required to manage the evolving demands of energy security, infrastructure modernization, and climate resilience.

The consequences extend beyond administrative inefficiency. The reductions have delayed infrastructure projects, hampered emergency preparedness, introduced cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and undermined the disbursement of funding under the IRA and IIJA. The federal government’s reduced presence is particularly acute in rural, tribal, and economically vulnerable communities, where federal coordination plays a critical role in ensuring access to energy resources, permitting, and long-term investment planning. Additionally, the loss of specialized personnel has eroded institutional memory and technical capacity, further limiting the federal government’s ability to carry out legally mandated energy functions.

Considering the United States’ role in clean energy deployment and climate diplomacy, the erosion of federal institutional capacity poses strategic risks. The inability to meet domestic emissions targets weakens the credibility of international commitments and threatens to reduce the influence of the United States in shaping global climate governance frameworks. As the energy transition accelerates worldwide, the U.S. risks falling behind in technological competitiveness, regulatory innovation, and the global energy export market.

To restore resilience, the federal government must urgently reinvest in its energy workforce, uphold statutory obligations, and align budgetary decisions with national energy priorities. Stabilizing institutional capacity across agencies is essential to safeguarding national security, accelerating decarbonization, and preserving U.S. credibility on the international stage. Future policymaking must recognize that administrative streamlining, if disregarded from strategic imperatives, can undermine the very functions it seeks to optimize.

Dems running for Congress spar over jobs, environment, taxes, how to fight Trump",howard fischer,,,,,https://tucson.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/article_6d2cdf09-2625-4373-a10e-7a29e623584f.html,"He is one of five Democratic candidates running in the special July 15 primary, who all took part in the debate.
""And what's left in the aftermath is an environmental destruction,'' Grijalva said.
Hernandez found himself in the minority among the Democratic contenders on the issue of jobs versus environmental concerns.
Candidate Patrick Harris, an inventor and former business owner, acknowledged that projects like new mines do create jobs.
""Those are short-term jobs,'' Harris said.","PHOENIX — Candidate Daniel Hernandez says the next member of Congress needs to be someone who pays less attention to environmental concerns and more to the jobs that sometimes-controversial projects will create.

Whether that reflects who Democrats want to be their standard bearer in the special election this summer to replace ardent environmental advocate Raúl Grijalva remains to be seen, after voters elected Grijalva to 11 terms in the U.S. House. He died in March of complications from cancer treatments at age 77 while holding the Congressional District 7 seat.

""When people are struggling to make ends meet, they need someone who will stand up to make sure they have good wages, protections for their families, and make sure that they have a job to be able to go to,'' said Hernandez, a former state lawmaker, during a debate Tuesday hosted by KAET-TV, the Phoenix PBS affiliate.

He is one of five Democratic candidates running in the special July 15 primary, who all took part in the debate.

Whoever survives will face off on Sept. 23 against the winner of the Republican primary. But the Democratic nominee will start off with a huge advantage. The district has about 176,000 registered Democrats, compared with fewer than 93,000 Republicans. It stretches from Douglas through Nogales into parts of Pinal and Maricopa counties and west to Yuma.

Hernandez made it clear he supports projects such as the plan by South32 to extract critical minerals in the Patagonia Mountains; a massive copper mine planned by Hudbay in the Santa Rita Mountains; and a proposal to build a new Interstate 11, including a stretch that would run through environmentally sensitive portions of Pima County.

That brought him into sharp contrast with one of the other contenders: Adelita Grijalva, who is not only a former Pima County supervisor, but also Raúl's daughter. She made it clear she does not see the claimed benefits to Arizona from the projects. The profits from digging out the ore will be shipped elsewhere, she said.

""And what's left in the aftermath is an environmental destruction,'' Grijalva said. She specifically criticized the plans for a new copper mine at Oak Flat near Superior, a project that survived a challenge when the U.S. Supreme Court refused Tuesday to consider concerns of the San Carlos Apache Tribe and others that the land is necessary for their ceremonies.

And if the message about what voters could expect wasn't crystal clear, Grijalva said she will follow in her father's footsteps.

""I am going to be another Grijalva,'' she said. ""I don't think you can be too progressive when you're on the right side of history.''

Hernandez found himself in the minority among the Democratic contenders on the issue of jobs versus environmental concerns.

Candidate Jose Malvido, whose father was a union organizer at Phelps Dodge in Ajo when miners went on strike in 1983, said much has been lost as environmental concerns were brushed aside in the name of economic development.

""I grew up in a copper mining town where sacred sites were reduced into a giant mine pit,'' Malvido said. ""It put food on the table, but at what cost?''

Candidate Patrick Harris, an inventor and former business owner, acknowledged that projects like new mines do create jobs. At the same time, he said, they destroy the environment.

But for him, the question is a bit different: Where do the profits go?

""Those are short-term jobs,'' Harris said. ""That profit is being siphoned out of the district. There are (other) good-paying jobs that can be brought into the district.''

And candidate Deja Foxx said that from her perspective — she is 25 — not enough has been done to protect the environment that should have been preserved for her generation.

""Every year we see summers get hotter here in Arizona, get longer because of the inaction of older generations,'' she said.

""Climate change is not theoretical to my generation,'' Foxx continued. ""We will have to live through your plans for 2050 and beyond.''

But Grijalva did find herself on the defensive on another issue: taxes.

The contenders each were asked about the wisdom of Republicans in Washington who say that reducing taxes is good for the economy and should also be considered by Democrats, who have found themselves losing ground politically.

Hernandez responded that the difference is Democrats believe in cutting taxes for working-class families. Or ""most Democrats,"" he said.

""The reality is people like Adelita tried to raise taxes just a couple of weeks ago in the city of Tucson,'' Hernandez said, referring to a plan on the ballot to increase the sales tax by half a cent. ""When we are in the height of inflation and people are hurting, the height of being out of touch was trying to raise people's taxes.''

It failed by a margin of more than 2-1.

""What we have is a problem where out-of-touch politicians who spent almost two decades in office forget what it's like to be able to buy groceries at the grocery store, and know what it's like to have to put something back,'' Hernandez said.

Grijalva was unapologetic for backing the proposed levy, saying that not just Tucson but Pima County have had to absorb more costs to provide government services even as the Republican-controlled Legislature was imposing a flat 2.5% income tax. Local governments get a piece of that levy.

""So the needs continue but the revenue decreased,'' Grijalva said, saying that the cost of these local needs must be shared by federal and state governments.

""You're still trying to raise people's taxes in the height of inflation,'' Hernandez responded.

Foxx took her own shots at Grijalva, describing her fight years ago with the Tucson Unified School District board, on which Grijalva served, over its sex education curriculum. Foxx said it had not been updated in decades, was medically inaccurate, and never mentioned things like consent.

Grijalva said afterwards that the board already had been looking at making changes when Foxx made her complaints, but could not do anything until state law was changed.

If there was a central theme to the debate — aside from the obligatory criticism by each contender of Republican President Donald Trump — it was the question of why Democrats recently fared poorly among voters. Foxx said part of that is due to Democrats who have failed to stand up and fight.

""We require activists,'' Foxx said.

""They don't know how to fight,'' Harris said of Democrats. ""They don't have a strategy.''

Malvido agreed that Democrats are not fighting back hard enough against Trump.

""We need to have the courage to really address issues and not worry about the big money people that also fund the Democratic campaigns,'' he said.

""A lot of Democrats, career politicians, all they really want to do is get elected,'' Malvido said. ""So they're not really going to address the issues and have the courage to fight in the way we need them to fight, especially now.''

Hernandez said the issue for voters goes beyond whether the Democrats are fighting hard enough.

""It's that we're not delivering results,'' he said.

""You elect people time and time again and yet they come back every two years and they say, 'We weren't able to do that because that other person was in charge, but elect us and we'll do it again next time,' '' Hernandez said. ""People are tired of empty promises.''

One position that did stand out was Harris' proposal for what he called ""capitated capitalism.''

In essence, it would cap individual wealth at $1 billion. Anyone whose assets exceeded that at the end of any year would have to spend the excess on things like investing in research.

All that spending, he said, would help stimulate the economy.

""I'm the only one with an economic plan to fund our shared priorities,'' Harris said.

The three Republicans hoping to clinch their own party's nomination in the July special election will debate at KAET on Thursday. They are Daniel Butierez, Jorge Rivas and Jimmy Rodriguez.

As of May 2025, the Kia EV9 is eligible for the full $7,500 federal EV tax credit starting with the 2026 model year.
Additionally, the 2026 EV9 complies with battery component and critical mineral sourcing criteria necessary for the tax credit.
It’s important to note that the federal EV tax credit program is subject to potential legislative changes.","Kia America on Monday unveiled pricing details and key updates for the 2026 Kia EV9, the automaker’s all-electric, three-row sport utility vehicle. Entering its third model year, the EV9 remains largely consistent with its original form but introduces a slate of meaningful refinements aimed at elevating both style and performance.

The headline addition is the new Nightfall Edition, an appearance-focused package now available on the Land AWD trim. With a commanding aesthetic defined by exclusive 20-inch gloss black alloy wheels, darkened Kia badging, and high-gloss black exterior elements, the Nightfall Edition introduces a fresh visual edge to the EV9’s sophisticated design. Inside, drivers will find distinctive seat stitching, bespoke interior trim, and subtle yet impactful design flourishes that separate it from other trims. It is available in both 6- and 7-passenger configurations, offering flexibility for families without additional cost.

Kia’s pricing for the 2026 EV9 lineup is as follows (excluding the $1,495 destination fee):

EV9 Light Standard Range – $54,900

EV9 Light Long Range – $57,900

EV9 Wind – $63,900

EV9 Land – $68,900

EV9 GT-Line – $71,900

A Sharpened Identity, A Longer Road Ahead

Beyond the Nightfall Edition, Kia’s 2026 EV9 lineup benefits from increased electric driving range on select trims. The Light Long Range model now offers an estimated 305 miles of range (Kia estimate), giving it the longest range in the lineup. The Wind and Land trims are now expected to achieve approximately 283 miles, while the sportier GT-Line is rated at an estimated 280 miles on a full charge. While these numbers remain manufacturer estimates and are subject to variation based on driving conditions, they reflect Kia’s continued refinement of battery and software efficiency.

Also new across all all-wheel drive variants is the addition of a Terrain Mode system—replacing the outgoing 4WD configuration—which enables driver-selectable modes for Snow, Mud, and Sand, enhancing off-road capability and traction across diverse terrain.

The EV9 retains its foundation as a modular, rear-biased electric platform (E-GMP) vehicle, supporting ultra-fast DC fast charging thanks to its 800-volt architecture. According to Kia, the EV9 can recoup up to 155 miles of range in approximately 15 minutes under optimal charging conditions. The long-range trims feature a 99.8 kWh battery, while the base Standard Range trim is equipped with a smaller 76.1 kWh pack.

Subtle Refinements in Color and Character

A refreshed exterior color palette brings a new sense of visual depth to the 2026 model year. The GT-Line now offers two new dual-tone colorways: Glacial White Pearl and Wolf Gray, each paired with a contrasting Ebony Black roof. The Nightfall Edition introduces a rich new exterior finish dubbed Roadrider Brown, alongside its exclusive interior detailing. These refinements add nuance to a vehicle already recognized for its bold silhouette and tech-forward design.

Inside the Cabin: Technology Meets Comfort

The EV9’s cabin remains one of the most spacious and advanced in the segment. A sweeping panoramic display integrates a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen, and a dedicated 5.0-inch climate control panel. Kia’s latest Connected Car Navigation Cockpit (ccNC) system powers the user experience, now featuring over-the-air update capability and support for a growing suite of digital services.

Advanced driver-assist systems remain standard across most trims, including Highway Driving Assist 2, Blind-Spot View Monitor, and Remote Smart Parking Assist 2, depending on configuration. The interior also offers tri-zone climate control, available premium relaxation seats with leg rests, and multiple USB-C charging ports in all three rows.

A Sustainable Brand in an Evolving Market

Kia continues to solidify its position among the most sustainability-conscious automakers. The EV9’s design incorporates recycled and bio-based materials throughout the cabin, and several trims—including the EV9 and the EV6—are assembled in the United States using both domestic and global components.

All pricing figures exclude taxes, licensing, and dealer fees. Estimated electric ranges are preliminary and not EPA-certified. Vehicle availability may vary by market. Always consult a retailer for the latest information.

As of May 2025, the Kia EV9 is eligible for the full $7,500 federal EV tax credit starting with the 2026 model year.

The eligibility for the 2026 EV9 is due to Kia’s production of this model in Georgia, meeting the North American assembly requirement. Additionally, the 2026 EV9 complies with battery component and critical mineral sourcing criteria necessary for the tax credit. However, early production units intended for fleet allocation and the GT trim, which is built in South Korea, are exceptions and do not qualify for the credit.

For the 2025 model year, the EV9 does not meet the federal tax credit requirements, even if assembled in the U.S., due to non-compliance with battery sourcing rules.

It’s important to note that the federal EV tax credit program is subject to potential legislative changes. A bill introduced by the House Ways and Means Committee proposes to eliminate key EV tax credits by the end of 2026, which could affect future eligibility.",https://cdn.autoconnectedcar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/staronly.png,N,,2025-05-28 06:02:50.656165

This is mainly because the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor only includes generating units that are visible or metered by balancing authorities.
On the other hand, the Electric Power Monthly and Electric Power Annual provide a more complete picture of U.S. electricity generation since they include all grid-connected power plants of 1 MW or larger capacity.
While the Electric Power Monthly and Annual give a fuller view of generation inside the United States, the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor can sometimes include generation not covered in the other reports.
This electricity appears in the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor, but since those plants are outside the U.S., their generation is not included in the Electric Power Monthly or Annual reports.","The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) tracks and reports electricity generation in the country through different methods, leading to data that may not always match. EIA publishes electricity net generation data from two main perspectives. One is a detailed monthly summary of every power plant connected to the grid in the United States that has at least 1 megawatt (MW) of nameplate capacity. This information is shared in the Electric Power Monthly, Electric Power Annual, and related data files. The second is hourly net generation data reported by local and regional balancing authorities, specifically for the Lower 48 states, which is available in the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor.

These two types of data reports often show different results because they do not reflect the same sets of generating units. As a result, if someone adds up the hourly generation data over a month or a year from the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor, the total will not match the figures reported in the Electric Power Monthly or Electric Power Annual. This is mainly because the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor only includes generating units that are visible or metered by balancing authorities. A balancing authority is responsible for managing the balance of electricity supply and demand in a specific region. These authorities can include large organizations like CAISO in California or the Southwest Power Pool, as well as smaller local entities.

However, balancing authorities usually do not track generation from distributed energy systems such as rooftop solar panels or from certain small-scale units. As a result, those distributed sources often do not appear in the hourly data. On the other hand, the Electric Power Monthly and Electric Power Annual provide a more complete picture of U.S. electricity generation since they include all grid-connected power plants of 1 MW or larger capacity.

To help users understand what is included in each set of data, EIA has published lists of electric generators. The Electric Power Monthly and Annual datasets have long included a list of the generators they track. Recently, EIA also published a new list for the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor, which only includes generators that are metered by balancing authorities based on responses to a new survey launched last year.

While the Electric Power Monthly and Annual give a fuller view of generation inside the United States, the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor can sometimes include generation not covered in the other reports. For instance, CAISO includes in its reports the generation from four power plants located in Mexico because it meters those plants. This electricity appears in the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor, but since those plants are outside the U.S., their generation is not included in the Electric Power Monthly or Annual reports.

Despite these differences, analysts can still reconcile the two sets of data by using the EIA plant codes and generator IDs. These identifiers appear across multiple EIA datasets, including the Annual Electric Generator Report and Power Plant Operations Report, allowing researchers to trace and compare generation details at the individual plant level.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pexels-photo-918986.jpeg,N,,2025-05-28 04:01:59.741720

Skyrocketing energy bills, government tax cuts for green investment and the moral imperative are just some of the factors pushing manufacturers towards finding cheaper, clean power sources.

In a sector faced with a significant skills shortage, failing to invest in clean energy sources could result in your business losing out on top talent to greener competitors.
If clean energy is not yet a priority, add ‘boosts your employer brand’ to its list of benefits...","The UN’s International Day of Clean Energy falls on the 26th of January and aims to encourage businesses and governments to transition to energy sources that do not pollute the planet, such as wind and solar power. According to our Manufacturing Sector Trends report, one third (34 per cent) of manufacturers already believe their organisation will invest in ‘green’ or ‘clean’ technology. For some, this will look like securing funding for onsite generation; for others it will involve entering a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), a long-term contract to draw power from a renewable energy generator.

Skyrocketing energy bills, government tax cuts for green investment and the moral imperative are just some of the factors pushing manufacturers towards finding cheaper, clean power sources. However, another pressing reason to prioritise clean energy is improving your employer brand: the way you are perceived as an employer, and therefore your ability to attract and retain talent. With the modern workforce increasingly demonstrating concern about environmental issues, join the dots between sustainability and your skills strategy.

Passion for sustainability

As the climate crisis dominates the news cycle, workers are beginning to choose and reject jobs based on environmental concerns. 37% of UK working adults say they would avoid working for a company with poor green credentials, and in the younger generations this is only set to continue, with one-third of young people rejecting job offers based on businesses’ sustainability stances. Attracting Gen Z and Alpha to manufacturing requires cultural evolution, as we have already explored in a previous blog, and investing in clean energy is one way to make your organisation more attractive to the next wave of talent. Some companies have already fallen victim to employee action, with Shell workers addressing their CEO publicly to express deep concern about a lack of investment in renewables. Leaders underestimate their workforce’s passion for sustainability at their own risk.

In a sector faced with a significant skills shortage, failing to invest in clean energy sources could result in your business losing out on top talent to greener competitors. The Royal Mint, for example, launched its own green energy centre in July 2023, to power its 38-acre manufacturing site, and builds sustainability clearly into its employer messaging, with sustainability strategy falling under its Great Place to Work branding. To cater to an eco-conscious jobs market, manufacturers must both work towards green goals and communicate them effectively.

Authentic change

However, a commitment to sustainability should not be viewed as a quick win for employer branding. Instead, it must be a long-term cultural shift with myriad benefits, of which favourable positioning on the job market is just one. Those leading the move towards clean energy must avoid greenwashing, where companies make unsubstantiated claims about sustainability credentials or enact only surface level change, without real impact. Nearly 43% of employees believe their company is guilty of greenwashing, with this number increasing to 56% among 18- to 24-year-olds.

Whereas other sustainability initiatives, such as publishing aspirational targets or purchasing carbon offsets, could be seen as avoiding tackling the problem head-on, investing in clean energy sources is proof of a long-term commitment. Organisations can also avoid accusations of greenwashing by taking their team with them for the journey, with 9 in 10 global employees claiming that easier-to-understand sustainability reporting would help them build trust in their company’s achievements.

International Day of Clean Energy is the perfect opportunity to educate employees and prospective new team members about the investments in sustainable power sources that your company is already making, ensuring that your efforts regarding sustainability can be fully maximised for attraction and retention purposes.

Clean Air Task Force Executive Director Armond Cohen said:

“Nuclear energy has a potentially large role to play in meeting rising energy demand with emissions-free, reliable and scalable power – and the United States indeed has much to gain by advancing projects domestically and, through exports, globally. But it will take a suite of supportive policies that derisk the first wave of nuclear investments and incentivize private sector participation to scale promising new technologies.

While it is encouraging to see a focus on building a series of large reactors of existing designs and uprates, as well as smaller newer designs, the U.S. will struggle to deploy and build new projects at the scale necessary to tackle energy security and leadership in nuclear technology. In particular, the orders do not highlight or even call for policies to share the financial risk and provide revenue certainty for early large standardized ‘orderbook’ reactor deployment – essential elements for future deployment.

This gap is all the more troubling because they appeared in the same week the House voted to diminish crucial tax credits that reduce the costs of new plants by up to 40% and restrict the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office, which is essential to finance the first wave of new plants and is called upon by one of the president’s executive orders to help deploy 10 GWs of new, large reactors. Congress must oppose these measures if the U.S. is to have any hope of achieving the goal set by the executive orders to quadruple American nuclear energy capacity and safely export American advanced nuclear energy technologies worldwide.

CATF shares the administration’s goal of unlocking advanced nuclear energy and will continue to advocate for strong government leadership to deliver safe, clean, and reliable nuclear energy at an affordable cost. But to accomplish this, a bolder and more cohesive strategy will be required.”

The bill makes tweaks to the Illinois Power Agency Renewable Energy Resource Fund and Illinois Solar for All program.","Illinois lawmakers are in final discussions over several progressive initiatives in the omnibus Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act.

Environmental advocates worry Illinois may delay the retirement of coal plants to help meet its rising electricity demand, largely caused by new data centers and AI. Meanwhile, renewable energy projects in Illinois are in limbo as they wait to get permission from the state’s grid operators PJM and MISO. The act hopes to address these issues, while helping the state meet its renewable energy targets.

The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act is the successor to the 2021 Clean and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), which expanded the Illinois Solar for All program from $30 million to $70 million per year, unlocking the benefits of affordable renewable energy for families across the state. CEJA also set a target to get Illinois to 40% renewable energy by 2030 and 50% renewable energy by 2040.

Solar Bill of Rights

The bill creates a Solar Bill of Rights, which aims to establish fair, transparent rules for solar energy across all utility territories within Illinois.

The Solar Bill of Rights requires incentives to be offered to low-income customers, non-profits and public facilities, either directly or through developers, to increase these groups’ participation in community solar.

The bill says the program’s goal is to allocate a minimum of 25% of the program’s incentives to community solar projects in environmental justice communities. It directs the agency to reserve a portion of the program for projects that promote “energy sovereignty” through ownership of projects by low-income households, not-for-profit organizations providing services to low-income households, affordable housing owners, or community-based limited liability companies providing services to low-income households.

The bill also requires the Illinois Power Agency to direct up to 5% of the funds available under the Illinois Solar for All program to community-based groups and other qualifying organizations to assist in community-driven education efforts, such as general energy education and job training program outreach efforts. The Solar Bill of Rights also puts a cap on high insurance requirements for installing rooftop solar.

In Illinois, community solar projects are compensated at the same price that utilities pay to procure and deliver power to their end-use customers. By allowing distributed solar and storage to participate in existing wholesale markets, Illinois’ community solar program lowers costs for ratepayers by adding more options to an already competitive energy supply marketplace. This also enables a more efficient use of ratepayer funds to supplement distributed generation project revenues via capacity-based and renewable energy credit incentives.

(Read: Scaling distributed generation starts with smarter state policy)

Illinois introduced a community solar offering under the Illinois Shines program in 2019. In 2023, ComEd opened enrollment to its first community solar project. As of Q4 2024, Illinois was ranked fourth for its community solar operating capacity and fifth per capita, according to the Institute on Local Self Reliance. Nineteen states and D.C. allow community solar, although legislation is underway in some states that, if successful, would increase that number.

More information about Illinois Bill of Rights can be found in the bill beginning on page 293.

Illinois Storage for All

The act creates the Illinois Storage for All program, which requires the agency to direct up to 25% of the funds toward grants, rebates or incentives designed to encourage renewable energy storage paired with solar distributed renewable energy generation. Illinois Storage for All would be available to current and future participants of low-income customers, nonprofits and public facilities.

Illinois Storage for All would be designed to support community energy resilience, disaster preparedness and energy bill reductions, particularly for low-income and environmental justice communities.

More information about Illinois Storage for All can be found in the bill beginning on page 87.

(Read: Illinois lawmakers propose 15 GW energy storage target by 2035)

Virtual power plant (VPP) program

According to Department of Energy estimates noted in the legislation, the United States could deploy 80 GW to 150 GW of VPPs by 2030 (a tripling of current levels) to support the rapid electrification of homes and vehicles, saving ratepayers $10 billion per year.

The legislation requires utilities with more than 300,000 customers to develop VPP programs through a standard offer, open-access tariff for distributed energy resources to provide system peak load reduction and other grid services.

More information about the VPP program’s provisions can be found in the bill beginning on page 505.

Time-of-use pricing

The bill establishes opt-in time-of-use rates to “reduce the need for ramping resources and increase the grid’s ability to cost-effectively integrate greater quantities of variable renewable energy and distributed energy resources.”

ComEd currently offers two time-of-use rate programs: Hourly Pricing, which fluctuates based on the actual market rate of electricity at any given hour, and Time-of-Day, which lets customers know a day in advance how much electricity will be during three different periods: off-peak, peak and super peak. For those that don’t require a lot of electricity consumption during peak demand periods, these programs can provide significant savings for participants, along with relief to the grid. For example, as a ComEd customer enrolled in its Hourly Pricing program, the author of this article has saved $290.34 since enrolling in the program 26 months ago.

(See also: Keeping electricity both reliable and affordable while meeting load demand)

At this time, it is unclear how the time-of-use pricing would differ from the programs already offered by ComEd. The Illinois Commerce Commission told pv magazine USA, “Presently, talks at the Capitol are ongoing and fluid. It would be premature and inappropriate for the ICC to comment on bill impacts on language not fully formed or filed as legislation.”

More information about the time-of-use pricing can be found in the bill beginning on page 499.

Data Centers

Recent analysis from Synapse Energy Economics projected that if the retirement of coal plants are delayed so that more data centers can be powered up, CO2 pollution in Northern Illinois will increase by at least 64%.

The bill directs utilities to propose rules for new large-scale data centers to protect other electric consumers and ensure the facilities have plans to develop clean energy resources to reduce strain on the power grid. The bill also directs the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency to propose environmental standards for large data centers.

Additional measures

Among other provisions, the bill:

Works to improve infrastructure by increasing transmission and fixing interconnection issues to deploy renewable energy more quickly;

Upgrades resource adequacy studies under the Illinois Environmental Protection Act to examine multiple clean energy options and select the least-cost pathway toward meeting the state’s renewable energy goals while ensuring adequate resources and electric system reliability;

Requires “munis and coops” (electric providers other than ComEd and Ameren) to use industry best practices to forecast and plan for future electricity needs; and

Directs utilities to propose rules for new large-scale data centers to protect other electric consumers and ensure the facilities have plans to develop clean energy resources to reduce strain on the power grid.

The bill makes tweaks to the Illinois Power Agency Renewable Energy Resource Fund and Illinois Solar for All program. For example, the bill would also direct the resource fund to also fund rebates, along with the purchasing of renewable energy credits currently in place.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/4405879284_2bd7ab8a78_o-1200x800.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 02:00:47.383171

Baker Botts would be pleased to assist you in your analysis of the upcoming legislative changes and other clean energy tax incentive matters.","On May 22, 2025, the House passed the legislation entitled “The One Big Beautiful Bill” (the “BBB”)1 that would, if enacted into law, severely restrict clean energy tax incentives. This client update addresses the BBB’s phase-outs, restrictions, and repeal of transferability with respect to certain clean energy tax credits enacted or extended under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”). For our separate discussion of the provisions of the BBB that affect general business, international, and individual taxation, click here.

The BBB will face further negotiation and likely modifications in the Senate under a process called reconciliation. While the reconciliation process requires only a simple majority of Senate members to approve the BBB, Senate Republicans are not yet aligned on the BBB and significant modifications are expected before it is in agreed form.

Clean Electricity Investment and Production Tax Credits (Sections 48E and 45Y)

Accelerated Termination

The BBB would terminate the Clean Electricity Investment Credit (the “ITC”) under Code Section 48E and the Clean Electricity Production Credit (the “PTC”) under Section 45Y for facilities that either —

begin construction more than 60 days after the enactment of the BBB; or

are placed in service after December 31, 2028.2

Under current law, the ITC and PTC gradually phase out for facilities beginning construction after 2032 or, if later, the year in which the United States achieves certain greenhouse gas emissions targets. Earlier versions of the BBB had proposed an accelerated phase-out of the credits, however, in a last-minute change before passage of the BBB, the phase-out was changed to complete termination by imposition of deadlines for beginning construction and placement in service. We expect the accelerated termination of the ITC and PTC in the BBB to be a focal point for further negotiations when the BBB reaches the Senate.

The addition of an absolute deadline for placing a facility in service will mean that a facility that timely begins construction but encounters unexpected construction delays pushing its placement in service beyond the deadline will be exposed to complete loss of the credits that the facility’s developers anticipated. This risk of complete credit loss will make project financing extremely difficult if the BBB is enacted into law.

Restrictions on Certain Foreign Connections

The BBB imposes restrictions on the ability of entities with certain connections to a “prohibited foreign entity” (“PFE”) to claim the ITC or PTC. These restrictions are sometimes referred to as “FEOC” rules, after an existing statute targeting “Foreign Entities of Concern” that partially inspired these restrictions.

The BBB creates several new defined terms for purposes of these restrictions:

A PFE is either of a “specified foreign entity” (“SFE”) or a foreign-influenced entity (“FIE”);

An SFE is an entity designated as a bad actor under the authority of a variety of existing statutes (including the FEOC rules) or a “foreign controlled entity” (“FCE”);

An FCE is (i) the government of a covered nation, (ii) a person who is a citizen or resident of a covered nation (and not also a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States), (iii) an entity organized or having its principal place of business in a covered nation, or (iv) an entity majority-controlled by one of the preceding types of FCEs;

A “covered nation” is China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea;

An FIE is an entity that (i) may have a board member, executive officer or similar person appointed by, (ii) has a specified percentage of its debt or equity held by, or (iii) in the preceding year made more than a specified portion of its total payments of interest, dividends, rent, royalties, or similar items to, one or more SFEs;

“Material assistance” from a PFE is any component, subcomponent, or applicable critical mineral (as defined in Section 45X) that is extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured, or assembled by a PFE; any design of such property based on any copyright or patent held by a PFE; or any know-how or trade secret provided by a PFE. The definition excludes parts or materials that are (i) not uniquely designed or formulated for use in property that will generate credits under Sections 45Y, 48E, or 45X, and (ii) are not exclusively or predominantly produced by PFEs.

The restrictions imposed by the BBB include:

An SFE is not eligible to claim the ITC or PTC in tax years beginning after enactment of the BBB;

An FIE or an entity that in the current year makes more than a specified portion of its total payments of interest, dividends, rent, royalties, or similar items to one or more PFEs is not eligible to claim the ITC or PTC in tax years beginning two years after enactment of the BBB;

For any facility that begins construction after December 31, 2025, the ITC and PTC is entirely disallowed if construction of the facility includes any “material assistance” from a PFE; and

An entity that claims the ITC during a tax year beginning two years after enactment of the BBB is subject to 100% recapture of such ITC if, during any of the 10 years following placement in service of the property generating the ITC, it makes more than a specified portion of its total payments of interest, dividends, rent, royalties, or similar items to PFEs.

The restriction on material assistance from a PFE will have no impact if the BBB is enacted by November 1, 2025 and includes the accelerated termination of the ITC and PTC. In such case, no facility that begins construction after December 31, 2025 (which would be 60 days after enactment) will be eligible for the ITC or PTC, let alone subject to the material assistance restriction. If the accelerated termination is removed in any future version of the BBB, the material assistance restriction will be especially disruptive to ITC and PTC eligibility for any facility that sources unique parts or materials from China or any other covered nation.

No Transferability Restrictions

While the BBB proposes to restrict the transferability (sale) of most clean energy credits, making investment in the underlying clean energy projects less attractive, the BBB makes no changes to the transferability of the ITC and PTC under Section 6418. Earlier versions of the BBB had proposed a sunset of ITC and PTC transferability for any facility beginning construction more than two years after the date of enactment, but the BBB as passed by the House does not include any such sunset for these credits, since any such facility would not be eligible for the ITC or PTC under the accelerated termination. If the accelerated termination is removed in any future version of the BBB, it is possible that the transferability sunset will be reintroduced for the ITC and PTC.

Note Regarding Legacy ITC and Legacy PTC

The BBB makes no changes with respect to the production tax credit under Section 45 (the “Legacy PTC”) and impacts the investment tax credit under Section 48 (the “Legacy ITC”) only with respect to geothermal heat pump property. Accordingly, any wind, solar, or energy storage technology (among other technologies) that began construction for tax purposes on or before December 31, 2024 may be eligible for the Legacy ITC or Legacy PTC and in such case can avoid altogether the adverse tax consequences proposed under the BBB (including limitations on transferability).

Restrictions on Certain Leased Property Used at Residences (Such as Rooftop Solar)

The BBB disallows the ITC and PTC for certain solar and wind property (but not storage property) (i) of a type that qualifies for the Residential Clean Energy Credit under Section 25D, (ii) that is leased or rented to a third party, and (iii) with respect to which the lessee would be eligible for a credit under Section 25D if the lessee owned the property. If enacted, this restriction may be disruptive to the residential rooftop solar industry, as residential rooftop systems are regularly leased to customers. However, since the BBB would repeal the Section 25D credit for property placed in service after 2025, it is not clear whether this provision would have any practical impact absent changes in the effective dates of the provisions.

Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z)

The Clean Fuel Production Credit under Section 45Z receives unique treatment as the only IRA tax credit to have its availability extended under the BBB. The BBB extends the availability of the credit for transportation fuel sold through December 31, 2031, from the current cutoff date of December 31, 2027. However, the BBB also limits the availability of the credit to sales of transportation fuel exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. Additionally, the BBB modifies the determination of emissions rates for purposes of the credit by excluding any emissions attributed to indirect changes to land use and calling for additional Treasury guidance regarding transportation fuels derived from animal manure.

The BBB also makes changes to the Section 45Z credit consistent with changes to other tax credits. The BBB disallows the Section 45Z credit for tax years beginning after enactment for SFEs and for tax years beginning two years after enactment for FIEs. Finally, the BBB repeals transferability of the Section 45Z credit for fuel produced after December 31, 2027.

Other Credits

The BBB includes significant modifications to several other IRA credits:

Carbon Capture -- Section 45Q: The Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit under Section 45Q is largely unchanged by the BBB. The credit is disallowed for SFEs for tax years beginning after enactment, and for FIEs for tax years beginning two years after enactment. Transferability of the credit is repealed for credits derived from the capture of carbon using carbon capture equipment that begins construction more than two years after enactment.

Nuclear -- Section 45U: The Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit under Section 45U is disallowed for SFEs for tax years beginning after enactment, and for FIEs for tax years beginning two years after enactment. Termination of the credit is accelerated by one year, with the credit unavailable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2031.

Hydrogen -- Section 45V: The Credit for Production of Clean Hydrogen under Section 45V applies only to facilities that begin construction before January 1, 2026, instead of the current deadline of January 1, 2033. Current law also offers an ITC for hydrogen storage property. Any taxpayer claiming the ITC for hydrogen storage property would be subject to the same restrictions on the ITC described above, including accelerated termination of the ITC for any hydrogen storage property that begins construction more than 60 days after the enactment of the BBB or is placed in service after December 31, 2028, and FEOC-type restrictions on certain foreign connections.

Manufacturing -- Section 45X: The Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit under Section 45X is generally phased out for components sold after December 31, 2031, instead of the current cutoff of December 31, 2032. However, no credit is allowed with respect to wind energy components sold after December 31, 2027. The credit for the production of critical minerals, which does not phase out under current law, is also phased out after December 31, 2031 under the BBB. The credit is disallowed for SFEs for tax years beginning after enactment, and for FIEs for tax years beginning two years after enactment. The credit is also disallowed for tax years beginning two years after enactment for any component that includes material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity or is produced subject to a licensing agreement with a PFE which has a value greater than $1,000,000. Additionally, the credit is disallowed for tax years beginning two years after enactment for taxpayers that make payments to PFEs of interest, dividends, rent, royalties, or similar items that are related to the production of eligible components, and which represent more than a specified portion of a taxpayer’s total payment of such items. Transferability of the credit is repealed for components sold after December 31, 2027.

Several other green energy tax credits are, subject to certain narrow exceptions, terminated for tax years after 2025 or for property acquired after December 31, 2025. These include:

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit under Section 25C,

The Residential Clean Energy Credit under Section 25D,

The New Energy Efficient Home Credit under Section 45L,

The Credit for Previously Owned Clean Vehicles under Section 25E,

The Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit under Section 30C,

The Clean Vehicle Credit under Section 30D, and

The Credit for Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles under Section 45W.

Exceptions exist for credits under Section 45L for homes that began construction before May 12, 2025, Section 45W for vehicles acquired pursuant to a written binding contract entered into before May 12, 2025, and Section 30D for vehicles placed in service during 2026 if certain criteria are met.

The BBB will face further negotiation and likely modifications in the Senate before being returned to the House and then sent to the President for approval, at which point it would be expected to become law.

MASTERS: And part, he says, it's about the number of cars manufacturers think they can sell in this market. And that number might soon tumble lower. Two years ago in Minnesota, lawmakers tried to encourage drivers to purchase electric vehicles by offering big rebates. This year, those rebates are gone, and in their place, a hike on the surcharges on those same cars.

CAROLYN BERNINGER: You know, we're coming off of Minnesota having its electric vehicle rebate program, which was very popular, but only funded for one year.

MASTERS: Carolyn Berninger is with Drive Electric Minnesota, a trade group looking to accelerate the adoption of EVs.

BERNINGER: And now we're kind of seeing the state go in the opposite direction.

MASTERS: That rebate program offered up to $2,500 for new EVs and $600 for purchases of used ones. But Berninger points out EV adoption in Minnesota is still very low. She's concerned customers won't want to go with an EV when they see that annual surcharge triple, from $75 to $200 starting next year.

BERNINGER: Hiking up fees, and particularly this $200 fee, would require electric vehicle owners to pay more in the electric vehicle fee than a lot of gas car owners pay through the gas tax.

MASTERS: Other states are also rolling EV incentives back. Colorado reduced its tax credit from $5,000 to 3,500. At the federal level, Congress voted to undo federal waivers for California. The White House wants to cancel funding for a $5 billion EV charging station grant program. Minnesota's Democratic Attorney General Keith Ellison is part of a multi-state coalition of AGs suing the Trump administration over the move.

KEITH ELLISON: The thing that's happening in the legislature I disagree with, but I can't claim it's unconstitutional. What the president is doing is unconstitutional and illegal, and that's why we're suing him for it.

MASTERS: At the Capitol in St. Paul, Democratic governor and former vice presidential candidate Tim Walz seems ready to pass the surcharge bill.

TIM WALZ: The gas tax is what - how we fund our roads. And the argument is is that EVs use our roads. They add to the maintenance of it. They should pay their fair share on that. And I think most EV owners agree with that.

MASTERS: The House here is tied between Republicans and Democrats this year. Democratic Representative Larry Kraft says he's disappointed lawmakers can't do more to curb climate change.

LARRY KRAFT: The climate doesn't give us a pause. The climate doesn't care about our politics. So the fact that we weren't able to make more progress, yes, I'm very disappointed, and I have renewed emphasis to work on it.

MASTERS: So at the same time that the Trump administration continues to disincentivize EV adoption, lawmakers, even Democrats, may charge Minnesotans a little more to keep their EV registrations up to date. For NPR News, I'm Clay Masters in St. Paul.

To achieve a reductionof 23 per cent would require full implementation of a wide range of policies and plans across all sectors and for these to deliver the anticipated carbon savings.

The first carbon budget and second carbon budget are projected to be exceeded with almost all sectors on a trajectory to exceed their national sectoral emissions ceilings for 2030.

Ireland will not meet its EU Effort Sharing Regulation target of 42 per cent reduction by 2030, instead a maximum reduction of 22% is projected.

Total emissions from the Land Sector are projected to increase by up to 95% and Ireland is unlikely to meet our European commitments in this area.

28th May 2025: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has today published its greenhouse gas emissions projections for the period 2024-2055.

EPA analysis shows that planned climate policies and measures, if fully implemented, could deliver up to 23 per cent emissions reduction by 2030 compared to 2018, down from the 29 per cent reduction projected last year. This widening gap to the emissions reduction target of 51 per cent in Ireland’s Climate Act is driven by updated information provided by Governmental bodies.

The first Carbon Budget (2021-2025) of 295 Mt CO2eq is now projected to be exceeded by between 8 to 12 Mt CO2eq. The second budget is now projected to be exceeded by a significant margin of 77 to 114 Mt CO2eq, including carryover from the first Carbon Budget.

Transport, Industry and the Buildings (Residential) sectors are projected to be the furthest from their sectoral emission ceilings in 2030, with emission reductions of up to 21%, 12% and 22% respectively. Agriculture emissions are projected to reduce by up to 16%. A direct comparison of the Agriculture sector against its Sectoral Emission Ceiling is no longer viable due to the impact of updated science underpinning the estimated agriculture greenhouse gas emissions.

Laura Burke, Director General, EPA said:

“The EPA’s projections show that full delivery of all climate action plans and policies could deliver a 23 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Although emissions trends are going in the right direction, the gaps to our European and National emission reduction targets are now projected to be larger than last year. This highlights the economy-wide effort needed to decarbonise our society and the focus must shift from policy aspiration to practical implementation.”

Ms Burke added:

“As we get closer to 2030 and receive more information on the impact of agreed policies and measures, it is concerning to see projected reductions and lack of progress in the delivery of actions to reduce emissions including in the electrification of our transport sector and the expansion of renewable electricity powering our homes and businesses and the implementation of carbon reduction measures in agriculture. Momentum is building for Ireland's low carbon society, but we need to accelerate it and scale up the transition.”

Agriculture

Depending on the level of implementation of measures outlined in Climate Action Plans, AgClimatise and Teagasc MACC, total emissions from the Agriculture sector will range from a 1 per cent increase to a 16 per cent decrease over the period of 2018 to 2030. Savings are projected from a variety of measures including limits on nitrogen fertiliser usage, switching to different fertilisers and bovine feed additives.

Transport

Emissions from the sector are projected to reduce up to 21 per cent over the period 2018 to 2030 if the measures set out in plans and policies are implemented. These include over 640,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2030, increased biofuel blend rates and measures to support more sustainable transport. Road freight is projected to be the biggest source of road transport greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.

Residential Emissions

Emissions from the sector arise from fuel combustion for domestic space and hot water heating. These are projected to decrease by up to 22 per cent by 2030. Emission reduction measures in this sector include 571,000 domestic heat pumps are projected to be installed by 2030.

Industry

Fuel combustion in manufacturing is the primary source of emissions in this sector; process emissions from mineral, chemical, and metal industries contribute the next largest portion. Emissions from this sector are projected to reduce by 12 per cent over the period 2018 to 2030 with full implementation of measures including the accelerated uptake of carbon-neutral heating technologies for low and high temperature heating, and increased use of biomethane.

Energy

Driven by a reduction in fossil fuel usage and increased net importation of electricity from interconnectors, there was a marked drop of over 21 per cent in emissions from electricity generation between 2022 and 2023. In combination with planned increases in renewable energy generation from wind and solar, energy sector emissions are projected to reduce by up to 68 per cent (over the period 2018 to 2030) and are projected to achieve over 68 per cent renewable electricity generation by 2030.

Land use

Emissions from this sector are projected to increase between 39 per cent to 95 per cent over the period of 2018 to 2030 as our forestry reaches harvesting age and changes from a carbon sink to a carbon source. Planned policies and measures for the sector, such as increased afforestation, water table management on agricultural organic soils and peatland rehabilitation are projected to reduce the extent of the emissions increase.

Commenting, Mary Frances Rochford, Programme Manager said:

“The Agriculture sector has made some progress in reducing emissions through the successful rollout of actions on nitrogen fertilisers, low emission spreading technologies and national liming programmes. In parallel, in line with new research, the EPA refined the information underpinning the agricultural figures which has led to a reduction in the overall agriculture emission estimates. It is imperative that this new research and information is incorporated into updated carbon budgets and sectoral ceilings to ensure that they reflect latest science, data and knowledge on greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland and alignment with the national reduction target for the sector of 25%.”

Notes to Editor

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the national body with responsibility to develop, prepare and publish projections of greenhouse gas emissions for Ireland. The EPA produces national greenhouse gas emission projections on an annual basis. These projections are compiled in accordance with, and to meet, EU reporting obligations. At a national level this report informs policy and monitors and reports Ireland’s climate action performance to Government under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act (Amendment) 2021 and to the public as outlined in Climate Action Plans.

It is an obligation under the Climate Act that, where the total greenhouse gas emissions for a preceding budget period exceed the carbon budget for that period, the excess greenhouse gas emissions from the preceding budget period is carried forward to the next period. The carbon budget for the next period is then decreased by the amount carried forward.

The EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Emission projection is an estimate of what emission levels are likely to be in the future. They are based on key assumptions such as economic growth, fuel prices and Government policy.

This is the fourth set of projections prepared following the enactment of the Climate Act and the 51 per cent target contained therein. The policies and measures contained in the Climate Action Plan 2024 and previous Plans are included in the projections with a number of exceptions including:

Onshore wind of 7.1 GW, offshore wind of 2.7 GW and 6.3 GW of solar PV was required to achieve 68 per cent share of renewable electricity by 2030. This compares with 9 GW onshore wind, 5 GW offshore wind and 8 GW of solar PV stated for the 80 per cent target in the Climate Action Plan 2024;

The full CAP 2024 ambition of 945,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2030 is not modelled. Instead, a total of 640,750 electric vehicles is modelled in the WAM scenario, based on updated information from the Department of Transport;

The full 2 GW target for new flexible gas fired generation is not modelled. However, Eirgrid data was used to produce an adjusted trajectory yielding new gas fired generation of 1.4 GW by 2030;

Climate Action Plan 2023 introduced an Avoid/Shift policy with multiple measures to achieve an abatement of 2.09 Mt CO2 eq by 2030 in transport relative to 2018, which was applied again in the Climate Action Plan 2024. One of these modelled measures relating to price increases in petrol and diesel out to 2030 has no supporting policy and is not modelled;

Measures aimed at achieving emissions savings from a decrease in embodied carbon in construction materials (1.0 Mt CO2 abatement by 2030) aren’t currently modelled;

Emissions reductions associated with Carbon Capture and Storage are not currently modelled;

The Climate Action Plan 2024 target of a 70-75 per cent share in renewable heat in industry is not specifically modelled. Instead, current Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH) grant rates are modelled to 2055;

Diversification measures in Agriculture with annual savings by 2030 of 1.5 Mt CO2 eq is not currently modelled;

Unallocated savings of 5.25 Mt CO2 eq per annum 2026-2030 (or 26.25 Mt CO2 eq cumulatively by 2030) as stated in the Climate Action Plan 2024 are not modelled.

New scientific research has led to a reduction in emissions from the Agriculture sector in the 1990 to 2023 national greenhouse gas inventory upon which these projections are based. Estimates of methane and nitrous oxide emissions associated with non-dairy cattle and sheep categories have been updated.

With respect to non-dairy cattle, models now include additional disaggregation of production systems within the herd and linked to detailed output from the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) databases. This approach allows for more detailed estimates of a larger number of production system cohorts from birth to slaughter, revised live weight and average daily weight gain incorporated at more refined levels, and tracks the changes in slaughter age.

With respect to sheep, a Tier 2 approach to estimating emissions from the national flock developed by Teagasc has been implemented. In comparison to the previous approach, which was based on default IPCC Guideline assumptions, country specific parameters associated with sheep production in Ireland are used including parameters such as feed characteristics, fecundity, lambing patterns, mortality, liveweights and liveweight gains.

All methodologies are detailed in Ireland’s National Inventory Document 2025 and summarised in Ireland's Final Greenhouse Gas Emissions 1990-2023 report.

EU Targets

EU greenhouse gas emission targets and reduction obligations for Ireland are split into two broad categories. The first category covers the large energy and power (i.e. energy intensive) industry which are controlled under the EU Emissions Trading System. The second category deals with the non- EU Emissions Trading System sectors such as agriculture, transport, residential, commercial, waste and non-energy intensive industry.

The Environmental Protection Agency produces greenhouse gas emissions projections on an annual basis for all sectors of the economy in collaboration with relevant State and other bodies. The following are key underlying data that underpin this year’s greenhouse gas emissions projections:

Energy-related emissions projections are based on updated energy projections provided to the Environmental Protection Agency by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland in Q1 2025.

The energy projections were prepared in conjunction with the Economic and Social Research Institute who produced energy demand projections using the I3E model (Ireland Environment, Energy and Economy model).

Agriculture emissions projections are based on data from Teagasc which was provided to the Environmental Protection Agency in February 2025.

On 14th May 2018, the European Council adopted a regulation (EU 2018/842 – the Effort Sharing Regulation) on greenhouse gas emission reductions. The regulation sets out binding emission reduction targets for member states in sectors falling outside the scope of the EU emissions trading system for the period 2021-2030. In April 2023 the Effort Sharing Regulation was amended (EU 2023/857) and Ireland’s new 2030 target under the Effort Sharing Regulation is to limit its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 42 per cent by 2030.

Annual emission limits out to 2025 for the 42 per cent reduction were set by the EU in 2023, with limits out to 2030 to be set later in 2025. Under the Effort Sharing Regulation two flexibilities may be utilised to allow for a fair and cost-efficient achievement of the target. These flexibilities are the use of EU Emissions Trading System allowances and credit from action undertaken in the Land use, Land use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector.

Flexibilities under the Effort Sharing Regulation include the allowance by eligible Member States to achieve their national targets by covering some emissions with EU ETS allowances which would normally have been auctioned. EU-wide, this cannot be more than a combined total of 100 million tonnes CO2 over the period 2021-2030. The ETS flexibility allows Ireland to transfer emissions of up to 4 per cent of 2005 levels per annum, or 19.1 Mt CO2 eq from the non-ETS to ETS sector, reducing the mitigation requirement in the non-ETS sector while cancelling the corresponding ETS allowances.

Also, to stimulate additional action in the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector, Member States can use up to a combined (EU-wide) total of 262 million credits over the entire period 2021-2030 to comply with their national targets. The LULUCF flexibility allows for Ireland to account for greenhouse gas removals of up to 26.8 Mt CO2 eq over two compliance periods 2021-2025 and 2026-2030.

Hawaii’s move is also being closely watched by other states considering similar taxes to fight climate-related damage.

Hawaii’s new climate tax targets tourists

Why you should care:

Hawaii Gov. Josh Green on Tuesday signed legislation that increases the state’s tax on short-term accommodations like hotel rooms and vacation rentals, aiming to raise funds for climate resilience and wildfire prevention.

The new law will boost the daily room rate tax by 0.75%, bringing the total state tax to 11%. That doesn’t include additional state and county taxes, which will push the total levy on accommodations close to 19%—among the highest in the U.S.

The law also introduces a new 11% tax on cruise ship bills starting in July 2026. That tax will be prorated based on how many days a ship is docked in Hawaii.

How the money will be used

What they're saying:

Officials say the tax will generate nearly $100 million annually, which will go toward:

Replenishing eroding beaches like Waikiki

Clearing invasive grasses that increase wildfire risk

Installing hurricane clips to help secure rooftops

Building firebreaks to stop wildfires

Supporting a new state fire marshal role

Green emphasized that the state must take bold steps after the devastating 2023 Lahaina wildfire that killed 102 people and nearly leveled the historic town.

""This is about protecting Hawaii and creating a model for the rest of the country,"" Green said.

Big picture view:

This marks the first tax in the U.S. specifically aimed at funding a state’s climate response. Hawaii’s unique vulnerability to climate impacts—rising seas, stronger storms, and wildfire risk—makes it a testing ground for how tourism dollars might help foot the bill.

Hotels and resorts ultimately supported the measure, arguing that protecting Hawaii’s environment is essential for maintaining its status as a top destination.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.livenowfox.com/www.livenowfox.com/content/uploads/2025/05/1280/720/gettyimages-2160501570.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-05-28 07:04:13.972757

U.S. Data Centers Could Quadruple Power Demand by 2030

Today, data centers account for roughly 4% of total U.S. electricity consumption. But by 2030, that share is projected to rise to 12%, driven by unprecedented growth in computing power, storage needs, and AI model training.

In absolute terms, U.S. data center energy demand is set to jump from 224 terawatt-hours in 2025 to 606 terawatt-hours in 2030.

Meeting this projected demand could require $500 billion in new data center infrastructure, along with a vast expansion of electricity generation, grid capacity, and water-cooling systems. Generative AI alone could require 50–60 GW of additional infrastructure.

This massive investment would also depend on upgrades in permitting, land use, and supply chain logistics. For example, the lead time to power new data centers in large markets such as Northern Virginia can exceed three years. In some cases, lead times for electrical equipment are two years or more.

A Strain on the U.S. Grid

The U.S. has experienced relatively flat power demand since 2007. Models suggest that this stability could be disrupted in the coming years. Data center growth alone could account for 30–40% of all net-new electricity demand through 2030.

Unlike typical power loads, data center demand is constant, dense, and growing exponentially. Facilities often operate 24/7, with little downtime and minimal flexibility to reduce usage.

After the signing of an executive order allowing the United States to take steps toward commercially mining the seafloor, the critical minerals located within the proximity of the islands have proven to be a significant opportunity for economic growth. Nickel and cobalt are two of the most valuable resources on the ocean floor and are used to create useful technology, such as batteries and superalloys. According to US Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, “Critical minerals are fundamental to strengthening our nation’s resilience and safeguarding our national interests.”

In international affairs, this move from the Trump Administration is unprecedented, mainly as this move flies in the face of the International Seabed Authority, which was established in 1982 to regulate the underwater mining industry in international waters. Although the US never signed the convention establishing this global organization, they have often promoted and overseen many developments throughout the ISA’s subsequent development. Leticia Reis de Carvalho, secretary-general of the International Seabed Authority, has written, “No state has the right to unilaterally exploit the mineral resources of the area outside the legal framework established by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea… It is common understanding that this prohibition is binding on all States, including those that have not ratified UNCLOS.”

While the US Department of the Interior is seeking input from American Samoan communities and mining experts, many believe that the potential for commercial seafloor mining is exploitative and damaging to the biodiversity of these habitats. The World Wildlife Fund has officially stated that “Deep-sea mining could exacerbate [environmental] pressures further, causing irreversible biodiversity loss, habitat destruction, sediment plumes, and the release of toxins and stored carbon.”

Industry wants government subsidies, the government says there is no public support for this, and society wants to see industry take responsibility first. But then you're stuck in a vicious circle.""

No market value, but essential

The climate debate is currently often framed from a techno-economic perspective, explains De Gooyert. ""Every solution must have direct market value. If that is lacking, no one is willing to take the first step. But a solution such as CCS has no direct market value. In addition to technology, regulations and subsidies, you really need that support, because a policy without support mainly results in resistance.""

De Gooyert collaborated with colleagues Senni Määttä, Sandrino Smeets and Heleen de Coninck on the article. Their recommendations are based, among other things, on extensive experience with discussions between government, business, citizens and other stakeholders on climate issues. They work with environmental organisations, industry and governments in European countries including Finland, Sweden, Spain and Belgium.

Trust

""What keeps coming back is that policy only works if there is mutual trust. People often think that if we explain it well, support will come naturally. But then you mainly have one-way communication, and research shows that this can be counterproductive. What you end up with is people thinking: there go those arrogant policymakers again, telling us what's good for us, and if we don't agree, they'll push it through anyway.""

De Gooyert and his colleagues advocate the use of independent, scientific advisory councils, but also initiatives such as citizens' councils. ""Citizens must be able to form an informed opinion independently, and there must be room for complexity and nuance. We must be honest with each other in such sessions: there are difficult choices to be made, but people must be given openness about the options and the consequences. Citizens deserve a say in their environment. To offer comfort to local residents, governments and businesses will also have to make sacrifices. We won't get there with the current method. Then we'll remain in the situation we're in now: no one willing to take big steps on climate policy, while time is running out.""",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png,N,,2025-05-27 22:04:15.935498

Ciaramella",,,,,https://reason.com/2025/05/27/will-trumps-regulatory-reforms-do-enough-to-unleash-nuclear-energy/,"""The NRC is designed to be an independent agency,"" Adam Stein, director of the Nuclear Energy Innovation Program at the Breakthrough Institute, tells Reason.
This executive order also directs the NRC to reconsider its radiation standards for nuclear power plants and ""adopt science-based radiation limits.""
Trump's order also sets a goal to effectively quadruple America's nuclear energy capacity and build 400 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2050.
Juliann Edwards, chief development officer at The Nuclear Company, a startup aiming to streamline the deployment of nuclear power plants, agrees.
China currently has 30 nuclear reactors under construction and is exporting its nuclear energy technology to developing nations.","On Friday, President Donald Trump issued four executive orders aimed at bolstering nuclear power production by addressing supply chain constraints, reforming advanced reactor testing at federal research facilities, and increasing nuclear reactor use on military bases.

One of the most substantive orders calls for a ""wholesale revision"" of regulations governing nuclear power. Specifically, it directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to establish guidelines that would issue final decisions on all new construction and operation applications within 18 months—a process that currently takes years.

Under the order, the NRC will work with the Department of Government Efficiency and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to draft these rules, which are due next year. Under an executive order issued in February, executive and independent agencies are required to submit draft and final rules to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (an office within the OMB) for review and approval.

This added layer of federal scrutiny could end up slowing down reactor approvals and make the NRC less efficient. It could also run contrary to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, which established the NRC and its guidelines.

""The NRC is designed to be an independent agency,"" Adam Stein, director of the Nuclear Energy Innovation Program at the Breakthrough Institute, tells Reason. ""The President has control by appointing Commissioners and has the authority to remove Commissioners for cause."" However, the Atomic Energy Act says that the commission shall execute the provisions of the law, ""not the Commissioners in conjunction with other parts of the Executive branch,"" he says.

Congress has also begun to address permitting delays at the NRC. In 2024, federal lawmakers passed the ADVANCE Act which, among other things, directs the NRC to establish a quicker permitting process for already-approved technologies (18 months to finish safety evaluations and environmental reviews and 25 months to issue a final decision). The agency is expected to issue these guidelines by September, according to the NRC website.

However, the legislation stipulates that these guidelines be enforced to ""the maximum extent possible."" Jack Spencer, a senior energy researcher at The Heritage Foundation, thinks Trump's order could ""bring additional accountability to the process.""

""Any big bureaucracy is going to be resistant to change,"" he says. ""Legislation that basically puts it in their hands to achieve that reform, I think, will often fall short of the sorts of reform that are possible."" Spencer thinks that subjecting the proposed reforms to another set of eyes ""that will ask hard questions will be helpful in ensuring that real reform ultimately takes hold.""

This executive order also directs the NRC to reconsider its radiation standards for nuclear power plants and ""adopt science-based radiation limits.""

Federal radiation regulations mandate nuclear power plants to emit levels of radiation that are ""as low as reasonably achievable"" (ALARA) and are based on the linear no-threshold model, which assumes that no level of radiation risk is safe to the public. This framework is not scientific (humans are exposed to natural levels of radiation that are higher than those that nuclear power plants emit) and has pushed up costs for power plant operators for no public safety benefit.

Spencer argues that fixing this rule is critical for reducing the nuclear industry's regulatory burden. ""You can make the NRC the most efficient regulatory agency that has ever existed. And if the basis of its regulatory actions is not grounded in science, then who cares?""

""That doesn't mean that you're reducing safety standards. It means that you're making safety standards in line with actual risks,"" he adds.

This directive could face legal scrutiny.

Stein, who has been critical of these standards, says ""safety standards are almost never implemented through executive order. They usually require the agency to review and 'reconsider' if the standards are appropriate."" With the NRC recently reaffirming its model for radiation standards in 2021, there ""would need to be new scientific evidence to justify a change now that wouldn't be viewed as arbitrary by a court."" Instead of rewriting ALARA standards, Stein suggests that the NRC could adopt radiation thresholds at nuclear power facilities that are defined in the Clean Air Act.

Spencer recognizes these standards can't be changed through an executive order. ""But it gets the conversation going. And it makes it more OK to talk about it, and it subjects the whole issue to daylight and makes people address it.""

Trump's order also sets a goal to effectively quadruple America's nuclear energy capacity and build 400 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2050. Stein says this goal ""can be a helpful signal to the market,"" but stating a goal does not ""will it into existence.""

Juliann Edwards, chief development officer at The Nuclear Company, a startup aiming to streamline the deployment of nuclear power plants, agrees. ""It's obtainable if you have the right leadership and you have the right behaviors and you're removing a lot of bureaucratic, unnecessary red tape, whether that be the federal level or the state level or through some regulatory regime.""

America's fleet of commercial nuclear power plants, while still safe and effective, is aging. Most of the reactors were built between 1967 and 1990—although two came online in 2023 and 2024, seven years delayed and $16 billion over budget.

As the U.S. halted its construction, China's has accelerated. From 2014 to April 2024, the nation has added over 34 gigawatts of nuclear capacity to its grid. ""Nearly every Chinese nuclear project that has entered service since 2010 has achieved construction in 7 years or less,"" notes the Breakthrough Institute. China currently has 30 nuclear reactors under construction and is exporting its nuclear energy technology to developing nations. Nearly half of the world's nuclear power plant constructions are happening in China.

While several factors have played into America's pivot away from nuclear power, including market structures, state bans on the energy source, and the introduction of cheap natural gas, the impact of federal regulations cannot be overstated.

""Without doing a refresh and making sure [that] regulations are still applicable, you can get into a point, which we're seeing now, where it's extremely difficult to even cite and permit a piece of land,"" says Edwards. In the past 20 years, regulations have become so onerous that it takes five to seven years and close to $1 billion just to permit and cite a plot of land for nuclear energy development, according to Edwards. Streamlining the licensing process isn't a safety hazard but rather ""a natural iteration that should be a part of our standard process with regulations.""

Regulations have long inhibited American nuclear energy. While Trump's order is well-intentioned to fix this issue, it is sure to face legal challenges—as many of the president's orders have.

Still, the orders may be enough to get a more substantial conversation going. ""I think anything that creates pressure toward reform is good,"" says Spencer.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/05/5-27-25-v1.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 21:01:21.780605

DETROIT (Reuters) -General Motors is investing $888 million at a New York propulsion plant to increase engine production and build a next-generation V8, the company said on Tuesday.

The investment at the Tonawanda propulsion plant in Buffalo, New York, first reported by Reuters, is a shift from a previously announced $300 million commitment to make electric-vehicle drive units at the plant.

The move is likely another sign of automakers adapting to slower-than-expected market demand for EVs and comes after the Detroit automaker aggressively lobbied Congress to rescind California electric-vehicle rules.

GM said the investment will support the sixth generation of GM’s V-8 engines, used in full-size trucks and SUVs expected to be more fuel-efficient.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul said the project will support 870 jobs at Tonawanda Propulsion, including 177 jobs deemed at risk. The state plans to provide up to $16.96 million in tax credits in return for investment commitments.

New York said last week it would pause penalties associated with any shortfalls of EV sales for two years.

GM has been more adamant in staying the course on its move to EVs than other automakers, but has also pulled back on some of its previously announced EV investments, including selling its stake in a battery cell plant to battery partner LG Energy.

GM CEO Mary Barra has said the automaker has a plan to sell only electric light-duty vehicles by 2035 but has said it will ""be responsive to where the customer is.""

Executives have more recently positioned the company to be focused on adapting to customer demand for EVs, but the automaker has also continued launching the vehicles. It now has about a dozen EVs available in the United States.

GM committed to a $300 million investment for drive unit production at the Tonawanda plant during the 2023 negotiations with the United Auto Workers union. Production of the drive units had not been launched there.

Overall, virtually all of the 21 GOP House representatives who previously defended clean energy tax credits under the IRA voted for the bill.
The tax bill would kill off two key tax credits that have been responsible for most of that growth.
Ben Smith, associate director at Rhodium Group, estimates that this could lead to up to a 72% decline in clean energy additions to the grid over the next decade.
According to Guggenheim analyst Joseph Osha, the tax bill will be “disastrous” for the rooftop solar industry because it will terminate tax credits for companies that lease solar equipment to customers.","Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed what's been dubbed the “big, beautiful bill”, with the legislation designed to leverage deep cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) credits to pay for tax cuts, immigration enforcement and extra spending on defense. The contentious bill is now headed for the Senate, where it faces its final test, with all Democrats but only a handful of GOP lawmakers critical of the huge increase it will bring to the national debt. According to a recent analysis by the International Council on Clean Transportation, the bill, coupled with cuts to other climate policies, could slash U.S. battery production by ~75% by 2030 to 250 GWh from the previously projected 1,050 gigawatt-hours, and EV sales by 40%.

According to the report, doing away with the IRA would eliminate 130,000 potential jobs in the EV sector by 2030, with the majority in battery manufacturing. Following the passing of the IRA in 2022, companies have announced a total of 128 U.S. facilities for battery manufacturing, with more than half yet to begin construction. Red and purple states including Texas, Michigan, Nevada, Tennessee, Kentucky and Georgia, would be the most adversely impacted if the bill were to become law. Under normal circumstances, this fact alone would be enough to galvanize GOP lawmakers in those states to oppose the bill; however, just two Republican House reps joined the Democrats in voting against the bill, portending a similar fate for the bill in the Senate. Interestingly, even Rep. Buddy Carter of Georgia, home to Hyundai’s new $5.5B EV and battery manufacturing plant, threw his weight behind the bill, calling it “fantastic.”

According to estimates by the experts, the project will create $4-5 billion in fresh investments in Bartow County as well as 3,500 new jobs. Over the past five years, EV-related projects in Georgia have created ~$17 billion in investments and more than 22,800 new jobs. Similarly, Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) did a 180 and supported the bill, having previously said that he will vote to preserve 45X and 30D tax credits. Overall, virtually all of the 21 GOP House representatives who previously defended clean energy tax credits under the IRA voted for the bill.

Meanwhile, the pivotal solar sector would face a massive setback under Trump’s bill. According to a study by the Rhodium Group and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the solar sector has recorded more than $160B in large solar and battery storage projects since the IRA was passed three years ago, marking one of the sector’s most productive periods in recent times. Solar and battery storage have been the fastest-growing energy source in the U.S., with the pair expected to account for 81% of new power additions to the grid in the current year.

The tax bill would kill off two key tax credits that have been responsible for most of that growth. In effect, the bill would terminate both investment and production credits for renewable energy facilities that begin construction 60 days after it becomes law or those that enter service after 2028. Ben Smith, associate director at Rhodium Group, estimates that this could lead to up to a 72% decline in clean energy additions to the grid over the next decade. Further, clean energy projects will be ineligible to claim the tax credits if they source basic materials such as cobalt and lithium for batteries, as well as glass for solar panels, from prohibited foreign entities such as China. According to Guggenheim analyst Joseph Osha, the tax bill will be “disastrous” for the rooftop solar industry because it will terminate tax credits for companies that lease solar equipment to customers. OSHA estimates that ~70% of the residential solar industry employs lease arrangements.

Among the bill’s other key highlights are a proposal to cut the Environmental Protection Agency's budget to $4.2B from $9.1B, the EPA’s smallest budget in nearly 40 years. The Union of Concerned Scientists has warned that shuttering the EPA's scientific arm would essentially turn the EPA into a purely political agency. If passed, the U.S. will record a large increase in greenhouse gas emissions by more than 1 billion metric tons annually over the next decade and U.S. household energy costs by ~$415 per household per year. The bill will also kill off the budding clean hydrogen, CO2 management, and even the nuclear power sectors.

There’s no doubt the chamber will try to make changes to the omnibus plan to extend and expand Trump’s tax cuts that passed the House last week. The president even told reporters over the weekend that senators should “make the changes they want to make,” and that some of the changes “maybe are something I’d agree with, to be honest.”

Whether those changes include salvaging the nation’s clean energy tax credits will likely depend on a small group of Republican senators who have criticized the House’s near-total gutting of the subsidies and how much they are willing to fight to undo it.

The bill that passed the House would outright eliminate consumer tax credits for electric vehicles, rooftop solar, and both energy efficiency renovations and new energy-efficient homes. It would also kill the clean hydrogen tax credit at the end of this year and give most zero-carbon power plants, including wind, solar, and geothermal, an end-of-year deadline to start construction, among many other damaging provisions.

To date, at least eight Senate Republicans have spoken out against at least some of these changes, but none of them have tied their vote to the issue. The pressure to stick with your party is “enormous” when your vote is the difference between a bill’s success or failure, Josh Freed, the senior vice president for climate and energy at Third Way, told me. “As we saw in the House, the biggest question is whether any Republican Senator, when push comes to shove, has any willingness to try to stop this bill in order to defend energy tax credits.”

Pay attention to what they say over the next few weeks — and when they say it. It’s one thing to speak out when everything’s still up in the air. It’s quite another to keep talking when votes are on the line.

The Letter Writers

When the budget fight was first heating up in April, four senators led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska sent a letter to Majority Leader John Thune warning that repealing the tax credits “would create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning, and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy.” The three co-authors were Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine, and Jerry Moran of Kansas.

Last week, after the House modified its proposal to phase out the tax credits more aggressively, Murkowski told Politico the Senate was “obviously going to be looking at” the provisions “as well as the final product, and kind of seeing where we start our conversation.” The moderate Republican has a history of supporting environmental policy, and has already broken with her party on at least one vote this year. In February, she was the only Republican who voted in favor of a Democrat-led effort to reinstate 5,500 federal public lands employees that had been fired by the Department of Government Efficiency. (The legislation failed.) Murkowski has also gone her own way to support more efficient energy codes, loans for electric vehicle manufacturers, and the impeachment of President Trump over the January 6 insurrection. But she did not vote for the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, and if you look at her overall voting record, these occasions of deviating from the party line have been rare.

Tillis, who is a member of the Finance Committee and will therefore be directly involved in writing the tax credit portion of the bill, has made more specific comments. He said he would push to wind down the tax credits more slowly to give businesses more time to prepare. “We have a lot of work that we need to do on the timeline and scope of the production and investment tax credits,” he told Politico in the same article.

While Tillis does not have the same kind of track record as Murkowski, he’s up for re-election next year, and his state has a lot to lose. Some 34 clean energy projects worth $20 billion in investment and tied to more than 17,000 jobs came to North Carolina because of the tax credits, according to the advocacy group Climate Power. Toyota invested in an EV battery manufacturing plant and just started production last month. Several EV charger manufacturers are setting up shop in the state. Siemens Energy is building a factory to make large power transformers, equipment that is essential to expanding the grid and is currently in very tight supply.

Susan Collins is also running again next year. While the Inflation Reduction Act hasn’t spurred much manufacturing in Maine, it has driven a clean energy boom. The Maine Climate Labor Council, a coalition of unions, estimates there are 145 utility-scale clean energy projects that are either operating or in development that could be eligible for the tax credits. The state has also made a big energy efficiency push in recent years, with the tax credits supporting the expansion of efficiency jobs.

Although Collins did not ultimately vote for the Inflation Reduction Act, she was the only Republican to vote against an amendment proposed by Senator Mike Lee of Utah that would have cut funding for the law’s energy efficiency rebate programs.

The Come-Latelies

When it became clear that the House was considering changes that would effectively repeal the clean energy tax credits in the IRA, Senators Kevin Cramer and John Hoeven of North Dakota, and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia chimed in to voice their concerns. Cramer criticized new deadlines the House proposed for ending the tax credits, telling Politico that “it’s too short for truly new technologies. We’ll have to change that. I don’t think it’s fair to treat an emerging technology the same as a 30-year-old technology.”

After the bill passed the House, Jon Husted of Ohio decided it was time to speak up. “You have companies that have already made investments, made commitments,” he told the outlet NOTUS. “Supply chains have been built around them, and we need to phase that out more slowly. I think that they deserve to have at least five years of that credit.” Like Tillis, Husted has an election coming up — and 35 clean energy projects in his state to protect.

The Wild Cards

The D.C. insiders I spoke to mentioned a few other powerful senators who could play a role in the debate who’ve been mum on the IRA so far. Thune, of South Dakota, has a history of being friendly toward tax credits for wind energy, and was honored by the American Council on Renewable Energy for his support for renewable energy in 2019. Lindsey Graham, chair of the Budget Committee, has also long been a sometimes-ally for climate action in the Senate. His home state of South Carolina has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the tax credits, with some 43 projects and 22,000 jobs at risk.

Then there are the potential spoilers. Republicans can only afford to lose three votes on the bill in order to send it back to the House and ultimately to the President’s desk, and the party has already split into a number of factions looking for various tweaks. Some, like Josh Hawley of Missouri, oppose the legislation’s deep cuts to Medicaid. Meanwhile, fiscal conservatives like Ron Johnson of Wisconsin have said they will push to reduce spending even more.

In the House, defenders of the tax credits ultimately cared more about raising the limit on the state and local tax deduction than fighting for clean energy subsidies. We could see a similar dynamic play out in the Senate, where Murkowski and Collins have also expressed concern about cuts to Medicaid. The Senate also can’t afford to change the bill so much that it will lose support in the House, so any changes will have to be surgical. The calculation will be, “What is the smallest thing that the authors of the bill can give these folks to fall back into line so that it is relatively easy to both pass the Senate and then get back through the House?” Freed explained.

Cramer, for his part, is not coming to the rescue for wind and solar, but he may be able to revive support for other forms of clean energy. The North Dakota Senator wrote a letter to Republican leaders in early May railing against the “indefinite entitlement” given to energy sources that depend on the wind and sun, and arguing that the tax credits should prioritize electricity generators on the basis of “reliability,” so as to encourage “geothermal, hydropower, coal and natural gas with carbon capture, and nuclear without excluding wind and solar.”

Capito has barely made a fuss about the energy credits, but she and Cramer will be the ones to watch to see how the Senate deals with the bill’s provision to repeal the Environmental Protection Agency’s greenhouse gas limits for vehicles, as both sit on the Environment and Public Works Committee, of which Capito is the chair. The repeal may not be allowed under the Senate’s rules for budget reconciliation, as it doesn’t have a direct effect on the federal budget. The Senate Parliamentarian hasn’t yet weighed in, but a negative ruling did not stop the two Republicans from leading the fight to revoke waivers granted to California that allowed it to set pollution limits on cars and trucks.

In the end, if any of these Senators wants to take a stand for big changes to the tax credits, they are going to need at least three colleagues to stick it out with them. A more likely outcome, Freed told me, is for them to attempt some smaller adjustments.

“Hopefully they can make it better, but they’re also under enormous pressure to not deviate too significantly from what the House wrote,” he said. “We just need to go in clear-eyed that it's going to be difficult.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDMyODQxOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MjUwNjk0OX0.pFEmdhqvdhuc8AnllM_I2iiJKWEUSmxdOJG2nF51SRA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C200,N,,2025-05-27 20:05:01.223539

These funds will allow the facility to implement wastewater treatment processes and ensure more efficient and environmentally responsible operations.
However, these services are critical in serving both the seasonal and year-round Mackinac Island communities, the State Park, and the numerous guests our community serves,"" said Mackinac Island Director of Public Works Allen Burt.","EGLE hosts tour during Mackinac Policy Conference to showcase the impact of water infrastructure investments

MACKINAC ISLAND, Mich.—Today, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) Director Phil Roos joined state and local leaders during the Mackinac Policy Conference to highlight the $78.7 million Mackinac Island Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) Improvement Project. The event featured a tour of the plant and an update on construction progress, emphasizing how the state’s continued investment in water infrastructure benefits communities, creates jobs and protects Michigan’s world-class water resources.

Originally constructed in 1970, the Mackinac Island WWTP has undergone significant upgrades to accommodate the island's growing population and tourism demands. The WWTP, which serves a population ranging from 492 in the winter to over 20,000 in the summer, previously struggled to meet environmental and capacity standards. The upgraded plant will provide better wastewater treatment, expand capacity and improve water quality on the island, ultimately supporting sustainable growth.

""Investing in water infrastructure is critical to ensuring the health and safety of Michigan’s communities,"" said Director Roos. ""This project is a shining example of how strategic investments in our water systems provide long-term benefits for both residents and visitors, while also contributing to Michigan’s ongoing efforts to improve water quality.""

The WWTP Improvement Project aims to expand and modernize the wastewater treatment plant, with major upgrades like automated screening, grit removal and advanced treatment systems such as moving bed biofilm reactors and UV disinfection. Expanded capacity will allow the plant to handle seasonal surges in wastewater, while new pumps, blowers and controls will improve water quality and stormwater management. Collaboration between EGLE, Mackinac Island and the Mackinac State Historic Parks was essential to securing additional property for expanding the WWTP footprint.

""We appreciate the support the community has received from the EGLE State Revolving fund loans, ARP grants, and additional State appropriations for our new Wastewater Treatment Plant,"" said Mackinac Island Mayor Margaret Doud. ""The project is a critical need for the Island’s infrastructure. This will be a great improvement to the Mackinac Island Community that all will greatly benefit from. We would like to thank everyone involved for supporting our beautiful Island, a true Gem, which is enjoyed by many and will be for generations to come.""

The Mackinac Island WWTP upgrade was made possible through a combination of funding sources, including a $24 million Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) loan, a $15 million American Rescue Plan (ARP) grant and a $39.7 million state appropriation grant in 2023. These funds will allow the facility to implement wastewater treatment processes and ensure more efficient and environmentally responsible operations.

""Infrastructure projects on Mackinac Island are not cheap, nor are they easy. However, these services are critical in serving both the seasonal and year-round Mackinac Island communities, the State Park, and the numerous guests our community serves,"" said Mackinac Island Director of Public Works Allen Burt. ""Without the assistance of EGLE State Revolving Fund loans, ARP grants, and additional State appropriations, the residents of the City of Mackinac Island would be unable to support these much-needed system updates. I thank everyone who has come together to support Mackinac Island as the special place it is not only to our local community, but to the entire State of Michigan.""

Governor Whitmer’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 Executive Recommendation Budget continues to build on these investments, providing $50 million in one-time funds to support lead service line replacement and upgrades to water systems. Additionally, $30 million in annual funding will be directed to support lead service line replacements, stormwater management and wastewater infrastructure improvements. Another $5.95 million is dedicated to strengthening the implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act to ensure safe water for all Michigan families.

""There is immense public value in making low-interest loans available for local communities to upgrade their water systems,"" said State Representative Parker Fairbairn, R-Harbor Springs. ""The Clean Water State Revolving Fund helps to protect our lakes, rivers, and streams and thereby safeguards public health. This program allows them the resources to make critical and sometimes overdue updates to their infrastructure. The Revolving Fund gives communities the flexibility to make these necessary investments without having to pay much higher interest rates of commercially available loans.""

Since 2019, the Whitmer-Gilchrist administration has invested more than $5.3 billion in water infrastructure projects, including lead service line replacement and water quality improvements.

""Longer term, we see clean energy stocks positioned for strong growth,"" BlackRock wrote.
BlackRock also suggested that investors keep tabs on nuclear stocks, with the Trump administration's focus on nuclear making the sector poised for growth.
""But given how long it takes to build nuclear power plants, we see natural gas and renewables benefiting sooner.""","US clean energy might seem an early victim of policy shifts and funding cuts, but BlackRock says its still a key source of power and an area of the stock market that could rise.

Even with renewable power facing heightened scrutiny from the Trump administration, coupled with the erosion of tax benefits in the congressional reconciliation bill, two things should keep investors interested in the space.

First, energy demand isn't ebbing, and clean energy will be needed more than ever.

""The US likely needs more of all kinds of energy to meet AI's needs,"" BlackRock wrote in a note on Tuesday. ""Industry projections see US data center electricity consumption rising between 50% and 200% by 2030 — a big jump after 15 years of flat national power demand.""

In other words, Washington can't afford to slash a leading source of electricity if the US is to maintain its artificial intelligence leadership. According to the Energy Information Administration, solar is projected to lead US power generation growth through 2026. Together with wind, solar overtook coal in the nation's energy mix for the first time in 2024.

Second, BlackRock says industry headwinds are priced into renewable power stocks.

""Longer term, we see clean energy stocks positioned for strong growth,"" BlackRock wrote. ""Renewables are quick to build and valuations are attractive: the factors that contributed to their slump — like high rates and tariffs — are now priced in, we think.""

BlackRock also suggested that investors keep tabs on nuclear stocks, with the Trump administration's focus on nuclear making the sector poised for growth.

""Last week, President Trump signed executive orders aimed at expediting nuclear power reactor deployment, and the most recent revisions to the House bill preserved the existing tax credits allotted to nuclear project developers,"" BlackRock wrote.

Gamechanger for Micromobility

The Fiat Tris is a three-wheel electric vehicle designed by engineers at the Stellantis brand’s design studio in Turin, Italy. Initially introduced in the Middle East and Africa (MEA) region, the compact EV has a range of just above 55 miles per charge and can be recharged by any standard domestic socket.

The company believes the ultra-light commercial vehicle can be a game-changer for micromobility, and it’s available in three different configurations: chassis-cabin, flatbed, and pick-up to suit applications such as urban logistics, last-mile delivery, mobile businesses, and essential transportation services.

Fiat’s First 3-Wheel Design

The Tris is the first three-wheel vehicle Fiat has brought to market. It has an integrated charging system as well as a 220-V plug to simplify recharging. Using a standard domestic plug, the Tris can be charged from 0% to 80% in 3.5 hours, or completely recharged in 4 hours and 40 minutes. According to the company, professionals can recharge the vehicle overnight or between shifts.

The Tris is 10.4 feet long and has a tight 10-foot turning radius. The vehicle is designed to navigate narrow city streets. The cargo area has 2.25 square meters of load space and can accommodate a standard 1,200 mm x 800 mm euro pallet. The Tris weighs about 2,200 pounds and has a payload capacity that maxes out at 1,190 pounds.

Future Expansion

Olivier Francois, FIAT CEO and Stellantis Global CMO, says the Tris will give independent workers, small businesses, and underserved communities a cost-effective, zero-emissions tool to move forward. Francois says the vehicle could ""transform last-mile mobility” in the MEA region and even teased that the Tris could be introduced next to the European market.

Fiat expects to manufacture the Tris in Morocco, where the brand has a significant manufacturing footprint.

According to the Times’ reporting, the EPA claims greenhouse gases from fossil fuel burning power plants, “aren’t contributing significantly to dangerous pollution”.

Big changes could come to the power industry.

“This is something that has gone back and forth for over a decade at this point,” said Byron Gary, program attorney for the Kentucky Resources Council.

The New York Times said that the EPA is proposing a regulation that would eliminate limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.

According to the Times’ reporting, the EPA claims greenhouse gases from fossil fuel burning power plants, “aren’t contributing significantly to dangerous pollution”.

“The idea that ... power plants don’t make up a significant enough portion of global warming causing pollutants is astounding and just downright wrong,” Gary said.

The EPA said electric power is the second largest human source of greenhouse gases in the U.S. In Kentucky, the power industry is the number one human source of greenhouse gases, according to the EPA.

“Kentucky, because it is more reliance on fossil fuels for its generation of power than most other states, it does rank a little bit higher percentage wise here than certain other states,” Gary said.

rank a little bit higher percentage wise here than certain other states,” Gary said.

Biden era regulations, that went into effect in 2024, said existing coal-fired and new natural gas-fired power plants must control 90% of their carbon pollution over the next few years. Dependable Power First Kentucky, a coalition concerned about Kentucky’s energy grid, said those regulations aren’t realistic.

“It would have raised all the consumers’ prices. The price everyone paid to turn on the lights would have went up; but also, it’s not just that, it’s the reliability. We just don’t have the energy infrastructure to do that, and the lights just wouldn’t have come on at times,” said Corey Elder, acting executive director for Dependable Power First Kentucky.

Elder said the EPA’s new proposal is a relief for Kentucky power plants.

“Our top priority is just ensuring that the American people have reliable electricity and what this rule does is it gives our power producers more time to get there,” Elder said.

But moving away from fossil fuels altogether, the Kentucky Resources Council said, would help with the negative effects of climate change.

“It will also be more affordable and sustainable for Kentuckians. We’re just kicking the can down the road by not tackling this problem now,” Gary said.

The EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said the agency will make sure all Americans have access to reliable and affordable energy.

The credit system is supposed to generate over $1 billion annually, with fossil fuel companies buying credits from utilities, transit agencies, and clean fuel producers.
“We don’t have to guess about that.” In California, for example, the 2011 clean fuel standard led to 31 billion fewer gallons of regular petroleum fuel being used, replaced instead with cleaner alternatives.
Electricity used to power vehicles now accounts for 20% of all the clean fuel credits generated through the program.
“They met their most recent target three years early.” In the New York State legislature, the Senate has passed similar clean fuel legislation twice in previous years and expects to do so again this session, Harckham said.","ALBANY, N.Y. (NEXSTAR) — Democratic lawmakers rallied alongside clean fuel advocates on Tuesday at the State Capitol to push legislation that could slash greenhouse gas emissions from transportation by 20% within eight years. The Clean Fuel Standard Act of 2025, S1343A/A472A would create an incentive system that rewards using cleaner fuels while generating billions for electric vehicle infrastructure.

The proposal would require all fuel companies—including providers, refiners, blenders, and electricity suppliers—to lower the amount of greenhouse gas pollution produced per unit of fuel energy their products consume or emit. That dirtiness is called carbon intensity, which they’d lower through a credit trading system, just like in California, Oregon, and Washington. Under the legislation, sponsored by State Sen. Kevin Parker and Assemblymember Carrie Woerner, providers who hit emissions targets would be able to earn credits they could then sell off to companies that miss the mark.

Transportation produces more than 34% of New York’s greenhouse gas emissions, making it the state’s largest pollution source, according to State Senator Pete Harckham, chair of the Senate Environmental Conservation Committee. The bill outlines the initial target as a 20% reduction by 2033.

The full lifecycle emissions assessment, measuring all pollution from a fuel from start to finish, would include all stages from fuel production through consumer use—including growing crops for biofuels, and refining, transporting, and burning the fuel. Providers would have also have to meet transparency requirements and submit annual reports. Alternative fuel examples include electricity for electric vehicles, renewable diesel made from waste cooking oil or agricultural products, biofuels made from plant materials, and renewable natural gas from farm waste.

Beyond 2033, the Department of Environmental Conservation would set specific reduction targets every five years, with limits based on new technology and stricter climate requirements under the 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. Companies providing electricity for electric vehicles, renewable diesel, or advanced biofuels would generate the most credits. Meanwhile, traditional gasoline and diesel suppliers would have to buy credits offsetting their environmental impact or be subject to penalties.

When utilities or government agencies earn money by selling credits, they must spend 40% of that amount on clean transportation projects in disadvantaged communities, including electric school buses, truck charging stations, and multi-family housing charging infrastructure. The credit system is supposed to generate over $1 billion annually, with fossil fuel companies buying credits from utilities, transit agencies, and clean fuel producers.

According to Julie Tighe, president of the New York League of Conservation Voters, that money would flow directly to transportation electrification projects without requiring new state spending. She said that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, for example, would receive approximately $20,000 per electric bus annually through credit sales.

“The clean fuel standard will improve air quality tomorrow, especially for our environmental justice communities, taking harmful pollutants out of the air,” Harckham said at the press conference. “It does this in a tax-neutral way.”

Dairy farmer David Fisher from the New York Farm Bureau said his operation already produces renewable natural gas equivalent to 2,500 gallons of diesel daily through anaerobic digestion of manure. That means that bacteria break down the manure to produce methane that’s used as fuel. Currently, about 12% of New York’s cows produce renewable natural gas that could replace diesel fuel, he said.

The legislation includes sustainable aviation fuel as a credit generator because European regulations require planes leaving their airports to use jet fuel made from renewable sources like waste oils or plant materials instead of petroleum, producing fewer emissions.

But flights departing New York airports still rely on traditional jet fuel. “They’re leaving Kennedy Airport and LaGuardia dirty. It doesn’t make any sense,” Woerner said. Here’s the Assemblymember on those tougher airline regulations:

Aviation fuels are exempted due to federal preemption, but sustainable aviation fuel can opt-in for credits. Spokesperson Patricia Ornst endorsed the legislation on behalf of Delta Airlines, saying it would bring suppliers to New York by creating market incentives.

And, “We’ve seen what’s happening in California and Oregon and Washington state,” Tighe said, noting those programs showed minimal impact on fuel prices while generating substantial clean energy investment. “We don’t have to guess about that.”

In California, for example, the 2011 clean fuel standard led to 31 billion fewer gallons of regular petroleum fuel being used, replaced instead with cleaner alternatives. Their transportation fuels also produce 15% less greenhouse gas pollution per gallon compared to when the program started. Electricity used to power vehicles now accounts for 20% of all the clean fuel credits generated through the program.

It blames the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for the sharp decline in nuclear plant construction after 1978, following the Three Mile Island accident.

It blames the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for the sharp decline in nuclear plant construction after 1978, following the Three Mile Island accident. Safety standards tightened, regulatory delays increased, and regulatory uncertainty grew, as nuclear construction slowed essentially to a halt. But tighter regulation is not the only reason for this: nuclear plants became increasingly expensive and higher risk, with massive cost over-runs and delays, with many expensive new designs competing for a shrinking market.

The EO claims that “Instead of efficiently promoting safe, abundant nuclear energy, the NRC has instead tried to insulate Americans from the most remote risks.” And there is certainly some truth to that. Over time, the regulatory process has focused more narrowly on a set of specific safety checklists, and that hinders innovation.

Regulatory costs are also an issue. Congress imposes stringent cost recovery on NRC applicants, requiring that they pay NRC staff time on an hourly basis, which is especially burdensome on smaller (and more innovative) companies.

The NRC also manages the safety of nuclear plants after designs are approved, monitoring and assessing their construction and operations. It has, especially since TMI, focused tightly on safety as its primary mission. For example, the NRC has, as the EO states, consistently required very low radiation exposure in licensing: “The NRC utilizes safety models that posit there is no safe threshold of radiation exposure and that harm is directly proportional to the amount of exposure.” Alternative approaches, however, argue that there is a threshold below which radiation exposure is safe, but these have been ignored.

Against this background, the EO calls for the following policies (EO, Section 2):

To reestablish the United States as the global leader in nuclear energy;

To facilitate increased deployment of new nuclear reactor technologies, such as Generation III+ and IV reactors, modular reactors, and microreactors, including by lowering regulatory and cost barriers to entry;

To facilitate the expansion of American nuclear energy capacity from approximately 100 GW in 2024 to 400 GW by 2050;

To employ emerging technologies to safely accelerate the modeling, simulation, testing, and approval of new reactor designs;

To support the continued operation of, and facilitate appropriate operational extensions for, the current nuclear fleet, as well as the reactivation of prematurely shuttered or partially completed nuclear facilities; and

To maintain the United States’ leading reputation for nuclear safety.

The basic thrust of the order is relatively simple: reform the NRC to ease regulatory burdens, incorporate industry development into its mission, reduce licensing uncertainty, shorten approval timelines, and limit duplication by elevating DOD and DOE roles.

These are largely worthy objectives. They follow on fairly directly from previous congressional efforts to reform the NRC through the NEIMA and the ADVANCE Act. However, while further NRC reform is necessary, the changes proposed in the EO won’t be nearly enough to transform the industry.

The United States doesn’t have hundreds of new nuclear plants largely because nuclear power plants are highly capital intensive, so the cost of the energy produced is also very high and hence uncompetitive with fossil fuels and (increasingly) solar and wind. Those capital costs also make investment in nuclear energy very risky: a shift in interest rates, an unexpected delay, problems in the supply chain—they can all cause devastating financial difficulties for a nuclear investment. So private investors are reluctant to engage.

The EO attacks one dimension of the problem: the delays and uncertainty caused by existing NRC regulation, although the EO ignores the recent efficient approval of innovative new designs through the NRC’s waiver process, as well as a major proposed rulemaking published by the NRC in late 2024 that will implement a risk-informed technology neutral regulatory framework (largely in line with EO objectives). Still, more reform will be needed, for example, to support the iteration of designs, which is a normal part of the innovation process but is hard to address within existing pathways. However, the EO also supports a reduction in staffing at the NRC. Given that some of the proposed timelines for action are extremely aggressive even with existing staffing, staff reductions will make any acceleration much more difficult. Meeting target deadlines will likely require more staff, not fewer.

More importantly, the EO does not address other critical elements of nuclear development.

R&D: Nuclear badly needs new designs and new approaches, as the existing technology is not price competitive, and – we believe – will not be price competitive regardless of whether the United States builds a handful of big new reactors. But DOE funding for nuclear R&D is slashed by 24 percent under the Administration’s proposed 2025 budget.

Development: The gap between a nuclear prototype and a commercially viable product is huge, expensive, and not well funded by private investors. TerraPower’s technology has been under development for almost 20 years, and it plans to deploy its first reactor 5 years from now. Congress previously addressed this gap through supportive funding via the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), but that function will apparently be broken into pieces and funding eliminated. Key new players like TerraPower, Kairos, NuScale, and X-energy have all received substantial funding. Without that support, essential new nuclear designs won’t reach the market.

Scale-up: Small modular reactors have more promise than existing large reactors because they can be scaled up and at least in part can benefit from factory production to reach scale, which is the key to sustained cost reductions that could make SMRs competitive. But that still takes a decade or more even after commercial launch, so private investors see promising technology but also a long runway of high up-front costs, massive risks, and uncertain demand. The Loan Program Office, if suitably reformed to focus only on scaleup, could help reduce the risks and encourage private investment at no significant cost to the government, since the support would come in the form of loans rather than grants. Nuclear will need it.

As nuclear scales up, international markets and standards will also become much more important; a slimmed down NRC might well not have the staff to address this in the face of more urgent short-term needs. And as we argued in a previous paper, the Administration must develop and operate a functional strategy that covers all stages of industry development, until the market is ready to take the technology and run with it.

So the EO’s focus on regulation is important and useful, especially in the highly regulated nuclear power sector, but it’s just a small piece of building a competitive nuclear industry in the United States. Unfortunately, on all other fronts, nuclear policy seems poised to move quickly into reverse.",https://cdn.sanity.io/images/03hnmfyj/production/9a378ee57e3a1e5a6d7530bd3eba94cf0de9f789-1920x1080.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 19:06:53.834446

Safe development and operation of battery energy storage systems (BESS) has been and remains a top priority for California energy agencies. CEC is part of a cross-agency collaborative convened by Governor Gavin Newsom to find opportunities to improve safety as technology continues evolving. Key initiatives include an update to the California Fire Code happening this year, expected to include enhanced BESS safety standards. The California Public Utilities Commission in March voted to require new safety protocols for the maintenance and operation of BESS facilities. These and other ongoing efforts are based on the latest studies and consultation with experts to keep California at the forefront of safe and reliable battery storage technology deployment.

To obtain certification, a BESS would be required to meet strict safety and environmental standards. Possible mitigation requirements include:

Compliance with top-tier safety measures such as the California Fire Code and National Fire Protection Association standards (NFPA 855).

Ongoing collaboration with the local fire department so local first responders are fully equipped to handle potential incidents.

A dedicated command and control center outside the battery energy storage system facility for safe incident management.

Real-time environmental monitoring of air and water quality in the event of an emergency.

Deflagration panels to safely vent gases and minimize fire hazards.

Thermal infrared cameras for real-time monitoring and early detection of potential fire events.

About Opt-In Certification

In 2022, Governor Newsom signed Assembly Bill 205 as part of his build more, faster agenda(link is external) which is focused on delivering critical infrastructure upgrades throughout California. The bill created an alternative certification option for certain clean energy projects through the CEC's Opt-In Certification program. This program is designed to accelerate the development of clean energy in California and support the retirement of fossil-fuel-based resources.

Under the Opt-In Certification program, the CEC serves as the lead agency for the California Environmental Quality Act and will hold public meetings at or near proposed project locations to gather input on the proposed projects. Except for specific circumstances, the environmental review must be completed within 270 days after the application is deemed complete.

The CEC will invite consultation with California Native American tribes, conduct public meetings in the local area, and facilitate and consider public comment throughout the process. If the CEC approves the project, the issuance of a certificate, in most instances, replaces the need for any permits, certificates, or similar documents required by state, local, regional, or federal agencies to the extent permitted by federal law. If certified, the CEC would monitor construction and operation of the project throughout its lifetime pursuant to established conditions of certification, including enforcement of any violations and decommissioning when appropriate.

“That’s why New Jersey is not going to walk away from this fight.”","The U.S. Senate last week voted 51-44 to repeal a rule allowing California to ban sales of gas-powered cars by 2035, creating a ripple effect across the country. Eleven other states, including New Jersey, were set to follow in California’s footsteps, representing roughly 40% of the U.S. auto market in all.

How much the bill if enacted would impact New Jersey specifically is up for debate. Following California’s lead, Gov. Phil Murphy had called for half of all new car sales to be electric by 2027 as part of a larger effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. But if President Trump was to sign the latest bill once it lands on his desk, New Jersey’s electric vehicle rule could be dead before it fully gets off the ground.

NJ Spotlight News spoke with Doug O’Malley, director of Environment New Jersey, about the Senate bill and its potential consequences for New Jersey.

“The key thing to know is that regardless of what happens in Washington, New Jersey’s been a clean-car leader for more than two decades, and this was no surprise whether it was a congressional vote or a regulation or through litigation,” he said.

“The fact is … we have a constituency of more than 200,000 New Jersey residents that are driving EV’s right now.”

The Murphy administration signed on to a multi-state effort known as the Affordable Clean Cars Coalition to roll out a series of “clean vehicle programs.” Participating states include California, Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Washington.

“It’s to basically say, we’re not going away,” O’Malley said of the coalition. “New Jersey is obviously one of those states, and the investments we’ve made are starting to pay off.”

“I think there will need to be a shift just acknowledging the fact that the feds are obviously not where they were last year,” he said. “That’s why New Jersey is not going to walk away from this fight.”",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2025/05/20250527_OMalley_INTV_WEB.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 18:09:06.576911

Time to hit rewind on that. According to a report from the New York Times, the Environmental Protection Agency under the Trump administration has drafted a plan that would eliminate all caps on greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants.

The proposal, which comes under the leadership of new EPA chief, and longtime climate change skeptic, Lee Zeldin suggests that the emissions generated by power plants from burning fossil fuels “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution”—a statement that seems to imply the existence of good pollution, but that’s a whole other thing.

Per the Times, the agency’s repeal would apply to all greenhouse gas emissions standards that are currently applied to fossil fuel-fired power plants. That would effectively undo much of the work of the Biden administration to clean up the energy sector, including rolling back requirements for coal plants to capture carbon pollution before it leaves its smokestacks and store it, and rules that require gas plants to use newer technologies that produce fewer emissions.

“We are seeking to ensure that the agency follows the rule of law while providing all Americans with access to reliable and affordable energy,” Zeldin said in a statement to the Times.

The US power sector continues to be one of the country’s largest sources of greenhouse gas—second overall, just behind the transportation industry—and is responsible for one-quarter of all carbon emissions. Under the Biden administration’s standards, new power plants were significantly cleaner than the existing infrastructure. According to a report from Cleanview, 96% of new power plants built in 2024 were carbon-free. Per the EPA during the Biden era, its standards required existing coal-fired and new natural gas-fired power plants to control 90% of their carbon pollution, finding ways to capture or offset the emissions.

Forgetting History While Ignoring Cost and Safety

This past week we saw a flurry of rushed decisions around nuclear power, first with TVA submitting a construction permit for their GE-Hitachi BWRX-300 Small Modular Reactor design near Oak Ridge, Tennessee followed late Friday afternoon, May 23, 2025 with four Trump Executive Orders apparently attempting to restructure the regulatory framework of nuclear power oversight and accelerating deployment of more unproven nuclear power designs. We have known that TVA was exploring the SMR technology, but had understood it was not cost-effective and that a decision to move forward had not been made; this action would indicate otherwise.

The Executive Orders raise more questions than they answer, but appear to push the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to short-circuit their safety and review process and even allow the Department of Energy (DOE) and Department of Defense (DOD) to rush forward with nuclear power plants outside of the regulatory process. Congress separated the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in 1974 with the Energy Reorganization Act, which created the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to handle nuclear safety regulation. The Department of Energy (DOE) was created later in 1977 through the Department of Energy Organization Act, which took over the AEC’s nuclear weapons and energy development functions along with energy programs from other agencies.

The separation was designed to address conflicts of interest that had developed within the AEC, which had been both promoting nuclear technology and regulating its safety since 1946. The 1974 reorganization split these functions, giving the NRC independent regulatory authority over civilian nuclear power while transferring the promotional and weapons-related activities to what would become the DOE.

Executive Order Concerns

According to Peter Behr’s Politico Energy Wire story, former nuclear regulators and industry experts are raising serious alarms about Trump’s executive orders potentially undermining decades of independent nuclear safety oversight. Former NRC chairs Allison Macfarlane and Stephen Burns warn that political interference in the historically independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission will “crater” essential public confidence in nuclear power and damage public trust. The orders mandate staff reductions at the NRC while simultaneously requiring the agency to complete a “wholesale revision” of safety regulations within months, leading Senator Ed Markey to warn that “it will be impossible for NRC to maintain a commitment to safety and oversight with staffing levels slashed and expertise gone.”

Technical Challenges Remain Complex

The advanced reactor technologies that Trump is counting on for his nuclear “renaissance” present unprecedented safety review challenges that cannot be rushed without significant risk. According to a 2023 National Academies study, most advanced reactors use unfamiliar cooling systems like liquid sodium, helium gas, or molten salt instead of traditional water cooling, requiring extensive testing and safety analysis. Former NRC Chair Richard Meserve emphasized that “there is no way to cut corners on ensuring that these new features are carefully analyzed,” while industry veteran Amir Afzali noted that sodium-cooled reactors face “significant fire risk, as sodium ignites explosively on contact with air,” requiring rigorous testing and monitoring that increases costs.

Will We Ever Learn

Critics point to recent nuclear project failures as evidence that regulatory shortcuts won’t solve the industry’s fundamental cost problems. The Georgia Power Vogtle expansion, which used NRC-approved reactor designs, still ended up costing $35 billion and running seven years late — problems that stemmed from construction and financing issues rather than regulatory delays. As Afzali observed, “the NRC can’t be blamed for the issues Vogtle faced,” and history across industries shows that “weakening oversight and blurring the lines between promotion and regulation” leads to “serious consequences.” The orders risk repeating past mistakes by prioritizing speed over safety in an industry where public trust and technical precision are paramount.

Small Modular Reactors: Big Promises, Bigger Price Tags

TVA Dreaming

TVA has been dreaming about having an SMR for years. Submitting a request for an Early Site Permit at the Clinch River Nuclear Site in 2016 and receiving the permit in 2019. Recruiting partners and submitting an application for $800 million in taxpayer funds to be a “first mover” in SMR technology.

This dream has been hyped by many Tennessee politicians and the Oak Ridge community who have never met a nuclear project they did not like. As with many dreams they can take a turn for the worse when not grounded in reality. The missing reality in this dream, as with so many nuclear proponents’ dreams, is price and schedule. TVA’s C-suite executives dreams can easily become Tennessee Valley ratepayers’ worst nightmare when fuzzy math and hype prevail over facts and prudence. Below are the facts that beg for more prudence.

BWRX-300 and other SMRs pose significant financial risks to ratepayers

In the race to decarbonize our electricity system, small modular reactors (SMRs) have been touted as the nuclear industry’s silver bullet – smaller, faster to build, and more affordable than their larger predecessors. Among the leading designs is GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300, which has attracted interest from utilities across North America. But recent expert testimony before the Colorado Public Utilities Commission by energy analyst David Schlissel raises serious questions about whether these reactors can deliver on their promises or will instead burden ratepayers with massive costs.

The rising price tag of the BWRX-300

While GE Hitachi has kept many of the BWRX-300’s financial details under wraps, what we do know is concerning. According to Schlissel’s testimony, TVA’s recent filings reveal an estimated overnight cost for the BWRX-300 of $17,949 per kilowatt in 2024 dollars. This figure only covers the base construction costs – it doesn’t include financing costs or inflation during the years of construction.

When all costs are factored in, the final price per kilowatt will be substantially higher. For comparison, that base cost is already nearly twice as high as what GE Hitachi initially suggested the reactor might cost.

“The estimated all-in cost of the project must be much higher than shown,” Schlissel testified, noting that overnight costs exclude escalation and financing costs that typically add substantial amounts to nuclear projects.

The pattern of ballooning costs

The BWRX-300 isn’t unique in facing cost increases. Every SMR design on the market has seen dramatic cost escalation before a single reactor has been built in the United States:

NuScale’s SMR project saw costs nearly triple from $6,833/kW in 2015 to $20,130/kW by 2023 before being canceled

X-Energy’s reactor cost estimates jumped 72% in just three years (2021-2024)

TerraPower’s Natrium reactor, initially touted as potentially costing $11,594/kW, is now estimated at $28,986/kW according to recent admissions by Bill Gates, the company’s founder

“It is extremely likely that any future SMRs or large reactors will cost far more and take far longer to build than the nuclear industry and its supporters now claim,” Schlissel concluded. “That has been the long history of nuclear power in the United States, and I see no evidence that leads me to believe it will change anytime in the foreseeable future.”

The international experience is no better

Supporters of the BWRX-300 and other SMR designs often suggest we should ignore the U.S. nuclear industry’s troubled history of cost overruns. But the international experience with SMRs tells the same story:

China’s Shidao Bay SMR cost tripled from its original estimate

Russia’s floating SMRs saw costs quadruple

Argentina’s CAREM 25 SMR has had cost increases of over 600% and is still under construction

Just as troubling, these projects all faced years-long schedule delays. China’s SMR took 11 years instead of 4 to complete, while Russia’s took 13 years instead of 3. Argentina’s is still under construction after 10 years, with at least 3 more years to go.

For the BWRX-300, which has yet to begin construction anywhere, these patterns suggest ratepayers should be extremely skeptical of current cost and schedule projections.

Factory fabrication: An empty promise?

A central claim made about the BWRX-300 and other SMRs is that they will be less expensive because modules will be manufactured in factories and assembled on site. However, as Schlissel points out, none of the SMR vendors marketing designs in the U.S. currently have factories where their reactor modules are being built.

“One of the key claims by supporters of SMRs is that the reactors will be less expensive to build because key reactor modules will be manufactured in factories and assembled on site. Yet, to my knowledge, no SMR vendor has yet opened a single factory,” Schlissel testified.

This same promise was made for the AP1000 reactors built at Georgia’s Plant Vogtle, which were supposed to utilize modular construction techniques to reduce costs and construction time. Instead, the project experienced a 157% cost overrun and a 6 to 7 year schedule delay – hardly a promising precedent for the BWRX-300.

No evidence of a learning curve

GE Hitachi and other SMR vendors claim that building multiple copies of the same design will lead to cost declines over time. But Schlissel’s analysis found no evidence of such a “positive learning curve” in nuclear construction:

“Even the French nuclear program, which relied on a high degree of standardization in the design of its 58 reactors built between 1974 and 1990, failed to achieve a positive learning curve. Instead, costs continued to increase over time despite the program’s design standardization.”

His analysis of construction schedules for recent reactor designs shows no meaningful reduction in construction time for subsequent builds of the same design.

Still too expensive, even with subsidies

Even with the Inflation Reduction Act’s generous 50% Investment Tax Credit for new nuclear plants built in communities that have had now-retired fossil plants, Schlissel’s analysis found that the cost of electricity from SMRs like the BWRX-300 would still be far higher than renewable alternatives.

Using NREL’s Annual Technical Baseline data, Schlissel demonstrated that SMR power would cost $115-251/MWh in 2035, compared to much lower costs for wind, solar PV, and storage. It’s worth noting that while tax credits reduce costs to ratepayers, they simply shift the burden to taxpayers – who are the very same people.

Too slow to address climate change

The climate crisis demands rapid action. Yet even by optimistic projections, the first BWRX-300 won’t be operational until the 2030s. Given the patterns of delay seen in every nuclear project to date, the timeline could easily stretch into the 2040s.

Meanwhile, renewable energy and storage systems can be deployed in months or a few years, making them far more effective tools for near-term carbon reduction.

The flexibility factor

Perhaps most concerning for ratepayers is that investing in expensive nuclear projects like the BWRX-300 locks utilities into very long-term financial commitments when future electricity demand is uncertain. If the dramatic increases in demand currently forecast don’t materialize, or if they materialize differently than expected, ratepayers could be stuck paying for expensive overcapacity.

As Schlissel notes: “A renewable energy park would give the Company valuable flexibility in its resource planning… New resources could be added in a relatively shorter number of years if demand grows at a higher rate than now expected. This flexibility is vital in today’s dynamic energy transition.”

Conclusion: A risky bet for ratepayers

The BWRX-300 and other SMRs represent a massive financial gamble for utilities and their ratepayers. While the technology sounds promising, the evidence suggests these reactors will follow the same pattern of massive cost overruns and delays that have plagued nuclear projects for decades.

Before committing billions of ratepayer dollars to these unproven technologies, utilities and regulators should carefully consider the overwhelming evidence that SMRs like the BWRX-300 are unlikely to deliver on their promises of affordable, timely carbon-free power.

As expert David Schlissel recommends, a more prudent approach would be to invest in proven renewable energy and battery storage technologies that can be deployed quickly, scaled flexibly, and have consistently demonstrated falling costs over time.",http://www.cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/14492253878_5bdacf7b37_4k-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 18:08:48.830129

State regulators immediately fired back, saying it's unnecessary to keep Consumers Energy's JH Campbell plant open. It was supposed to close May 31.

“We currently produce more energy in Michigan than needed. As a result, there is no existing energy emergency in either Michigan or MISO,” Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission, said.

Consumers Energy is planning to close Campbell as part of a transition to cleaner energy. The power plant opened in 1962 in western Michigan's Ottawa County, near Lake Michigan. It can generate up to 1,450 megawatts of electricity to serve up to 1 million people, the utility said.

“MISO and Consumers Energy shall take all measures necessary to ensure that the Campbell Plant is available to operate,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said last week.

The utility said it will comply with the order, which expires August 21.

""Yes, the plant will stay on and produce electricity,"" spokesperson Brian Wheeler said Tuesday.

An environmental group, the Sierra Club, panned the government order.

It is a multi-million project that is being carried out by the motoring company, with the purpose of leading the revolution and the electric global market in the automotive sector.

Located in Stanton, Tennessee, it is a city with a futuristic design, which will host factories, assembly lines, technical training and storage space for batteries. This huge project will benefit the people of Stanton, generating a large number of jobs and infrastructure improvements. Ford is committed to clean energy and electric cars and has decided to do it big.

The Blue Oval City

Ford has decided to throw caution to the wind and has come up with this idea of a futuristic city, focused solely on the world of electric motors. With an expansion of 3,600 acres, this is a complex located in Stanton, Tennessee.

Its main purpose is to become the state and world reference in terms of electric energy, as well as promoting the use of cleaner energies. In addition to the assembly lines, there are factories, technical training, battery installations and also a recycle center for all products.

Is it really useful?

The company Ford, founded in 1903, is one of the world’s largest manufacturers. But that is not its only advantage. It has also been a pioneer in betting on cleaner and sustainable energies and continues to do so today. It has taken another step further, creating a working environment that also seeks to be sustainable, so the supply of energy vehicles will increase. As expected, mass production has to reduce costs, so we could benefit from a greater number of vehicles at more affordable prices.

Positive or negative impacts on the region?

This is an issue that must be addressed jointly between Ford and the community. The construction of this complex began three years ago, and already then its impact could be appreciated. The city of Staton benefited from the increase in jobs, something that will also happen in the future with the opening of the same, after its construction is finished. In addition, improvements will have to be made to the city’s infrastructures, as more roads and an increase in public service will be needed.

However, it must also be borne in mind that this increase could lead to an higher volume of the population, which would have repercussions on the price of housing and life in general, making them more expensive.

EV´s future

One of the products already being designed by the company is the launch of a second generation of the classic Ford F-150 EV model in the Blue Oval City. An offer that will reach even greater number of consumers since the production will be on a large scale. Ford has opted for a path that is still uncertain, but one that promises a better future. A commitment to the development and research of the electrical sector, advocating the use of clean energy and care for the environment, offering an increase in cost-benefit ratio.

In short, we are facing one of the most innovative and risky bets in the automotive sector. To make an investment of this magnitude and direct it towards clean energy, adding the purpose to offer products of good quality, respectful with the environment and above all more affordable for the consumer, require a blind confidence in the project.

It will be a matter of time to see how other brands launch similar initiatives, but we will have to see if they are of the same magnitude in terms of investment, confidence and size.",https://pedirayudas.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ford-logo-1800-x-1200-wallpaper-9aaksmtk072ewndr.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 20:05:17.481565

As with nearly all lithium-ion batteries, BESS batteries are made of thin layers of anode and cathode materials interdigitated together and encased in aluminum and copper.
Lithium-ion battery cells made with composite conductive materials — or polymeric current collectors, PCC — are built with a different architecture.
But one of the reasons they and others could never move forward with PCC batteries is that there was no way to mass produce them.
Worldwide, this “wet process” is how lithium-ion batteries have been made for over 30 years!","Karl Littau is the chief technology officer of Sakuu, a San Jose-based company providing commercial-scale printing equipment and technologies to the battery industry.

The recent battery fires at the Vistra Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility on the California coast are a tragedy.

A large regional energy source was ruined, nearby residents evacuated and already there are lawsuits and questions about toxins released into the environment.

Battery energy storage system, or BESS, facilities are essential for leveraging renewable energy resources like solar, since they capture daytime electricity production and supply it to the grid after sundown when demand remains high. But communities may become more hesitant about hosting these facilities.

So it’s a tragedy because society desperately needs more renewable energy, more grid storage and more BESS facilities — and this could slow things down. (Lest we forget: Non-renewable energy production is not free from fire risk, as residents of Martinez, California, can attest.)

The saddest thing is that BESS fires like Vistra’s are entirely preventable. It all comes down to how batteries are made.

Understanding batteries

I don’t want to minimize this catastrophic fire, but let’s be clear: Lithium-ion batteries are incredibly safe. There are literally billions of them in use every day around the world, functioning reliably and without incident. But changing the way they are manufactured will make them even safer and virtually eliminate the possibility of fires.

Lithium batteries need no air to burn. Above a certain temperature, a battery fire is self-sustaining — it can’t be “choked off” with traditional firefighting techniques. It would probably burn on the moon! All firefighters can safely do is wait for it to burn out and keep it from spreading.

As with nearly all lithium-ion batteries, BESS batteries are made of thin layers of anode and cathode materials interdigitated together and encased in aluminum and copper. A small manufacturing flaw in one cell may cause an internal short that produces heat. And due to the design of the layers and the mixed metal conductors, all the cell’s energy discharges within seconds. Those failures are catastrophic. It gets so hot, so fast, that it ignites nearby batteries, and eventually everything around them, burning so intensely that fire suppression systems can’t stop it. There are some approaches to mitigate this risk, like using lower energy LFP batteries. But even with those, a short still causes failure and can generate enough heat for fire.

There is a way to avoid these fire risks altogether.

Lithium-ion battery cells made with composite conductive materials — or polymeric current collectors, PCC — are built with a different architecture. When there is a short, they continue to function. Energy eventually dissipates, but it happens gradually over the course of hours. There is no catastrophic heat production, ignition, or “thermal event” (fire).

If a PCC battery fails, it’s a warranty issue. No one needs to call the fire department.

Making safer batteries

A PCC cell is a series-connected battery, not a parallel-connected or interdigitated battery like those now used in BESS facilities. It’s still made layer by layer, but the layers are connected directly, one on top of the other, and current moves from one layer to the next over the entire surface of each layer. There’s no need for aluminum or copper. Instead, a thin conductive polymer film loaded with a little bit of carbon is used, and current flows vertically up a chain of sealed layers. It cannot produce fire.

This is not a “new” lithium-ion battery architecture. Plenty of people are familiar with it and companies as formidable as Apple have explored it for safer batteries. But one of the reasons they and others could never move forward with PCC batteries is that there was no way to mass produce them.

In standard battery manufacturing, all the cell layers are interleaved together, the electrolyte floods over them, and everything is packaged with a single seal. Worldwide, this “wet process” is how lithium-ion batteries have been made for over 30 years!

To build a PCC battery, every single layer within it functions as its own individually sealed battery — you can’t flood the whole thing with an electrolyte because that would short out the battery. It won’t catch fire, but it also won’t work. You could construct the individual cells “by hand” separate from the standard fabrication process, but then you would be manufacturing a battery exponentially more expensive than everything else on the market — and no one is going to pay that much for a battery no matter how safe it is.

But upgrading the standard equipment in existing battery manufacturing plants lets you use a multimaterial “dry process” to produce batteries with a sealing material right around every layer individually. Dry electrode technology makes PCC batteries imminently feasible. And to make a long story short: Yes, we now have that technology; Yes, we have systems capable of mass production; No, it won’t increase the cost of making the battery — if anything, it should make it cheaper.

And, of course, they don’t catch fire.

The Vistra fire represents a safety issue that only exists because 20th century manufacturing equipment doesn’t produce 21st century batteries.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/pycAa1JlVFECWjLtiGpQgrRrE7d4d8NnxV76w85zOkw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xOTI2MjI3OTQ4XzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-05-27 18:08:54.012072

3D printing material is also lightweight, but it provides all the strength and support of metal fabrication.”","As a country, India is famous for the early adoption of technology and is home to revolutions in programming and green tech. India has a history of working toward greener transportation solutions through forward-thinking policies and programs at the state level. As India accelerates towards electric vehicle adoption, the need for environmentally responsible battery solutions has become urgent. Enter identical twin sisters Nishita and Nikita Baliarsingh, founders of Nexus Power, a startup that’s taking on the problem of sustainable battery manufacturing.

The duo first became interested in quantitative sustainability metrics like ESG matrix frameworks while studying at university. They were looking for ways to reverse environmental problems from industrialization and human activity in general, and a confluence of events put them on the path of creating an exciting new battery technology.

The first of these events was an auto show in Delhi, where Nikita Baliarsingh says they realized how many electrical components of modern cars end up as e-waste. They decided to focus on one of the most damaging and wasteful elements in the process: batteries. “We started doing research in materials which are electrochemically charged and can therefore work as batteries, but aren’t as harmful as lithium,” Baliarsingh says.

The breakthrough came from a line in a research paper, suggesting certain proteins could serve as effective battery electrolytes. Their first efforts were homemade, built during COVID lockdowns out of chickpeas and kidney beans, producing outputs of up to five volts—an impressive result from something “so raw and so basic and so abundantly available in Indian households,” Baliarsingh says. “We collected some crop residue, extracted our proteins out of it and then made a new generation of batteries very successfully.”

What began as a curiosity evolved into a scalable solution. At the time, news reports began focusing on deteriorating air quality due to the widescale practice of burning crop stubble on farms. When crops are harvested, plants are almost always cut off low to the ground rather than uprooted entirely. This leaves fields full of cut-off vegetation (stubble) that needs to be cleared before the next planting, and burning is one of the most common methods used across the developing world.

But in the most populous country on Earth, crop stubble means one thing to Nexus Power: a virtually endless source of raw material. “As far as our calculations go, it’s something that’s never going to be out of stock,” Baliarsingh says. India’s vast crop stubble could be converted into high-performance battery materials. This not only reduces harmful emissions but also creates a sustainable input loop.

If agricultural waste can be used to produce biomaterials for batteries, it’s possible to save millions of tons from being burnt, funneling it instead into a new sustainable product cycle. This process is also transportable—research or production units can be set up wherever the protein-rich raw input is available, which is almost everywhere.

More importantly, it doesn’t change the way batteries are made. “The layering and crimping is the same. We synthesize the proteins and then build the entire anode and cathode slurry. That slurry then goes into existing machines or equipment and it’s fabricated using the normal process. Everything else remains the same,” Baliarsingh says.

Being able to transpose protein-based inputs into existing or entrenched battery manufacturing infrastructure is crucial for environmental and business sustainability—businesses are unwilling to spend large sums to completely retool a manufacturing process, nor would consumers pay orders of magnitude more for the resulting batteries.

The Baliarsingh sisters also relied on the ability to use existing infrastructure to help them craft a compelling business case for partners. “Being a startup, you don’t have a lot of funds to set up new manufacturing units,” Baliarsingh says. “So we had to adjust to the available infrastructure.”

In addition to being made from waste materials, Nexus Power’s batteries are completely biodegradable: when the cathode/anode/mixture structure is out of charge, it’s still essentially just old leaf and plant matter. Once separated from the plastic casing or metal wiring, it can simply be thrown in the compost.

Baliarsingh adds that Nexus Power’s batteries are performing better than the lead-acid, lithium ion, or even alternative chemistries that are becoming more widespread. Because the energy density of the agricultural slurry is higher, she says it performs up to 25% better than comparably sized batteries of other types—and at a lower price, thanks to the plentiful and inexpensive input material.

Though Nexus Power has the means to lead the field on performance and cost, the Baliarsinghs believe the focus on sustainability is the biggest selling point and what makes the company unique.

With demand for electric vehicles and energy storage skyrocketing worldwide, Nexus Power has the potential to make waves globally. Many tools that have become ubiquitous in daily life contain batteries, from EVs and drones to laptops, phones, and other consumer electronics. Even power system grid storage runs on them. “EVs are sunrise industries,” Baliarsingh says, “so changing components or elements in these industries is easier to do through trials and tests.”

Nexus Power received initial support from KIIT-Technology Business Incubator (KIIT-TBI), a non-profit incubator at KIIT University in Odisha that has helped over 450 startups in electronics, AR/VR, biotechnology, and medical technology. “The TBI believed in our idea early on and supports young women entrepreneurs like us with the right infrastructure,” Baliarsingh says. KIIT-TBI facilitated government grants for Nexus and provided material synthesis machines, electrochemical testing, and 3D modeling and printing access.

After several years of research and development funded by grants from the government of India and equity investors, Nexus Power is now preparing for a commercial rollout within a year. The company is running large-scale trials to align its technology and product roadmap with the target Mobility and Stationery markets. The results of these trials will inform a pilot manufacturing plant with a capacity of approximately 100 MWh to support broader test deployment in EVs, drones, battery energy storage systems (BESS), and uninterruptible power supply (UPS) applications. Over six months, Nexus will conduct rigorous testing and begin certifications, aiming to scale production to 1 GWh within 10–12 months.

“We’re trying to build the thesis and the market’s conviction about the product,” Baliarsingh says. “It’s going to be a transition from available infrastructure to batteries with a different chemistry, so the plan is to have enough pedigree to make sure buyers are readily available and open to accepting the change.”

Autodesk has been a critical partner for the company throughout its growth. Nexus Power has used Autodesk Fusion and AutoCAD software to create detailed battery designs, run simulation tests, and create prototypes. “We 3D printed all our initial prototypes, a workflow that was managed through Fusion,” Baliarsingh says. Fusion’s integration of CAD and CAM made it possible to develop designs, test layering options, and prepare files for printing in one software environment. “Using 3D printing really informed all the layers and cuts of our designs. The software became our most trusted tool in designing an entire battery pack.”

The Nexus Power team opted to 3D print the prototypes for three reasons. First, the cell types and shapes they wanted to use for initial testing weren’t available, and they didn’t have access to the traditional machine milling needed to fabricate them. Second, the non-profit incubator KIIT-TBI had a 3D printer workflow set up and available for the company’s use.

Last was the speed and agility. “3D printing helps build multiple prototypes really fast,” Baliarsingh says. “It took us maybe two or three days to build one entire battery pack—if we had to use metal fabrication, it would take a lot longer. 3D printing material is also lightweight, but it provides all the strength and support of metal fabrication.”",https://images.ctfassets.net/v7wr16nrr0mz/5RL1OIFrENrSPpCTJpzlTd/0d515fefe22a75c3b254cb65bdc423b6/nexus-power-sustainable-battery-manufacturing-banner-1920x1080.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 17:09:12.236346

The executive orders aim to quadruple nuclear electricity production by 2050 by enhancing domestic nuclear fuel production, revamping and streamlining the regulatory process for new reactor approvals and restarting shuttered ones, establishing a pilot program for advanced reactors, and authorizing the construction of nuclear reactors on federal lands.

This Lawflash offers a high-level overview, summarizing the core provisions within each of the four executive orders and highlighting their primary aims and key directives.

REINVIGORATING THE NUCLEAR INDUSTRIAL BASE

The first executive order (EO) addresses the critical need for a reliable and secure domestic supply of nuclear fuel. By leveraging Section 708 of the Defense Production Act, the EO seeks to reduce dependence on foreign sources of enriched uranium and strengthen national security through a robust domestic nuclear fuel infrastructure.

Section 3 of the EO directs, among other actions, the following actions from the US Department of Energy (DOE) to bolster the domestic nuclear fuel cycle:

Within 240 days (January 18, 2026), the DOE secretary must submit a report recommending a national policy for managing spent nuclear fuel and for developing advanced fuel cycle capabilities, including reprocessing/recycling of spent nuclear fuel.

Within 120 days (September 20, 2025), the secretary, in consultation with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), must develop a plan to expand domestic uranium conversion and enrichment capabilities.

The secretary must prioritize contracting for fuel fabrication facilities that can supply fuel for test/pilot program reactors within three years of such applications. The secretary can also seek voluntary agreements with domestic nuclear companies for the cooperative procurement of low-enriched uranium (LEU) and high assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU).

Section 4 directs actions for funding of advanced nuclear technologies:

Federal loans and loan guarantees will prioritize projects that support nuclear energy, including restarting closed nuclear plants, increasing the power output of existing plants, and completing construction of nuclear reactors whose development was previously suspended.

Within 180 days (November 19, 2025), the secretary, in coordination with the Small Business Administration, must prioritize funding (grants, loans, investment capital, and other federal support) for advanced nuclear technologies, subject to the availability of appropriations.

DOE will facilitate five gigawatts of power uprates at existing nuclear reactors and aim for 10 new large reactors with complete designs under construction by 2030.

Section 5 aims to expand the workforce by directing the secretaries of the US Departments of Labor and Education to increase participation in nuclear energy-related Registered Apprenticeships and Career and Technical Education programs within 120 days (September 20, 2025). Also within 120 days, all executive departments and agencies that provide education grants shall consider nuclear engineering and nuclear energy-related careers as a priority for investment.

REFORMING THE NRC

The second EO aims to restructure and reform the NRC to accelerate the licensing and deployment of advanced nuclear reactors.

Section 3 reinforces the mission statement update in Section 501 of the Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy Act of 2024 (ADVANCE Act) by requiring the NRC to also “consider the benefits of increased availability of, and innovation in, nuclear power to economic and national security” in licensing actions, along with safety, health, and the environment.

Section 4 directs the NRC, in consultation with the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and OMB, to reorganize its structure to expedite processing of license applications. The order also calls for reductions in force, but recognizes that some functions, including new reactor licensing, may increase in size to support the reactor licensing initiative. The EO also directs that the personnel and functions of the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) be reduced to the minimum necessary to fulfill statutory obligations, narrowing the scope of ACRS to issues that are “truly novel or noteworthy.”

Section 5 outlines directives to revise and modernize NRC’s licensing regulations. The EO directs the NRC to “undertake a wholesale revision of its regulations and guidance documents” and issue notice(s) of proposed rulemaking within nine months and final rules and guidance within 18 months. The revision must establish mandatory fixed deadlines for licensing decisions, which will be enforced by fixed caps on NRC’s recovery of hourly fees. The deadlines include: (1) no more than 18 months for a final decision on an application to construct and operate a new reactor of any type and (2) no more than one year for applications to continue a renewed license for an existing reactor. These deadlines are not designed to be tolled except for applicant failure.

The EO also directs the NRC to reconsider reliance on the linear no-threshold (LNT) model for radiation exposure and the “as low as reasonably achievable” standard and instead consider adopting determinate radiation limits in consultation with DOE, the US Department of Defense (DOD), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Other provisions of section 5 include revising regulations governing National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance, establishing processes for high-volume licensing of microreactors and modular reactors with standardized approvals and potential general licenses and setting stringent thresholds for demanding design changes during construction. Furthermore, it mandates revising the Reactor Oversight Process and reactor security rules, adopting data-backed thresholds for safety assessments, reconsidering and potentially extending renewed license periods, and streamlining the public hearing process.

MODERNIZING DOE REACTOR TESTING

The third EO focuses on enhancing DOE’s capabilities and processes for testing nuclear reactors.

Section 3 sets the stage by finding that the advanced reactors overseen by DOE should include research as well as demonstrating the suitability for commercial application of a reactor.

Section 4 directs reforms to the reactor testing processes within DOE’s National Laboratories. Within 60 days (July 22, 2025), the secretary shall issue guidance regarding what counts as a qualified test reactor for purposes of the EO and help ensure expeditious processing of a qualified test reactor application. Within 90 days (August 21, 2025), the secretary shall take steps to revise the regulations, guidance, and procedures to “significantly expedite the review, approval, and deployment of advanced reactors under [DOE’s] jurisdiction.”

Section 5 directs the secretary to establish a pilot program outside the National Laboratories, but still under sufficient DOE control, to construct and operate at least three test reactors, with the goal of achieving criticality by July 4, 2026.

Section 6 addresses streamlining environmental reviews by directing the secretary, in consultation with the chair of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), to begin reforming DOE’s NEPA compliance regulations by June 30, 2025, consistent with EO 14154, Unleashing American Energy. This includes exploring the use of existing statutory authorities, such as categorical exclusions, to eliminate or expedite DOE’s environmental reviews for certain activities, including authorizations, permits, approvals, and leases.

DEPLOYING ADVANCED NUCLEAR REACTOR TECHNOLOGIES FOR NATIONAL SECURITY

The fourth EO focuses on leveraging advanced nuclear reactor technologies for various national security objectives, including for artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and other national security installations.

Section 3 directs the DOD secretary, through the secretary of the US Army, to establish a program for using nuclear energy for installation and operational needs and begin operating an Army-regulated nuclear reactor at a domestic military base or installation by September 30, 2028. Additionally, within 240 days (January 18, 2026), the DOD secretary, collaborating with the DOE secretary, OMB director, and secretaries of the military departments, must submit legislative and regulatory recommendations concerning advanced nuclear reactors and spent fuel at military installations.

Section 4 directs the DOE secretary to designate AI data centers located at or operated with DOE facilities as critical defense facilities. The necessary electrical infrastructure, nuclear and non-nuclear, shall be deemed defense critical electric infrastructure. The DOE secretary shall also designate one or more DOE-owned or controlled sites for advanced nuclear reactor deployment within 90 days (August 21, 2025) and use all existing authorities to approve privately funded reactors at such sites for AI infrastructure and other critical, national security, or supply chain needs.

Section 5 directs the DOE secretary, within 90 days (August 21, 2025), to identify all DOE-owned uranium and plutonium suitable for recycling or fuel use in US reactors. At least 20 metric tons of HALEU shall be made available from DOE stockpiles for authorized private-sector projects on DOE-controlled sites supporting AI and other infrastructure, while preserving reserves for national security needs, including tritium production, naval propulsion, and nuclear weapons. The DOE secretary shall also ensure a long-term domestic supply of enriched uranium. The DOE and DOD secretaries shall use all existing authorities to site and approve privately funded nuclear fuel facilities at DOE and/or DOD-controlled sites for national security, commercial, and research reactor use.

Section 6 directs the DOE and DOD secretaries to use their respective authorities to enter into contracts or agreements to support implementing this EO, including DOE technical support at DOD sites for all phases of advanced reactor development and deployment.

Section 7 directs the DOD and DOE secretaries to leverage existing and new NEPA categorical exclusions, use expedited permitting processes, and develop alternative compliance measures for the construction of advanced nuclear reactor technologies on federal sites.

Section 8 focuses on increasing nuclear exports. It directs the Secretary of State to negotiate at least 20 new agreements by January 3, 2029, for peaceful nuclear cooperation with other countries under Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, and to renegotiate agreements set to expire within the next decade. The DOE secretary also shall expeditiously review and decide on export authorization requests within 30 days of receipt of a complete application and DOE analysis, although the timeline does not include interagency reviews or the time it takes to request and receive foreign government nonproliferation and retransfer assurances.

Although the EO does not mention these export regulations by name, they are clearly those required for export of non-public, unclassified nuclear reactor and fuel cycle technology under 10 CFR Part 810. Within 90 days (August 21, 2025), the federal government will develop strategies to expand financing for US nuclear projects and trade and provide financial and technical support to promote the global adoption of nuclear energy. Finally, Section 8 instructs the secretary of state, within 90 days (August 21, 2025), to implement a program aimed at boosting the global competitiveness of US nuclear companies by expediting agreements and reducing barriers to US exports.

Section 9 of the order directs the DOD secretary to prioritize the issuance of the appropriate clearances to support the rapid distribution and use of nuclear energy and fuel cycle technologies.

CONCLUSION

The four EOs mark a strategic push to revitalize the US nuclear energy industry, consistent with President Donald Trump’s Unleashing American Energy EO (summarized here) to prioritize domestic energy dominance and security. The directives signal a clear expectation for federal agencies to reform their operations, modernize regulations, and accelerate both civilian and national security nuclear deployment.

He's also been spending more than his share of time in Washington, D.C., where he heads the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, an organization within President Trump's administration focused on cost cuts.

Musk's busy schedule has earned him equal praise and criticism from fans and foes.

His supporters applaud his seemingly golden touch in building companies, while detractors say his lack of focus has contributed to failed Tesla model launches, declining sales, and X service disruptions.

The matter has come to a particular head this year as Musk's political activism has accelerated. He spent hundreds of millions of dollars supporting President Trump's election in 2024, and his role at DOGE has arguably turned off many once-loyal Tesla customers.

The impact has taken Tesla's stock on a wild ride. Shares rallied after President Trump's election on hopes that he would leverage his close relationship to benefit Tesla, only to fall sharply earlier this year when it became clear that Tesla wouldn't sidestep Trump's tariff policy, and sales had dropped because of DOGE.

Tesla's stock price has performed much better since Musk said on Tesla's earnings conference call that he would refocus energy on the company. His latest message to investors is similarly sending shares soaring today.

Tesla's big advantage fades

Tesla's (TSLA) became a major success because Elon Musk decided early on to focus the car company on the performance of its electric vehicles rather than solely on their environmentally friendly nature.

As a result, Tesla's cars competed with and often outperformed luxury rivals like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Porsche. Celebrities and speed enthusiasts coveted Tesla's aspirational vehicles, leaving competitors like Ford, General Motors, and others in the dust.

The high-performance moat, however, has largely disappeared.

Almost every car company, including Detroit's Big Three, has spent heavily to build and market high-end EVs. These competing vehicles often deliver similar performance and possibly better fit-and-finish than Tesla.

As a result, Tesla's electric vehicle market share has slipped, and this year, this problem worsened due to Musk's often polarizing political positions, particularly in key markets like Europe and California.

Tesla's sales in Europe dropped 49% year-over-year in April to 7,261 vehicles, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Meanwhile, total EV sales in the region rose 34%. So far, Tesla's Europe unit volume is down nearly 40% through the first four months of this year.

The trends are similar in California, where Tesla registrations fell 21.5% year-over-year in the first quarter. Non-Tesla electric vehicle (EV) registrations were up 14%.

Overall, Tesla sold 9% fewer EVs in the first quarter in the U.S. than last year. Meanwhile, Ford and General Motors' EV sales have surged. In Q1, Ford saw its EV sales climb 11.5%. GM's Cadillac, GMC, and Chevrolet saw EV sales increase by 37%, 184%, and 114%.

Elon Musk promises more time at Tesla

Musk appears to have heard his shareholders' complaints loud and clear.

""There's been some blowback for the time that I've been spending in government with the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE,"" said Musk on Tesla's Q1 conference call on April 22. ""I think starting probably next month, May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly... I'll be allocating probably more of my time to Tesla and now that the major work of establishing the Department of Government Efficiency is done.""

The reassuring words have sent Tesla shares rocketing 38% since. Yet, worries that Musk is distracted have persisted, including in the wake of a recent increase in outages at X, and amid renewed tariff debate last week following President Trump's threat to place a 50% tariff on the EU.

Over the weekend, the concerns prompted Musk to reiterate his commitment to his businesses, including Tesla.

""Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms,"" wrote Musk in a post on X on May 24. ""I must be super focused on X/Xai and Tesla (plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out.""

The words emboldened investors yet again, given Tesla's key programs underway, including its much-hyped autonomous driving robotaxi program. Musk has promised that full-self-driving vehicles will be on the road in Austin in June.

""Not only is FSD Supervised safer than a human driver, but it is also improving the lives of individuals who experience it,"" said Musk in April.

Trump reignited the ""drill, baby, drill"" mantra during his 2024 campaign, declaring a national energy emergency and rolling back environmental regulations to boost U.S. oil and gas production.

Musk is a close ally of the president, with the billionaire Tesla owner spearheading efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to reduce government spending.

What To Know

Musk's post featured a clip from the DER Task Force podcast, which included an interview with Jesse Peltan, co-founder and CTO of HODL Ranch, a developer of Bitcoin mining projects in Texas.

""China's still growing exponentially on their solar deployments,"" Peltan said in the clip.

""The targets for what their solar and battery manufacturing capacity...what that could do, if you take two terawatts of solar, and about eight terawatt-hours of storage, that's an entire U.S. worth of electricity generation.""

""That's 4,000 terawatt-hours a year of 24/7 solar power. They're going to be able to make that every single year...by like 2030,"" Peltan added.

Upon reentering office, Trump signed executive orders to expand fossil fuel development, including lifting a pause on liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports and withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement.

""We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it,"" Trump said in his inaugural address.

The administration's policies led to the cancellation, closing, or downsizing of $8 billion worth of clean energy projects in the first quarter of 2025, according to a study by the nonpartisan group E2 published in April.

Trump has also urged U.S. allies to increase oil extraction and reduce their reliance on green energy. He urged British Prime Minister Keir Starmer last week to abandon its ""costly and unsightly windmills"" in favor of increased oil drilling in the North Sea.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump claimed that tapping into the North Sea's oil reserves could significantly reduce Britain's energy costs, suggesting Aberdeen as a central hub for drilling operations.

""Our negotiated deal with the United Kingdom is working out well for all. I strongly recommend to them, however, that in order to get their energy costs down, they stop with the costly and unsightly windmills, and incentivize modernized drilling in the North Sea, where large amounts of oil lay waiting to be taken. A century of drilling left, with Aberdeen as the hub,"" he wrote.

""The old fashioned tax system disincentivizes drilling, rather than the opposite. U.K.'s Energy Costs would go WAY DOWN, and fast!""

What People Are Saying

President Donald Trump, in his inaugural address: ""America will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have—the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth—and we are going to use it. We'll use it.""

At its height, Kentucky commanded approximately 20% of the United States’ computing power dedicated to Bitcoin mining, with facilities rapidly establishing themselves across the region, often repurposing abandoned coal mines in the process.

THE CRYPTOCURRENCY COLLAPSE

According to a recent WIRED investigation, what began as a heralded economic savior for the region in 2021 has now largely dissipated. Many Bitcoin mining operations have either shut down completely or significantly scaled back their activities, creating yet another economic void in an area that has historically struggled with sustainable development.

Anna Whites, a lawyer who provided legal representation for several cryptocurrency mining ventures in the state, observed that many operations suffered from fundamentally unsustainable business models. The pattern became familiar: companies would quickly establish operations, lease property, and then abruptly cease activities, leaving behind a trail of unpaid obligations and unfulfilled promises to local communities.

A CASE STUDY IN BROKEN PROMISES

One operation that initially appeared to buck this trend was Mohawk Energy, co-founded by Kentucky State Senator Brandon Smith. In 2022, Mohawk acquired a substantial 41,000-square-foot facility in Jenkins, Kentucky, much of which was leased to a Chinese cryptocurrency mining firm. The venture had ambitious goals beyond just mining Bitcoin; it aimed to provide training for former coal miners and veterans in electronics repair and maintenance of Bitcoin mining equipment.

The early signs were promising, with twenty-eight families securing stable employment through the operation and additional jobs created in the surrounding area. However, within just 18 months, the partnership deteriorated rapidly. As reported by Lexington News, the Chinese partner initiated legal action against Mohawk alleging contract violations, which Mohawk countered with litigation of its own. The promised profits that were intended to fund local training programs never materialized, and many workers lost their newly acquired jobs.

SHIFTING TO AI: THE NEXT DIGITAL FRONTIER

As the Bitcoin mining dream crumbles, attention in Kentucky is pivoting toward a potentially more sustainable digital infrastructure: data centers dedicated to artificial intelligence. These facilities are crucial for powering sophisticated AI applications like Siri and ChatGPT, utilizing enormous computing capabilities for machine learning and data processing.

Wes Hamilton, a local entrepreneur with experience in the mining sector, sees AI technologies as offering more solid and enduring opportunities compared to the volatility of Bitcoin mining. This perspective aligns with recent actions by Kentucky’s state government, which in March 2025 enacted the “Bitcoin Rights Act,” establishing the right to use digital assets while creating a regulatory environment conducive to various forms of digital economy, including AI-focused data centers.

CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM AMID LINGERING CONCERNS

Despite the enthusiasm from certain quarters about this technological pivot, many Kentucky residents remain cautious and skeptical. Nina McCoy, a Kentucky citizen cited by Cryptonomist, expresses concern about potential ecological problems similar to those caused by previous extractive industries, such as water pollution resulting from coal waste spills.

For McCoy and others like her, there’s apprehension that new AI data centers might replicate familiar patterns of environmental and social exploitation, particularly given their substantial energy requirements and water needs for cooling advanced technological infrastructure. This cautious stance reflects a broader wariness born from historical experiences with boom-and-bust economic cycles in the region.

THE LESSONS OF ECONOMIC TRANSITION

Kentucky’s experience with cryptocurrency mining may serve as a cautionary tale for other regions pursuing similar operations as economic development strategies without adequately accounting for their inherent instability. As reported by GetCoai, the cryptocurrency mining retreat in Kentucky mirrors historical boom-bust cycles in Appalachian communities, raising fundamental questions about sustainable economic development in regions transitioning away from traditional industries.

The swift rise and subsequent decline of Kentucky’s Bitcoin mining sector highlights the challenges of building sustainable economic alternatives in regions historically dependent on resource extraction. Whether AI data centers represent a more stable path forward remains to be seen, but the lessons from the Bitcoin mining experience suggest that careful planning, robust regulatory frameworks, and attention to environmental impacts will be essential for any technology-based economic development strategy in the region.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/xai-tmp-imgen-437dd117-80fc-4c5a-805c-19f5d1db449a.jpeg,N,,2025-05-27 17:10:10.071567

Utilities, transit agencies, and private companies will be eligible to generate clean fuel credits by supplying electricity as transportation fuel.
The Clean Fuel Standard complements New York’s broader climate strategy without raising fuel taxes or imposing burdensome mandates on consumers.","Albany, NY – New York State Senator Pete Harckham and Assemblymember Carrie Woerner, along with leaders from environmental and agricultural groups, labor and the Clean Fuels coalition, urged support for the Clean Fuel Standard Act of 2025 (CFS) at a press conference today held at the State Capitol.

The Clean Fuel Standard Act of 2025 (S.1343A / A.472), which was introduced by State Sen. Kevin S. Parker and Asm. Woerner, will reduce on-road transportation sector greenhouse gas emissions, accelerate New York’s shift to clean energy, and help build a more affordable and equitable future for all New Yorkers. The legislation will not only reduce emissions and support working families but will also serve as a key driver of New York’s electric vehicle (EV) transition by incentivizing investments in EV charging infrastructure.

“The importance of advancing a Clean Fuel Standard in New York rests on our commitment to improving air quality and decreasing fossil fuel pollutants at a time when the federal government is stepping back from its role in overseeing environmental protections—so it really is up to us,” said Sen. Harckham. “The fact that we will be creating thousands of new good paying jobs each year while moving to low-carbon fuels and growing our renewable energy sector makes the argument for enacting this legislation even stronger.”

“As other states and Canada have demonstrated, adopting a Clean Fuel Standard can have a marked and immediate impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation,” said Asm Woerner. “Further, California has shown that zero emission vehicles and the infrastructure to support them have grown in adoption over the years that a Clean Fuel Standard has been in place. This is a practical and proven tool that could and should be in New York’s decarbonization toolbox. I am happy to join Senators Harckham and Parker, along with the League of Conservation Voters and others in calling for passage of the Clean Fuel Standard Act of 2025, so that New York can accelerate the decarbonization of its transportation sector.”

“We’re here to send a clear message: the Clean Fuel Standard is essential to building a more affordable New York,” said Sen. Parker. “By diversifying our transportation fuel mix and supporting cleaner, locally produced alternatives, we can stabilize energy costs, protect public health, and create quality jobs in the clean energy economy. The Clean Fuel Standard is a practical, proven strategy for cutting emissions while promoting innovation. It supports local industries, attracts private investment, and reduces our dependence on fossil fuels without burdening taxpayers.”

Assemblymember Chris Burdick said, “With the transportation sector being a leading contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, it is crucial to reduce toxic diesel emissions from medium- and heavy-duty vehicles by lowering their carbon intensity. This long-range plan will provide ample time for compliance and help New York meet its commitments under the 15-state action plan to cut these emissions. Now more than ever, New York must do its part to combat the climate crisis and protect our environment.”

The Clean Fuel Standard Act of 2025 will require fuel providers to reduce the carbon intensity of their transportation fuels by at least 20% by 2030. This would create a performance-based credit market that rewards the use of lower-carbon fuels like electricity and renewable biofuels while penalizing high-emission fuels.

With transportation accounting for the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions in New York, the CFS offers a cost-effective strategy to meet the goals of the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) and drive innovation across the state’s transportation sector.

Critically, the CFS will create new revenue streams and market incentives to expand New York’s electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Utilities, transit agencies, and private companies will be eligible to generate clean fuel credits by supplying electricity as transportation fuel. Those credits can then be reinvested in building out EV charging stations, modernizing grid infrastructure, and supporting clean fleet upgrades across the state.

At least 40% of credit value from utilities or government entities under the CFS must be reinvested in disadvantaged communities, those most impacted by vehicle pollution and environmental neglect. This ensures the clean energy transition benefits everyone, not just those who can already afford EVs or live in well-resourced areas.

If passed, New York will join California, Oregon, and Washington with successful clean fuel programs that have reduced emissions, supported innovation, and driven billions in private clean energy investment. The Clean Fuel Standard complements New York’s broader climate strategy without raising fuel taxes or imposing burdensome mandates on consumers.

Julie Tighe, President of the New York League of Conservation Voters, said, “A Clean Fuel Standard would cut greenhouse gas emissions and deliver much-needed relief to communities suffering from toxic diesel pollution on Day One, and it will also accelerate our transition to electric vehicles, which is critical at a time when federal clean car standards are under attack. This is exactly the kind of bold action we need to fight climate change, protect public health, and drive forward a zero-emissions future. We urge the State Senate and Assembly to pass this measure before the end of session so all New Yorkers can breathe a little easier.”

Stephen Dodge, Director of State Regulatory Affairs, Clean Fuels Alliance America, said, “New York has a critical opportunity to lead on climate by adopting a Clean Fuels Standard that supports low-carbon solutions like biodiesel and renewable diesel. California’s success shows what’s possible—these fuels now make up almost 79% of the state’s transportation diesel pool under its Low Carbon Fuel Standard, with no adverse impact on consumers. By following this proven path, New York can cut emissions, improve air quality, support local jobs, and deliver cleaner, affordable fuel options for consumers.”

Deb Peck Kelleher, Deputy Director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York (ACE NY), said, “The Clean Fuel Standard is the jumpstart legislation our state needs to help New Yorkers breathe cleaner air. It is time for New York to unleash the power of the marketplace to reduce our climate emissions and increase funding towards our electric school bus transition. This effort will improve the health outcomes for our school kids and all New Yorkers. We must take steps to reduce our reliance on foreign sources of fuels and build a domestic energy supply chain. This legislation furthers those goals.”

Matt Tomich, President, Energy Vision, said, “New York’s transportation sector is its second largest greenhouse gas emitter and a major source of toxic air pollution. Diesel truck exhaust contributes to smog and acid rain, harms health, and kills 3,000 New Yorkers annually. By far the worst offenders are thousands of heavy-duty diesel trucks built before 2013 still on our roads. A CFS would enable replacing them with cleaner fuel trucks.”

Cyn S French, Co-Founder and EVP Feedstock of LF Bioenergy, said, “A Clean Fuel Standard program is critical to opening markets for New York's agricultural and dairy economies, meeting consumer demands and farmers' needs with locally produced food and locally produced cleaner energy. Both benefit the state today with an RNG estimated value of $4.8B, providing 38,500 jobs while the dairy industry contributes $13.8B in wages, $50B in economic impact and 180,000 jobs. We put Farmers First in New York!”

Anthony Willingham, Government Affairs & Public Policy Lead – State Government for Electrify America, said, “A Clean Fuel Standard is one of the most powerful tools New York has to cut emissions, accelerate transportation electrification, and meet its climate goals. By incentivizing cleaner fuels without burdening taxpayers or drivers, it creates a sustainable funding source for clean energy investments. Amid economic and political uncertainty, passing this measure would affirm New York’s leadership in climate action and signal to the clean fuels industry—especially EV charging providers—that the state is a premier market for investment.”

Lewis Dubuque, Vice President of Chapter Management at the National Waste & Recycling Association, said, “The National Waste and Recycling Association (NWRA) supports the effort to enact the Clean Fuel Standard bill before the end of the legislative session. Such a standard will create more jobs in New York State with the production of renewable fuels while reducing emissions NWRA has supported similar bills in other states like California, where they have been enacted into law. We urge the State Legislature to pass the bill and add New York to the list of states that are working hard to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector.”

Emily Kelly, Director of US Public Policy at ChargePoint, said, “Clean Fuel Standard is an established policy that has proven to help accelerate the transition to electric mobility by establishing a reliable and self-sustaining investment signal for electric vehicle charger deployment. This policy will increase the number of chargers across the state, providing more New York drivers with access to clean and lower cost fueling options.”",https://www.nysenate.gov/sites/default/files/2025/05/27/clean-fuels-crop-5-27-25.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 19:06:47.283371

Solar panels contain silver. The solar industry used about 700 million ounces of silver in 2024. That's a scrap value of $23 billion for panels produced in one year. To say nothing of the scrap value of copper, aluminum, and tin, which is a decent revenue stream when silver is paying the cost of recycling.

Even solar glass has recycling value. Household glass is often just downcycled as concrete fill, because the value of the material is lower than the cost of transport. Solar glass is low in iron, it is significantly more transparent and more expensive, it is worth recycling. (Iron gives regular glass a green tint which is visible in thick sections, it also blocks near IR). The sticking point is that there are different types of glass in use, including some that contain antimony, which has to be kept out of recycling streams for food packaging.

Solar set a new record in Q1 2025

In EIA’s latest monthly “Electric Power Monthly” report (with data through March 31, 2025), the data confirmed that solar continues to be the fastest-growing source of electricity.

Utility-scale (>1 megawatt (MW)) solar thermal and photovoltaic expanded by 43.9% while “estimated” small-scale (rooftop) solar PV increased by 11.1% during Q1 2025 compared to Q1 2024. The combination of utility-scale and small-scale solar increased by 33.7% and was almost 6.8% of total US electrical generation for January to March, up from 5.3% a year earlier. As a consequence, solar-generated electricity surpassed the output of US hydropower plants (5.7%).

In March alone, electrical generation by utility-scale solar increased by 45.6% while that from small-scale systems rose by 13%. Combined, they provided 9.1% of US electrical output during the month.

Wind had a strong first quarter

Wind turbines across the US produced 9.5% more electricity in Q1 2025 than they did a year before.

That output was nearly one-eighth (12.2%) of total US electrical generation and more than double that produced by US hydropower plants.

In March alone, wind-generated electricity increased by 11.1% and provided 14.8% of the US electricity supply.

Wind + solar outproduced coal + nuclear

In Q1 2025, electrical generation by wind plus utility-scale and small-scale solar provided 19% of the US total, up from 17% year-over-year. In just the month of March, solar + wind accounted for 23.9% of U electrical output.

During Q1 2025, wind + solar provided 6.8% more electricity than coal and 6% more than US nuclear power plants. In March alone, the gap increased significantly when solar + wind outproduced coal and nuclear power by 66.5% and 31%, respectively.

Renewables’ electrical output is closing in on natural gas

The mix of all renewables – wind, solar, hydropower, biomass, geothermal – produced 10.5% more electricity in Q1 2025 than they did a year ago (12.5% more in March alone) and provided 26.1% of total US electricity production compared to 24.8% year-over-year.

Electrical generation by all renewables combined in March alone reached a new record and provided 31.9% of total US electrical generation. For the first time, it nipped at the heels of natural gas (34.8%), which saw a drop in electrical output of 8.9%.

For perspective, five years ago (May 2020), the mix of renewables provided 21.9% of total electrical generation while natural gas accounted for 41.9%. A decade ago (May 2015), renewables provided 15.1% of total generation while natural gas provided 30.5%; most of the balance was accounted for by coal (33.5%), and nuclear power provided 19.9%.

The renewables mix has strengthened its position as the second largest source of electrical generation, behind only natural gas, with the gap closing rapidly.

EIA forecast strong growth for renewables

The growth of solar, wind, and other renewables is consistent with several forecasts issued by EIA during the past five months.

In its “Preliminary Monthly Electric Generator Inventory” report issued in late December 2024, EIA forecast 32.5 GW of new utility-scale solar capacity to be added to the grid in 2025, along with 7.7 GW of new wind capacity and 18.2 GW of utility-scale battery storage.

Similarly, in early spring, EIA released its “Annual Energy Outlook 2025” report that explores potential longer-term US energy trends. In it, the agency foresees a nearly 50% increase in installed solar capacity during the Trump administration’s term. Moreover, electrical generation by grid-connected PV solar during that time would more than double from 201.1 billion kilowatt-hours (bKWh) to 420.1 bKWh. Onshore wind generation would rise from 153.4 bKWh to 175.4 bKWh while offshore wind could increase from 0.2 bKWh to 18.7 bKWh.

Finally, in its “Short-Term Energy Outlook” report issued in early May, EIA projected 26.3% growth in solar installations in 2025, increasing from 121 GW of installed capacity at the end of 2024 to 153 GW by the end of this year. It expects another 19.5% growth in cumulative capacity next year, reaching 182 GW by the end of 2026. During that period, actual generation would grow from 0.217 trillion kilowatt-hours (tKWh) to 0.343 tKWh. Wind would expand from 0.453 tKWh to 0.494 tKWh.

“Renewable energy sources, led by solar and wind, are clearly outpacing fossil fuels and nuclear power,” said the SUN DAY Campaign’s executive director, Ken Bossong. “It therefore defies logic that the Trump administration and the Republican Congress would be trying to curtail that growth in favor of dirtier and more expensive technologies.”

Detroit is modeling how to co-create clean energy solutions with communities by combining urban revitalization efforts with sustainability goals. The Motor City’s climate goals are ambitious: by 2034, Detroit aims to power 100% of its municipal buildings with clean energy and source 50% of its electricity from clean sources in the next three years. Along the way, the city is advancing a range of co-benefits, including improved public health, more energy efficiency and affordability, and quality jobs and opportunities.

As part of this strategy, Detroit‘s Office of Sustainability and Department of Neighborhoods are teaming up to implement the city’s Neighborhood Solar Initiative, which will build solar arrays on vacant land surrounded by communities that benefit from the repurposed space. Five neighborhoods were selected based on resident interest, and a total of 167 acres of land are being fitted with solar fields, raised gardening beds and other landscaping enhancements. Spearheaded by Mayor Mike Duggan and informed by input from thousands of Detroiters, the effort is one of the first steps to achieving the city’s larger climate goals. By providing clean energy and engaging residents and local nonprofits, Solar Neighborhoods will make new use of vacant areas and offer money-saving energy efficiency upgrades for surrounding homes.

I spoke with Tepfirah Rushdan, Detroit’s Director of Sustainability, to learn more about the city’s Solar Neighborhoods, how communities have been involved during every step of the process and her advice for other local leaders looking to build more sustainable futures for their cities.

How does the Solar Neighborhoods project fit into Detroit’s larger climate and energy strategy?

The Solar Neighborhoods project is one of several strategies the City of Detroit is employing to address climate change and the one that has the most direct resident impact. By generating enough clean energy to power 127 city municipal buildings, we can offset that amount of fossil fuel usage. Unlike other cities, which build solar hundreds of miles away, Detroit is taking mostly vacant land in its own neighborhoods and putting it back to an important use that benefits the surrounding neighborhoods specifically, and the entire city more generally.

As a city, we also are investing significantly in conversion of our vehicle fleet to fully electric, hybrid and in some cases, hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicles. As part of our Climate Strategy, we are working to reduce the carbon footprint of our own facilities and will be requiring our larger privately owned buildings to take similar steps through Energy and Water Benchmarking ordinance.

We also are proud of our partnership with American Forest and others to plant 75,000 new trees in Detroit to help rebuild our tree canopy.

Why is community input important with this project?

Simply put, community input is what has driven this project from the beginning. Mayor Mike Duggan made it clear from the outset that solar fields would be placed only in neighborhoods that actively sought the opportunity and had overwhelming support from residents living there. This is contrary to how solar projects often are sited in other cities and states against the expressed wishes of nearby residents.

Most important to us is that every one of the remaining homeowner occupants living inside the planned solar array footprint voluntarily chose to accept offers to purchase their homes and to assist with relocation to a new home.

For the few that did not wish to leave, we simply redrew the boundary of the solar array to carve them out of it. Not only did this mean they would stay in their longtime home, but this change also put them in the community benefits area of the neighborhood, entitling them to thousands of dollars of energy efficiency upgrades to their home at no cost to them.

How are you ensuring communities’ desires and concerns are properly heard? How often – and in what ways – are you involving members of the community with this project?

Through our Department of Neighborhoods and Office of Sustainability, we conducted extensive community engagement process, to make sure every resident living in each of the solar neighborhoods fully understood the proposal and their options. We held numerous community meetings and also went door-to-door to make sure we reached each resident.

Our approach was to take as much time as necessary to make sure everyone’s questions were answered so they could make the decision that was best for them, their families and their neighborhood.

How has the input from community members shaped the different solar array lots? What will the final lots look like?

Community input has played a huge role in this project. It was community feedback that set us in the direction of creating a community benefits program for homeowners living in the solar neighborhood, but outside of the actual arrays. That was one of the biggest factors for generating neighborhood-wide support for the project.

Not only did neighbors decide for themselves if a solar array made sense for their neighborhood, they also drove the process on how they will look. Residents came together to design the appearance of the grounds inside and outside of the arrays.

They chose from decorative fencing options, perennials and ornamental trees to serve as attractive visual buffers, as well as flower meadows and/or agrivoltaics inside the arrays, and the results are stunning.

These graphics show the variety of the solar fields, with communities working with the developers to select the layouts that best met their needs, down to the types of plants and fencing that will be installed.

What other benefits will communities receive from the Solar Neighborhoods project?

The most obvious benefit of the Solar Neighborhoods initiative is the blight removal and putting large tracts of vacant land that had become an attractive nuisance for illegal dumping and other undesirable activity back to an attractive, productive and purposeful use. This alone, was important to residents in these neighborhoods who often felt they had been forgotten.

The more personal benefit will be felt by owner occupied homes in each Solar Neighborhood who stayed and live just outside of the arrays. Depending on the number of acres each neighborhood is producing in solar, each homeowner occupant will receive between $15,000 and $25,000 in energy efficiency upgrades to their homes to help reduce energy usage and help lower their energy costs. These upgrades recently began in our Phase One neighborhoods, where homeowners picked from a list of upgrades including new windows or a new roof, energy efficient furnaces and water heaters, or even their own solar panels.

What advice do you have for other local officials looking to build clean energy projects in their cities or towns?

Listen to residents because they are the ones who will be living with the result. We firmly believe that Detroit’s Solar Neighborhoods project was so enthusiastically supported because we let neighbors decide whether they wanted a solar array in their neighborhood and we took the time to understand and address their concerns.",https://blogs.edf.org/climate411/wp-content/blogs.dir/7/files//54503788998_676291100d_c.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 17:09:19.739882

The 19th

This story was originally reported by Jessica Kutz of The 19th. Meet Jessica and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.

The Trump administration wants to eliminate the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), a little-known piece of the social safety net that helps low-income people pay their utility bills.

Congress created the program in 1981, initially to help people pay for heating in the winter. The program — which has had broad bipartisan support — has increasingly been used to pay for cooling as summers grow hotter and more dangerous to human health due to climate change.

At a recent budget hearing, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, called the program a “lifesaver” for residents in Alaska when questioning Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about its future.

Kennedy acknowledged the importance of the program but also said Trump’s proposal to eliminate the funding was based on the expectation of lower future energy prices. Yet according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, residential energy prices are expected to go up in much of the country at least through 2026.

Murkowski and lawmakers from across the aisle have been pressuring the administration to commit to funding the program, which provided $4.1 billion to states, territories and tribal nations in fiscal 2025. But the administration has not only called to defund the program in its entirety, but also has put the staff that administer the program at Health and Human Services (HHS) on leave.

Advocates say the end of the program could be disastrous for households who rely on other government benefits that are also under threat, like the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid, which are both facing deep cuts.

As the funding of LIHEAP continues to be debated on the national level, here’s an explanation of what the program does and who it helps:

What does the Low Income Housing Energy Assistance Program do?

LIHEAP helps about 6 million households pay their heating- and cooling-related utility bills annually and prevents disconnections through an emergency assistance fund. The payments typically go directly to the utility companies.

States tailor the program to best fit the needs of residents. For example, in places like Arizona, where extreme heat kills hundreds of people a year, a higher allocation of funding goes to cooling assistance. In some states, funds can be used to repair furnaces or air conditioning units.

States are required to account for both a household’s income and its energy burden, or the percentage of a family’s income that goes to pay utility bills, to target those most at risk for utility disconnections.

Low-income households typically have higher energy burdens, often due to homes with poor insulation or drafty windows and doors.

Who does it help?

The LIHEAP program targets households with family members who are particularly vulnerable to extreme temperatures. In fiscal 2023, the program reached 2.1 million households where a resident had a disability; nearly 1 million households that had small children; and 2.4 million households that housed an elderly person.

Both children and the elderly are more sensitive to extreme temperatures because they are physiologically less able to regulate their body temperature. People with complex medical needs also shoulder higher energy costs, due to electricity-dependent medical equipment.

Single parents, who are disproportionately women, are more likely to be energy insecure, as are rural residents, Black, Indigenous and Latinx households.

And the people who utilize the program are usually on the brink of an emergency — either already disconnected from their utility or on the verge of it. “By the time they’re reaching out for help, it’s that their situation has escalated,” said Diana Hernandez, an associate professor and sociologist at Columbia University who studies energy insecurity.

Only about 17 percent of eligible households receive LIHEAP assistance, said Hernandez, who has been pushing to increase funding for the program.

“The money always runs out,” she said.

Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, an organization that works with state officials to implement LIHEAP, said electricity costs are going up at a higher rate than inflation and that rising temperatures are also leading to a greater need for cooling.

“In Southwestern states the length of the [heat waves are] getting longer,” Wolfe said. “The bills are going up, and a lot of housing is just poorly built … so the costs are going up faster than expected,” he said.

Why is it important?

LIHEAP has multiple benefits that all center on keeping people safe and healthy in their homes, advocates say.

While in many states residents have some protection from a utility disconnecting their electricity, without energy assistance programs like LIHEAP more households would likely keep their homes at dangerous temperatures to keep their bills down.

In a Census Household Pulse Survey from 2024, nearly 23 percent of households reported keeping their homes at unsafe temperatures over the previous 12 months due to rising energy costs.

But doing so is risky in places like Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located. While there is a moratorium on electricity shutoffs during the summer, in 2024, 138 people died indoors of a heat-related cause, with 18 percent of those deaths in a home where the AC was functioning but not turned on. Seventy percent did not have a working AC unit in a place where average summer temperatures are over 100 degrees.

These deaths occurred in a state where over 20,000 households received LIHEAP assistance in fiscal 2023, according to the National Energy Utility Affordability Coalition, which tracks state use of funds.

Without the program, “we’ll be having more and more of these unnecessary deaths,” Wolfe said.

Helping to pay energy bills has also been shown to help keep families more food secure. According to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 20 percent of U.S. households said they skipped meals and medicines to pay for electricity bills in 2020, a time when households were under additional stress due to the pandemic. And in a 2019 survey of LIHEAP recipients, 36 percent said that before they began to receive energy assistance, they went without food for at least a day to pay utility bills.

It’s called the “heat or eat” phenomenon.

“Just because the bill gets paid, people should not assume that that’s not at great cost,” said Olivia Wein, senior attorney with the National Consumer Law Center. But with multiple social welfare programs facing deep cuts, “it’s going to be harder and harder for people to do that, to juggle enough to get the bills paid on time,” she said.

Wein points out that people’s housing security could also be impacted. Maintaining a utility connection is a condition on many housing leases, and without LIHEAP, more people could face evictions, Wein fears.

She’s also worried children could be taken from their parents. “Not having heat in the winter could result in Child Protective Services getting involved because your home is not habitable,” she said. “So there are all of these ripple effects from unaffordable energy that we will unfortunately see on the grand scale without a strong LIHEAP program.”

Where does the program stand now?

For fiscal 2025, all of the program’s funding has already been released, so residents won’t see an impact until fiscal 2026, which starts in September. But even if the program is funded, Wein says there will be issues with disbursement because of the federal layoffs.

While each state develops individual programs, they still have to run their plans by the federal agency every year to determine state allocations, Wein said. This plan is also accompanied by a complicated formula that happens each time funding is released. Right now only four people are managing the LIHEAP program on the federal level; after the entire office was laid off in April. Wein predicts this will delay funding being sent to the states.

HHS did not respond to a request for comment by press time.

Additionally, community action agencies, places around the country where people go to apply for benefits like LIHEAP, could be shut down, due to a separate move to defund the Community Services Block Grant. This would make it harder for residents to apply to the program. “We need that funding as part of our whole ecosystem,” Wein said.

Trump also sought to zero out LIHEAP funding in his first term, but Congress ultimately is in charge of approving a budget. But Wein said the precarity of the program feels different this time around. “Congress is really looking at cutting, cutting, cutting, cutting. … Things that you would never imagine being cut like entitlement programs are in live discussion right now. So that’s the unknown.”

Advocates say that there really isn’t any other comparable safety net for residents seeking energy assistance if LIHEAP ends up being cut. Though alternatives like charitable giving and religious organizations can help pay for energy costs, it doesn’t come close to meeting the needs of 6 million people who were previously reached by the program, Wein said.

“There is no easy fix and there is no comprehensive fix to losing LIHEAP,” she said. “Every state is going to be devastated with the loss of this funding.”

Borrowing computer modeling concepts that have been used to study the oceans, the researchers refined them to work with the Great Lakes.

Drew Gronewold is an associate professor at UM’s School of Environment and Sustainability. He said when we talk about heat waves on land, people understand.

“So this paper is taking that idea that we’re very familiar with on land and applying it to temperatures in the lakes.”

The problem to overcome was that we don’t have all the data needed across eight decades to look at water temperatures during the most extreme heat waves or cold periods.

“There are periods in time or locations on the lake either at the surface or at depth that we just don’t have a measurement for. So, this is where developing high-powered computer models comes in. And that’s a huge part of this study,” said Gronewold.

Lead author of the study, postdoctoral research fellow Hazem Abdelhady, said the study analyzed how extremes have affected the lakes over the last 80 years and found they’ve intensified sharply in their strength, more than doubling.

That is in keeping with climate change predictions.

The findings are not just about colder colds and hotter heat waves. They have real world consequences.

“Stronger extremes can disrupt ecosystems, threaten fisheries, degrade water quality, and stress coastal infrastructure like drinking water intakes and nuclear power plant cooling systems,” Abdelhady said.

Past studies have shown that of the large lakes in the world, Lake Superior was among those warming fastest.

“Lake Superior continues to warm rapidly and, based on our findings, now shows the largest increase in heatwave intensity among all the Great Lakes,” Abdelhady said.

That does not mean Lake Superior is the warmest lake; it means it is warming the most quickly.

The research was published in the journal Communications Earth and Environment.

U.S. health officials, following recommendations by infectious disease experts, have been urging annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older.
“The reason we give vaccines to healthy people is to keep them safe,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.
Last week, the FDA announced routine COVID-19 vaccine approvals will be limited to seniors and younger people with underlying medical risks, pending new research for healthy adults and children.","DETROIT (AP) — The U.S. Energy Department ordered a Michigan coal-fired power plant to remain open, at least until late August, citing possible electricity shortfalls in the central U.S.

State regulators immediately fired back, saying it's unnecessary to keep Consumers Energy's J.H. Campbell plant open. It was supposed to close May 31.

“We currently produce more energy in Michigan than needed. As a result, there is no existing energy emergency in either Michigan or MISO,” said Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission.

MISO stands for Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which manages the flow of electricity in 15 U.S. states and Manitoba in Canada.

MISO's forecast says there should be enough electricity in the region this summer though ""there is the potential for elevated risk during extreme weather.""

Consumers Energy is planning to close Campbell as part of a transition to cleaner energy. The power plant opened in 1962 in western Michigan's Ottawa County, near Lake Michigan. It can generate up to 1,450 megawatts of electricity to serve up to 1 million people, the utility said.

“MISO and Consumers Energy shall take all measures necessary to ensure that the Campbell Plant is available to operate,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday.

The utility said it will comply with the order, which expires Aug. 21.

""Yes, the plant will stay on and produce electricity,"" spokesperson Brian Wheeler said Tuesday.

An environmental group, the Sierra Club, panned the government order.

“Coal is expensive, outdated and deadly. ... Consumers Energy is right to finally retire this hugely expensive plant that is costing Michiganders their lives,” attorney Greg Wannier said, referring to the health effects of coal emissions.

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Tuesday announced that COVID-19 vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women — a move immediately questioned by several public health experts.

In a 58-second video posted on the social media site X, Kennedy said he removed COVID-19 shots from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendations for those groups. No one from the CDC was in the video, and CDC officials referred questions about the announcement to Kennedy and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

No other details were released, and HHS officials did not immediately respond to questions about how the decision was made.

Some doctors and public health leaders called the move concerning and confusing.

“There's no new data or information, just them flying by the seat of their pants,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.

U.S. health officials, following recommendations by infectious disease experts, have been urging annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older.

The idea of changing the recommendations is not completely out of the blue. As the COVID-19 pandemic has waned, experts have increasingly discussed the possibility of focusing vaccination efforts on people 65 and older — who are among those most as risk for death and hospitalization.

A CDC advisory panel is set to meets in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are suggesting shots for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice to get vaccinated.

But Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine advocate before becoming health secretary, decided not to wait for the scientific panel's review. He said that annual COVID-19 booster shots have been recommended for kids “despite the lack of any clinical data” to support that decision.

Some physicians and public health leaders expressed concern that HHS officials disregarded a scientific review process that has been in place for decades, in which experts — in public meetings — review current medical evidence and hash out the pros and cons of policy changes.

“It's a dangerous precedent. If you can start doing that with this vaccine, you can start doing that with any vaccine you want — including mumps-measles-rubella,” said Osterholm, referring to another vaccine that Kennedy has voiced doubts about.

He and others said the announcement raises an array of questions, including whether health insurance companies will keep covering COVID-19 vaccinations and how hard it will be now for people who want the shots to get them.

“The reason we give vaccines to healthy people is to keep them safe,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.

More than 1.2 million people have died in the U.S. from COVID-19, most of them elderly. But children haven't been spared: The coronavirus has been the underlying cause in more than 1,300 childhood deaths since the pandemic began, according to CDC data.

Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary and Dr. Jay Battacharya, head of the National Institutes of Health, appeared in the video with Kennedy.

Earlier this year, during the nomination process, Kennedy gave assurances to wavering Republicans that he would not alter the federal vaccine schedule.

But since then, Kennedy and other Trump administration appointees have made big changes to the system for approval and use of vaccines.

They added restrictions to a recent vaccine approval. Last week, the FDA announced routine COVID-19 vaccine approvals will be limited to seniors and younger people with underlying medical risks, pending new research for healthy adults and children.

Among the confusion created by Tuesday's announcement, experts said, was the implication that the coronavirus isn't dangerous to pregnant women.

During the height of the pandemic, deaths of women during pregnancy or shortly after childbirth soared to their highest level in 50 years. Indeed, pregnancy was on the list of health conditions that would qualify someone for a COVID-19 vaccination under FDA’s new guidance “framework” announced last week.

Vaccination has been recommended for pregnant women, in part, because it's a way to pass immunity to newborns who are too young for vaccines and are vulnerable to infections.

“To say that they are not at any risk is simply incorrect,” said Dr. Sean O'Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said: “The science has not changed. It is very clear that COVID infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families.”

A proposal to disqualify companies from claiming key tax credits if they use components or critical minerals imported from certain countries, including China, would effectively kill the credits even sooner.
In the same period its energy storage battery revenue may grow from $8 billion to $22 billion.
Among the top takeaways from the April Shanghai auto show were CATL’s Shenxing battery that charges to 520 kilometers in five minutes, its cheaper Naxtra sodium-ion battery and its Choco-SEB battery swapping system.","The largest stock listing of 2025 is by the world’s biggest battery maker, a Chinese company profiting from energy transition efforts that Republicans in the US want to defund to finance tax cuts. Amid the ongoing tariff tensions between the US and China, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., better known as CATL, is set to start trading in Hong Kong after raising $4.6 billion in the secondary listing.

In April, a congressional committee called for withdrawal from a deal by two US banks working on the listing, Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The committee cited a Pentagon blacklist which included CATL and several other prominent Chinese firms with alleged links to the Chinese military. The blacklist carries no specific sanctions and CATL denies the allegations. Both banks decided to move forward with the deal, while CATL opted to pursue a Regulation S offering, which excludes sales to US onshore investors and exempts the issuer from certain US regulatory filing obligations.

President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Chinese imports and desires to cut funding for US green projects threaten battery makers. A Republican budget blueprint to save $560 billion on clean energy tax credits over 10 years, would end them for EVs after next year and for homes after this year. A proposal to disqualify companies from claiming key tax credits if they use components or critical minerals imported from certain countries, including China, would effectively kill the credits even sooner.

After a tough year in 2024 as battery prices declined, analysts see revenue from CATL’s power battery systems topping $68 billion by 2029, a steep increase from the $35 billion it reported in 2024. In the same period its energy storage battery revenue may grow from $8 billion to $22 billion. CATL, which controls 35% of the global EV battery market, was ahead of rivals with an operating margin of 15% and R&D spending of $2.58 billion in 2024. It also maintained better debt to equity ratios and free cash flow.

CATL’s Hong Kong listing is designed to help fund a battery plant in Hungary, adding to a facility in Germany and a planned factory in Spain. Trade tensions with the US and Republican efforts to sunset clean energy initiatives have led CATL to try to shield itself by licensing its technology, increasing research and development, and sourcing materials from more neutral regions. First-quarter R&D expenses increased 11%.

CATL will need to keep innovating to stay on the cutting edge and maintain market dominance.

The Republicans are so deeply in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry that they probably are choking on lint. So, the fact that they’re discussing something as radical in its denial as this should surprise approximately nobody. From :

The Environmental Protection Agency has drafted a plan to eliminate all limits on greenhouse gases from coal and gas-fired power plants in the United States, according to internal agency documents reviewed by The New York Times. In its proposed regulation, the agency argued that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from power plants that burn fossil fuels “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or to climate change because they are a small and declining share of global emissions. Eliminating those emissions would have no meaningful effect on public health and welfare, the agency said.

This is, of course, nonsense.

But in the United States, the power sector was the second biggest source of greenhouse gases, behind transportation, according to the most recent data available on the E.P.A. website. And globally, power plants account for about 30 percent of the pollution that is driving climate change.

EPA boss Lee Zeldin—whose qualifications for the job include being a career politician who lost a campaign for governor of New York—had a rough time of it in front of congressional committees last week. (He and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, had a heated exchange during the senator’s time to question him.) But these proposed changes are a perfect example of the administration’s blasé hand-waving of the climate crisis and of why Zeldin is the perfect huckster to sell the country on bad air and rising seas.

The Trump administration is methodically uprooting policies aimed at curbing climate change, and the E.P.A. is at the epicenter of that effort. In recent weeks, Mr. Zeldin has and air pollution, and has launched the repeal of more than two dozen regulations and policies. The agency is feeling pressure from the White House to finalize its deregulations by December, according to two people briefed on internal discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to describe them. That would be an extraordinarily fast pace. Rewriting regulations can typically take more than a year.

This dynamic environment presents both challenges and opportunities for investors, compelling them to navigate a complex web of trade policies, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical shifts.

Challenges and Opportunities: The changing trade policies and tariffs have created a significant level of uncertainty within the energy sector. This has led to a cautious approach toward M&A activities. While new energy deal kickoffs on Datasite, an M&A platform that facilitates around 19,000 new deals annually, remained flat in the first four months of this year compared to the previous year, hold rates increased by two percentage points, and deal closure rates jumped by nine percentage points.

COMMENTARY

This trend mirrors global activity, where new deal kickoffs, especially in asset sales and mergers, on Datasite rose 4% year-over-year (YoY), during the first four months of the year. Similarly, deal hold rates on Datasite increased by four percentage points during the same period.

However, the impact of tariffs has been palpable. Global deal starts on Datasite dropped by 15% YoY in April, following an 11% surge in the first quarter. This drop coincided with the first major U.S. tariff announcement on April 2. Consequently, deal completion odds also declined, sinking to 44%, down from 49% YoY.

Effects on Oil and Gas M&A: The uncertainty induced by tariffs has notably affected the oil and gas M&A market. Many deals have been pulled back or put on hold as global buyers conduct more thorough due diligence. The use of virtual data rooms, where buyers interrogate deal information using question and answer tools, has become increasingly common. Tariff risk analysis is now a critical component of every valuation model.

Counterbalancing Factors: Despite the challenges, there are factors driving deal activity within the energy sector. Technological innovation, cost reductions, and rising demand for zero-carbon solutions are creating opportunities for M&A. These developments provide a measure of counterbalance to the negative impact of tariffs and trade uncertainties.

For example, with demand and energy consumption by data centers, especially those powering artificial intelligence, projected to grow by 10% to 15% annually through 2030, companies are racing to secure resources and infrastructure. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global electricity demand from data centers, cryptocurrencies, and artificial intelligence (AI) could more than double by 2026, reaching more than 1,000 terawatt-hours (TWh) annually, roughly equivalent to Japan’s total electricity consumption.

Much of this growth is driven by AI models requiring intensive computing resources, particularly large language models and generative AI applications that depend on vast server farms. This trend is prompting renewed interest in nuclear power as a stable, carbon-neutral energy source capable of supporting around-the-clock operations without the intermittency challenges of solar or wind. However, geopolitical tensions and trade restrictions on critical materials like enriched uranium and advanced reactor components could slow progress. As a result, businesses must carefully account for these regulatory, logistical, and supply chain variables when evaluating potential investments in the evolving energy landscape.

Navigating Unpredictability: The volatility in the trade environment necessitates vigilance among dealmakers. Policy changes can either accelerate or delay deal timelines, and preparation is key. Anticipating increased levels of review and longer review processes is crucial. Leveraging technology, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), can expedite the due diligence process and enhance efficiency.

The Role of AI in M&A: AI is already transforming the M&A landscape by identifying potential targets, automating due diligence, and using predictive analytics to improve accuracy. Currently, one in five dealmakers employs generative AI in the M&A process, and many rank AI adoption as their top operational priority this year.

Strategies for Success: To thrive in this evolving landscape, dealmakers must strengthen their due diligence processes, strategically use AI, anticipate regulatory scrutiny, and stay ahead of geopolitical shifts. Proactive strategies, including prioritizing deal readiness and leveraging technology to mitigate risks, will be essential for success.

While the global tariff war has introduced significant challenges for European energy M&A, it has also underscored the importance of adaptability and innovation.

Gov. Patrick Morrisey said at a recent news conference the new law will allow operators to fill wells without removing the largest mine shaft.

""This will provide operators with greater flexibility, especially when dealing with older wells in poor structural condition,"" Morrisey explained.

West Virginia historically has only been able to plug just a few wells a year because of lack of funding. Federal investments through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 has led to the plugging of around 275 wells within the last three years. The state's new well plugging law goes into effect July 10.

Morrisey noted safely plugging a well can cost between $60,000 and $200,000 but argued doing so is necessary because untreated wells can expose communities to harmful chemicals.

""Abandoned and orphan wells can pose a significant threat and safety risk and can potentially impact surface and groundwater drinking water sources, land and air quality,"" Morrisey outlined.

According to advocacy group West Virginia Rivers, more than half of West Virginians live within a mile of an active oil and gas well.

The Florida Legislature's failure to pass a budget before adjourning has left key environmental projects in limbo, including a Senate-approved proposal to restore the Ocklawaha River by dismantling the Rodman Dam.

For residents like Samuel Carr, president of the Bartram Trail Society who fished the river before the dam's 1971 construction, the more than $6 million project represents a chance to revive what he called a ""free-running wild river"" from what he said he believes turned into ""a mud hole.""

""Since they put that dam in, 150 million gallons of fresh water doesn't come into the St. Johns River now per day, as it did before 1971,"" said Carr. ""So, the restoration would literally turn the faucet back on to get that cool, clear water to the St. Johns River.""

Carr noted the dam blocks 20 springs and forces periodic pollution releases into the St. Johns, which he said has suffered catastrophic algae blooms and lost critical eelgrass.

Lawmakers will reconvene sometime after June 2 to resume budget talks. The Senate has already approved the funding, but House approval remains uncertain amid broader disputes over tax cuts.

A Florida Atlantic University study projects the restoration would deliver a 214% return on investment, yielding over $15 million a year in recreation revenue and 340 jobs.

Former Putnam County Commissioner Linda Myers framed restoration as an economic imperative for rural Florida.

""This area of northeast Florida has so many rivers that connect to the St. Johns and this specific structure, the dam, has actually eliminated some of that connectedness,"" said Myers. ""So, opening that up would just give the opportunities - and here in Florida, we know the tourism dollars, we know how important they are.""

Myers said she believes the project aligns with lawmakers' stated priorities of water quality, conservation and leveraging Florida's tourism industry.

The study also shows restoring the Ocklawaha River would reconnect 213 river miles for fish migration, revive 20 submerged springs, and reduce algal bloom risk by 63% by restoring natural water flow.

Support for this reporting was provided by The Pew Charitable Trusts.

Indiana's rural communities could lose out under a new federal bill aimed at speeding up clean energy development.

What Republicans are calling the One Big Beautiful Bill, part of President Donald Trump's tax package, includes major changes to how energy and infrastructure projects get environmental approval.

Lawmakers rewrote parts of the National Environmental Policy Act, to shorten timelines and block lawsuits that often delay big builds.

Supporters say the changes will fast-track everything from solar farms to broadband.

But Thomas Hochman, director of infrastructure policy at the Foundation for American Innovation, warned that the new rules may push developers to focus on easier, cheaper sites.

""There are quotes from folks like an outgoing Environmental Protection Agency general counsel, who say that 90% of the details NEPA review are purely there for litigation proofing,"" said Hochman. ""If you know that you are not at risk of litigation that is almost certainly a radically faster timeline.""

Hochman said that could leave rural areas behind.

The U.S. House narrowly passed the bill. It now moves to the Senate.

Hochman said for developers with large projects, fees aren't a problem.

""For a developer who has a project that still will go through environmental impact statement, the vast majority of time $5 million - or whatever it might be - is peanuts,"" said Hochman. ""I think this will become the common avenue for private developers.""

Advocates fear this progress could slow if project scoring continues to prioritize cost-efficiency over need.

As the Environmental Protection Agency scales back enforcement because of staff shortages and new federal rollbacks, concerns are growing in Michigan and across the country about who will hold polluters accountable.

Michigan, with more than 11,000 inland lakes and access to four Great Lakes holding 90% of the nation's freshwater, faces challenges as EPA budget cuts reduce enforcement by nearly 20% and eliminate more than 200 staff.

Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law & Policy Center, said in a recent webinar that his organization commissions polling and focus groups every two years on clean-water issues in the Great Lakes.

""And it's an 85% issue. It's almost as if, when you push people and you say, 'How much should we do to protect the Great Lakes and restore them?' he asked, ""It's like, whatever it costs, you do it.""

Supporters of EPA cuts, especially in energy, manufacturing and agriculture, contend strict environmental rules are too costly for businesses. In late 2024, more than 100 industry groups urged then-President-elect Donald Trump to roll back regulations they said were ""strangling"" the economy.

Partisanship continues to shape the debate over environmental laws, with lawmakers often split along party lines when it comes to regulations.

David Uhlmann, a former EPA official and environmental law attorney, stressed in the webinar the need to take politics out of environmental protection.

""The environmental laws require EPA working with the state to promote clean air, healthy rivers and streams, to make sure that we're living in communities free of toxic waste,"" he said. ""Those laws apply regardless of who the president is.""

In Fiscal Year 2024, the EPA's enacted budget was more than $9 billion, with a workforce of more than 15,000 employees.

U.S. consumer demand for renewable energy continues to grow, with more solar panel capacity installed in 2024 than in 2023, which saw more than in 2022. But U.S. trade policy is in flux, and high tariffs have been imposed on imported solar panels, which may cause shortages.

I am a scholar who studies the Sun, as well as an entrepreneur who is working to harness its power here on Earth by creating new designs for generating solar electricity. As part of that effort, I’ve studied market trends and manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. and abroad. Right now, U.S. manufacturers do not produce enough solar panels to meet the nation’s demand, but industry investments and federal tax incentives have been making progress, though recent federal moves have created uncertainty.

In 2024, U.S. installers put up enough solar panels to generate 50 gigawatts of electricity – enough to power New York City for a year.

U.S. manufacturers made only a small fraction of that – 4.2 GW of solar modules in the first half of 2024. That was a big boost, though – a 75% increase compared with the same period in 2023. And the prices were roughly three times the cost of imports.

A look at recent imports

In 2024, the U.S. imported far more panels than the country needed, suggesting developers may be stockpiling panels for future projects.

Most of those imported panels were made in Asia, particularly Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand. In fact, nearly all of the U.S.-made panels used at least some components from overseas. China currently makes about 97% of the world’s supply of photovoltaic wafers, which are building blocks of solar panels.

The effects of proposed U.S. trade policies on the solar industry remain unclear. Through 2024, manufacturing continued a yearslong ramp-up to take advantage of government policies favoring domestic manufacturing. And imported panels seem slated to suffer from ever-increasing tariffs, which drive up costs.

Domestic production rises

Since 2010, U.S. solar panel production has increased about eightfold. But U.S.-made panels are more expensive than imported alternatives. In 2024, U.S.-made panels typically cost 31 cents per watt, but imported panels, even including tariffs that existed before President Donald Trump’s second term, cost about one-third of that: 11 cents per watt.

But domestic manufacturers are bringing costs down by ramping up production while relying on the government to maintain or increase tariffs on imports, which may make U.S. panels more competitive domestically in the future.

Reliance on overseas sources

Despite that increase in domestic production, U.S. demand for solar panels has grown even faster. To meet demand, the U.S. imports a substantial portion of its solar photovoltaic modules.

Tariffs, including a 30% tariff on solar cells and solar panels starting in 2018, aimed to boost domestic manufacturing.

But those tariffs and falling global prices made solar installations more costly in the U.S. than in the rest of the world. The average global cost of installed solar systems dropped from $1.15 per watt in 2012 to $0.72 per watt in 2016, nearly half that of U.S. installations.

The 2018 tariffs, as well as earlier rounds in 2012 and 2014, have shifted the source of U.S. imports of solar panels – from China and Taiwan to Malaysia and South Korea. Manufacturers are also building solar panels in Singapore and Germany to maintain access to the U.S. market. And Chinese companies are even investing in U.S. solar manufacturers to take advantage of federal incentives and avoid tariffs.

New tariffs emerge

Trump’s proposal for new tariffs on foreign-made solar goods, including panels and components, particularly target Chinese-owned companies in Southeast Asia.

They could include a potential 375% tariff on Thai products – nearly quadrupling prices – and a 3,500% tariff on products from Cambodia.

In contrast, U.S.-made solar panels will be cheaper. But a reduced supply of solar panels will raise prices even of domestic-made panels, at least until U.S. manufacturing can catch up with the demand. Some developers have begun to delay or cancel solar installations to address rising costs.

Domestic investment

Due in large part to the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, enacted in 2022, the U.S. solar panel industry has seen significant investments.

Since the law’s enactment, more than 95 GW of manufacturing capability have been added across the solar supply chain in the U.S., including new facilities that in a year can construct enough solar panels to produce nearly 42 GW, beyond existing manufacturing levels. This growth in manufacturing capabilities is largely located in Texas and Georgia.

Still, the new administration’s shifting priorities and trade policies make the landscape uncertain. Before Trump began discussing various solar-related trade policies, the industry projected it would install an average of 45 GW of solar panels every year for the next decade.

At no extra cost, that means Canadian housing and infrastructure dollars are spent on clean, often Canadian, materials.","If there’s one thing Canadian politicians agree on, it’s that we need more housing. We need to build more affordable homes and the infrastructure that surrounds them. And, wherever possible, we should be building them with Canadian materials.

But if there’s another thing that the majority of Canadians agree on, it’s that more housing should not come at the cost of meeting our climate goals. We talk a lot about the need to heat, cool and power our homes with renewable energy to reduce emissions. But what’s talked about less are the emissions caused by building those homes in the first place.

Producing construction materials like concrete, steel, drywall and insulation causes significant industrial emissions. Before you get the keys to your new home, it has already locked in 20 to 120 tonnes of emissions. At the high end, that’s equivalent to 30 years of driving the average gas-powered car. For the housing build-out we need to see by 2030, that would mean more than a year’s worth of Canada’s total emissions from the entire economy.

In short, we cannot ignore the climate consequences of the housing debate. Prime Minister Mark Carney’s housing plan promises that low-emissions materials will be prioritized in the build-out, but in a housing crisis, there may be worries about a trade-off between green and affordable, or between green and fast.

Thankfully, cleaner options are already available, and they do not need to cost more. A new report by Clean Energy Canada shows that low-emissions alternatives for concrete, steel, insulation and drywall are available at no or negligible-cost premiums.

Drywall and insulation alternatives that cut emissions in half or even reduce emissions by as much as 98 per cent are already available at standard market rates. Even high-emissions steel and concrete can be replaced with cleaner alternatives, usually without paying extra.

Where slight cost increases were found for projects built with cleaner materials, in most cases these added up to no more than $2,000 to $3,000 per material, less than cents on the dollar for multi-million-dollar projects that deal with larger cost variations every day.

What’s more, preferring clean materials gives Canadian producers an edge, as our relatively clean electricity grid and innovation in clean material industries have made Canadian construction materials on average cleaner than those imported.

Governments can support domestic industry by adopting a “Buy Clean” approach, requiring government-funded buildings and infrastructure to use cleaner materials and meet whole-building emissions reduction targets. At no extra cost, that means Canadian housing and infrastructure dollars are spent on clean, often Canadian, materials. Investing in clean manufacturing will also help Canadian industry be competitive in export markets like the EU, which is adopting an emissions-based import tax on a range of industrial products, including steel.

In addition to cleaner materials, construction projects can cut cost and carbon through more efficient design. Simplifying existing designs and not overbuilding can already save time, dollars, and emissions. Taking this a step further and rethinking how a building can provide the same function with less material, builders can achieve emission reductions as large as 40 per cent. Building parkades and basements underground are examples of particularly carbon-intensive structures, not to forget flood risks. Thinking about the climate, as well as cost, early on can lead to big savings.

If the new federal government is looking for ways to tie the housing crisis to the tariff war, a common solution can be found in building efficiently with clean, made-in-Canada materials.

You can also learn more about the EV’s benefits from our many electric vehicle reports, available to you at Lung.org/EV.","Motor vehicle exhaust emissions are a major contributor to air pollution nationwide, especially in urban areas. Burning gasoline and diesel fuel releases many dangerous chemicals into the air including particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which cause the creation of ground level ozone. Switching to zero-emissions vehicles and getting the most polluting cars off the road is one of the best ways to reduce air pollution. But many families believe that they can’t afford this switch. The truth is that in addition to making the air cleaner, switching to a zero-emissions vehicle can actually save you money. Read on to find out how one local program is making a big difference for drivers and the air they breathe.

Zero-Emission Vehicles are Important for Health

The Lung Association’s own “Zeroing In on Healthy Air” report series found that a nationwide switch to zero-emission vehicles, coupled with clean electricity, would have enormous benefits for health. That transition would save 110,000 lives by 2050 – and amount to $1.2 trillion in public health benefits from avoided health harms.

Another report, called Cleaner Cars, Cleaner Air, looked to California as a case study. It found that despite comprising only 19% of the state's vehicles, pre-2004 gasoline and diesel-powered cars and trucks are responsible for a significant share of harmful emissions, including 55% of nitrogen oxides and 64% of reactive organic gases from passenger vehicles. Additionally, the study highlights that pollution from these older vehicles disproportionately affects Black and Latino Americans, low-income households, and communities designated as disadvantaged.

Valley Clean Air Now (Vally CAN), located in San Joaquin Valley, the region with the worst air quality in the U.S., is responding to this need. “Here in California, we have the largest older fleet in the U.S.,” Tom Knox, executive director of Valley CAN, explains. “Old gas guzzlers are very dirty, and those older vehicles are concentrated inland where the air quality is worst.” Committed to reducing air emissions by helping everyone own a cleaner car, regardless of their economic status, Valley CAN offers programs that assist these disproportionately affected drivers in a variety of ways.

Tune In, Tune Up

In the San Joaquin Valley, like in many places nationwide, cars need to pass periodic emissions tests. Emissions testing – or “smog tests,” as they’re called in California – is one of the most tried and tested tools to help reduce unhealthy levels of air pollution in the area.

When a car is new, the smog system is rarely an issue and is exempted from emissions testing requirements for the first eight years. But once a car gets over 100,000 miles and is on its third owner, the emissions system is likely to degrade. Unfortunately, many of these owners tend to be on a tight budget, meaning upkeep and maintenance costs can be an ongoing challenge. Having to test and update their emissions system can cost over $800 to get up to code. “It is almost inevitable that a low-income driver is going to run into this problem. These are people who have to move farther out to get affordable housing, so they have to drive farther to get good paying jobs,” Tom Knox explained. “There are about 3% of vehicles that are emitting 40% of emissions in California because the people who own those cars can’t afford smog repairs.”

As cars and car repairs get more expensive, it gets harder for low-income people to keep these vehicles compliant. This is where Valley CAN steps in. For the past 20 years, the Tune In & Tune Up smog repair program has offered free vehicle emissions testing at events held all over the region. If a vehicle fails the emissions test, drivers are given a voucher for free emission-related repairs at a local STAR-certified smog shop. The program has been extremely successful, with over 70,000 low-income, disadvantaged community residents attending the events throughout the region, resulting in repairs to over 30,000 high-emitting vehicles.

Vehicle Replacement Program

In 2013, impressed by the success of Tune In & Tune Up, California Senator Fran Pavley authored a bill that added the option for a vehicle replacement program that would become Clean Cars 4 All. Starting in 2015, Vally CAN began offering income-qualified customers the opportunity to trade in their gas-guzzling vehicle for a car that required little or no gasoline. Since its inception, this program has had a very positive response in the community.

“Gas costs are a big burden for this community so the opportunity to cut that cost was a big motivator for them,” said Tom Knox. “The money earned during the first two days of work, for many families, all goes toward filling the tank. The more you drive to work the more you have to pay for gas; it is a vicious cycle. When we eliminate this expense, it is totally transformative. They love their plug-in vehicles.""

The program has replaced over 8,000 cars, with more than 80% of them going to residents of disadvantaged communities. Currently, the program offers up to $12,000 and continues to evolve as more used plug-in vehicles become available and continue to be more desirable and affordable than used gas-powered vehicles. ""We are solving the problem, which reduces stress in these people’s lives. You improve quality of life, and you improve air quality. It’s a win-win situation,” Tom exclaimed.

LRM battery chemistry, on the other hand, can help GM make its future EVs more affordable.
According to GM, the lower cost LRM prismatic cell batteries will primarily be used to expand customer choice in the electric truck and full-size SUV markets.
Pre-production of LRM battery cells is expected to begin at an LG Energy Solution facility by late 2027.
The batteries will also be validated at an unnamed LG Energy Solution facility before series production begins.","Dive Brief:

Battery engineers at General Motors and its joint venture partner LG Energy Solution have developed an improved lithium manganese-rich (LMR) prismatic battery cell design for the company’s future electric vehicles, the automaker announced in a May 13 press release.

The LRM battery chemistry uses a higher percentage of lower-cost manganese to replace Cobalt, a critical raw material for EV batteries, making them less costly to produce while still delivering high energy density.

GM aims to be the first major automaker to deploy LMR batteries in EVs. Its Ultium Cells joint venture with LG Energy plans to start commercial production of the battery cells in the U.S. by 2028 for full-size electric trucks and SUVs.

Dive Insight:

GM’s current EV models use nickel manganese cobalt aluminum oxide (NMCA) batteries, which contributes to improving driving range, but are costlier manufacture. LRM battery chemistry, on the other hand, can help GM make its future EVs more affordable.

A high nickel battery cell typically consists of roughly 85% nickel, 10% manganese and 5% cobalt, according to GM. But LMR cells contain around 35% nickel, 65% manganese, and “virtually no cobalt,” which can significantly reduce costs.

In addition, GM says its LMR prismatic battery cell design has 33% higher energy density compared to the best-performing lithium iron phosphate (LFP) or manganese cobalt aluminum oxide (NMCA) cells used in many EVs on the road today, and at a comparable cost.

The new LRM battery cells are not intended to replace GM’s current batteries. Rather they will be used for some electric models along with high-nickel and iron-phosphate cells for others. According to GM, the lower cost LRM prismatic cell batteries will primarily be used to expand customer choice in the electric truck and full-size SUV markets.

“We’re pioneering manganese-rich battery technology to unlock premium range and performance at an affordable cost, especially in electric trucks,” said Kurt Kelty, VP of battery, propulsion, and sustainability at GM, in the release. “As we look to engineer the ideal battery for each vehicle in our diverse EV portfolio, LMR will complement our high-nickel and iron-phosphate solutions.”

GM is targeting driving ranges of over 400 miles for its full-size electric trucks and SUVs equipped with LRM batteries, while achieving significant cost savings compared to today’s high-nickel battery cells the automaker is currently using.

The automaker said it began researching LRM battery cells a decade ago, which included prototyping cells at its Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center in Warren, Michigan. The automaker accelerated its research in 2020 as its engineers collaborated with partners including LG Energy to achieve advancements in battery cathode materials, electrolytes, additives, form factors and assembly processes.

GM said researchers overcame LMR’s limitations in performance and durability that made them impractical for commercial use, according to the company.

“We’ve worked with our suppliers to optimize the materials in our LMR cells, adding proprietary dopants and coatings, along with particle engineering, process innovations, to achieve the right energy density and arrangement of battery materials inside the cell to keep them stable,” said Kushal Narayanaswamy, director of advanced battery cell engineering at GM, in a May 13 blog post.

By the end of 2024, GM said its researchers coated roughly one metric ton of LMR cathode material at the company’s Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center, which included testing hundreds of large format prismatic cells in 18 different prototypes and three cell dimensions. In total, the tests were equivalent to 1.4 million miles of EV driving, according to GM.

Unlike the 4680 cylindrical cell format used by Tesla for the Model Y, prismatic cells can be stacked closer together inside an EV’s battery pack. Their flat design uses less space compared to cylindrical cell batteries, leading to higher energy density, as more cells can fit into each EV battery pack. The cells can also better dissipate heat for improved cooling performance with an outer case typically made of aluminum.

“That makes them substantially more efficient to package in full-scale trucks and SUVs,” Narayanaswamy said.

Prismatic cells also require fewer components to assemble battery packs, which contributes to lower costs. The design can reduce battery module components by 75% and total pack components by 50%, according to GM.

Pre-production of LRM battery cells is expected to begin at an LG Energy Solution facility by late 2027. The final cell design will be validated at GM's new Battery Cell Development Center in Warren, Michigan, that’s expected to be operational by 2027. The batteries will also be validated at an unnamed LG Energy Solution facility before series production begins.

“We’re excited to introduce the first-ever LMR prismatic cells for EVs, the culmination of our decades-long research and investment in the technology,” said Wonjoon Suh, executive VP and head of the Advanced Automotive Battery division at LG Energy Solution, in the release. “GM’s future trucks powered by this new chemistry are a strong example of our shared commitment to offering diverse EV options to consumers.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/w7RnjI24r0x0m_t5tzUG6n6cpNXLPkzWJVcuKDLku0Q/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9MUk0tYmF0dGVyeS1HTS5qcGVn.webp,N,,2025-05-27 16:09:01.972843

“Rather than imposing a punitive tax on a subset of Americans, Congress should identify a fuel-neutral solution to the Highway Trust Fund’s structural insolvency.”","Advocates for speeding the nation’s transition to electric vehicles have joined the list of groups and individuals criticizing the massive budget reconciliation bill that was narrowly approved by U.S. House Republicans last week. In a news release distributed Tuesday, Ben Prochazka, the executive director of the nonprofit Electrification Coalition said the bill “takes a sledgehammer” to North Carolina’s electric vehicle (EV) industry and would undo EV tax credits that have led to 16,300 jobs and $20.4 billion in investments in the state.

Among the provisions in current law that would be eliminated by the legislation:

a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of an eligible new EV

a 30% tax credit up to $100,000 per single item or $1,000 for eligible home refueling infrastructure

a credit that supports a portion of the cost of producing certain technologies

a credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of eligible commercial EVs under 14,000 pounds and up to $40,000 for those over 14,000 pounds

a credit of up to $4,000 for the purchase of an eligible used EV.

The bill “would eliminate critical tax credits that are spurring private-sector investments, supporting critical mineral supply chain development, creating American jobs and ensuring the United States remains competitive in the global automotive market,” Prochazka said in the statement. “Removing these credits would pull the rug out from under the auto and aligned battery industries at a critical time, immediately putting North Carolina jobs at risk. Industry needs policy certainty and consistency to build domestic and allied supply chains.”

The bill now heads to the Senate, where Prochazka said he hopes North Carolina Republican Sens. Thom Tillis and Ted Budd fight to preserve the EV credits.

The legislation also would implement a new car tax, which would levy an annual tax of $250 on owners of electric vehicles and $100 for owners of hybrid vehicles.

“While all drivers should pay their fair share, this proposal is nearly three times what the average driver pays in federal gas taxes, which have not covered the cost of infrastructure for nearly 20 years,” Prochazka said. “Rather than imposing a punitive tax on a subset of Americans, Congress should identify a fuel-neutral solution to the Highway Trust Fund’s structural insolvency.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-102/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ev-charger1748369096.jpg?h=c9f93661&itok=1GzaJX57,N,,2025-05-27 15:15:09.893858

Overall hydropower generation in the U.S. is expected to rise 7.5% in 2025, which will also still keep overall hydropower generation below the 10-year average.
The increase in hydropower expected in 2025 is due in large part to above average precipitation in northern California, Oregon and eastern Washington during the past winter and this spring.
Both Oregon and Washington generated 20% less hydropower in 2023 than they did in 2021, and hydropower generation in the Northwest dropped to a historic 22-year low between Oct. 2022 and Sept. 2023.
Half of the drop in power generation was due to drought in Oregon, Washington and California.","After dropping to historic levels last year due to ongoing drought and high temperatures, hydropower generated in the Northwest is expected to rise slightly this year from much needed precipitation.

Hydropower in the region is expected to increase about 17% compared to last year, a welcome boost to growing energy demand, but will still be below the 10-year average, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Officials at the Energy Information Administration published their 2025 forecast on May 19, as well as annual expectations for water supplies in key river basins generating the hydroelectricity.

Overall hydropower generation in the U.S. is expected to rise 7.5% in 2025, which will also still keep overall hydropower generation below the 10-year average. Hydropower represents about 6% of the country’s electricity.

The increase in hydropower expected in 2025 is due in large part to above average precipitation in northern California, Oregon and eastern Washington during the past winter and this spring. Parts of southeast Oregon received record rainfall this spring, causing Gov. Tina Kotek in March to declare a state of emergency.

Despite the increased precipitation in some parts of the state, the Upper Columbia River Basin near Grand Coulee Dam in Washington will have a below-normal water supply this year when compared to the past 30 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Northwest River Forecast Center. Water supply will be about normal or above normal in the southern portion of the Columbia River, which includes the Snake River Basin.

Eleven Western states produce up to 60% of the country’s hydroelectricity. Washington, California and Oregon are the three largest contributors, with dams in Oregon and Washington producing more than one-third of all U.S. hydropower. About 40% of the electricity used in Oregon comes from the region’s hydroelectric dams.

But ongoing drought, periods of low precipitation and rising summer temperatures that melt mountain snowpack too quickly have led to lower-than-usual power generating capacity at dams in the West.

Both Oregon and Washington generated 20% less hydropower in 2023 than they did in 2021, and hydropower generation in the Northwest dropped to a historic 22-year low between Oct. 2022 and Sept. 2023. Hydropower generated in 2024 was the lowest it’s been since 2010, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.

The loss in generating capacity has cost the hydropower industry billions in revenue in recent years, according to researchers from the University of Alabama. The sector lost about 300 million megawatt hours of power generation between 2003 and 2020 due to drought and low water compared with the long-term average, equating to about $28 billion in lost revenue. Half of the drop in power generation was due to drought in Oregon, Washington and California.

In Oregon, the hydroelectricity sector is estimated to have lost more than $1.5 billion in revenue over those 18 years.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-95/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/columbiagale_01-1-1024x6831748368168.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=mCeeC9O9,N,,2025-05-27 15:14:41.468163

So, it’s a bet, but it’s a bet that we’ve made very conservatively by buying it in a very attractive price. It’s right in our lane. This is what we’ve been doing every day for a very, very, very long time.

Our assumptions are pretty conservative, and yet we’re still looking at 40% higher earnings per share per annum growth on a compound basis. If we get soaring demand growth, that would be even better, but we don’t need soaring demand growth. We’re betting on a normal tightening of the market, but we didn’t even put tightening of the market in the numbers to get the 40% growth, just to be super clear.

I do believe that this is a demand super cycle. I get that from talking to our customers. We have the second-largest C&I (commercial and industrial) electricity book; we’re the largest residential provider in Texas; we are the largest C&I provider of natural gas. So, we have customers we talk to every day about what they’re using and what they need. We base our thoughts on demand and what really drove this acquisition was their needs.

You just talked about being conservative, but I’ll still play devil’s advocate a little bit. What if the so-called data center boom underwhelms, whether it’s from AI becoming much more energy efficient more quickly, or from just AI utilization rolling out more slowly than anticipated?

When you look at our numbers that we projected, we have put in zero for data centers. I don’t believe that’s what’s going to happen, but we’re showing compound growth per annum on an EPS (earnings per share) basis going from 10% to 14% with no data centers or other significant large load additions. I believe data centers are real, but they’re going to be on top of all the growth that we’re achieving in our core business. I think that’s really important. I’m a big believer, and we have a great data center strategy, and I think it will drive markets and tightening even further. But we don’t need it to achieve the kind of growth that we’re talking about.

Could you elaborate a bit on that data center strategy and how you see it playing out in terms of growth?

Data centers are going to be integral to U.S. economic growth, and we need to be there to power the economic growth. We already serve most of the people who are building these data centers, the hyperscalers in our C&I business. But there’s a few ways we can serve them. If you have a data center, we can sell you power for a long-term period. With this new acquisition, we have a lot more flexibility to create products for data centers that they want longer term. How much price risk do you want? Second, we have a series of sites, 21 that we have now, and another 15 that will come with the new acquisition, that have the potential either for new power plants, or new data centers, or some colocation combination of the two.

The third leg of our stool is additionality. There’s a lot of concern the data centers are going to take power off the grid. We have an agreement with GE Vernova and Kiewit for over 5 gigawatts of turbines and construction, of which we already have reserve slots for 2.4 gigs. In the new acquisition, we’ve already identified another gigawatt of possible upgrades of [smaller] peakers (gas-fired peaker power plants) to [larger] CCGTs (combined-cycle gas turbine plants). We think we have that great three-legged stool to really provide a great menu for the data center builders and users of the world.

Homing in on the LS deal more, why is it so important right now to scale up, especially in gas-fired power generation?

I think this is probably the last big fleet that was available, certainly in the competitive markets where we want to be, in particular PJM (regional transmission organization in the Midwest and Northeast) and Texas. We think those are the two most attractive markets in the country. We’re doubling our generation fleet, we’re modernizing it because the LS fleet is younger than ours, and we’re acquiring it at roughly 50% of what it would cost to build it new. Then you talk about all the upside opportunities that I mentioned with tightening prices, upgrading of the new capacity on those CCGTs. It’s very exciting. Interestingly also, it enhances our credit profiles. Rating agencies are a lot more comfortable when you have iron. The last thing is, and not to bury the lead, it was a super accretive transaction.

Did you have LS in mind for a while? How did it play out over time?

We talk to everybody all the time. Aa lot of these plants are in funds that are long lived. As you know, private equity funds have finishing days. Yes, they can extend them, but I think LS Power was looking to return capital to their investors but also have some way of playing in future benefits and growth. They all looked at IPOs, but the IPO market has been super volatile. This is a way for them to have their cake and eat it too. They’re very, very happy. We had a lot of discussions about the power of the combination, and it really fits like a glove in Texas and PJM. They will own 11% of us, which will be their largest equity investment. Eventually, we said, “We need to do this,” and we did.

Please touch on the importance of LS’ CPower component of the deal and maybe explain how the virtual power plants (VPP) work and factor into NRG?

CPower is the leading demand-response platform in the country. Demand response is really the ability to get people to turn down or turn off their power usage at peak times, rather than having to generate additional power. You’re paying them, obviously, to do that. It can be more economical to pay someone to shut down than it can be to build an extra power plant and then have to turn it on, especially if you’re talking about a limited number of hours a year. It’s kind of the same function as a peaker plant. You’re going to only get to run it a few percentage points of the number of hours in a year, but it can be super important in those times of crisis where maybe it’s 115 degrees or its 0 degrees. It’s a small part of the economics of the deal today, but, as markets tighten, we view it as something that will be more and more valuable. We have our own C&I demand-response business but, frankly, we think theirs is a better platform, and we look forward to working synergistically with them on that.

Here in Texas, we just rolled out a residential virtual power plant, which will do the same thing by people agreeing to let us work with their thermostats for short periods of time in their home, which will also be a significant help for Texas in times of particular heat and cold or other high-peak use.

Switching gears a little bit, obviously, natural gas is going to be by far the largest part of the generation portfolio. Right now, it’s closer to equal between gas and coal. What’s your take on the coal portfolio and the future of coal for NRG and maybe for the coal industry as a whole?

Coal plants are still very, very economical. and more so in a tightening market. We’re not going to build any new coal plants. I don’t know if anyone is, and I don’t know of any of that are planned. It’s also grid stability. If we shut down those plants tomorrow, there would not be enough power in Texas. It would be both grid instability and inadequate capacity. Those are two really bad things. They’re an integral part of the system, and I think they’ll remain so for the foreseeable part of the future. But I don’t see us in any way, shape, or form expanding in coal. You’re correct that our percentage of gas will be 75% to 85% [after the LS deal], depending on how you want them measure. That’s a very comfortable place to be. We can’t build a grid without gas-fired capacity today. Whatever your political persuasion is—and I did my first solar deal in 1983, so I’ve seen all the cycles—until we have some long-duration affordable storage, you can’t have an all-renewable grid even if you want one. I try to speak the truth.

Why are Texas and PJM the spots you want to continue to grow and focus?

They’re competitive markets where being a well-run company with some of the most amazing people in the industry actually makes a difference. In a regulated market, you offer one product. This is what the product is, this is what the price is, and everybody’s a taker. And we can’t compete. The ability for us to offer customized, tailored solutions of various durations to all of our customers, that’s possible in PJM and Texas, in particular. That’s why we want to be there. I’m a big believer in competitive markets, I always have been, and those are the two best competitive markets by far in the United States.

Could you discuss the smaller Rockland Capital deal (Texas gas-fired power plants acquired for $560 million in March) and, longer-term, the brownfield construction projects over the next few years (new plants built in part through loans with the Texas Energy Fund)?

We have a lot of customers in Texas. We’re the biggest retail provider here and a lot of C&I. Both the Rockland deals and the TEF (Texas Energy Fund) projects are similar strategically to what we did with LS. LS is just bigger. Rockland and those TEM projects are 2 gigs. The amount of power for those in Texas is about the same as the amount of Texas power we got in LS. Adding those 4 gigs total in Texas gives us tremendous flexibility with our generation, and it enables us—if we want—to supply our entire retail load from our own generation, which we could not do before. It gives us more and more optionality in competitive markets, which we love. All of that generation is very flexible. When there’s cheap solar and wind, we’re happy to turn off our gas plants, buy that, and resell it to our customers, instead of running our plants. The TEF program is really designed to bring more gas—non-intermittent power—online. We think it’s a great program. We have those three projects in there, and we anticipate all of them will get to close and get built.

What about the integrated generation and electric strategy? How is the home retail business going with your Reliant, Green Mountain, Direct Energy, and other brands?

We’ve been doing super well, partly because one of the things we’ve been working on is integrating our Vivint smart home business with those brands. The residential VPP I talked about is the best example, but we’ve rolled out a product called Home Essentials. If you sign up for Reliant for a certain period of time, we’ll actually give you a Vivint [security] camera and [smart] thermostat. They’re upgrading their smart home systems, so we’re expanding our horizontal share of people’s wallets.

We’re really trying to make everything energy in your home easier rather than what I would say we were doing five years ago, which is sell you electricity. There’s a big difference between selling you something you actually want and are happy to have rather than, “OK, my lights went on.” It’s a strategic rollout, first in Texas and then in other parts of the world. Unlike most companies in our space, we start with the customer and work backwards. I don’t care if you’re a homeowner or you’re a hyperscaler, we want to serve you in the most optimal way possible.

I’m going back in time a little bit, and word this probably a little poorly. So that’s my fun setup. You mentioned the success of Vivint, but it was the acquisition of Vivint in part that drew Elliot back in and led to the ouster of your predecessor, Mauricio Gutierrez, and put you in the CEO role. Could you take me through that evolution from then to now?

I think Vivint is a great company and was a very good acquisition. I think it took people a while to figure that out. We could spend hours over a drink talking about why it is, but people didn’t understand it and how we got it strategically. It was also part of a big pivot of ours towards being customer centric. And you don’t hear any more about what a terrible acquisition Vivint is. People look at the growth numbers and go, “Wow, what a great deal.” The public market sometimes wants to judge everything in a month rather than taking the time to learn it. If you look at any of the stats or growth, Vivint is killing it. And, so, Elliott made a lot of money. They are [now] out of the stock, but they made a lot of money. They were out a little bit before the [LS] acquisition, but I think they would tell you they were happy shareholders. They have a way of doing business and they make a ton of money doing it. So, I can’t really argue with them. What we have done by putting our focus on operations, by creating all of these new products, by integrating Vivint in our retail business, we’ve created a powerful platform to serve everyone.

You’ve been on the board since 2003 but, when you took over the interim CEO role, the initial expectation was eventually for an external hire.

That was certainly mine (laughing).

Obviously, things have gone well since you took over. I wanted to get your take on why you ended up in the position more permanently.

You remember The Godfather Part III, when he says, [“Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.”]. I was trying to get out, but they sucked me back in. Look, I think we started to create a real momentum of success here. There were some cultural changes. I talked about going on offense instead of defense here because, when you have an activist, it’s too easy to kind of go into a shell because you think they’re going to attack whatever you do. We started making progress and the board, after going through its process, came back to me and said, “We’d like you to finish what you started here if you’re willing to do that.” And here I am. My only goal for 2023 was to go on Medicare. I succeeded, but then I ended up with this job too. But I’m thrilled to be here and, obviously, if I didn’t love what we were doing and love the potential that we have and didn’t want to finish that journey, I would have said no. And it’s now 18 months later, and here I am.

The other thing I wanted to ask about the past is because you’ve been on the board since 2003. Prior to Gutierrez, the CEO was David Crane and his big push for renewables and green energy. That led to his ouster, and Elliot’s first involvement with the spinoff of the NRG Yield renewables business. From your board perspective, how did that play out and why was the result maybe the best thing for NRG?

I don’t think the issue was being green. I think the issue at the end of the day was economic performance. When your stock falls precipitously and stays there for an extended period of time as a CEO, you must be very convincing to your investors that you have a plan to fix that. And, for better or for worse, that wasn’t the case for David. I know everyone thought it was a rejection of all things renewable, but I think it was a rejection of things unprofitable. I think we did a lot of really good things for a while and the next iteration under Mauricio, and then kind of hit another snag period. I think this has been the most interesting time to be at NRG because of the plethora of opportunities and the desire to play offense.

Getting back to the present, how do you see geopolitics with the tariffs, but also the emphasis on American energy dominance and where things stand today?

As opposed to yesterday or tomorrow? The problem is the instability. As a CEO, I can manage into any sort of criteria you give me. The hard thing is when you change it every day. From the power industry point of view, it’s a very strange time because we’re a very defensive stock. People still use power, and they actually spend more on smart homes and security when times are uncertain. And, yet, we have enormous growth potential. That’s a very rare thing to be a defensive stock with great growth potential. It’s usually one or the other. At the end of the day, I always believe that markets will determine what our energy policy is. I do think it will be somewhat tougher in some places for renewable folks if some of those benefits go away, but people will still be building renewables in places like Texas because they’re economical and an important part of the grid. I would welcome stability more than anything else but, at the end of the day, energy has always been determined by what people want and markets rather than what anybody’s been able to dictate as a policy.

On a personal basis, I’m curious about your background. You have more conventional economics and law degrees, but then you have a doctorate in archaeology. How did you end up going that route and how you got back to here?

I came out of law school and was an energy entrepreneur for a while. I was lucky enough to sell a couple businesses and kind of made a career switch and went back to do the PhD. I’d always loved archaeology. That’s what I did on vacations, go visit sites, visit museums. And, for the first time, I didn’t have a company I wanted to start. So, I went back to school. The worst thing that can happen is I hate it, and I quit. I obviously didn’t hate it. After a few years, in 2001 and 2002, there were a whole lot of energy bankruptcies. People were looking for people who were familiar with energy but hadn’t been involved in any of the bankruptcies. Well, I’ve been in graduate school. I ended up on two boards at that time, NRG and the other one was Enron International, called Prisma Energy post-bankruptcy. I always make sure I add that. The boards were great because I could go to meetings and still go to excavating sites. That’s what I was doing along with the [Escala Initiative] foundation that I started to help poor women entrepreneurs in Latin America that I had seen around my sites. And I was doing those three things right up until the day I got into this [CEO] seat.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.aZYv3vGia.2iskpEbLpIw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fortune_175/bf3c8c71cf740773e3fd45c8cc0d859e,N,,2025-05-27 15:14:00.092187

Despite these concerning trends, Wall Street analysts are increasingly bullish on the electric vehicle maker’s long-term prospects, with some firms raising price targets to street-high levels based on Tesla’s artificial intelligence and autonomous driving ambitions.

Tesla Sales Plunge in the European Market

Tesla’s European operations are experiencing a severe downturn, with sales across 32 European countries tumbling 49% to just 7,261 vehicles in April 2025, down from 14,228 in the same month the previous year. This dramatic decline comes as the broader electric vehicle market in Europe actually grew by approximately 28%, highlighting Tesla’s specific challenges.

The sales collapse extends beyond a single month, with Tesla’s European sales falling roughly 39% to 61,320 vehicles for the first four months of 2025, while the continent’s overall auto market showed little change during the same period.

The decline is attributed to multiple factors, including protests and boycotts over Elon Musk’s political involvement, an aging model lineup, and intensifying competition from Chinese EV brands like SAIC, which saw sales rise 54% in April.

Additionally, Tesla faced operational challenges with factory shutdowns for several weeks while upgrading its best-selling Model Y sport utility vehicle, which constrained supply. The company’s struggles are further compounded by US President Donald Trump’s trade war, which has reportedly turned Europeans away from American brands, with Trump threatening a 50% tariff on EU goods before agreeing to delay duties until July.

Analyst Remain Upbeat on Tesla’s Long-Term Ambitions as an AI Company

Despite the sales challenges, Wall Street analysts remain remarkably optimistic about Tesla’s future prospects.

Wedbush Securities has issued the most bullish call, raising Tesla’s price target to a street-high $500 from $350, implying approximately 47% upside potential. Analyst Daniel Ives positions Tesla as “one of the best pure plays on AI for the next decade,” emphasizing the company’s artificial intelligence and full self-driving (FSD) ambitions as key value drivers.

Cantor Fitzgerald has also maintained its $355 price target with an Overweight rating, highlighting Tesla’s ambitious plans to deploy fully autonomous robotaxis starting with a modest fleet in Austin by the end of June 2025. The initial phase will involve Model Y vehicles equipped with unsupervised Full Self-Driving technology, with expectations to scale up and expand into other cities by year-end.

Key catalysts identified by analysts include the rollout of FSD in China (which began in Q1 2025), expected deployment in Europe during the first half of 2025 pending regulatory approval, and high-volume production of the Optimus Bot slated for 2026 with initial customer deliveries projected for 2027. Wedbush’s Ives forecasts that Tesla’s autonomy and robotaxi service could unlock approximately $1 trillion in AI-related valuation, potentially propelling the company’s market capitalization to $2 trillion by late 2026.

Divergence Between Tesla’s Short-Term Performance and Long-Term Potential

The contrast between Tesla’s current operational challenges and analyst expectations creates a fascinating market dynamic. While Tesla’s FSD technology has accumulated over 3.5 billion miles with supervision as of Q1 2025, the company faces immediate headwinds from macroeconomic conditions, tariffs, and the anticipated removal of EV tax credits.

Analysts acknowledge these near-term challenges but remain focused on Tesla’s technological transformation. The company’s strong financial position, with a current ratio of 2.0 and more cash than debt on its balance sheet, provides resilience against current headwinds. Tesla also plans to introduce a lower-priced vehicle in the first half of 2025, starting around $30,000 including tax credits, which could align well with market conditions.

Elon Musk’s confirmed commitment to Tesla for the coming years, even as he prepares to conclude his role at DOGE, has provided additional reassurance to analysts. The company is expected to update its 2025 automotive growth targets and energy storage outlook next quarter, aiming for over 50% year-over-year growth following more than 100% increase in FY24.

Tesla Stock Gains on Early Tuesday Trading

Tesla stock has shown significant volatility, with a 52-week range of $167.41 to $488.54, and currently trades near the higher end of this range with a market capitalization of $1.151 trillion.

Tesla’s valuation metrics reflect its premium positioning, with a trailing P/E ratio of 193.91 and forward P/E of 158.73. The company maintains strong financial health with $37 billion in total cash and a debt-to-equity ratio of just 17.41%. Despite the recent sales challenges, Tesla generated $95.72 billion in trailing twelve-month revenue with a profit margin of 6.38%.

The analyst community shows mixed sentiment with price targets ranging from a low of $115.00 to Wedbush’s high of $500.00, with an average target of $299.38.

This wide range reflects the significant uncertainty around Tesla’s transition from a traditional automaker to an AI and robotics company, with current trading levels suggesting the market is pricing in substantial future growth from autonomous driving and energy storage initiatives.

“We are pausing decommissioning activities at the Campbell plant and will operate it in compliance with the order, working in conjunction with MISO,” spokesperson Brian Wheeler said.","DETROIT -- The U.S. Energy Department ordered a Michigan coal-fired power plant to remain open, at least until late August, citing possible electricity shortfalls in the central U.S.

State regulators immediately fired back, saying it's unnecessary to keep Consumers Energy's J.H. Campbell plant open. It was supposed to close May 31.

“We currently produce more energy in Michigan than needed. As a result, there is no existing energy emergency in either Michigan or MISO,” said Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission.

MISO stands for Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which manages the flow of electricity in 15 U.S. states and Manitoba in Canada.

The increase in hydropower expected in 2025 is due in large part to above average precipitation in northern California, Oregon and eastern Washington during the past winter and this spring.
Washington, California and Oregon are the three largest contributors, with dams in Oregon and Washington producing more than one-third of all U.S. hydropower.
Both Oregon and Washington generated 20% less hydropower in 2023 than they did in 2021, and hydropower generation in the Northwest dropped to a historic 22-year low between Oct. 2022 and Sept. 2023.
Half of the drop in power generation was due to drought in Oregon, Washington and California.","After dropping to historic levels last year due to ongoing drought and high temperatures, hydropower generated in the Northwest is expected to rise slightly this year from much needed precipitation.

Hydropower in the region is expected to increase about 17% compared to last year, a welcome boost to growing energy demand, but will still be below the 10-year average, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Officials at the Energy Information Administration published their 2025 forecast on May 19, as well as annual expectations for water supplies in key river basins generating the hydroelectricity.

Overall hydropower generation in the U.S. is expected to rise 7.5% in 2025, which will also still keep overall hydropower generation below the 10-year average. Hydropower represents about 6% of the country’s electricity.

The increase in hydropower expected in 2025 is due in large part to above average precipitation in northern California, Oregon and eastern Washington during the past winter and this spring. Parts of southeast Oregon received record rainfall this spring, causing Gov. Tina Kotek in March to declare a state of emergency.

Despite the increased precipitation in some parts of the state, the Upper Columbia River Basin near Grand Coulee Dam in Washington will have a below-normal water supply this year when compared to the past 30 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Northwest River Forecast Center. Water supply will be about normal or above normal in the southern portion of the Columbia River, which includes the Snake River Basin.

Eleven Western states produce up to 60% of the country’s hydroelectricity. Washington, California and Oregon are the three largest contributors, with dams in Oregon and Washington producing more than one-third of all U.S. hydropower. About 40% of the electricity used in Oregon comes from the region’s hydroelectric dams.

But ongoing drought, periods of low precipitation and rising summer temperatures that melt mountain snowpack too quickly have led to lower-than-usual power generating capacity at dams in the West.

Both Oregon and Washington generated 20% less hydropower in 2023 than they did in 2021, and hydropower generation in the Northwest dropped to a historic 22-year low between Oct. 2022 and Sept. 2023. Hydropower generated in 2024 was the lowest it’s been since 2010, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.

The loss in generating capacity has cost the hydropower industry billions in revenue in recent years, according to researchers from the University of Alabama. The sector lost about 300 million megawatt hours of power generation between 2003 and 2020 due to drought and low water compared with the long-term average, equating to about $28 billion in lost revenue. Half of the drop in power generation was due to drought in Oregon, Washington and California.

In Oregon, the hydroelectricity sector is estimated to have lost more than $1.5 billion in revenue over those 18 years.",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ColumbiaGale_01-1-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 14:15:28.191240

In a news release distributed Tuesday, Ben Prochazka, the executive director of the nonprofit Electrification Coalition said the bill “takes a sledgehammer” to North Carolina’s electric vehicle (EV) industry and would undo EV tax credits that have led to 16,300 jobs and $20.4 billion in investments in the state.

Among the provisions in current law that would be eliminated by the legislation:

a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of an eligible new EV

a 30% tax credit up to $100,000 per single item or $1,000 for eligible home refueling infrastructure

a credit that supports a portion of the cost of producing certain technologies

a credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of eligible commercial EVs under 14,000 pounds and up to $40,000 for those over 14,000 pounds

a credit of up to $4,000 for the purchase of an eligible used EV.

The bill “would eliminate critical tax credits that are spurring private-sector investments, supporting critical mineral supply chain development, creating American jobs and ensuring the United States remains competitive in the global automotive market,” Prochazka said in the statement. “Removing these credits would pull the rug out from under the auto and aligned battery industries at a critical time, immediately putting North Carolina jobs at risk. Industry needs policy certainty and consistency to build domestic and allied supply chains.”

The bill now heads to the Senate, where Prochazka said he hopes North Carolina Republican Sens. Thom Tillis and Ted Budd fight to preserve the EV credits.

The legislation also would implement a new car tax, which would levy an annual tax of $250 on owners of electric vehicles and $100 for owners of hybrid vehicles.

“While all drivers should pay their fair share, this proposal is nearly three times what the average driver pays in federal gas taxes, which have not covered the cost of infrastructure for nearly 20 years,” Prochazka said. “Rather than imposing a punitive tax on a subset of Americans, Congress should identify a fuel-neutral solution to the Highway Trust Fund’s structural insolvency.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EV-charger.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 14:14:28.488418

House Bill Includes Major Cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act

On May 21, the House of Representatives passed a budget reconciliation bill which includes major cuts to clean energy investments in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA, P.L. 117-169). This was part of the reconciliation process which fast tracks legislation related to federal spending and bypasses the filibuster in the Senate. When Congress passed the budget resolution at the end of February, it provided a blueprint for spending cuts to the relevant committees.

Passed in 2022, the historic IRA expanded and provided new clean energy tax credits. It also created loan and grant programs to support clean energy production, clean air, and environmental justice. Now lawmakers are targeting these programs for cuts to extend tax breaks for the wealthy.

Both the House Energy and Commerce Committee and Ways and Means Committee have jurisdiction over parts of the IRA. On May 11, the Energy and Commerce Committee released legislative text proposing sweeping cuts to IRA and energy programs totaling nearly $6.5 billion. This includes cuts to the Loan Programs Office at the Department of Energy, $75 million in cuts to the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program, $25 million to clean air grants for low-income communities, and many more. These programs are essential to building resilient clean energy systems and stewarding our environment.

The House Ways and Means Committee released its legislative text on May 12, taking aim at the IRA’s clean energy tax credits which have spurred the creation of more than 400,000 new jobs. The legislation would end tax credits that lower the cost of home clean energy and home weatherization projects, and credits for electric vehicle purchases. It would also phase out tax credits that incentivize clean energy manufacturing. These proposed cuts and phase outs threaten energy affordability for working families across the U.S.

After passing out of the House, the bill now makes its way to the Senate for consideration.

Trump Administration Dismisses Scientists Working on National Climate Report

At the end of April, the Trump administration fired nearly all of the 400 scientists that work on the National Climate Assessment. Released every four years, the National Climate Assessment addresses the impacts of climate change on the United States. The report is congressionally mandated under the Global Change Research Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-606). This report helps federal and state policy officials, business leaders, public health officials, and community planners integrate the risks of climate change into the work that they do. Ahead of the sixth edition, set to be published in 2027, the administration says it will be evaluating the “scope” of the next report.

A question that has been rocketing around the mahjongg tables at CleanTechnica global headquarters is, how will this price war affect Tesla in the Chinese market?","Last Updated on:

BYD is the tail that wags the dog in the Chinese new car market. It sells more “new energy vehicles” — which in China means plug-in hybrids and battery-electrics — than any other company. It is also pursuing an aggressive export strategy in many major markets around the world. When BYD sneezes, everyone else catches a cold.

This week, BYD announced sweeping price cuts of up to 34%, a move that has sent shock waves through the domestic industry and sent stock valuations — including its own — tumbling. On May 23, 2025, BYD announced it was reducing prices on 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models through the end of June. The starting price for the BYD Seagull was rolled back 20% to 55,800 yuan ($7,780). The dual motor Han PHEV was cut by 34% to 102,800 yuan ($15,000), according to CNBC.

“We expect BYD’s vehicle margin would be under pressure in the short term as I think this move by them is driven by the need to hit their sales targets,” Victor Sun, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said, as quoted by CNBC. He added that he expects the company to “offset the impact via larger sales scale and battery cost staying low” regardless of whether its sales campaign is extended beyond the end of June.

Bloomberg analyst Tim Hsiao said the new pricing plan may spark a “prolonged price war,” that could have ripple effects that extend into into the second half of this year. Other brands will have to either increase their own discounts or concede market share, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Joanna Chen.

What Is The BYD Game Plan?

At issue is whether the push for “new energy vehicles” by the Chinese government is beginning to lose steam. In April, the Xingyuan compact hatchback from Geely became the top-selling model in the country, overtaking the BYD Seagull. Smartphone maker Xiaomi also is continuing its into the auto sector, despite a serious setback earlier this year when a family was killed riding in one of its cars. Nevertheless, Ford CEO Jim Farley drove a Xiaomi sedan for 6 months in and around Detroit and told everyone within earshot the car was so good, he didn’t want to stop driving it.

The price war may devastate German manufacturers such as Volkswagen, Mercedes, and BMW, all of whom have have suffered declining sales in China partly because they refused to cut the prices of the models they sell in China to the same extent as their Chinese rivals. As they say in Sales Training 101, the three most important words in sales are the price, the price, and the price. Adding to those woes, Chinese drivers prefer Chinese brands that better suit their tastes. Tesla has also seen a decline in sales in China, with deliveries of cars manufactured at its assembly plant in Shanghai down for a seventh consecutive month in April. All in all, 2025 has not been a good year for Western manufacturers.

Morningstar’s Victor Sun told CNBC, “Retail discount levels stayed at high levels in the first quarter of 2025. With the expected prolonged price war, we believe the sector’s profitability will remain under some strain in the near term,” In a research note on May 26, auto analysts at Citi said they are not concerned that BYD’s price cuts would result in fewer sales for its competitors. Instead, they expect “robust sales growth” for “new energy vehicle” companies if prices remain below 200,000 yuan ($28,000) as “competition remains relatively mild.

The Zero Mileage Used Car

One area of concern for Chinese officials is the sale of so-called “zero mileage” used cars. Bloomberg’s Linda Lew explains that some manufacturers may be padding their sales numbers by reporting cars as sold that are in fact being distributed to finance companies and used car dealers. They are, in fact, new cars but appear in the used car market as cars with no miles on their odometers. The manufacturers record them as sales even though they are not purchased by end users.

On Sunday, May 25, China’s Ministry of Commerce summoned some of the country’s biggest automakers to a meeting on May 27 to discuss the practice. Attendance was not optional. The meeting also included industry organizations such as the China Automobile Dealers Association and online car distribution channels, according to a memo shared by Li Yanwei, an official at the dealers’ association, on Weibo.

Whether the tactic is legal or not in China, we cannot say. But it may be masking a slowdown in NEV sales in China and that is very much of a concern to Chinese officials.”‘Zero-mileage” cars came to public attention last week when Great Wall chairman Wei Jianjun warned of an unhealthy outlook for China’s car industry as the result of a price war that has now been ongoing in China for several years. Many see it as a race to the bottom, but others see it as the intended result of pure capitalism, as competition will weed out the weaker companies and benefit the survivors.

Playing The Long Game

Some readers may recall at the end of 2023, prices for lithium used to make batteries for electric cars had risen into the stratosphere. Then CATL, the largest battery maker in the world, suddenly announced it was slashing the prices of its batteries in anticipation of a significant decrease in the price of lithium. Within a few months, the price of lithium did indeed plummet and CATL got the yearly award for marketplace prescience.

China is still a place of great mystery. How BYD came up with the plan to dramatically reduce prices may never be known, but in the long run, BYD may turn out to be crazy like a fox after it drives some of its competitors out of business.

BYD has over 100,000 engineers on its payroll, which has allowed it to make several major announcements lately. First, it said it had developed an EV battery that could be recharged from 10 to 80% in 5 minutes. Second, it released its God’s Eye automatic driver assistance technology and made the most basic version of it standard equipment on all model priced at more than 100,000 yuan ($13,900). Some of the recently discounted models include cars equipped with the basic version of the God’s Eye ADAS suite.

The squeeze play is on in China and there is no way of telling who will win and who will lose. We have to assume before making this move, BYD thought its business strategy through and this is more than a “hold my beer” moment by founder and chairman Wang Chuanfu. A question that has been rocketing around the mahjongg tables at CleanTechnica global headquarters is, how will this price war affect Tesla in the Chinese market?

StarPlus Energy, the partnership between Stellantis and Korean battery maker Samsung SDI, has agreed to recognize the union as representing the 420 workers at the site, the UAW said in a news release. The organizing victory is a product of the 2023 contract between the union and Stellantis following a 44-day targeted strike, which paved the way for the card check system at the Kokomo plant by having the maker of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram lease employees to the joint venture.

“The UAW members at StarPlus stood up to make sure battery jobs are good union jobs,” Dave Green, UAW Region 2B director, said in a statement. “Workers in Indiana and across the region, know they deserve fair wages, workplace protections, and the dignity that UAW members have been fighting for the last 90 years. As a union family, they need to know that we’re going to have their back every step of the way.”

The UAW's success in Kokomo stands in contrast to efforts to organize EV battery workers at BlueOval SK in Glendale, Kentucky. Ford Motor Co. didn't agree to a card check system at BlueOval SK Battery Park, which encompasses two battery plants jointly owned with Korean battery maker SK On Co. Ltd. In January, the UAW requested a National Labor Relations Board vote at the site after a ""supermajority"" of employees there signed authorization cards in November. A vote, however, still hasn't been held with the union accusing the company of dragging out the process and intimidating workers, some of whom have accused the company of hazardous working conditions.

StarPlus began production in Kokomo earlier this year. Stellantis announced plans in 2022 for a first battery plant in the city where it already has powertrain and transmission production. It was expected to spend at least $2.5 billion on the 33-gigawatt hour plant and create 1,400 jobs. In 2023, it said it would build a second $3.2 billion, 34-gigwatt hour plant set to open in 2027 there with 1,400 jobs.

""Stellantis-leased employees at the StarPlus Energy facility in Kokomo, Indiana, have completed a union organizing card check process, demonstrating majority support for representation by the United Auto Workers (UAW),"" Stellantis spokesperson Jodi Tinson said in a statement. ""In accordance with established procedures, the UAW has been recognized as the employees’ exclusive bargaining representative.""

StarPlus Energy joins battery workers under the UAW at Ultium Cells LLC, the joint venture between General Motors Co. and LG Energy Solution Ltd. The union has organized plants in Lordstown, Ohio, and Spring Hill, Tennessee, also by a card check system, and has celebrated wage increase and other benefits improvements since its representation at those sites began.

StarPlus Energy, the partnership between Stellantis and Korean battery maker Samsung SDI, has agreed to recognize the union as representing the 420 workers at the site, the UAW said in a news release. The organizing victory is a product of the 2023 contract between the union and Stellantis following a 44-day targeted strike, which paved the way for the card check system at the Kokomo plant by having the maker of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram lease employees to the joint venture.

“The UAW members at StarPlus stood up to make sure battery jobs are good union jobs,” Dave Green, UAW Region 2B director, said in a statement. “Workers in Indiana and across the region, know they deserve fair wages, workplace protections, and the dignity that UAW members have been fighting for the last 90 years. As a union family, they need to know that we’re going to have their back every step of the way.”

The UAW's success in Kokomo stands in contrast to efforts to organize EV battery workers at BlueOval SK in Glendale, Kentucky. Ford Motor Co. didn't agree to a card check system at BlueOval SK Battery Park, which encompasses two battery plants jointly owned with Korean battery maker SK On Co. Ltd. In January, the UAW requested a National Labor Relations Board vote at the site after a ""supermajority"" of employees there signed authorization cards in November. A vote, however, still hasn't been held with the union accusing the company of dragging out the process and intimidating workers, some of whom have accused the company of hazardous working conditions.

StarPlus began production in Kokomo earlier this year. Stellantis announced plans in 2022 for a first battery plant in the city where it already has powertrain and transmission production. It was expected to spend at least $2.5 billion on the 33-gigawatt hour plant and create 1,400 jobs. In 2023, it said it would build a second $3.2 billion, 34-gigwatt hour plant set to open in 2027 there with 1,400 jobs.

""Stellantis-leased employees at the StarPlus Energy facility in Kokomo, Indiana, have completed a union organizing card check process, demonstrating majority support for representation by the United Auto Workers (UAW),"" Stellantis spokesperson Jodi Tinson said in a statement. ""In accordance with established procedures, the UAW has been recognized as the employees’ exclusive bargaining representative.""

StarPlus Energy joins battery workers under the UAW at Ultium Cells LLC, the joint venture between General Motors Co. and LG Energy Solution Ltd. The union has organized plants in Lordstown, Ohio, and Spring Hill, Tennessee, also by a card check system, and has celebrated wage increase and other benefits improvements since its representation at those sites began.

Galvanised by a myriad of factors – including consumer demand, decarbonisation efforts and other sustainability regulation, and a desire to innovate – OEMs have now created a landscape where EVs are commonplace on our roads and are a viable alternative for consumers traditional ICE vehicles

However, the industry has been quick to realise that EVs bring with them their own logistical challenges, especially when also factoring in batteries. From rethinking cargo flows to digitalising key processes, logistics teams have approached challenges from a variety of angles – read on for assessments and guidance from industry experts that will continue to be updated as more insights are shared.

Tony Stinsa at International on the importance of considering EV design when deciding FVL

The problems faced by the International team when looking at their BEV truck supply chain are indicative of the core problem faced by EV logistics teams – that is, transposing existing ICE frameworks over to EV won’t work.

Speaking at the Finished Vehicle Logistics North America conference earlier this year, Tony Stinsa, director of inbound and finished vehicle logistics at International, explained that the traditional means of transporting their Class 4-8 trucks often involves a deck-set approach, with one truck towing the rest. However, refuelling the lead truck becomes a problem when it’s an EV column as charging infrastructure is not as common as petrol stations. Similarly, Stinsa also points to EV design as also being an issue his team have faced. For one, the BEV trucks are heavier than their ICE counterparts, while the apparatus typically used to connect the truck rails can be blocked by the battery infrastructure.

Stinsa goes onto describe reactive and proactive measures that have been undertaken, and suggests that the latter should be more widely adopted. Reactive measures involve utilising existing ICE shipments, or combined shipments, to facilitate the transportation of BEV trucks. The more frequent refuelling infrastructure of the ICE trucks allows for better freight optimisation as the deck-set column is not limited to routes with charge stations. As for proactive measure, Stinsa argues that discussions on FVL need to “move way up into the development cycle”, with logistics teams being able to give feedback throughout the design process. By incorporating transportation parameters as early as possible, efficient and effective FVL can be ensured – an idea that’s worth adopting more widely.

Amy Paulsen at GM on how to ensure agility in EV logistics, even at scale

Amy Paulsen, director of finished vehicle logistics at GM, also looks at the importance of feedback and communication in the EV supply chain, and explores how the adoption of new technologies to do so can create a higher degree of flexibility.

Another common challenge in the EV logistics space is battery health and the state of charge throughout the supply chain. Paulsen states that monitoring these issues is crucial and so has introduced measures to maintain vigilance. Part of this involves an increased reliance on digital tools and quantifiable metrics. Using telematics to monitor charge throughout the battery’s journey allows the team to collect analysable data that can, in turn, be used to identify and remedy any problems – ensuring any risks are mitigated as quickly and as effectively as possible.

Paulsen also explores to the efficiency of communication and collaboration as being integral to GM’s flexibility in its EV logistics. With a network as vast as GM’s, there is a necessity to ensure that internal and external information flows are as optimised as possible, and Paulsen reveals that the secret for doing so is simply “transparency”. Sharing when there is “a plan… and problems” has facilitated a level of trust and understanding that Paulsen and her team can leverage to help mitigate any disruption. She points to the “very strong partnerships” with third party charging companies as an example of the benefits it can have in the EV space, and is a good reminder for other companies that talking to people and building relationships is key.

Javier Valdez at Paccar Mexico on having a “just in case” mindset

Speaking at ALSC Mexico 2024, Javier Valadez, director of operations at Paccar Mexico surmised that the “most expensive” thing to happen to an OEM is not having its products available. This is especially pertinent in the EV and battery space, as the landscape is very cost- and price-sensitive.

To combat this, Valdez recommends a mentality shift born out of disruption caused by the Covid pandemic – “think not only on having a just-in-time supply chain, but [the] just-in-case availability of your components.” Doing so will allow manufacturers to keep up production in the face of demand fluctuation or disruption in the flows from n-tier suppliers. He argues that it’s better to spend more on warehousing and be “a little overstocked” than lose business because of reduced production and delivery. This idea goes against the industry standard of just-in-time production and so is an interesting proposition for EV manufacturers.

He also discusses the role of international and regional legislature for EV supply chains. The USMCA agreement has been integral at reinforcing the auto trade between its three members – although, there are currently fears as to its continued success as it is up for review in 2026. However, Valdez argues that the regulations and legislature that form part of the agreement are integral in examining the “regional value” of an approach and has become a “major decision maker” in the adoption of new suppliers – a worthy reminder to any potential partner on the importance on keeping qualifications up to date.

Monica Garcia at GM explains the benefits of being challenged in EV logistics

Monica Garcia, GM’s director of global purchasing and supply chain in Mexico, also spoke at ALSC Mexico 2024. In her Red Sofa interview, she reiterated the importance of communication and collaboration with partners for EVs and batteries but approached it from a slightly different angle.

Whereas fellow Paulsen spoke about the benefits of transparent lateral and operations-focused communication, Garcia instead examines it from a more strategic standpoint. She wants GM’s partners to “challenge the way [they] are doing things” by suggesting alternatives or presenting ideas seen elsewhere in the market. In creating this discourse, “new ways of working together” can be created, which in turn can lead to improvements in network design and risk minimisation. As part of this, suppliers are encouraged to invest in innovation and take the initiative. This approach is worthwhile advice, as it strengthens the working relationships between OEMs and their suppliers, while facilitating future growth and development.

Garcia also points to “stability and continuity” as also being integral factors to effective collaboration. This can be achieved though strengthening relationships, but this is futile without delivery. With that in mind, suppliers can take solace in GM’s commitment to improving its EV and battery supply chain through nearshoring battery production. In the last year, GM has announced new plans for a new US-based battery plant, as well as unveiling a new EV and battery roadmap. This commitment to EV supply chain development sends a message to suppliers, clients and partners that stability is achievable and expected, and is the sort of message that OEMs should be encouraging if they want to strengthen their appeal to logistics partners.

Criss Edwards at Unipart on the role of 3PL players in EV FVL

The previous few Red Sofas have been great at getting the OEM perspective, but it’s also useful to learn more about how their logistics partners view the EV and battery space.

Criss Edwards, president and managing director North America at Unipart, describes there being a “massive transformation” in the automotive sector, driven by EVs, AI and autonomous vehicles, and nearshoring and localisation. Looking at EVs, he explains that one cause for this transformation is that the EV market has not grown in a “straight line” – rather, it’s been a “very dynamic situation”. A lower percentage market share growth for EVs compared to OEM expectations has led to manufacturers having to move away from set plans and adjust. “OEMs will have to manage… two independent, in-parallel supply chains” in response, one for ICE vehicles and one for EVs.

He goes onto to discuss the role that 3PLs can play in helping to manage this problem. They can leverage their networks and assets to make changes at speed, adjusting their cargo flows to meet OEM needs at that time. This expands beyond freight flows and is applicable to warehousing and storage. Edwards explains that both EVs and ICE vehicles are at risk of becoming slow-moving inventory depending on market demand at the time, becoming lost revenue for OEMs. 3PLs can utilise inventory forecasting and replenishment tool help counteract this, pivoting stock allocation to match demand. By working with 3PL, OEMs can ensure their supply chain maintains “flexibility, predictability [and] reliability” in the face of volatile markets and fluctuating EV demand – especially useful as uncertainty seems to be on the rise.

Paulo Monteiro at Volkswagen Group of America cracks the code on integrating software awareness into EV logistics

One recurring discussion point surrounding EVs that has been present for years is the concern around the software inside the car. Awareness of the coding creating this software is something that OEMs should also factor into their logistics network from the very start of the car’s production, explains Paulo Monteiro, head of Logistics, VW Group of America Chattanooga Operations, at ALSC Mexico 2024.

As the Chattanooga plant has diversified its output, the electronic complexity of the models has increased – the Passat had “about 30 modules”, the Atlas “jumped to about 90 modules”, and the currently produced ID.4 has “over 150”, which translates to “100 million lines of code”. This amount of coding is a monumental task in and of itself, but any issues can have serious knock-on impacts for logistics. Monteiro explains that each module must have the same generation, or the car will not start. Each module therefore needs to be verified ahead of production, leading to “additional difficulty” in processes.

However, now that processes are in place to check validity, these can be shared with other plants within the Group. Monteiro points to this level of collaboration and communication as being integral to the success of EV production and logistics. A standardised platform allows the Chattanooga plant to access parts using the entirety of the Group’s global supply chain. Doing so improves resiliency in the supply chain, as it facilitates increased flexibility, with Monteiro using a recent example of the plant bringing over parts from Europe after a domestic supplier couldn’t meet demand. A situation that could have been disastrous for the plant was negated by the global part accessibility afforded by a standardised strategy.

Saba Azizi at CATL explores the benefits that digitalisation can have for the EV market

Like most facets of the automotive industry, operations surrounding EVs and batteries have become increasingly digitalised. Speaking at Automotive Logistics and Supply Chain Digital Strategies Europe last year, Saba Azizi, overseas service network and development manager for CATL, discussed how carmakers can best leverage digitalisation in EV aftermarket logistics.

With a market share as significant as CATL’s, a core driver for continued success is keeping customers “satisfied, happy and loyal” and Azizi explains that digitalising the battery-maker’s service network platform has allowed them to achieve these targets. In creating an accessible hub for all the information surrounding services, including partner management details and technician certification, CATL can offer its customers a “consistent and transparent service.” This is especially pertinent as, although there may be increasing uncertainty surrounding EV markets, CATL are heavily investing in new battery production facilities across the world in response to increasingly regional production efforts. Considering these factors, increasing digitalisation in EV and battery operations is a useful means of maintaining efficiency and effectiveness.

Another useful lesson from Azizi’s Red Sofa is that the human side of logistics planning should never be forgotten. She promotes creating teams where everyone has a “different background or perspective” to ensure that there is a diversity in ideas. Creating this sort of environment allows for better “creativity and adaptability” in the face of uncertainty and a changing automotive landscape, bringing value to this important reminder.

Haley Wilson at Navistar on leveraging group dynamics in cross border EV logistics

Haley Wilson, logistics director at Navistar, sat down on the Red Sofa at ALSC Mexico last year at a time when Navistar had recently joined the Volkswagen Group of America. As such, her interview focuses on how an individual company can best utilise its sister companies and wider Group network to improve operational efficiency.

For one, Wilson describes the ability to tap into the wider Groups’ experience in producing and shipping EV models as “very helpful”, as it allows the company to identify issues that have already been encountered and create best practices to counter them without having to commit to lengthy trial-and-error or analysis procedures themselves. By adopting strategies that have worked for other companies in the Group, they can adapt to and overcome common challenges at speed. Like with increased digitalisation, this can be very beneficial for EV producers as regional flows and established production routes are in flux.

Similarly, Wilson also points to the increased supplier and logistics networks that come with being in a Group as being a significant advantage. She uses the example of Navistar leveraging fellow Traton Group member Scania to establish a cargo flow from their European hubs to Navistar’s US-based site. Such opportunities can be crucial at maintaining a solid cargo flow, and so the example acts a good reminder on the importance of communication between sister companies.

Oliver Bilstein at BMW outlines how plant logistics need to adapt to increased EV and battery output

Oliver Bilstein, vice-president of production control, logistics and material control at BMW Manufacturing in the US, sat down on the Red Sofa and explained how the BMW Spartanburg plant is adapting to increased electrification.

Part of this involves planning new logistics flows including inbound and outbound, but it also involves designing mature control processes for new components. This is an area that can be critical in introducing EV lines. As Monteiro outlined in his Red Sofa, there needs to be a holistic approach to parts production and assembly to avoid any late-stage crises. By planning these processes from the ground up, while also considering how they can be balanced alongside ongoing production lines, OEMs can ensure that planned EV expansion is carried out effectively.

For the Spartanburg plant, one approach to maintaining in-plant efficiency in the face of expansion and electrification is using automation – autonomous systems from the “building bricks” in Bilstein’s strategy to “bring logistics to the next level”. Such systems run through a centralised data hub which allows the team to teach and assign them new tasks with relative ease, facilitating quicker and smoother adaptation to new processes. While not every EV and battery plant might not have access to such systems, it is worth investigating their application.

Paulina Chmielarz at JLR discusses how digital strategies can be used to combat increased regulatory complexity

Paulina Chmielarz, director of Digital & Innovation at JLR, sits down on the Red Sofa and explains how increased electrification plays into JLR’s wider ‘Reimagine’ strategy, and discusses how such a shift requires a different approach to traditional ICE vehicle logistics.

She reflects that the traceability of traditional ICE engines through the value chain is “quite stable”, with established processes and regulations. For EVs, however, the regulations surrounding are much more granular – “it’s not tracing serial numbers through the supply chain, it’s tracing serial numbers of each weld and each cell.” Such an increase in monitoring has taken some adjustment, but Chmielarz points to technology as a means to achieve this watchfulness.

A common avenue for this is using AI for predicting and forecasting, but Chmierlarz presents an alternative approach that could be quite beneficial. She instead asks if AI software can help “literally relive yesterday”, using it to recreate scenarios where disruption may have occurred but not all the data needed for an analysis is available. Using AI to plug the gaps of missing information allows increased for increased analysis and “proper problem solving”. This approach is less common that future-looking AI uses, such as forecasting tools, but can offer valuable insight for both OEMs and LSPs, and so should be more widely considered.",https://d3n5uof8vony13.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/8/5/9/332859_tonystinsaredsofa_272052.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 15:14:34.929856

Erv knows his Tesla costs more.","Are EVs truly a cost-saving revolution? Or are they just fancy gadgets with a hidden price tag?

One Reddit user, armed with spreadsheets, has taken it upon himself to track the cost per mile of his Tesla Model 3 and Chevy Bolt against his trusty, old-school Toyota Corolla.

The results are surprisingly counterintuitive, shattering some common EV myths and revealing a few hard truths about the cost of owning an electric car.

50,000-Mile Cost Breakdown of Tesla Model 3 vs. Chevy Bolt vs. Toyota Corolla

Erv, shared some insights and data on r/electricvehicles after driving 50,000 miles across a Tesla Model 3 and Chevy Bolt EUV. The kicker? His old Toyota Corolla still beats them both in one crucial metric.

""I have a separate meter for my 2023 Tesla Model 3 RWD that I use to track energy use, efficiency, cost (and cost-savings), etc., and compare back to very detailed data I kept on my previous ICE car.

Given I've now driven >30,000 miles, it felt like a good time to share the data, and because I had it, I also shared comparisons to the Bolt EUV.

*I benchmarked the fuel costs against my prior car, a Toyota Corolla, which got 33.17 mpg over the 100,000+ miles I tracked it, and I also benchmarked against current gas prices, which in my area have been roughly $3/gallon, but I am using nuanced monthly averages for my state. I also bake in a $30 oil change per 5,000 miles as ""fuel"".

**I also calculated the portion of my savings that is due to taxes I'm not paying at the pump (0.285+0.184 per gallon) - which is relevant politically given we can expect a $250/year EV surcharge to attempt to ""close that loophole"", which for me, looks to be ""fair"" if it were state + federal, but just being federal and combined with my state's surcharge ($75), it is not.

I have insurance, tabs, depreciation, maintenance, as well but wanted to focus on ""fuel"". Those costs are all higher than the Corolla due to the Tesla (and Bolt) being much newer cars (and fully insured instead of minimally insured), and the heightened costs do offset the fuel savings for now. I'll be curious to see over 100,000+ miles how the total cost to own tightens u,p and I expect the Tesla to win out.

Currently, depreciation/any cost of the vehicle, the Tesla is already winning at 15c/mile vs. the Corolla's 16c/mile due to the cheaper maintenance and fuel despite the higher insurance and tabs. But taking into account depreciation changes, that comparison to $0.34 vs. $0.20 in favor of the Corolla, for now. Which is a price I'm comfortable paying for enhanced safety, comfort, etc.

EFFICIENCY

Because it's always interesting to discuss - this is my ""efficiency"" based on the electricity I am actually paying for, so it includes losses (and I am adding in charging away from home, but that's been extremely minimal). The Tesla itself reports a different number: 239 Mi/kWh (vs 296), which is partially due to losses and partially due to the car not reporting preconditioning. Similarly, the Tesla app says 8,771 kWh charged vs. I have logged 9,028 (a 3% variance), which tells me the 20% variance on Mi/kWh is primarily preconditioning and not charging losses, which is surprising given I do not precondition very frequently and I do not use Sentry. I charge L2.""

Tesla Model 3 vs. Chevy Bolt EUV: Performance, Range, and Space Comparison

The Tesla Model 3 offers a dual-motor all-wheel-drive system producing 460 horsepower, achieving 0–60 mph in 2.9 seconds, with an EPA-estimated range of up to 342 miles. In contrast, the Chevrolet Bolt EUV features a single front-mounted motor delivering 200 horsepower, reaching 0–60 mph in approximately 7 seconds, and provides an EPA-estimated range of 247 miles.

The Model 3, a compact sedan, offers 97 cubic feet of passenger volume and 24 cubic feet of cargo space. The Bolt EUV, a subcompact crossover, provides similar passenger volume at 97 cubic feet but offers slightly less cargo space at 16.3 cubic feet.

Tesla's Model 3 includes a minimalist interior with a 15-inch touchscreen interface, advanced driver-assistance features, and access to Tesla's Supercharger network. The Bolt EUV comes equipped with Chevrolet's infotainment system, supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and offers GM's Super Cruise hands-free driving technology on compatible roads.

The 2025 Tesla Model 3 starts at approximately $42,490, positioning it in the premium EV segment. The Chevrolet Bolt EUV offered a more affordable entry point, with prices starting around $27,800, making it one of the most budget-friendly electric vehicles available at the time of its release.

Erv, in the kind of methodical tone that could make an actuary swoon, detailed everything: kilowatt-hours, miles per gallon equivalent (MPGe), oil changes priced to the penny, and even the political nuances of gas taxes and EV surcharges.

According to his logs, the Model 3 RWD clocked in at 15 cents per mile in fuel and maintenance. The Bolt? Slightly worse. But even those figures paled next to his dearly departed Corolla, which, once depreciation was factored in, ran just 20 cents per mile overall. The Tesla ballooned to 34 cents. That’s not a minor difference.

Depreciation and Maintenance, How Reddit Users React to True EV Ownership Costs

The Reddit horde, predictably, pounced. One commenter, Hsaphoto, praised the inclusion of depreciation: the forgotten financial bogeyman. Another, neutralpoliticsbot, scoffed at the $30 oil change estimate with a sarcastic “$30 oil change where?”, the internet equivalent of flipping a table.

Erv held the line, citing years of discount coupons and standard oil. Welcome to Reddit, where every car becomes a case study and every assumption gets litigated like a class-action suit.

Beyond the Spreadsheet, User-Reported Efficiency and Cost Highlights from Bolt and Hybrid Owners

One Bolt owner, Low_Thanks_1540, bragged about getting 5.1 mi/kWh in Detroit, averaging just 3 cents per mile. Another user brought their Ford Maverick hybrid into the ring, reporting a paltry $0.129 per mile in operating costs. Suddenly, the Model 3's efficiency crown didn’t feel quite so regal.

The Tesla still wins where it matters to many, comfort, safety, and long-term efficiency. It delivered 114 MPGe versus the Bolt’s 103, despite colder temps and nearly 11,000 more miles logged. And with LFP batteries under the floorboards and a 239 mi/kWh efficiency reported by the car itself (after adjusting for preconditioning losses), the Model 3 proved not only cost-effective but technologically superior. As one user noted, “It’s well documented that the Tesla Model 3 RWD is more efficient than a Bolt with all things being equal.” The key phrase is that all things being equal, which in the real world, they rarely are.

MPGe Demystified, How EPA’s Miles-Per-Gallon-Equivalent Rating Works for EV Buyers

MPGe is determined by equating the energy content of electricity to that of gasoline. Specifically, 33.7 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity is considered equivalent to one gallon of gasoline. To calculate MPGe, the distance an electric vehicle can travel on 33.7 kWh is measured, allowing for a comparison with traditional miles-per-gallon (MPG) ratings of gasoline vehicles.

MPGe was introduced to provide consumers with a familiar metric to compare the energy efficiency of electric vehicles (EVs) to that of internal combustion engine vehicles. By translating electric energy consumption into a gasoline-equivalent format, it aims to simplify the decision-making process for potential EV buyers.

While MPGe offers a standardized measure, it doesn't account for various real-world factors such as driving habits, terrain, climate conditions, and accessory usage (like air conditioning), all of which can significantly impact an EV's actual efficiency. Consequently, two vehicles with similar MPGe ratings might perform differently under everyday driving conditions.

MPGe focuses solely on the energy consumed by the vehicle during operation, neglecting the efficiency and environmental impact of electricity generation and transmission. For instance, electricity produced from renewable sources has a different environmental footprint compared to that generated from fossil fuels, but MPGe does not differentiate between them.

Still, the most revealing part of this Reddit saga was the emotional math. Erv knows his Tesla costs more. He admits it. But he’s comfortable paying that premium for the intangible upgrades, refined ride, cleaner footprint, and the sense that he’s driving the future. That, right there, is the fine print most car reviews miss. We’re not always chasing the cheapest ride. Sometimes, we’re chasing the one that feels right. Even if it costs 14 cents more per mile.

Shifts in Car Ownership

So what does this all mean? It means the automotive world is no longer defined solely by horsepower and leather trim. It’s defined by kilowatt-hours, tax credits, and Reddit threads that dissect your every mile like a neurosurgeon studying a brain scan.

The EV revolution forces you to confront what you value, numbers or nuance, cost or conscience. And if you’re still wondering whether to switch, don’t just take it from the marketing brochures. Sit down with the math geniuses in the back booth of Reddit and let them show you what owning an EV actually costs.

Because in the end, the Tesla might feel like the future, the Bolt might get you there frugally, and the Corolla? That humble little gas-sipper might still be the most honest ride of all.

The data center industry has striven to address this by showcasing the many benefits of digital infrastructure, lately beginning to bring our own power to the table, and by advocating for how our infrastructure can help shape a more resilient grid.

Power generation and distribution started long before the data centers or the internet existed. In the early days, power plants manually controlled generation and local distribution without anything we’d recognize today as “digital communication.” Operators used mechanical gauges, manual switches, telegraphs, and direct human coordination to run the grids.

However, today’s power grids are far more complex, integrating thousands of plants, renewables, storage systems, microgrids, and millions of endpoints as the majority of our modern world (including data centers) relies on electricity. This complexity depends on fast, reliable, and centralized communication systems, like SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) networks, which run via internet and private data transfer systems. Data centers aren’t just reliant on this grid complexity, but in fact host and process the real-time data that grid operators need to balance supply and demand instantaneously.

A mid-sized utility might need between 1-5 MW of capacity to support operational, customer data, and regulatory needs. Additionally, as mission critical entities, utilities often require higher uptime such as Tier 3 redundancy, which further increases space and power requirements. There are over 3000 power utilities in the US that provide electricity to more than 140 million rate-payers, including investor-owned utilities, public power utilities, and rural cooperatives, each serving different regions and customer bases across the country.

The Data-Hungry Power Grid: Flipping the Script

The IT footprint for power grids may not seem like much compared to other data center tenants, but it’s certainly on the rise as more sensored devices are deployed and utilities begin to incorporate AI-backed algorithms into their operations. Additional considerations include:

Data Growth: According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the volume of data generated by the grid is expected to increase exponentially as more smart meters, distributed energy resources, and IoT devices come online.

Cybersecurity: With this digital transformation, data centers also play a vital role in cybersecurity. Utility data centers are at the frontlines of defending against cyber threats that could disrupt critical infrastructure.

Resilience and Decarbonization: Data centers are helping utilities integrate renewable energy and distributed resources, providing the computational muscle for real-time grid balancing, forecasting, and demand response programs.

Interdependency: The relationship is symbiotic. While data centers depend on reliable power, modern grids increasingly depend on data centers for analytics, automation, and control.

So it’s worth pondering - and flipping the script: What would the power grid look like if data centers were not backing utility infrastructure? Would we be able to integrate renewables at scale, respond to outages in real time, or defend against cyber threats as effectively?

Grid Management

For starters, grid management would be far less efficient and resilient. Utility operators would be forced to rely on outdated manual oversight, resulting in slower reaction times and delayed response to outages. Accurate forecasting of demand would be severely hampered, making it difficult to balance supply and demand, especially as more intermittent power sources and endpoints come online.

Blackouts would become far more frequent. Today’s advanced distribution grids employ fiber-optic sensors, edge computing, and centralized data centers to detect faults and reroute power automatically. Rapid FDIR (fault detection, isolation, and response) depends on real-time data flowing through the utility’s communications network and being processed in high-availability data centers. Without this digital backbone, utilities would struggle to restore faults quickly, leading to prolonged outages and greater risk to public safety.

Wildfire mitigation presents a striking example of how data centers and cloud platforms have transformed gird management. This life-threatening scenario has been especially prevalent in driving innovation in using cloud-based analytics to protect communities, with platforms that provide localized alerts, support evacuation planning, and share real-time risk data with first responders and the public. AI-powered risk modeling can help predict fire weather conditions with a 90% accuracy by merging satellite data, vegetation maps, and grid telemetry. This data-driven approach influences dynamic safety shutoff protocols to balance preemptive shutdowns with minimal rate-payer disruption, adjusting in real time based on evolving grid conditions.

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) emphasizes that grid reliability now hinges on digital infrastructure and real-time analytics, which are only possible with robust data center support. And the U.S. Department of Energy notes that the integration of distributed energy resources, demand response, and grid automation all depend on centralized data processing and storage. While this is not unknown, it is underrepresented as data centers showcase their value to society at large.

Microgrids and Decentralized Generation

Communication between local grids is entirely dependent on digital infrastructure to coordinate energy flows, manage distributed resources, and ensure seamless transitions between grid-connected and islanded operations. Data centers and cloud platforms serve as the nerve centers for these decentralized systems, processing vast amounts of real-time data from sensors, smart inverters, and distributed energy resources (DERs).

With new grid-edge technologies and microgrid advancements, decentralized solutions are fundamentally reshaping power distribution. The integration of DERs, including rooftop solar, wind, battery energy storage, and intelligent behind-the-meter systems enables local grids to stabilize themselves during outages or disturbances. None of this would be possible without an incredible communications network to automate power flow. This level of coordination and automation is only possible with robust communications networks and powerful data processing capabilities.

Data centers and cloud-based platforms optimize microgrid performance by aggregating and analyzing data from diverse sources: renewable generation, storage assets, and demand response systems. Advanced algorithms can forecast local supply and demand, dispatch resources in real time, and even enable peer-to-peer energy trading within communities. During grid emergencies, microgrids can automatically “island” from the main grid, keeping critical facilities powered—an operation that relies on split-second digital coordination.

As the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) observes, the proliferation of distributed energy resources requires advanced data analytics and control platforms to ensure grid reliability and maximize the value of renewables. Without the computational power and connectivity provided by data centers, the promise of resilient, decentralized energy would remain out of reach.

Renewable Integration

The inherent variability of solar and wind energy production demands fast, automated management to maintain grid stability. Cloud computing is, therefore, vital for renewable energy management, providing the scalable and flexible resources needed to handle fluctuating power inputs.

Modern grids rely on sophisticated forecasting algorithms, real-time monitoring systems, and advanced control technologies to balance renewable energy supply with demand. For example, cloud-based analytics can predict solar and wind output based on weather patterns and historical data, allowing grid operators to adjust generation and transmission accordingly. Additionally, energy storage systems are optimized using cloud platforms, storing excess renewable energy when production is high and releasing it when demand peaks or renewable output drops.

Without the digital infrastructure provided by data centers and cloud platforms, it would be impossible to integrate large amounts of intermittent renewable energy sources reliably. Advanced control systems require continuous data processing, machine learning, and high-speed communications to ensure grid stability in the face of fluctuating supply.

In short, power would still be possible without data centers, but modern energy systems rely heavily on the digital backbone that data centers and communications networks provide. Without it, we’d revert to much simpler, less reliable, less renewable, and more manually controlled grids, unable to harness the full potential of today’s technological advancements.","https://img.datacenterfrontier.com/files/base/ebm/datacenterfrontier/image/2025/05/6835f50d975c3e88fe50b6ac-dreamstime_xxl_358172703.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-05-27 14:16:08.719804

ZeroAvia’s Hydrogen Centre of Excellence will support the company in a range of manufacturing operations relating to powertrain production and testing. It will also serve as the company’s primary location for production of advanced high temperature PEM (HTPEM) fuel cell stacks and supporting systems. With nearly 3,000 full engine and component pre-orders agreed with airlines and OEMs – corresponding to over $10 billion in future revenues – ZeroAvia is advancing its production operations to meet demand.

“Scotland has some unique advantages for ZeroAvia with strong aerospace and engineering skills, a burgeoning hydrogen sector and a clear aviation strategy with potential for early adoption of zero-emission flights,” said Val Miftakhov, Founder & Chief Executive, ZeroAvia. “The aviation industry is on the cusp of the biggest transformation since the advent of the jet age, with entirely new propulsion systems set to power the next era of aviation – cleaner flights, better economics and better experiences for all.”

“With this new facility, Scotland has a big role to play in driving this transformation,” continued Miftakhov. “We welcome the grant award from Scottish Enterprise and the support of our equity investors that has enabled us to move into another phase of manufacturing readiness as we progress towards certification of our first engines.”

The new facility will complement ZeroAvia’s Propulsion Center of Excellence in Washington State which is focused primarily on electric motors and power electronics. The company also has plans to expand its R&D and aircraft testing centre at Cotswold Airport in Gloucestershire.

The project in Scotland, which will support hundreds of jobs over the next few years, has been made possible by $12 million Regional Selective Assistance grant from Scottish Enterprise. This follows an equity investment of $27 million from the Scottish National Investment Bank into ZeroAvia as part of the company’s Series C funding, with the UK National Wealth Fund investing $43.2 million as a cornerstone-level investor in the round. The Series C funding round was led by Airbus, Barclays Sustainable Impact Capital and NEOM Investment Fund.

The UK Government awarded ZeroAvia and consortium partners $14 million to develop the advanced HTPEM fuel cells in 2024 via the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) program in conjunction with the Department for Business and Trade and Innovate UK. The UK Government has awarded ZeroAvia $25 million total R&D funding since 2019 to develop its fuel cell and powertrain technology. This support, alongside more than $250 million private investment, has enabled ZeroAvia to make rapid progress: flying the world’s first hydrogen-electric commercial scale aircraft in 2020, more than doubling the power output to again fly the world’s largest hydrogen-electric aicraft in 2023, manufacturing and shipping fuel cell systems to customers, and securing significant regulatory traction for the certification of its powertrains.

“Scotland has the skills, the talent and the innovation to be at the forefront of efforts to tackle the climate emergency while developing significant new opportunities to grow the economy,” said John Swinney, First Minister of Scotland. “ZeroAvia’s decision to establish a base in Scotland – creating 350 highly-skilled jobs in the process – is the perfect illustration of Scotland’s growing reputation in the global transition to net zero.”

“By setting out a strategic vision in priority areas such as hydrogen, we are sending a clear statement to investors and businesses that Scotland is at the heart of the green energy revolution,” Swinney continued. “The Hydrogen Centre of Excellence will be at the forefront of fuel cell technology and offers a hugely promising and exciting proposition for sustainable aviation.”

“It is fantastic that we’ve been able to attract ZeroAvia to Scotland, not only for the jobs they will be creating, but for the hugely important role they can play in ensuring Scotland maintains its reputation for fostering innovative green technologies,” said Adrian Gillespie, Chief Executive, Scottish Enterprise. “Making aviation sustainable is crucial to a successful green economy and Scottish Enterprise is fully committed to backing ambitious companies with innovative ideas. ZeroAvia’s decision to come to Scotland is a real boost to our energy transition leadership, as well as being a further example of why Scotland is such a great place for inward investment.”

“ZeroAvia’s new facility in Scotland is fantastic news for the whole of the UK,” said Gary Elliott, Aerospace Technology Institute. “It shows how investment in aerospace research, made possible by support from the ATI Programme, is delivering jobs and growth right across the country, unlocking private investment and helping address climate change.”",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/zeroavia-atr72-in-scotland-1a-1536x804-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 14:15:08.635274

The policy targets every one in three vehicles registered to be an EV by 2030.

It offers an incentive of a maximum of ₹2 million (~$23,502.8)/vehicle in the passenger bus/goods carrier category. Electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers will get a purchase incentive of ₹10,000 (~$117.52) and ₹30,000 (~$352.57) for the first 100,000 and 15,000 vehicles, respectively.

Electric cars will be eligible for a purchase incentive of ₹150,000 (~$1762.84) for the first 10,000 vehicles.

The policy, which will be valid for five years, aims to accelerate EV adoption across all vehicle segments and ensure widespread charging infrastructure to support it.

The policy also plans to reduce vehicular particulate matter (PM) 2.5 emissions in the state. It is estimated that Maharashtra will be able to reduce 325 tons of vehicular PM 2.5 emissions and approximately 1 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector by 2030.

The state’s Transport Department will be the designated nodal agency for the policy.

Under these targets, 40% of all new two-wheelers must be EVs, and electric four-wheelers will comprise 30% of all new four-wheeler registrations.

These incentives will be valid only for vehicles either manufactured for sale in Maharashtra or registered for sale in the state.

The original equipment manufacturer will avail the incentives and pass them on to the end consumer.

The incentives will be disbursed as a percentage of the vehicle’s ex-factory price. They will also be applicable for selling EVs without transferring battery ownership.

All EVs sold under the policy period will be completely exempted from motor vehicle tax.

There will also be a 100% toll tax exemption for passenger EVs commuting on state highways such as Yashwantrao Chavan Mumbai-Pune Expressway, Hindu Hrudaysamrat Balasaheb Thackeray Maharashtra Samruddhi Mahamarg, Atal Bihari Vajpayee Sewri–Nhava Sheva Atal Setu.

Phased toll waivers for electric vehicles on other state highways are currently under discussion.

Charging Infrastructure

The policy includes the installation of EV charging infrastructure every 25 km along state and national highways.

It mandates all existing and new fuel pumps on state and national highways to have at least one fast charging station. The same requirement also extends to all Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation bus stations.

The state will also release viability gap funding for DC fast charging station installations to incentivize establishing EV charging infrastructure across highways. The state’s Energy Department will create a nodal agency to develop an integrated EV charging infrastructure plan. It will categorize EV charging stations based on renewable energy usage and availability of battery energy storage systems.

The concessional tariff for all EV charging and battery swapping stations will follow the tariff structure issued by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission.

The state government will establish a one-window online system/portal to provide charging infrastructure approvals.

Building Code Amendments

Under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs guidelines, the state government has mandated that all new residential buildings have 100% EV-compliant parking spaces.

Each new residential building must allocate at least one dedicated community EV charging point.

Existing housing societies must allocate shared EV charging stations if at least 50% of the housing society members approve of this dedicated allocation.

Under these rules, all new commercial buildings must also allocate at least 50% of their parking spaces for EV charging.

The Mumbai – Pune Expressway and Mumbai – Nagpur Samruddhi will be built as a sustainable mobility corridor. It will comprise charging infrastructure for all EV types. Deploying hydrogen vehicles on the Pune-Mumbai Expressway on pilot routes is also targeted.

Battery Recycling

To attract investments for EV manufacturing, the state government will provide all benefits under the D+ category of mega projects/other categories for industries, including micro, small, and medium enterprises. These companies can be part of the EV battery and component manufacturing sector, irrespective of their manufacturing location in the state.

The state will encourage setting up EV battery recycling hubs closer to EV battery manufacturing hubs and EV charging infrastructure.

Urban local bodies will designate convenient drop-off points for used EV batteries. They will also identify and earmark the land for drop-off spots near the solid waste disposal and processing sites for battery segregation.

They can also collaborate with nearby and existing battery recycling facilities to bolster battery recycling.

Research and Development

To encourage R&D in the state, at least three centers of excellence will be developed, focusing on EVs, charging infrastructure, and hydrogen-based technologies.

The government has earmarked ₹150 million (~$1.76 million) under the “CM EV R&D Grant” to fund R&D activities in the EV sector.

The Maharashtra government will also develop specialized courses for EV design, battery technology, charging infrastructure, power electronics, and energy management.

The Transport Department will establish a network of automated testing stations for EVs to conduct standardized safety assessments.

The state government will also develop a digital battery passport to track key parameters such as manufacturing details, real-time health status, usage history, and end-of-life diagnostics.

According to data released by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways through its Vahan Dashboard in January 2025, Maharashtra had the second-highest EV sales in the country.

In September 2024, the Union Cabinet approved the PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement Program, with a total outlay of ₹109 billion (~$1.29 billion).

Foreign entity of concern (“FEOC”) restrictions would apply to all IRA tax credits.
FEOC Restrictions: A ""prohibited foreign entity"" is either (i) a specified foreign entity or (ii) a foreign-influenced entity.
Observation: The imposition of FEOC rules to tax credit qualification would introduce an additional layer of complexity.","On May 22, 2025, the House of Representatives passed (by a vote of 215-214-1) its version of the budget reconciliation bill (H.R. 1, the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"") containing numerous tax reform provisions. Below are our summaries of the proposed amendments to certain tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (""IRA"") as well as our initial observations. The bill now advances to the Senate for consideration and markup, and we will continue to monitor any developments and updates.

Overview of Changes from the Ways and Means Committee Draft Bill:

The focus of the updates from the draft bill presented by the Ways and Means Committee are as follows:

Termination of Tech-Neutral Credits Without Phaseout: Tech-neutral PTCs and ITCs under sections 45Y and 48E would terminate for projects that (i) begin construction after 60 days from enactment or (ii) are placed in service after Dec. 31, 2028.

The prior draft bill included a modified phase out of the credit rates starting in 2029 and running through 2032, with credits being terminated after 2032, based on when a project is placed in service.

The bill does not alter the existing guidance on how to begin construction of a project for tax purposes, and the date of enactment would be the date the bill is signed by the President.

Advanced nuclear facilities and expansions of nuclear facilities seeking credits under sections 45Y or 48E would be required to begin construction before Jan. 1, 2029.

Material Assistance from a Prohibited Foreign Entity: This restriction would apply to projects seeking tax credits under sections 45Y or 48E that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2025.

The prior draft bill provided a 1-year grace period to begin construction before the material assistance rules applied.

Observation: If the bill is enacted into law before November 1, 2025, then this material assistance restriction would not affect projects seeking credits under sections 45Y or 48E, because such projects would have to begin construction within 60 days of enactment to be eligible for such credits.

Transferability: Tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E would remain transferable for the duration of the credit period for projects that meet the Dec. 31, 2028 deadline to be placed in service.

The prior draft bill preserved transferability for projects that began construction up to 2 years after enactment.

Observation: The preservation of transferability is undermined by the accelerated expiration of the credits themselves.

Special Rule for Residential Solar: No credit would be allowed under sections 45Y or 48E for residential solar water heating property, solar electric property, or small wind energy property if (i) the taxpayer/owner rents or leases such property to a third party and (ii) the third party would qualify for the 25D credit with respect to such property if the third party were the owner of such property.

Observation: This does not seem to include residential PPAs because in such cases the owner is not leasing the equipment to the consumer (but only for systems that begin construction within 60 days of enactment and are placed in service by Dec. 31, 2028). We see no logical basis for treating PPAs differently than leases, so this treatment may be aligned by the Senate, if this special rule for residential property is otherwise maintained.

Observation: This also does not seem to include residential battery storage technology for which a credit is allowable under section 25(d)(6).

Observation: After the bill's amendment, the Section 25D credit would not be allowed for property placed in service after December 31, 2025. Thus, the lessee technically would not qualify for Section 25D credits after the bill's amendment, which means condition (ii) could not be satisfied. This is probably not the intended consequence and either the Senate or the House may modify the bill to fix this glitch.

Residential projects that can demonstrate that they began construction in 2024 would qualify for the ITC under Section 48, as noted below.

Accelerated Termination of Section 45U PTC for Existing Nuclear Facilities: This credit would terminate for electricity produced and sold after Dec. 31, 2031, and such credits would remain transferable for the duration of the credit period.

The amendments to the bill did not affect the provisions in the draft bill presented by the Ways and Means Committee with respect to tax credits available under sections 45Q, 45V, 45X, 45Z, and 48, which are summarized below.

Projects seeking tax credits under sections 45 and 48 (which must have begun construction by Dec. 31, 2024) are unaffected by the bill. To be eligible for tax credits under sections 45 or 48, a project must have begun construction before Jan. 1, 2025, and generally be placed in service within 4 years (or 10 years in the case of offshore wind). The quantum of PTC or ITC available for a given project under sections 45 or 48, as applicable, is the same (for a project that qualifies thereunder) as it would be for the same project under sections 45Y or48E. Application of the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements to achieve a 5x credit rate, potential bonus credit amounts for energy community and domestic content, and eligibility for direct pay under Section 6417 would not be affected by the bill

Reference Guide for Amendments to IRA Tax Credits in the House Budget Bill:

Overall, the proposed amendments fall into 3 general categories:

Expiration of certain credits as early as December 31, 2025, while other credits would either expire in 2028 or follow a modified phaseout schedule starting in 2029.

Foreign entity of concern (“FEOC”) restrictions would apply to all IRA tax credits.

Repeal of transferability after 2 years from enactment for credits under 45Q, 45X, and 45Z.

Observation: Safe harboring of credit rate would be based on timing of placement in service, whereas safe harboring of transferability would be based on timing of beginning construction.

§45Y – Clean Electricity Production Credit & §48E – Clean Electricity Investment Credit

The credits would expire for projects that (i) begin construction after 60 days from enactment, or (ii) are placed in service after Dec. 31, 2028. However, for advanced nuclear facilities and expansions of nuclear facilities, the deadline to begin construction would be Dec. 31, 2028, with no placed in service deadline. In other words, to claim credits a project would need to (i) begin construction within 60 days of enactment and (ii) be placed in service by Dec. 31, 2028.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment;

Facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2025, that include ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity""; and

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" or make an ""applicable payment"" to a ""prohibited foreign entity"" in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment.

100% of ITCs claimed under Section 48E with respect to a property would be recaptured if a ""specified taxpayer"" (i.e., one who is allowed an ITC for any tax year beginning 2 years after enactment) makes an ""applicable payment"" within 10 years after the property is placed in service.

Transferability would continue for the duration of the credit period.

No credit would be allowed for residential solar water heating property, solar electric property, or small wind energy property if (i) the taxpayer/owner rents or leases such property to a third party and (ii) the third party would qualify for the 25D credit with respect to such property if the third party were the owner of such property.

Observation: The placed in service deadline represents a policy change from the general continuity safe harbor period of 4 years (10 years for offshore wind) provided under current IRS guidance on beginning construction.

§45Q – Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment; and

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment.

Transferability would be repealed for facilities that begin construction after 2 years from enactment.

§45U – Clean Electricity Production (For Existing Nuclear Facilities)

The credit would terminate for electricity produced and sold after Dec. 31, 2031.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment; and

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment.

Transferability would be continue for the duration of the credit period.

§45V – Clean Hydrogen Production Credit

This credit would be terminated for facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2025.

§45X – Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit

The credit rate would phase out as follows based on the date the eligible components are sold:

On or before December 31, 2029: 100%;

During 2030: 75%;

During 2031: 50%; and

After December 31, 2031: 0%;

Wind energy components sold after December 31, 2027, would not be credit eligible.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment;

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" or make an ""applicable payment"" to a ""prohibited foreign entity"" with respect to any eligible component category in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment; and

Eligible components produced in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment that (i) include any ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"" or (ii) are produced subject to a licensing agreements with prohibited foreign entity valued in excess of $1 million.

Transferability would be repealed for components sold after 2027.

§45Z – Clean Fuel Production Credit

The credit period would be extended until December 31, 2031 (based on when the fuel is sold).

Fuel sold after December 31, 2025, would be required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions would exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land use charge, and distinct emissions rates would be provided for transportation fuels derived from animal manure, including dairy, swine, and poultry.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment; and

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment.

Transferability would be repealed for fuel produced after 2027.

§48 – Energy Credit

The credit rate for ground or groundwater thermal systems would phase out as follows based on when such property begins construction:

Before January 1, 2030, 6%;

During 2030: 5.2%;

During 2031: 4.4%;

After December 31, 2031: 0%.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment;

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment.

Transferability would be repealed for property that begins construction after 2 years from enactment.

Observation: Credit-eligible asset classes under Sections 48, 45Y, 48E, and 45Q, application of the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, potential bonus credit amounts for energy community and domestic content, and eligibility for direct pay under Section 6417 would be unchanged.

Observation: Additional FEOC requirements would apply to credits under Sections 45Y,48E, and 45X that would not apply to credits under Sections 45U, 45Q, 45Z, and 48.

FEOC Restrictions:

A ""prohibited foreign entity"" is either (i) a specified foreign entity or (ii) a foreign-influenced entity.

""Specified foreign entities"" include:

entities designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the Secretary of State;

entities included on the specially designated nationals and blocked persons list maintained by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control;

entities alleged by the Attorney General to have engaged in conduct for which a conviction was obtained under certain laws;

entities determined by the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence, to be engaged in unauthorized conduct that is detrimental to U.S national security or foreign policy;

Chinese military company operating in the United States;

entities Listed Under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act; or

certain battery producing entities.

Specified foreign entities include ""foreign controlled entities"" such as (i) the government of a covered nation (e.g.,, China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea), (ii) a citizen or resident of a covered nation without U.S. status as a lawful permanent resident, (iii) an entity organized under the laws of, or having its principal place of business in, a covered nation, or (iv) an entity controlled by any of the above, including subsidiaries, measured by more than 50% ownership of stock in a corporation, profits interests or capital interests in a partnership, or other beneficial interest in the entity.

An entity is ""foreign-influenced entity"" if:

(i) During the taxable year:

A specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint a board member, executive officer, or similar individual;

A single specified foreign entity owns at least 10% of the entity;

One or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate at least 25% of the entity; or

At least 25% of the entity's debt is held in the aggregate by one or more specified foreign entities; or

(ii) During the prior taxable year, the entity knowingly makes (or had reason to know) a payment of dividends, interest, compensation for services, rents or royalties, guarantees, or any other fixed, determinable, annual, or periodic payments to:

a specified foreign entity in an amount ≥10% of the total of such payments; or

more than 1 specified foreign entity in an amount ≥25% of the total of such payments (each, an ""applicable payment"")

Construction or production of any property includes ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"" if, with respect to such property:

Any component, subcomponent, or applicable critical mineral included in such property is extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured, or assembled by a prohibited foreign entity; and

Any design of such property is based on any copyright or patent held by, or any know-how or trade secret provided by, a prohibited foreign entity.

Material assistance does not include any subcomponent (or collection of subcomponents) or any material that is (i) not uniquely designed for use in construction of a 45Y/48E facility or 45X component, (ii) not exclusively or predominantly produced by prohibited foreign entities, and (iii) not acquired directly from a prohibited foreign entity.

Observation: The imposition of FEOC rules to tax credit qualification would introduce an additional layer of complexity. The statute would further authorize the Treasury Department to issue regulations under these rules.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.12122_4252.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 18:09:26.819208

The bill aims to cement Trump’s America First agenda into law. The legislation includes tax cuts and reforms that many organizations say will benefit American workers, businesses, and families.

The Farm Bureau applauded updated farm programs and tax provisions that will help farmers and ranchers. The Chamber of Commerce said the bill will raise wages and improve lives by making tax relief permanent. Airlines for America praised the $12.5 billion investment to modernize air traffic control infrastructure.

The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said the bill invests in cattle health and provides tax relief to protect family farms.

House passes Trump’s tax cuts bill

Small business groups like the Job Creators Network and National Association of Manufacturers called it a major victory.

They said making tax cuts permanent will allow small businesses to expand, hire, and raise wages. However, the bill would also roll back incentives for electric vehicles. It repeals subsidies for EV purchases, battery manufacturing, and charging stations passed under President Biden.

Analysts said this will make EVs more expensive and could delay automakers’ plans for new EV and battery factories in the U.S.

The legislation now heads to the Senate for consideration. Republican leaders aim to use money saved from cutting EV incentives to provide tax cuts primarily for high-income households and businesses. The White House said the bill could increase take-home pay for families and workers by over $13,000 and $11,000 respectively over the next four years.

It projects the reforms could increase GDP by 5.2% and create up to 7.4 million jobs in that time.",https://www.selfemployed.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Trumps-Reform.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 14:14:45.628272

“It is the first serious fusion power plant design that I’ve seen,” said Dr. Neilson.
The Type One Energy Infinity Two fusion power plant is being designed to put a nominal 350 MWe on the electricity grid.
By properly architecting Infinity Two, Type One Energy is creating a proprietary fusion power plant design that supports a compelling two-year power plant operating cycle separated by 30-day planned maintenance outages using today’s existing materials and enabling technologies.
The company also made use of its partner-rich commercialization program to access the power generation industry’s deep expertise in power plant engineering design.","Type One Energy announced on May 27 that it had successfully completed the first formal design review of Infinity Two, which is based on the world’s only implementable, peer-reviewed physics basis for a fusion power plant recently published by the prestigious Journal of Plasma Physics. The Infinity Two design is progressing in support of a potential fusion power plant project with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), using Type One Energy stellarator technology.

The Infinity Two design review board, which was chaired by Type One Energy Chief Technology Officer Dr. Thomas Sunn Pedersen, included several outside experts, including Dr. George H. “Hutch” Neilson from the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and Dr. Paolo Ferroni from the Westinghouse Electric Company, to provide independent assessments of the engineering work performed by Type One Energy.

“It is the first serious fusion power plant design that I’ve seen,” said Dr. Neilson. “The work they’ve done to date provides a sound foundation for continued design development of what could be the first system to produce net electricity from fusion.”

Dr. Ferroni, the Chief Engineer for Advanced Reactors—GenIV/Fusion at Westinghouse Electric Company, added, “I think it is important that the Type One Energy team is taking a comprehensive plant-level approach to develop their technology, which includes a description of all necessary systems, not just the plasma core.”

Successful completion of the initial design review confirms that the Infinity Two technology approach, architecture, performance, and reliability requirements remain aligned with the expectations of TVA and the broader global energy market for a commercially viable first-of-a-kind (FOAK) fusion power plant.

The Type One Energy Infinity Two fusion power plant is being designed to put a nominal 350 MWe on the electricity grid. This design is based on the company’s groundbreaking stellarator fusion physics basis, which, for the first time, realistically considered in a comprehensive and unified manner, the complex relationship between competing requirements for plasma performance, power plant startup, construction logistics, reliability, and economics utilizing actual power plant operating experience. The Journal of Plasma Physics considers this approach to be “… setting the gold standard for how this is done.”

The Infinity Two architecture is grounded in stellarator fusion technology. This technology has, uniquely within the fusion industry, demonstrated stable, continuous steady-state operation at large scale by the W7-X machine. By properly architecting Infinity Two, Type One Energy is creating a proprietary fusion power plant design that supports a compelling two-year power plant operating cycle separated by 30-day planned maintenance outages using today’s existing materials and enabling technologies. The company also made use of its partner-rich commercialization program to access the power generation industry’s deep expertise in power plant engineering design. Among other firms, AtkinsRéalis assisted in developing the design of those Infinity Two systems and structures not part of Type One Energy’s core focus on the stellarator fusion technology.

“Our ability to efficiently architect the initial Infinity Two design in an efficient, partner-rich manner reaffirms our commitment to pursuing the lowest-risk, shortest-schedule path to a commercially viable fusion power plant,” said Christofer Mowry, CEO for Type One Energy. “The energy industry needs more reliable, clean, power generation technology that can meet the rapidly increasing demand for electricity and we are delivering a commercially compelling solution.”

The progress Type One Energy is making on its Infinity Two fusion power plant design, together with its collaboration with TVA, has attracted the attention of the global energy industry. Several prominent energy utilities and industrial companies have expressed an interest in Infinity Two and participation in Type One Energy’s deployment of its first-generation fusion power plant technology.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/type-one-energy-fusion-power-plant.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 13:24:46.715700

Republicans in the House of Representatives passed a budget reconciliation bill Thursday that would further pare back most clean energy production, manufacturing and investment tax credits. The bill’s passage came after clean industry executives were looking for sympathetic members of the chamber to push for favorable changes to a version that passed the Ways and Means Committee earlier this month.

The bill’s passage immediately sparked alarm across the clean energy economy that has been supported by the credits, as companies and industry groups representing clean energy developers and responsible investors warned the bill would eliminate jobs, slow development and raise energy prices.

Scott Elias, vice president of policy and market development for clean energy developer and investor CleanCapital, said Thursday that the bill “threatens U.S. energy development and risks ceding the AI race and tech leadership to China.”

“Put simply, Congress is now one chamber away from passing a law that would dramatically increase project risk, reduce investment certainty, cancel previously announced projects and investments and stall clean energy deployment,” Elias said in emailed comments Thursday.

While the committee-passed bill text would have phased out most of the Inflation Reduction Act on a multi-year timeline, the House-passed “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” would repeal the IRA’s technology-neutral clean energy production and investment credits for any projects that don’t begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment, according to an analysis by clean energy tax credit marketplace Crux. Non-nuclear projects that meet the accelerated construction timeline would see the credits eliminated entirely after 2028.

The nuclear energy industry saw positive changes from the committee text, including a carveout from the production and investment credits restrictions and having the full credit value available until 2031. However, other changes to transferability mechanisms, as well manufacturing production, carbon sequestration and clean fuels were also included.

The residential solar industry would be upended, with a credit eliminated for leased residential and community solar installs that began after Jan. 1 of this year, according to the Crux analysis. SunRun, the nation’s leading residential solar company, saw its shares fall nearly 40% on May 22, ESG Dive sister publication Utility Dive reported.

Additionally, a foreign entity of concern provision that some House Republicans recommended be adjusted to aid the U.S. clean energy industry instead saw its start date pushed up to 2026 in the House-passed bill.

After the bill’s passage, industry group Advance Energy United President and CEO Heather O’Neill said the bill “abruptly dismantles bipartisan, long-standing tax policy that has catalyzed billions in private investment for affordable, reliable energy.”

“If enacted as written, this bill will weaken our power system and send shockwaves throughout the U.S. economy by raising electricity prices, killing tens of thousands of jobs, and ceding energy dominance to China,” O’Neill said in a release. “This isn’t a scalpel, it’s a meat cleaver, and it will hurt us all.”

Climate nonprofit Ceres said the House-passed reconciliation bill is “unworkable” in its current form, as it “all but eliminat[es] clean economy incentives” and would freeze investment in “key sectors.”

“Unless redone, this legislation will raise prices across the country, resulting in less energy and more scarcity,” Ceres Senior Director of Federal Policy Zach Friedman said in an emailed statement May 22.

Industry groups and participants are hoping for more moderated changes to the current clean energy tax environment in the Senate version of the bill. Crux noted in its blog that “historically, the House version of a reconciliation bill represents the biggest change to law, with the Senate playing the role of narrowing the approach.”

After the committee-passed bill would have limited the window of tax credit transferability, the version that passed the House maintained the transferability mechanism through the lifecycle of the tech-neutral tax credits and nuclear production credits, in line with a recommendation from a group of House Republicans.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/SzeDlF5mAUjrDGk1oJJJMM3i44d_IA-dOxj49B5UYxk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTkwMTk5MTY0LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-05-27 13:23:20.749374

Made possible by $500 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the project could also create 5,500 construction jobs.
And yet, the future of the smelter, along with dozens of the DOE’s other multimillion-dollar climate and clean energy projects, is in jeopardy.
Renewable energy is energy independence Climate and clean energy investments are at the top of DOGE’s hit list.
Meanwhile, other countries, including those that the administration says it cares to compete with, are investing dozens of times more into renewable projects.","There’s a reason the United States hasn’t seen a new aluminum smelter in 45 years. Producing this soft, pliable metal from scratch consumes astronomical amounts of electricity, and the costs of keeping a smelter open and running, let alone building a new one, are just too high.

But Century Aluminum, a U.S.-based company, hopes to change that by building a first-of-its-kind green aluminum smelter in the Ohio-Mississippi basins. Through improved energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy, the proposed facility could emit 75 percent less climate pollution than a typical smelter and, potentially, rejuvenate the domestic aluminum industry.

Made possible by $500 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the project could also create 5,500 construction jobs. And yet, the future of the smelter, along with dozens of the DOE’s other multimillion-dollar climate and clean energy projects, is in jeopardy.

Around 8,500 DOE staffers risk losing their jobs due to the roughshod reorganization efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), and thousands more have accepted voluntary resignation offers.

The Elon Musk–led office has already fired tens of thousands of federal workers and substantially shrunk or altogether shuttered multiple federal agencies, including the U.S. Agency for International Development, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, and the National Park Service.

The Trump administration is coming for the DOE’s budget too. The proposed 2026 federal discretionary budget reduces DOE funding by $19.3 billion, with the deepest cuts to renewable energy and decarbonization programs. When excluding the National Nuclear Security Administration, which received a 25 percent increase, the proposed cut is nearly 20 percent of the DOE’s remaining budget.

While DOGE’s efforts face widespread public scrutiny and mounting legal pushback, including by NRDC and partners, the work of the DOE remains in limbo. Here’s why an intact Energy Department is essential to solving some of the toughest challenges of a rapidly changing, and warming, world.

OCED: Because industry needs innovation

Heavy industries, such as steel, concrete, and chemical production, are notorious carbon polluters. In fact, in addition to spewing large amounts of local air pollution, industry contributes 30 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Often, the production methods in these industrial sectors haven’t changed in decades, and the pollution solutions that work for one industry don’t necessarily work for another.

“These have always been called ‘hard-to-abate’ industries, which meant sweep them under the rug and ignore their pollution,” explains Christina Theodoridi, head of NRDC’s industrial policy team.

This is where the innovations spurred by the DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) come in. OCED works to speed up the commercial adoption of innovative cleaner technologies—the kind that have made it past the R&D phase but aren’t yet ready to go fully commercial. Private investors typically see such projects as too high risk, so the federal government’s initial support and cost-sharing is essential to getting big polluters to modernize without breaking the bank.

OCED launched its $6 billion Industrial Demonstrations Program (IDP) last year. The program provides funding for groundbreaking projects that test new means of electrification, pollution control, and energy efficiency, among others. IDP projects vary widely. Current initiatives include new ways to make cement, glass, and steam, several with little or no fossil fuels.

The American Council for an Energy-efficient Economy, a nonprofit research organization, estimates IDP could funnel $14 billion in private investment to communities within 20 states. But, with OCED’s future now uncertain, so is its $25 billion portfolio of projects.

Among them are the proposed regional hydrogen hubs—a network of facilities planned at sites throughout the country dedicated to advancing this burgeoning clean energy industry. The department had earmarked $8 billion for the program to develop innovative ways of producing hydrogen, which has a variety of end products, from jet fuel to fertilizer. Two other OCED endeavors are the direct air capture (DAC) hubs slated for Louisiana and southern Texas. These hubs aim to find ways to scrub carbon dioxide from the air for either storage underground or for new uses.

Both the hydrogen and DAC hubs appeared on DOGE’s short list of proposed canceled projects leaked in March.

Many local leaders expressed frustration with the decision. “Investing in DAC will generate demand for American-made steel, concrete, and advanced equipment, revitalizing U.S. manufacturing and ensuring that innovation and jobs remain here at home,” wrote Louisiana Secretary for Economic Development Susan Bourgeois in a letter to the state’s representatives in Washington, D.C., urging them to tell Energy Secretary Chris Wright to reconsider the defunding.

According to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a nonprofit organization that advocates for clean energy, OCED programs would support roughly 290,000 jobs and fuel nearly $70 billion in economic output. The DOE’s many private sector partners could also be left in the lurch.

“A lot of the work that the DOE does, especially when it comes to the commercialization of breakthrough tech, is through public-private partnerships,” Theodoridi explains. “The federal government is now letting go of its end of the bargain. It erodes confidence in our nation’s ability to be a partner—and it's going to take a long time to build it back.”

A resilient electric grid to keep the lights on

The grid is also in need of an overhaul. “If you started from scratch, you’d never build the system the way we have it today,” says Cullen Howe, a senior policy advocate at NRDC whose work focuses on improving the country’s transmission system and decarbonizing the power sector.

For starters, the grid needs double its transmission capacity—that is, its ability to move large quantities of electricity over long distances. “Right now, we don't have an equivalent to the interstate highway system for the transmission system, but that's what we need,” Howe says. With extreme weather of all varieties increasing the occurrences of power outages, upgrading our transmission capacity has grown more urgent than ever.

The DOE, and specifically its Grid Deployment Office (GDO), are central to this work. In 2023, the GDO launched its Transmission Facilitation Program, a $2.5 billion effort to build or upgrade high-voltage transmission lines that crisscross the country and connect previously separated regions of the grid.

In a recent round of contracts, the GDO awarded funding to four new projects that would together add nearly 1,000 miles of new transmission infrastructure and 7,100 megawatts of capacity to the grid. This kind of big-picture planning for the country’s transmission system is some of what the GDO does best.

For example, every three years, the office releases its National Transmission Needs Study, a look at what kind of infrastructure the country needs to meet its growing electric demands. The study informs investment and planning decisions by regional transmission operators, utilities, and local governments, among others.

“If a nonprofit puts out a study that says, ‘This is the amount of transmission we're going to need over the next 20 years,’ that's useful,” Howe says. “But it doesn’t carry the weight of a nonpartisan federal agency.”

During severe winter storms or heat waves, the grid must be able to move electricity around to meet regional demand spikes or address service interruptions. Further, because solar and wind energy generation tends to occur in rural areas, adequate transmission is vital to getting that power to wherever consumers need it.

Meanwhile, energy demand is expected to keep growing substantially, in large part due to the electrification of the building and transportation sectors and the expansion of power-hungry data centers, especially with the rise of AI.

With sweeping staff and budget cuts, the DOE won’t be able to build the modern, resilient power grid essential to meeting the electric needs of the coming decades. “My sense is that most of the work that the Grid Deployment Office was doing—if they even staff the office at all—is probably not going to be done,” Howe says.

Renewable energy is energy independence

Climate and clean energy investments are at the top of DOGE’s hit list. In its proposed 2026 budget, the administration eliminates more than $19 billion in funding for “climate change–related activities,” such as the Biden administration’s Justice40 initiative and what it falsely dubs “Green New Scam funds committing to build unreliable renewable energy.”

The DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy faces a $2.6 billion cut, along with the downsizing of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), a research lab that focuses on energy systems research and development. NREL, located in Golden, Colorado, laid off 114 employees in May, but there are fears of more to come.

These cuts would hobble the United State’s ability to scale up its renewable energy output at a moment when the world needs to double down on it, in order to avoid the most devastating effects of climate change.

Take for example the U.S. offshore wind industry, which could supply up to a quarter of the nation’s total electricity by 2050. A growing stretch of proposed offshore wind farms along the Atlantic Coast are poised to generate much of this power. Yet they need the DOE to help bring that electricity ashore—a complicated job involving laying cable deep in the sea, navigating harsh ocean environments, and coordinating ports, vessels, and crews.

So, over the course of two years, the Energy Department held a series of workshops to hear from state representatives, Tribal leaders, regional transmission operators, and energy experts (including those from NRDC), and other stakeholders. The result was the 2024 Atlantic Offshore Wind Transmission Study and a subsequent Action Plan, which now serves as a guide for decision makers up and down the coast.

Complex infrastructure projects like these have the potential to transform the U.S. power sector and make it more resilient, but they require ongoing collaboration with dozens of parties across federal, state, and local jurisdictions—each with their own interests and sensitivities. For DOE staff to succeed, they need to understand how the bureaucracy works, along with all the relevant laws, codes, standards, and stakeholders.

“These aren’t things that can just run on autopilot,” says Jennifer DiStefano, director of innovation and technology for industry at NRDC. And managing them is not a task that a brand-new DOE staffer could handle on day one. “Ultimately, the agency needs experts in order to do its job effectively.”

Turning our back on renewable energy investments now would not only spell climate disaster but also make the United States less of a player on the world stage.

In recent years, thanks to federal investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, the United States was about to reclaim some of the solar manufacturing it had lost to China and Southeast Asia over the past 20 years. That comeback is in jeopardy now. Meanwhile, other countries, including those that the administration says it cares to compete with, are investing dozens of times more into renewable projects.

“We need to figure out how to deploy as much clean energy as possible so that we have reliable, affordable, abundant energy for all Americans,” Theodoridi says. “They should be turbocharging the Energy Department. Instead, they're pumping the brakes.”",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2025-05/worker-century-aluminum-smelter-kentucky-RC13E6D54B10.JPG?h=b9130491&itok=Kx54hg13,N,,2025-05-27 13:23:25.243150

""That means there's more to the story — either bad forecasting, bad modeling or higher demand than was projected.""
Another 12,000 customers were affected in St. Bernard and Plaquemines parishes combined.
More than 100,000 customers lost electricity during the series of rolling blackouts Sunday.
Approximately 52,000 customers were impacted in the city of New Orleans.","NEW ORLEANS — WWL Louisiana has learned the region's two nuclear power plants were down Sunday, causing widespread power outages in the New Orleans area.

According to state Public Service Commissioner Davante Lewis, Waterford 3 in Killona on the west bank of St. Charles Parish was scheduled to be offline for maintenance. River Bend in St. Francisville, north of Baton Rouge unexpectedly tripped offline, and there wasn't enough energy in the region to meet demand.

""For a scheduled outage to occur and a generator to fail simply should not cause a load shedding event,"" Lewis said. ""That means there's more to the story — either bad forecasting, bad modeling or higher demand than was projected.""

Lewis said it's unclear why River Bend failed.

“The Waterford 3 nuclear plant was in the midst of a previously planned outage on Sunday afternoon, as part of regularly scheduled refueling and maintenance,"" a spokesperson for Entergy said. “Entergy typically conducts maintenance on its utility plants in the spring and fall, when loads are lower. The Waterford 3 maintenance and refueling outage was conducted in accordance with that policy and was planned months ahead.”

New Orleans City Councilman JP Morrell, the lead regulator of Entergy in the city of New Orleans, said the council will hold a hearing on Tuesday, June 3, with Entergy and the Mid-Continent Independent System Operator (MISO) to get answers about what happened. He said he couldn't comment on the nuclear power plant going down until that hearing.

He did question the decisions made in Baton Rouge to cut power to 52,000 customers in New Orleans, more than the 38,500 that lost power in Jefferson Parish, even though Jefferson Parish has more Entergy customers than New Orleans. Another 12,000 customers were affected in St. Bernard and Plaquemines parishes combined.

""Out of the 100,000 homes that were affected, over 50,000 were in one parish, and that seems very, very glaring,"" Morrell said. He said next Tuesday's hearing will provide more answers, but he's skeptical after what happened during Winter Storm Uri in February 2021, which forced similar rolling blackouts, including shutting off power to the city's water intake pumps.

""They had an investigation and it was shown that New Orleans bore a disproportionate brunt of that load-shed, and the excuse at that time was like the wrong lever had been pulled,"" Morrell said.

According to Entergy, the forced outages were directed by MISO as a last resort and done to prevent a more extensive, prolonged power outage that could have severely affected the reliability of the power grid.

MISO is a regional transmission organization that manages the electric grid in portions of 15 states, including Louisiana in the South and Midwest, and parts of Canada.

Lewis claims Entergy should share some of the blame for the outages.

""If we had more significant solar and battery storage, we could have been able to use some of those immediate resources for the short time to keep the lights on,"" Lewis said. ""If we had better transmission, we could have flowed power from other parts of the state and other parts of this nation to keep power on.""

More than 100,000 customers lost electricity during the series of rolling blackouts Sunday. Approximately 52,000 customers were impacted in the city of New Orleans. Outages were also reported in Jefferson, St. Bernard, Plaquemines, St. Tammany and Washington parishes.

As of Monday morning, power had been fully restored across the New Orleans area.

Cleco updates customers on Sunday’s forced power outage:

“If the power supply cannot meet the demand, periodic power outages could be needed to protect the stability of the power grid and prevent widespread lengthy outages,” said Jennifer Cahill, director of corporate communications. “This was the case yesterday when we took the unprecedented step, as directed by MISO, to force outages to some customers in St. Tammany Parish.”

“Controlled outages are a last resort when all other options have been exhausted, and every attempt is made to notify customers before an outage occurs,” said Cahill. “However, due to the many variables that affect the overall electric power grid, these events can occur quickly and without advance notice.”

“We apologize to our customers who experienced power loss during yesterday’s mandatory service interruption,” said Cahill. “And while we strive to give our customers advance notice of any outages, this emergency situation did not allow us the time to inform our customers ahead of time.”

""As our climate continues to change and rainfall increases, these types of projects help us maintain healthy lakes, rivers, and streams,"" said MassDEP Commissioner Bonnie Heiple. ""It’s important that we implement strategies to eliminate the pollutants at the source, restore impaired waters and provide equitable access to clean and safe water.""

NPS pollution occurs when rainfall or melting snow picks up and carries away natural and human-made pollutants, such as fertilizers, herbicides, construction sediment, nutrients and bacteria from animal waste, and eventually deposits those pollutants into our lakes, rivers, wetlands, coastal waters, and ground waters. There are many types of NPS pollution that can impact our waterways. These grants help municipalities, tribal nations, regional planning agencies, and public and private entities address NPS pollution across Massachusetts.

The ten grants awarded are:

Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe — $700,000

Mashpee, MA

The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe and the Town of Mashpee have collaborated to take a strategic, watershed-based approach utilizing a combination of structural and non-structural best management practices (BMPs) to improve water quality in Santuit Pond. This project will reduce persistent water quality degradation in Santuit Pond due to excessive in-pond nutrient loading by sequestering phosphorus over a 145-acre area of sediment where anoxia occurs most frequently. Alum treatment will be applied to the pond to reduce internal phosphorus loading to achieve substantial progress toward the watershed-based plan goal of an 81 percent reduction in phosphorus load established for the pond. This project will build on ongoing outreach and engagement activities targeted at residents in the neighborhoods surrounding Santuit Pond, Town officials, and the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe.

Mystic River Watershed Association — $869,640

Arlington, MA

The Mystic River Watershed Association will take a strategic, watershed-based approach to construct a total of 65 infiltration trenches in six (6) municipalities in the Mystic River watershed, offering cost-effective phosphorus reduction in a highly urbanized setting. This strategy is based on a model pioneered by the Town of Arlington in consultation with the University of New Hampshire Stormwater Center and EPA. The project is a continuation of work conducted by the City of Everett on behalf of eight municipalities. Municipalities will gain capacity to continue similar projects into the future, as municipalities work to meet the ambitious phosphorus reduction goals set out in the Alternative Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) report for the Mystic River watershed, released in May 2020 by EPA and MassDEP.

Town of Monson — $203,965

This project will improve water quality and ecological conditions for Chicopee Brook by installing stormwater BMPs at Cushman Field and support improved landscape management at Veterans Field. These recreational facilities, located along Chicopee Brook in Monson’s downtown, are identified in the Chicopee Brook Watershed Plan as highest priority sites for stormwater management BMPs. For Cushman Field, proposed BMPs include the installation of a 5,750-square foot bio-infiltration basin and larger drainage pipe to capture storm flows from Main and Washington Streets and stabilization of the unpaved road to reduce sediment transport. At Veteran’s Field, the recommendation to develop a 10-foot “no mow” zone along 500 feet of Chicopee Brook will be combined with a transition to organic land care practice.

The Massachusetts Alternative Septic System Test Center – Barnstable County Department of Health and Environment (Wastewater Division) — $416,997

This project will install 25 urine diversion (UD) systems in nitrogen-impaired watersheds. The applicant will document actual nitrogen load reductions by watershed and generate performance data of UD systems to support the inclusion of UD as a general use nutrient management strategy. The County will also develop and maintain a publicly accessible map tool to communicate real-time progress toward watershed TMDLs. This project will help develop the management infrastructure needed to support collection, transport, and recycling and/or disposal of urine, and document costs and energy usage to maintain a community urine diversion program.

Solar power is expected to become cheaper than nuclear energy between 2030 and 2035. Rapid improvements in solar panel efficiency and lower installation costs are driving this change. By 2035, solar is projected to lead the nation’s power generation. This shift supports a national goal of 80% renewable energy, aligning climate priorities with energy security and economic growth.

South Korea’s Power Mix in 2024: Heavy on Fossil Fuels, Light on Renewables

Think Tank Ember Group’s analysis showed that in 2024, low-carbon sources generated 40% of South Korea’s electricity, nearly matching the global average of 41%.

As the world’s 7th largest electricity consumer, South Korea still leans heavily on fossil fuels, which supply 60% of its electricity.

Nuclear energy is the country’s largest source of clean power, accounting for 30% of the mix. However, solar and wind together made up just 6%, less than half the global average of 15%.

Despite rapid economic growth and rising power demand over the last two decades, South Korea’s power sector emissions peaked in 2018. This turning point came as solar and nuclear began to edge out coal. Still, emissions remain high, at around 5 tonnes of CO₂ per person. It’s nearly three times the global average.

Looking ahead, South Korea is targeting 20% renewable electricity by 2030. That figure, though a step forward, falls far short of the 60% global renewables share envisioned in the IEA Net Zero Emissions scenario for that year.

RELATED: Hanwha Qcells Shines with Record-Breaking Solar Cell Efficiency and $1.45 Billion DOE Loan

Why Solar Power Is Outpacing Nuclear?

The country’s energy model is shifting, supported by strong policies and rising investments in solar. A report titled “Assessing the Levelized Cost of Energy in South Korea” shows that solar’s levelized cost of energy (LCOE) may drop by 50% in the next decade. In contrast, nuclear’s LCOE could rise by 15% due to aging reactors and increased maintenance costs.

Solar’s declining costs give it a clear advantage over coal, nuclear, and natural gas. The report estimates that solar could supply over 60% of South Korea’s electricity by 2035, up from about 10% in 2020.

Growth will come from rooftop solar in cities and large-scale solar farms in rural areas. Thus, South Korea is seeing solar become the smartest and most sustainable energy option.

Boosting Energy Independence

EIA revealed that, “South Korea relies on imports to meet almost 98% of its fossil fuel consumption as a result of insufficient domestic resources.”

This dependence exposes the economy to global risks and price fluctuations. Transitioning to solar and other renewables aims to reduce this reliance and boost national energy security.

The country’s National Carbon Neutrality Plan links expanding clean power to building national resilience. By increasing domestic renewable energy sources, South Korea lowers its vulnerability to international supply chain issues. The plan also outlines key steps to enhance clean power, upgrade transmission networks, and expand battery storage, strengthening the grid against disruptions.

Cutting Emissions and Cleaning the Air

As of 2023, fossil fuels provide 62% of South Korea’s electricity, giving it one of the highest per-person carbon footprints in the G20. Replacing coal and gas with renewables like solar will significantly lower emissions by 2035.

The “A Clean Energy Korea by 2035” study shows that expanding solar and wind, along with a target of 10 GW of storage by 2030, can reduce fossil fuel use without building new coal plants. This shift will cut emissions, improve air quality, and help South Korea meet its climate commitments.

Kim Seo-Young from the Korea Energy Agency stated,

“Clean energy isn’t just about reducing emissions—it’s about improving public health and creating a stronger economy.”

Market Transformation Underway

South Korea’s electricity market is changing. New infrastructure and investment are making solar and wind more affordable. Analysts expect a 28% to 41% drop in the LCOE of solar and wind by 2035, while nuclear costs are likely to keep rising.

Nuclear currently makes up about 30% of power generation, but solar is set to overtake it in the next decade. Government plans include adding up to 14.5 GW of renewable energy each year from 2030 to 2035.

A $30 billion investment will support large solar projects and urban rooftop installations.

Private companies are also getting involved. As regulations change to support cleaner energy, local firms invest in solar development. New pilot programs and battery storage projects are beginning in industrial areas, with support from public R&D funding. This growth could create up to 400,000 green jobs by 2035.

These jobs will be in renewable tech, grid management, and clean manufacturing. This shift benefits both the planet and the economy.

Will South Korea Hit Its 2035 Clean Energy Target?

Reaching 80% clean electricity by 2035 depends on how quickly South Korea scales up. Current trends show that, without stronger action, renewables might only reach 21–33% of power by 2038. This is much lower than what other advanced economies expect.

Public, industry, and international partners are pushing for faster action. Sectors like AI and chip manufacturing are growing, and their energy demands are high.

If they continue to rely on fossil fuels, the country might lose its competitive edge. Thus, speeding up the rollout of renewables is essential for climate goals and maintaining relevance in the global economy.

Solar’s rapid growth, driven by affordability and smart policies, makes it South Korea’s leading energy source. No longer an add-on, solar is now central to the clean energy revolution. The next decade will challenge the system’s flexibility and resolve. The path ahead is clear: solar is leading the way.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2519034573.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 13:23:28.943814

Gas prices — the subject of considerable political spin and even a doughnut promotion as millions of Americans hit the roadways and went shopping during the long holiday weekend — averaged $3.18 a gallon nationally and $3.20 in Michigan, according to AAA.

Petroleum analysts and news outlets have attempted to explain the fluctuations in prices in a global economy disrupted by tariffs and a shifting U.S. energy policy that encourages increased fossil fuel use and environmental deregulation.

The national gas price average, derived from a survey of about 120,000 gas stations, was 41 cents less on Monday than it was a year ago, but the same as a week ago.

Michigan’s average was down 46 cents from a year ago, but up three cents from last week.

Throughout the state, the highest gas price averages by community were in Benton Harbor, $3.27 a gallon; Lansing, $3.26 and Grand Rapids, $3.25, and the lowest were in Traverse City, $3.04; Marquette, $3.08 and metro Detroit, $3.16.

The White House, which attributed its claims to GasBuddy, went on to declare ""Biden’s war on American energy is over"" and trumpeted Trump’s ""relentless action to revive the nation’s energy capabilities and undo the Biden-era stranglehold on American energy production.""

Patrick DeHaan, GasBuddy’s senior petroleum analyst, confirmed on X that ""speaking seasonally, all 50 states are lower than last Memorial Day"" and noted that gas prices were at their lowest seasonal (Memorial Day) level since 2021.""

DeHaan said gas prices are at their lowest inflation-adjusted level since 2003, excluding 2020, meaning Americans are putting ""less of their paycheck into their tanks,"" although prices are higher than they were in December.""

In the last six months, DeHaan said, gas prices ""climbed in 39 of the nation’s 50 states, declined in 11.""

Politicians, he added, will ""lie/incorrectly lead you to believe they've done something,"" adding ""the bulk of this has been recent economic turmoil, as well as OPEC production changes, and continued re-balancing of the global economy"" since the pandemic.

West Texas Intermediate crude oil has been trading at less than $62 a barrel and could fall. At its May 31 meeting, Bloomberg News reported, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to discuss whether to increase oil output.

The price of oil is a key factor in the price of gasoline. More oil production could be good for consumers, but bad for oil companies, which also affects the economy. When prices fall, oil companies tend to profit less.

Fact-checkers also have suggested that previous claims by President Donald Trump that gas has been selling for less than $2 a gallon, and by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that prices have “collapsed under President Trump,” were misleading.

DeHaan also warned that hurricane season, if turbulent, could cause spikes in gas prices, and forecasted last week that ""due to a large jump in wholesale prices,"" the retail price could go up.

On Thursday, May 22, the Senate passed Congressional Review Act resolutions reversing California’s Environmental Protection Agency waivers for three vehicle emission rules: Advanced Clean Cars II, Advanced Clean Trucks and the Omnibus Low NOX regulation. All three resolutions passed on a party-line vote.

Last week’s votes kill any hope for California to implement regulations that phase out internal combustion engine vehicles. By using the Congressional Review Act, California cannot take a second bite at the apple with a future Democratic administration. It would take an act of Congress for it to do so.

Enacted in 1996, the Congressional Review Act requires agencies to send new rules to Congress, allowing lawmakers to review and overturn them. Once a rule is submitted, Congress has 60 days to file a joint resolution of disapproval to revoke the rule. Rather than the typical 60 votes needed to pass a bill in the Senate, a CRA resolution requires only a simple majority.

Once signed into law, an agency is barred from issuing a similar rule in the future. In this case, California cannot request an EPA waiver for vehicle emission regulations that are “substantially the same form” as the Advanced Clean Trucks and Advanced Clean Cars II rules.

If a future EPA wants to grant similar vehicle emission waivers, Congress would need to pass a law allowing it to do just that.

“This action, once signed by President Trump, not only prevents California from implementing their attempt at EV mandate actions but ensures that they can never do something similar again,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement.

The trucking industry applauded Congress’ decision to stop California’s electric vehicle mandate. The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association said CRA resolutions “protect small-business truckers nationwide from California’s regulatory encroachments.”

“Setting national policy is the responsibility of Congress, not California,” OOIDA President Todd Spencer said. “It’s no wonder small-business truckers have left the state in droves to find better opportunities elsewhere. For OOIDA members, vehicle reliability and affordability are critical. So far, there is no convincing evidence that electric commercial motor vehicles are a viable option for small-business truckers given the high costs and inadequate charging infrastructure.”

CRA controversy

This marks the first time the Congressional Review Act has been used to overturn one of California’s EPA waivers, a move Democrats have warned may set a dangerous precedent.

Until now, the EPA has not submitted its California waivers to Congress because it determined that they are not considered rules subject to the Congressional Review Act. The Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian have backed that determination.

Three years ago, the Biden administration rescinded the EPA’s decision from Trump’s first term to revoke an Obama-era waiver for the Advanced Clean Cars vehicle emission rule. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.V., asked the GAO whether those waivers are considered rules under the Congressional Review Act.

In November 2023, the GAO determined that the EPA waivers are not rules under the Congressional Review Act. Rather, they are considered orders and cannot be reviewed and repealed by Congress.

Despite that finding, the EPA submitted the three California vehicle emission waivers, collectively called an electric vehicle mandate, to Congress as rules in February. By doing so, the agency started the 60-day clock for a Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn the waivers.

In March, Democratic Senators Sheldon Whitehouse, Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff asked the GAO if those waivers are rules subject to the Congressional Review Act. The GAO doubled down on its 2023 determination, stating that the EPA waivers submitted to Congress in February are not rules that Congress can review and overturn them through a CRA resolution.

Undeterred, House Republicans introduced the three resolutions in April to overturn EPA waivers allowing California’s electric vehicle mandate.

Just hours before Senate Republicans introduced their resolutions, the Senate parliamentarian ruled that EPA waivers are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, reinforcing the GAO rulings.

Since then, Democrats have raised concerns about breaking with traditional procedures by overruling parliamentarian and GAO rulings. Republican Sens. Mike Lee, John Thune and Susan Collins have acknowledged those rulings, with Thune and Collins indicating they would not vote against the parliamentarian.

During a Senate floor speech before the vote, Padilla called the votes to overturn California’s vehicle emission waivers a “nuclear option.” He claimed there is nothing stopping the Senate from weaponizing the Congressional Review Act to undo virtually any agency action that was not considered a rule in the past.

Padilla warned that using the CRA to overturn California’s electric vehicle mandate could set a dangerous precedent.

“Republicans have crossed the red line and gone nuclear,” Padilla said in a statement. “As the saying goes, ‘What goes around comes around.’ And it won’t be long before Democrats are back in the driver’s seat again. When that happens, all bets will be off. Every agency action that Democrats don’t like – whether it’s a rule or not – will be fair game, from mining permits and fossil fuel projects to foreign affairs and tax policies.”

Capito shot back, claiming nothing in the Senate rules gives the GAO the authority to prevent senators from overturning a rule through the Congressional Review Act. She said Republicans are not expanding the scope of the CRA. Rather, they are not narrowing the CRA by subjecting it to GAO approval.

“The procedural action we have taken today is not about the filibuster and not about the parliamentarian,” Capito said. “Instead, the procedural issue before the Senate was simply whether GAO staff should be able to block resolutions of disapproval against agency-submitted rules.”

Challenges to the Senate’s vote were swift. On the same day, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the state will be filing a lawsuit against the resolution.",https://landline.media/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/05-27-25-CA-EPA-CRAs-pic.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 13:25:39.351493

The 72% figure represents a 24% increase in system-level defects from previous years.

Of the system-level defects, 62% were identified across three ‘Safety-critical failures’. The first was 28% of defects in fire detection and suppression, 19% with faulty auxiliary circuit panels, and 15% with thermal management defects.

The other notable categorised system-level defect was ‘Performance failures,’ which comprised 6% of systems failing capacity tests.

For CEA, a critical failure denotes “Findings that may result in severe safety risks and hazardous conditions. Critical findings are likely to cause damage to other products or property, trigger non-compliance regulatory issues and generally constitute a breach of mandatory regulations.”

The firm also says that none of the inspected systems were shipped with unresolved thermal management of fire detection/suppression defects.

It follows a four-step defect resolution protocol: buyers are notified, the manufacturer is informed of the issue, the manufacturer must fix or make a new item, and then the item is re-inspected.

CEA further clarified that most system-level findings, 64%, were balance of system (BOS)-related.

Balance of system-related findings occur when defects with BESS components or improper system integration procedures arise. CEA says an example would be a live conductor exposed within the AC/DC distribution, or malfunctioning sensors and alarms due to miswiring.

30% of system-level findings were enclosure-related. These are defects from the enclosure manufacturing and mishandling during transportation. CEA gave the example of grounding mechanism defects.

6% of system-level findings are performance test-related. This includes a wide variety of manufacturing defects or improper system integration. CEA gave an example of charging/discharging failure due to wiring issues in battery rack’s high-voltage boxes.

Defects at the system level greatly affect safety, potentially causing fires, system failures, or energy shortages.

The report from CEA indicates that 28% of the inspected BESS units exhibited defects in their fire suppression systems.

These defects included non-responding release actuators for the fire extinguishing agent, non-functional fire alarm abort buttons and non-responding smoke and temperature sensors.

15% of the inspected BESS had thermal management defects. These included circulation system component failures and compressor mainboards short-circuiting.

The Roundtable coincided with the signing of a new memorandum of understanding between EnergyCo and Endeavour Energy, the local electricity distribution operator.

The agreement will support the joint development of innovative network and battery solutions within the proposed zone.

The government is considering the use of existing infrastructure and underutilised land – including rooftops and government-owned parcels – for energy storage and distribution, aiming to reduce environmental impact and community disruption.

“The Illawarra is uniquely positioned to show how renewable energy production and consumption can fit into an urban area,” said Minister for Planning and Public Spaces and Member for Wollongong Paul Scully.

“This Roundtable brings together industry pace setters and innovators in a crucial step towards delivering clean green energy that can meet the needs of both residents and local industry.”

With the growth of lithium extraction projects in the Salton Sea region, our community could become a global leader in clean energy and innovation. But if we are going to do this, we must do it right.

We are not against lithium development; we support it if done right. For too long, Imperial County has borne the brunt of poverty, unemployment, and environmental challenges. A well-managed, community-centered lithium industry could create jobs, boost infrastructure, and help address long-standing economic disparities. But these projects must need enforceable environmental protections, clear community benefits, and full transparency and accountability.

Too many of our neighbors feel like an afterthought in the decision-making process. Our voices are often missing from health concerns to basic safety planning. That has to change.

We need companies that will do more than just extract our resources, but also be committed to investing in people and communities. If lithium extraction leads to air or water contamination, or puts people at risk, there must be systems in place to hold companies accountable. That means enforceable mitigation agreements with legal teeth, not voluntary promises that are too easily broken.

Getting this right is an opportunity to set a national precedent and ensure community benefits for local communities. The outcome could help establish an efficient model for responsible lithium development that prioritizes environmental protection, community engagement, and real enforceability. If done correctly, it could show the country that clean energy doesn’t have to come at the cost of the communities closest to the work.

In Calipatria, we are especially concerned about safety. What happens if a fire or hazardous spill occurs at one of these facilities? Are our first responders trained and equipped to respond? Where is the emergency preparedness plan? We haven’t seen one.

There are also basic questions about infrastructure. Large-scale industrial development strains roads, water systems, and public services. If you build a project of this scale, you need to plan for the impact and invest in upgrades. The companies profiting from lithium extraction should bear more responsibility for these local upgrades.

Our message is simple: We support clean energy. We support jobs. We support progress. But we won’t support any of it without guarantees that our community will be protected, included, and respected.

Let this be a turning point. Let Imperial County show the rest of the nation how to balance innovation with inclusion. Lithium Valley must become a model for responsible development, not a warning sign of what happens when companies move too fast and leave communities behind.

Some of the major players in the global EV market are Chinese firms, including BYD and Geely.
This is the automaker’s first dedicated EV production facility and was made with the explicit purpose of improving the stability of its US EV battery supply chain.
With the support of these projects, the potential for North America to grow as a manufacturing hub is increased.
Delays in EV production will also have an impact on the battery supply chain, easing the demand while more gigafactories come online to meet it.","According to the International Energy Agency, the market share of EVs in the US (including plug-in hybrids) jumped from 0.2% of total car sales in 2011 to 4.6% in 2021, with similar adoption rates also seen in Canada and Mexico. However, this initial increase has stagnated in recent years. Speaking at ALSC Global last year, Criss Edwards, president and managing director North America at Unipart, explained that there was only a small increase in total market share from 2023 to 2024, from 7.5% to 8%.

Despite this recent slowdown, automakers have poured millions of dollars into the EV space, encouraging innovation at every stage of the value chain. Experts at this year’s Finished Vehicle Logistics North America conference were positive about EV forecasts and the steps that North American companies had taken to reinforce EV and battery production in the face of disruption.

At the conference, Thomas Shannon, finished vehicle operations manager for ports and logistics EV at GM, said that the most important parts of an EV and any associated logistics were “batteries, batteries [and] batteries.” The question is, how might changes to EV demand in North America impact this key component?

Brakes on legislation

A major contributor in the rapid growth of EVs in the US market over the last few years has been the increased support for EV development and purchasing. The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and the Chips and Science Act, both sought to encourage domestic EV production while making it easier for consumers to buy into EVs. The former legislation introduced tax credits for EVs manufactured in the US while the latter provided federal support for technical R&D into semiconductors, which are crucial for EVs. A 2024 report by Sucden Financial pointed directly to these regulations as being key to the growth of the EV market – as without them, there would have been no way to “accelerate the adoption” of EVs in the US.

Facilitated by federal support for research and increased consumer buy-in to the space, the demand for batteries skyrocketed and far outweighed the supply and production capabilities. This continued on a trend seen in the wake of the Covid pandemic where core battery materials – most commonly lithium, but also cobalt and nickel – were in short supply, leading to increased prices and resource competition. Despite these supply-side challenges, automakers saw success in the hybrid and EV space, with almost 20m units being sold in the US in 2022 alone.

However, very early into his new term, President Trump announced a halt on IRA benefits. This followed an earlier statement about revoking an unspecified EV mandate.

The response to this was mixed, with some suggesting it could help address the difference between demand and supply in the domestic US market for EVs. If such a slowdown occurred, it would relieve some pressure on the battery supply chain and potentially help level out the price of battery materials. However, others feared it would see EV adoption stagnate even further, resulting in wasted investment for OEMs and exacerbating existing fiscal pressures.

The Trump administration “paint[ed] a clear expectation for US policy direction in the immediate term,” according to Stephanie Brinley, associate director of AutoIntelligence at S&P Global Mobility, who was commenting at the time. Her prediction was correct, as a bill recently introduced by the House of Representatives seeks to remove several of the tax credits associated with EVs. That includes the Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit, part of the IRA, which stipulates that businesses and tax-exempt organisations that buy a qualified commercial clean vehicle may qualify under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 45W for a clean vehicle tax credit of $7,500 for vehicles of up to 6,350kg, and $40,000 for vehicles over that weight.

Demonstrating how entrenched these tax credits were, Cox Automotive reported that the leasing rate for EVs increased from around 11% in 2022 to around 45% in 2024, which is an increase that is double the industry standard percentage. These credits being removed would disincentivise consumers even further, in turn slowing down both EV and battery demand.

The North American market does not exist in a vacuum however, and the role of foreign carmakers is not to be ignored. Some of the major players in the global EV market are Chinese firms, including BYD and Geely. Their vertical integration within the value chain has proven disruptive to the sector, as they have more agency over and resiliency in their battery supply chains compared to American counterparts. However, this disruption may not be a major factor going forward, as the previous Biden administration took steps to prohibit the sale and import of Chinese hardware and software systems. Similarly, the tariffs introduced by President Trump at the start of April further limit the flow of Chinese and other foreign battery parts into the US, which too could limit US-based EV production.

Nearshoring to strengthen battery supply

With the increased level of uncertainty, especially surrounding international cargo flows, there has been a significant rise in nearshoring as a means to reduce disruption and improve supply chain resiliency, as well as capitalise on the rising domestic market. As Kurt Kelty, vice-president of battery cell and pack at GM, puts it: “It’s a simple and pragmatic reality that development of any new technology benefits greatly from proximity to customers…[.] Today, the US has the customer base.”

Kelty’s comments represent a wider move by American OEMs to domesticate production within the EV value chain, including batteries and battery components. GM, for example, has committed to building a battery facility at its tech hub in Warren, Michigan with the goal of boosting the company’s R&D in battery tech. Similarly, last summer Ford announced plans to reshore battery production for several of its EV models, including the best-selling EV truck in the US currently, the F-150 Lightning, with the production moving from Poland to Michigan. Rivian also recently announced a $120m supplier park project attached to its EV production facility in Illinois – a move that CEO RJ Scaringe called a “key enabler” for scaling up the site’s production when the company’s R2 model launches next year.

While the price of GM’s new facility was not announced, the moves are indicative of the belief held by some American OEMs, despite any differences in scale and market share, that EVs will continue to grow and so it is worth investing the means to streamline and improve production efficiency.

Support for this idea is so strong that Kelty also stated that North America will soon become the global leader in EV battery production – an idea that has the potential to reverse the established flows of battery material and information from East to West.

This is also seen in the steps these automakers are taking to strengthen their domestic EV and battery logistics. Shannon expanded on his earlier declaration by explaining how GM had identified problems in its EV infrastructure and taken steps to fix it. For instance, deploying mobile charging stations along both rail and road routes. Fellow panellists echoed this sentiment, talking about how – even though adjustments would be required in both mentalities and infrastructure – there was invested support in ensuring EV logistics success. However, increased communication is key to this. As Charles Franklin, Glovis America’s senior national manager for business development, succinctly put it: “We’ll ship whatever you build – I just want you to be open on what your constraints are, and then I can make it happen.”

Foreign investment

It is not only American OEMs that are taking steps to localise EV and battery production in North America. Earlier this year, Toyota revealed that its first battery manufacturing plant outside Japan, located in North Carolina, was ready to begin production. The company’s press release said that the $14 billion plant is part of its ‘best-in-town’ approach, focused on “investing and producing locally, contributing to the local community and offering products tailored to local needs through a multi-pathway strategy.”

Hyundai already has opened a metaplant in the state of Georgia following a $5.54 billion joint investment from the company and its suppliers. This is the automaker’s first dedicated EV production facility and was made with the explicit purpose of improving the stability of its US EV battery supply chain. Again, this mindset and the level of investment represents a strong vote of confidence in the continued growth of the EV market in North America from OEMs. It also reinforces how the flow of batteries might change over the coming years, as the infrastructure required for the US to become a key manufacturing hub for batteries is increasingly being created from both domestic and foreign players.

While EV and battery production sites may be domesticated, there is still the risk that the supply of battery materials further upstream may be disrupted. However, recent research from the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) downplays this concern. Chang Shen, researcher at the ICCT, commented that “there’s more than 100 lithium mining and refining projects underway within the US and its trade partners”. With the support of these projects, the potential for North America to grow as a manufacturing hub is increased. Creating this direct flow of core battery components improves resiliency by reducing reliance on other markets and regions for a key part of EV production.

Another benefit to increased domestic mining and refining is that the distances covered in the supply of materials is significantly shorter which reduces the environmental impact of transporting them. Shorter distances between refinery and factory can therefore help American OEMs further decarbonise their supply chains and hit sustainability targets.

Scale backs and delays

Despite the optimism shared by some OEMs, others have raised concerns over the continued success of the EV market in the US and have responded by pulling away from battery-related investments. As Criss Edwards points out in his Red Sofa interview, EV sales have fallen short of expectations, which has resulted in some OEMs shifting gear. For example, while Ford plans to reshore its battery production, it is making several planned SUV model lines hybrid instead of purely electric and has said that its annual capital expenditure for EVs will drop from 40% to 30%.

Others have scaled back on planned EV expansions or delayed planned production lines. Stellantis, meanwhile, has pushed production of the electric version of the Dodge Challenger and the Ram 1500 Ramcharger back from 2026 to 2027. For the latter, this is the second pushback it’s had in as many years. Such moves bely increased caution surrounding EVs that is set to continue in the face of reduced governmental support and a projected slowdown in consumer demand.

Delays in EV production will also have an impact on the battery supply chain, easing the demand while more gigafactories come online to meet it. However, a renewed focus on hybrid models over pure EVs will maintain at least some investment in batteries from the more cautious OEMs.

So, what does the future hold for EV batteries in North America? The Global EV Outlook, published earlier in May by the International Energy Agency, forecast that sales of plug-in cars in the US will double to an overall automotive market share of 20% by 2030. While this may seem like solid growth, it is still far below the figure expected by many OEMs at the turn of the decade.

Such a difference may be alarming to some but there is still optimism from several leaders in the field, even if their approaches have adjusted. At this year’s FVL North America conference, Patrick Manzi, chief economist at the National Automobile Dealers Association, outlined several of the key problems facing the EV sector in North America, pointing to charging infrastructure and battery costs as critical roadblocks.

While the latter of these problems might be solved by nearshoring efforts, a pullback in investment might mean that the former remains a problem. In the face of all the difficulties facing the North American EV market, Manzi accurately summarised that “uncertainty is the only constant right now” but does think that “cooler heads could change that.”",https://d3n5uof8vony13.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/8/1/5/332815_factoryrowofevs_530051.jpeg,N,,2025-05-27 13:22:24.261105

More than 50 years ago, Congress allowed California to request a “waiver” from applicable federal air regulations. Congress provided California with this tool because the state had extraordinarily poor air quality and unique challenges in controlling it. Recently, California has abused that discreet authority to set climate policy across the country.

In December 2024, the lame duck Biden Environmental Protection Agency approved California’s request to implement its Advanced Clean Cars II regulation when Democrats wouldn’t have to face voters over this politically toxic policy.

California’s ACC II waiver requires all vehicles sold in the state, Washington, D.C., and the 11 other states that have adopted California’s standard to be zero-emission vehicles by 2035. This means that in one decade, these states, totaling 30% of the nation’s new car market, will have a full ban on the sale of gasoline-powered vehicles and traditional hybrids. These unattainable standards, backed by a fine of over $26,000 per vehicle for non-compliance, would reshape auto manufacturing and take away consumer choice across the country.

The Biden EPA tried to avoid accountability from Congress by claiming its decision was not a rule and refusing to submit it to Congress under the CRA. Fortunately, Trump corrected this by identifying the waiver as a rule and submitting it to Congress.

To protect consumers and workers, as well as the Senate’s oversight authority over bad agency rules, I introduced a resolution under the CRA to reverse the EPA’s California waiver. Using this statutory process allows members of the Senate and the House, the constitutionally elected representatives of all Americans, to decide whether a nationally significant agency rule should move forward.

After the rule was submitted to Congress, Senate Democrats who wanted to protect this electric vehicle mandate requested the Government Accountability Office find that the waiver was not a rule under the CRA. Once a rule is submitted by an agency, GAO consistently refrains from issuing an opinion. Despite its own precedent, GAO “observed” in a letter that the Biden EPA action approving California’s waiver was not a rule under the CRA, despite the agency’s submittal to Congress.

Democrats got this GAO letter to obstruct the Senate from exercising its authority provided by the CRA. Nothing in the plain text of the CRA, Senate rules, or Senate precedents gives unelected staff at the GAO the authority to prevent the Senate from considering a resolution of disapproval against a rule that has been submitted to Congress.

Once an agency submits a rule to Congress, as the EPA did here, elected representatives are able to decide whether to approve or disapprove of the rule. That is how the CRA precedent has functioned since its enactment in 1996 as a statutory exception to the Senate’s normal practice of unlimited debate. This allows Congress to realize the fundamental purpose of the CRA: oversight by elected representatives over unelected agencies.

GAO FINDS TRUMP VIOLATED LAW BY WITHHOLDING CONGRESSIONALLY APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR EV CHARGING STATIONS

Democratic senators claim that our action undermines the legislative filibuster. That is simply untrue. Unlike my Democratic colleagues, I have supported the legislative filibuster as a senator in the majority and as a senator in the minority. The procedural action we have taken is not about the filibuster. Instead, the procedural action the Senate has taken is simply about whether GAO staff can violate its own precedent and have veto authority over elected officials’ ability to use the CRA against rules submitted to Congress by an agency. The answer is no.

Despite the best efforts of unelected bureaucrats in California, the Biden administration, and congressional Democrats to shield this electric vehicle mandate from the will of the people, Congress has rejected California’s attempt to impose a mandate that would have eliminated consumer choice, increased prices, and killed jobs across the country.

Partnering with industry and academia, their goal is to enable more effective and informed use of underground resources — from fossil fuels to geothermal energy to water.

Berkeley Lab’s researchers are advancing the science needed to access underground energy sources and store energy underground. They’ve made big advances in estimating lithium reserves and mapping rare earth elements, and are inventing new ways to measure earthquake risks to infrastructure and track groundwater. Read on to learn how Berkeley Lab is refining our understanding of the subsurface environment.

Geothermal Energy

Berkeley Lab geoscientists are advancing enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) — engineered reservoirs in Earth’s subsurface capable of providing access to round-the-clock energy. EGS technologies stimulate the flow of fluids through hot rocks that can be converted to electricity at the surface. Geothermal electricity-generating capacity has the potential to expand 20-fold in the United States by 2050 — enough to power up to 65 million homes.

With nearly 50 years of geothermal research behind them, geoscientists at Berkeley Lab study which geologic factors, such as depth and rock type, are most favorable for developing geothermal reservoirs. They led the U.S. Department of Energy-funded EGS Collab project, which focused on developing technologies to model and monitor rock fracturing at depths greater than two kilometers and temperatures exceeding 200°C. Now, they are testing methods to create and sustain EGS at Utah FORGE, a field-scale lab, and through other DOE-supported demonstration projects, including one exploring superhot conditions above 700°F. These can provide significantly more energy compared to geothermal reservoirs with lower temperatures.

Critical Minerals and Materials

The U.S. relies heavily on imports for critical minerals such as lithium, a key battery metal. With demand for some of these critical minerals expected to increase by up to seven times by 2030, Berkeley Lab scientists are finding new ways to tap into domestic resources and develop technologies for efficient mineral recovery. They use state-of-the-art tools to better understand how mineral systems form, evolve, and are transformed into important functional materials. Their research integrates fieldwork, laboratory experiments, and modeling to explore sources such as lithium in geothermal fluids and claystones, rare earth elements in mine tailings, and cobalt and cadmium in geological rock formations.

In a major step toward securing minerals domestically, Berkeley Lab scientists conducted the most comprehensive analysis yet of lithium reserves found in geothermal brines from Southern California’s Salton Sea. Their findings indicate the region could contain over 3,400 kilotons of lithium — enough to produce more than 375 million electric vehicle (EV) batteries, surpassing the total number of vehicles currently on U.S. roads.

AI and machine learning play a key role in characterizing and processing these critical minerals. The team is also mapping rare earth elements — like neodymium, used in high-performance magnets for energy and medical applications — from industrial waste such as coal fly ash. By combining drone-based geophysical sensing with AI, they are pinpointing neodymium hotspots at fly ash sites in Pennsylvania and developing processes to efficiently transform them into magnets.

Seismic Risk and Impact

Berkeley Lab researchers study seismic activity through real-world measurements and high-performance computing to predict major quakes and understand earthquake impacts on groundwater. Using the Perlmutter supercomputer at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), located at Berkeley Lab, they create high-frequency ground shaking simulations to identify the infrastructure within a region most at risk of a severe quake. This large database of simulated ground motions for the San Francisco Bay Area, shared with engineers via an open-access database, related to a M7 Hayward fault earthquake and is being replicated in the Los Angeles region and in a region of the Midwest that has experienced large quakes. This work is progressing in partnership with the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center at UC Berkeley and with the University of California at Los Angeles. With partners at the University of Nevada-Reno, the researchers also developed the largest U.S. facility for studying how the soil around a structure influences building performance during quakes.

Another team deployed an ultra-sensitive sensor developed at Berkeley Lab’s Geosciences Measurement Facility into a 200-meter-long borehole along the San Andreas Fault to measure natural seismicity from earthquakes. An example of what the future of earthquake data collection could look like, these instruments capture in real-time the displacement, location, and any changes in water pressure associated with faults — representing the first time that datasets can be sourced from a singular, continuous, autonomous sensor. This can give unprecedented insights into important societal and environmental implications from seismic activity, such as water-level shifts.

Energy Generation and Storage

Building on their expertise in fluid behavior in underground rock from geothermal energy research, Berkeley Lab scientists are exploring ways to ensure year-round energy access through geologic hydrogen and underground water-storage systems. With support from DOE’s ARPA-E program, they conduct research essential to stimulating the production of geologic hydrogen through chemical reactions between certain rocks and water in the subsurface, and to extracting geologic hydrogen safely. Applying knowledge gained over several decades of observing how fluids behave in Earth’s subsurface, one team is studying how to inject fluids at varying pressures, temperatures, and pH levels to control the extraction of hydrogen without inducing harmful seismicity.

Geologic hydrogen generation occurs fastest in deep and hot environments that would be costly and commercially risky to access. Berkeley Lab researchers are using quantum chemistry simulations and experiments as they investigate how to speed up hydrogen-generating reactions in cooler, shallower environments safely and affordably.

In parallel, scientists are advancing aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES), which uses naturally occurring underground water to store energy for later use to heat and cool buildings — helping reduce power grid strain during extreme temperatures. These systems use deeper aquifers that don’t impact drinking water supplies and often rely on heat pumps to deliver energy at usable temperatures.

Water Management and Reuse

Approximately 40% of the U.S. water supply comes from underground reserves, but their location, volume, and availability are often uncertain. To better understand and manage these resources, Berkeley Lab geophysicists track water movement using a mix of traditional methods, new sensors, and modeling tools. Their work helps answer key questions about groundwater recharge — such as where water goes, whether it reaches the aquifer, and how subsurface geology affects recharge. They’ve developed a way to estimate aquifer volume changes by analyzing ground deformation with satellite images and advanced modeling, creating region-specific 3D groundwater maps.

A suite of software codes developed at Berkeley Lab, called TOUGH for Transport of Unsaturated Groundwater and Heat, helps solve complex problems requiring advanced simulation of the movement of fluids and heat in Earth’s subsurface. Originally developed to trace groundwater contamination, the TOUGH codes are now widely used in research and industry for applications like geothermal energy and oil and gas production.

Berkeley Lab also leads efforts through the National Alliance for Water Innovation (NAWI) to improve desalination technologies for treating groundwater and other salty waters. Supported by the DOE and several California agencies, NAWI aims to lower the cost and energy demands of using nontraditional water sources.

According to a Princeton University analysis, the bill cancels all uncommitted funding for clean energy and climate programs enacted by the IRA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021.
Since its inception, the IRA has invested more than $90 billion in clean energy technologies and improvements for the building sector.
The move to target clean energy tax credits comes as politicians have long argued that the costs associated with the IRA’s energy and climate provisions are unnecessary, burdensome, expensive and add to the country’s deficit.","The United States House of Representatives recently passed the budget bill, H.R. 1, which seeks to repeal or modify clean energy programs and rescind funds offered by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). According to a Princeton University analysis, the bill cancels all uncommitted funding for clean energy and climate programs enacted by the IRA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021.

Since the IRA’s adoption in 2022, multiple glass industry-related companies have taken advantage of its tax incentives. The clean energy bill offers several benefits for the glass and glazing industry, including enabling a tax credit for electrochromic glass, appropriating millions to help states and localities adopt building energy codes and offering billions in grants to retrofit and upgrade building efficiency technology.

The IRA’s funding has also produced various programs targeting building decarbonization, such as the United States General Services Administration’s Green Proving Ground program. Since its inception, the IRA has invested more than $90 billion in clean energy technologies and improvements for the building sector. Nearly $50 million has already been awarded to parties working to decarbonize buildings.

According to the current version of H.R. 1, several provisions would end the Section 45Y Clean Energy Production Credit and the Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Credit for any qualified facilities that don’t begin construction within 60 days following the bill’s enactment and that are placed in service after the end of 2028. Additional IRA provisions targeted by H.R. 1 include the following:

Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund

High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Program

State-Based Home Efficiency Contractor Training Grants

Clean Energy Production Tax Credits

Princeton University estimates that repealing current federal energy and climate policies would increase U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by around 0.5 billion metric tons annually in 2030 and more than 1 billion metric tons in 2035. A repeal would raise U.S. household and business energy expenditures by $25 billion annually in 2030 and more than $50 billion in 2035. Furthermore, a repeal would increase average U.S. household energy costs by roughly $100 to $160 per household per year in 2030, and approximately $270 to $415 per year in 2035 and endanger $522 billion in pending investments in U.S. clean energy supply and manufacturing.

But with advances in technology such as generative artificial intelligence driving up energy usage across the country, Illinois lawmakers from both parties, as well as environmental advocates, say the state’s energy policy has fallen behind.

But the fee for new data centers and other large energy users would be three times larger under the latest proposal.","When Illinois enacted a sweeping clean energy law in 2021, the state was seen as ahead of the curve in promoting renewable energy standards and creating clean energy jobs.

But with advances in technology such as generative artificial intelligence driving up energy usage across the country, Illinois lawmakers from both parties, as well as environmental advocates, say the state’s energy policy has fallen behind.

In the final days of the spring session, lawmakers are working on a legislative package aimed at addressing the state’s growing energy needs and rising costs without derailing the ambitious goals championed by Gov. JB Pritzker to make the state carbon-free by midcentury.

“What we’re trying to do is find ways to ensure those capacity spikes don’t continue for years into the future, and there’s really only two ways of doing that, and that’s by either decreasing demand for electricity or increasing supply,” said state Sen. Bill Cunningham, a Chicago Democrat who’s leading energy legislation efforts in the Senate. “I think that’s really the underlying impetus for energy bills this session.”

Due to supply cost increases, the average bill for a residential Commonwealth Edison customer is expected to increase this summer by $10.60 per month. The typical Ameren customer’s monthly bill is expected to increase by approximately 18% to 22%, depending on their usage.

Cunningham said while lawmakers don’t have control over the expected increased electricity charges going into effect this June, they can work to mitigate future spikes.

The state’s past energy legislation, such as the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, which aims for 40% renewable energy by 2030, did not account for the dramatic rise in energy usage from data centers and other large energy developers, Cunningham said.

There are several business developments, such as data centers, being planned in Illinois that could bring a total of 30 gigawatts of electricity, the equivalent of 3 billion light bulbs, to the grid starting in 2029, according to Anna Markowski, Midwest director of Place-Based Advocacy on Climate and Energy for the Natural Resources Defense Council. That’s more than double the grid’s current maximum capacity, Markowski said.

A study by the Illinois Commerce Commission released early May estimated that the state could lose approximately $12 billion in direct development investments, along with $60 billion in hardware and systems investments, for every gigawatt of power that can’t be provided.

“The markets are screaming at us, saying build more generation,” said Mark Denzler, president and CEO of the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association. “Everyone’s bidding for a limited amount of power.”

Lawmakers sent a 600-page draft of energy legislation to stakeholders in early May, less than two weeks before the end of session. The measure’s proposals range from expanding nuclear energy to increasing large-scale energy storage in batteries.

One proposal would require new data centers and other large energy users building in Illinois to bring their own renewable energy to the grid, or pay a higher fee into the state budget that would fund other renewable projects. The measure is backed by environmental interests and others who say the companies building large data centers and other businesses that sap energy resources should pay more, instead of having the burden fall on homeowners and small-business users.

“Once those big loads start to come on the grid, we’re going to start to see instability,” Markowski said. “We’re going to start to see costs transferred onto every household, and so what we’re trying to do within the bill is protect against that by making them bring new energy. You can’t just cannibalize whatever we have here.”

Illinois electrical consumers, from residential consumers to commercial data centers, are already required to pay a fee to the state’s renewable portfolio standards, which fund the part of the state budget used to award grants to renewable energy developers.

But the fee for new data centers and other large energy users would be three times larger under the latest proposal.

Denzler warned the higher fee could have an adverse impact on economic development in the state.

“I mean your costs right there are going to be astronomical for a large user, and they’re just going to go to Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and other states,” Denzler said.

Another proposal that’s received increased support this year is a plan that could expand nuclear power by lifting a moratorium on the construction of new nuclear plants, an idea organized labor and manufacturers have historically backed while environmental groups have opposed.

Gov. Pritzker has indicated support for the idea of allowing flexibility on new nuclear plants, a shift from his previous position against large-scale nuclear plants. He vetoed a bill to lift the state’s decade-old moratorium on new nuclear plants in 2023.

“We’re looking forward to having a bill that comes to my desk that will allow us to expand the options for nuclear in the state of Illinois,” Pritzker said in mid-April. “But it has to be done in the right way, and I think the legislature and my team are working together to make sure that that happens.”

The legislative draft also would create an ambitious new goal for large-scale energy storage through large batteries that would absorb excess wind and solar power for later use, along with goals to deliver clean, low-cost energy, while also promoting several efficiency measures supporting virtual power plants.

Cunningham said that if the larger legislative package does not come together, proposals within the measure could still be pushed as individual bills.

“We’ll see if it bears fruit,” Cunningham said.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CTC-L-Illinois-Capitol24_228578818.jpg?w=1024&h=678,N,,2025-05-27 13:23:54.122590

What’s being done to get more minorities into green jobs?

Sam W., via email

Green jobs—those that directly contribute to a sustainable environment—have been growing in need as the world has become more eco-focused. According to the Solar Energies Industries Association (SEIA), between 2014 and 2019 employment in the solar energy sector increased five times faster than job growth in the general U.S. economy.

Despite this, there is still more to be done to improve workforce diversity. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory reported that 69 percent of the wind energy work force is white, and SEIA found that its workforce is 73 percent white. There is a clear lack of diversity in the green jobs workforce, often due to an underrepresentation of minorities trained in leadership roles, wage gaps unequal hiring practices. Lucky, there are a few ways green companies can address this problem.

The first solution to this problem is advancing access to training and degrees required for green jobs. Engineering jobs require bachelor’s degrees, but in 2022 only a quarter of engineering bachelor’s degrees were earned by women, and in 2018 only 4.6 percent were earned by Black people. “Despite the efforts of many ... within the formal educational system, education for a just and sustainable world is not a high priority,” explains Anthony D. Cortese in his report The Critical Role of Higher Education in Creating a Sustainable Future. In order to create a more diverse workforce, companies should offer financial aid for higher education and create real-life, research experiences designated for women and people of color.

Jobs that do not require degrees, such as repair, maintenance and construction, are covered by unions, though while unions generally protect workers’ rights and improve working conditions, they have a history of being exclusionary. “I understand that in the United States the same corporations that have been destroying the planet have collaborated to make it so that most American workers no longer have good, unionized jobs,” says Jane McAlevey, author and senior policy fellow at the University of California Berkeley’s Labor Center. Unions can implement new programs and policies, such as mentorship programs, to increase minority representation and improve worker skills. Another strategy is to create programs specifically for women and people of color that provide career development and financial support for transportation, uniforms or food.

Interested in taking action? Support companies that have inclusive hiring practices and educate your community about the need for diversity in the green job workforce.

About Volcon

Based in the Austin, Texas area, Volcon was founded as the first all-electric power sports company producing high-quality and sustainable electric vehicles for the outdoor community. Volcon electric vehicles are the future of off-roading, not only because of their environmental benefits but also because of their near-silent operation, which allows for a more immersive outdoor experience.

Volcon's vehicle roadmap includes both motorcycles and UTVs. Its first product, the innovative Grunt, began shipping to customers in late 2021 and combines a fat-tired physique with high-torque electric power and a near-silent drive train. The Volcon Grunt EVO, an evolution of the original Grunt with a belt drive, an improved suspension, and seat, began shipping to customers in October 2023. The Brat is Volcon's first foray into the wildly popular eBike market for both on-road and off-road riding and is currently being delivered to dealers across North America. In 2024, Volcon entered the rapidly expanding LUV and UTV market and shipped its first production MN1 unit in October 2024. The new MN1 and HF1 products empower the driver to explore the outdoors in a new and unique way that gas-powered units cannot. They offer the same thrilling performance of a standard LUV / UTV without the noise (or pollution), allowing the driver to explore the outdoors with all their senses.

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is experiencing a significant sales decline across key markets, particularly in Europe, where monthly sales plunged by nearly half in April 2025. Despite these concerning trends, Wall Street analysts are increasingly bullish on the electric vehicle maker’s long-term prospects, with some firms raising price targets to street-high levels based on Tesla’s artificial intelligence and autonomous driving ambitions.

Tesla Sales Plunge in the European Market

Tesla’s European operations are experiencing a severe downturn, with sales across 32 European countries tumbling 49% to just 7,261 vehicles in April 2025, down from 14,228 in the same month the previous year. This dramatic decline comes as the broader electric vehicle market in Europe actually grew by approximately 28%, highlighting Tesla’s specific challenges.

The sales collapse extends beyond a single month, with Tesla’s European sales falling roughly 39% to 61,320 vehicles for the first four months of 2025, while the continent’s overall auto market showed little change during the same period.

The decline is attributed to multiple factors, including protests and boycotts over Elon Musk’s political involvement, an aging model lineup, and intensifying competition from Chinese EV brands like SAIC, which saw sales rise 54% in April.

Additionally, Tesla faced operational challenges with factory shutdowns for several weeks while upgrading its best-selling Model Y sport utility vehicle, which constrained supply. The company’s struggles are further compounded by US President Donald Trump’s trade war, which has reportedly turned Europeans away from American brands, with Trump threatening a 50% tariff on EU goods before agreeing to delay duties until July.

Analyst Remain Upbeat on Tesla’s Long-Term Ambitions as an AI Company

Despite the sales challenges, Wall Street analysts remain remarkably optimistic about Tesla’s future prospects.

Wedbush Securities has issued the most bullish call, raising Tesla’s price target to a street-high $500 from $350, implying approximately 47% upside potential. Analyst Daniel Ives positions Tesla as “one of the best pure plays on AI for the next decade,” emphasizing the company’s artificial intelligence and full self-driving (FSD) ambitions as key value drivers.

Cantor Fitzgerald has also maintained its $355 price target with an Overweight rating, highlighting Tesla’s ambitious plans to deploy fully autonomous robotaxis starting with a modest fleet in Austin by the end of June 2025. The initial phase will involve Model Y vehicles equipped with unsupervised Full Self-Driving technology, with expectations to scale up and expand into other cities by year-end.

Key catalysts identified by analysts include the rollout of FSD in China (which began in Q1 2025), expected deployment in Europe during the first half of 2025 pending regulatory approval, and high-volume production of the Optimus Bot slated for 2026 with initial customer deliveries projected for 2027. Wedbush’s Ives forecasts that Tesla’s autonomy and robotaxi service could unlock approximately $1 trillion in AI-related valuation, potentially propelling the company’s market capitalization to $2 trillion by late 2026.

Divergence Between Tesla’s Short-Term Performance and Long-Term Potential

The contrast between Tesla’s current operational challenges and analyst expectations creates a fascinating market dynamic. While Tesla’s FSD technology has accumulated over 3.5 billion miles with supervision as of Q1 2025, the company faces immediate headwinds from macroeconomic conditions, tariffs, and the anticipated removal of EV tax credits.

Analysts acknowledge these near-term challenges but remain focused on Tesla’s technological transformation. The company’s strong financial position, with a current ratio of 2.0 and more cash than debt on its balance sheet, provides resilience against current headwinds. Tesla also plans to introduce a lower-priced vehicle in the first half of 2025, starting around $30,000 including tax credits, which could align well with market conditions.

Elon Musk’s confirmed commitment to Tesla for the coming years, even as he prepares to conclude his role at DOGE, has provided additional reassurance to analysts. The company is expected to update its 2025 automotive growth targets and energy storage outlook next quarter, aiming for over 50% year-over-year growth following more than 100% increase in FY24.

Tesla Stock Gains on Early Tuesday Trading

As of May 27, 2025, at 10:31 AM EDT, Tesla stock (NASDAQ: TSLA) was trading at $357.42, up $18.08 (+5.33%) with the market open. The stock has shown significant volatility, with a 52-week range of $167.41 to $488.54, and currently trades near the higher end of this range with a market capitalization of $1.151 trillion.

Tesla’s valuation metrics reflect its premium positioning, with a trailing P/E ratio of 193.91 and forward P/E of 158.73. The company maintains strong financial health with $37 billion in total cash and a debt-to-equity ratio of just 17.41%. Despite the recent sales challenges, Tesla generated $95.72 billion in trailing twelve-month revenue with a profit margin of 6.38%.

The analyst community shows mixed sentiment with price targets ranging from a low of $115.00 to Wedbush’s high of $500.00, with an average target of $299.38.

This wide range reflects the significant uncertainty around Tesla’s transition from a traditional automaker to an AI and robotics company, with current trading levels suggesting the market is pricing in substantial future growth from autonomous driving and energy storage initiatives.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump signed executive orders Friday intended to quadruple domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, a goal experts say the United States is highly unlikely to reach.

To speed up the development of nuclear power, the orders grant the U.S. energy secretary authority to approve some advanced reactor designs and projects, taking authority away from the independent safety agency that has regulated the U.S. nuclear industry for five decades.

The order comes as demand for electricity surges amid a boom in energy-hungry data centers and artificial intelligence. Tech companies, venture capitalists, states and others are competing for electricity and straining the nation’s electric grid.

“We’ve got enough electricity to win the AI arms race with China,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said. “What we do in the next five years related to electricity is going to determine the next 50” years in the industry.

Still, it’s unlikely the U.S. could quadruple its nuclear production in the time frame the White House specified. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two reactors, at a nuclear plant in Georgia, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.

The nation’s 94 nuclear reactors supply about 19% of U.S. electricity, compared to about 60% for fossil fuels and 21% for renewables, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Trump is enthusiastic

At the Oval Office signing, Trump, surrounded by industry executives, called nuclear a “hot industry,” adding, “It’s time for nuclear, and we’re going to do it very big.”

Burgum and other speakers said the industry has stagnated and has been choked by overregulation.

“Mark this day on your calendar. This is going to turn the clock back on over 50 years of overregulation of an industry,” said Burgum, who chairs Trump’s newly formed Energy Dominance Council.

The orders would reorganize the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission to ensure quicker reviews of nuclear projects, including an 18-month deadline for the NRC to act on industry applications. The measures also create a pilot program intended to place three new experimental reactors online by July 4, 2026 — 13 months from now — and invoke the Defense Production Act to allow emergency measures to ensure the U.S. has enough uranium and other reactor fuel for a modernized nuclear energy sector.

The orders also call for the Energy and Defense departments to assess the feasibility of restarting closed nuclear power plants and explore siting reactors on federal lands and military bases.

The NRC is assessing the executive orders and will comply with White House directives, spokesperson Scott Burnell said Friday.

Jacob DeWitte, chief executive officer of the nuclear energy company Oklo, brought a golf ball to the Oval Office. He told Trump that’s the amount of uranium that can power someone’s needs for their entire life.

“It doesn’t get any better than that,” he said, holding up the ball.

“Very exciting indeed,” Trump said.

Trump has signed a spate of executive orders promoting oil, gas and coal that warm the planet when burned to produce electricity. Nuclear reactors generate electricity without emitting greenhouse gases.

Trump said reactors are safe and clean, but did not mention climate benefits. Safety advocates warn that nuclear technology still comes with significant risks that other low-carbon energy sources don’t, including the danger of accidents or targeted attacks, and the unresolved question of how to store tens of thousands of tons of hazardous nuclear waste.

The order to reorganize the NRC will include significant staff reductions but is not intended to fire NRC commissioners who lead the agency. David Wright, a former South Carolina elected official and utility commissioner, chairs the five-member panel. His term ends June 30, and it is unclear if he will be reappointed.

Critics have trepidations

Critics say the White House moves could compromise safety and violate legal frameworks such as the Atomic Energy Act. Compromising the independence of the NRC or encouraging it to be circumvented could weaken the agency and make regulation less effective, said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“Simply put, the U.S. nuclear industry will fail if safety is not made a priority,” he said.

Gregory Jaczko, who led the NRC under President Barack Obama, said Trump’s executive orders look like someone asked an AI chatbot, “How do we make the nuclear industry worse in this country?”

He called the orders a “guillotine to the nation’s nuclear safety system” that will make the country less safe, the industry less reliable and the climate crisis more severe.

A number of countries are speeding up efforts to license and build a new generation of smaller nuclear reactors to meet a surging demand for electricity and supply it carbon-free. Last year, Congress passed legislation that President Joe Biden signed to modernize the licensing of new reactor technologies so they can be built faster.

This month, the power company in Ontario, Canada, began building the first of four small nuclear reactors.

Valar Atomics is a nuclear reactor developer in California. Founder and CEO Isaiah Taylor said nuclear development and innovation in the United States has been slowed by too much red tape, while Russia and China are speeding ahead. He said he’s most excited about the mandate for the Energy Department to speed up the pace of innovation.

The NRC is currently reviewing applications from companies and a utility that want to build small nuclear reactors to begin providing power in the early 2030s. Currently, the NRC expects its reviews to take three years or less.

As electric vehicle juggernaut Tesla urges longtime battery partner Panasonic to accelerate production in the US, Korean are poised to take the spotlight as key material suppliers — leveraging their cost competitiveness and reduced reliance on the Chinese supply chain.

According to The Financial Times, Tesla has recently pushed Panasonic to fast-track the two companies’ joint battery cell manufacturing plant, which has been under construction since 2022. The $4 billion project, initially scheduled to begin operations by March this year, has been rescheduled for as early as July due to unexpected setbacks, including cost increases. The plant’s annual capacity is projected at 30 gigawatt-hours — enough to power approximately 300,000 vehicles — and is expected to increase Tesla’s US production capacity by 60 percent by March 2027.

“As we’ve been told by our customer to get Kansas moving quickly, we’re hurrying to do so … There are risks, but we are planning on robust demand for batteries from our main customer as of now,” said Panasonic CEO Yuki Kusumi in an interview with Tokyo-based media, as quoted by the Financial Times.

Korean suppliers rise as EV battery formulas evolve

Even if Panasonic begins operations at its Kansas plant this year, concerns remain over a potential production gap in new battery materials, stemming from Tesla’s cost-cutting strategy amid slowing EV demand, according to sources.

Reportedly, one of Panasonic’s main material suppliers, Japan’s Sumitomo Chemical, has announced plans to shift its cathode material chemistry from nickel, cobalt and aluminum (NCA) to nickel, cobalt and manganese (NCM) starting next year, citing customer demand.

“There’s a reason why Korean battery makers have preferred NCM over NCA. Manganese is significantly cheaper than aluminum — almost incomparable,” said Yang Min-ho, an energy engineering professor at Dankook University. “From a research perspective, it has also shown better structural stability in tri-component lithium-ion batteries. Although NCA initially outperformed NCM, companies have since improved capacity by increasing nickel content.”

While Korea’s LG Chem and L&F Co. are known to supply NCA cathode materials for Tesla through Panasonic, their deeper focus on NCM gives them a competitive edge over Sumitomo Chemical.

“We believe our company’s diversified product portfolio — ranging from NCM and nickel cobalt manganese aluminum (NCMA) to NCA — could appeal to Panasonic,” said an industry source who requested anonymity.

Industry insiders also point out that Korean firms may benefit from distancing themselves from the Chinese graphite supply chain. Despite pushback from Tesla and Panasonic, the US Commerce Department on May 20 issued a preliminary ruling to impose tariffs of up to 720 percent on certain Chinese graphite imports, citing unfair government subsidies.

In response, Posco Future M last month announced a 396.1 billion won ($289 million) investment in spherical graphite production — a key precursor for anodes — to reduce its reliance on Chinese raw materials.

Legacy carmakers chip away at Tesla’s lead

Tesla, still the leading EV maker in the US, is under pressure as it gradually loses market dominance — a position it established with the launch of its Model S sedan in 2012.

According to Cox Automotive, Tesla’s US market share fell from 55 percent in 2023 to 48.7 percent in 2024 — the first time it has dropped below 50 percent. Sales declined about 6 percent year-on-year to 633,762 units.

Meanwhile, legacy automakers such as General Motors, Ford and Hyundai Motor Group are expanding their presence in the US EV market. Hyundai Motor and Kia collectively sold 123,000 battery electric vehicles in the US in 2024, securing a 10 percent market share, according to data from the Korea Automobile & Mobility Association.

Tesla is racing to expand its US battery production to capitalize on subsidies and tax credits offered under the Inflation Reduction Act while the window remains open.

Last Thursday, the US House of Representatives passed a bill moving up the expiration date for the $7,500 consumer EV subsidy by six years to Dec. 31, 2026. It also shortened the Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit period by one year, now set to end in 2031. These changes increase the urgency for companies to localize their manufacturing and supply chains within the US clean energy sector.

And while there was limited news to report from the executive branch – either in direct rulemakings or broader policy pronouncements from the White House – the other two branches of the federal government had some fairly significant developments regarding regulatory policy. Across all rulemakings, agencies published $31.2 million in total costs and had no change in paperwork burden hours.

REGULATORY TOPLINES

Proposed Rules: 31

Final Rules: 53

2025 Total Pages: 22,145

2025 Final Rule Costs: -$75.8 billion

2025 Proposed Rule Costs: $181.3 billion

NOTABLE REGULATORY ACTIONS

As noted above, it was another remarkably quiet week in the pages of the Federal Register. The only rulemakings with measurable effects were a handful of airworthiness directives, with the most significant being one focused on certain Airbus aircraft that could involve roughly $29 million in costs.

TRACKING TRUMP 2.0

In terms of announcements with substantive regulatory policy implications coming from the White House, it was a generally quiet week – until Friday afternoon, at least. As the country headed into the holiday weekend, President Trump issued a quartet of executive orders (EO) focused on bolstering and expediting the development of nuclear energy resources. Perhaps the most significant of the four from a regulatory perspective is the EO on “Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission [NRC].”

Beyond broad-based directives to reform the Commission’s “culture” and “structure” (see Sections 3 and 4, respectively), the EO also tasks NRC with proposing within the next nine months – and finalizing within 18 months – a series of rulemakings aimed at making various changes to its licensing and approval processes. Among the most notable of these policy prescriptions is the putative establishment of “a deadline of no more than 18 months for final decision on an application to construct and operate a new reactor of any type.” The EO represents yet another bold assertion of executive branch prerogative over an “independent agency,” which will likely invite some degree of controversy over the eventual rulemakings in question. Nevertheless, many of the policy points included therein are directionally in line with other recent reform efforts related to nuclear energy.

Not to be outdone, however, there were also some important decisions made by the judicial and legislative branches this past week. Regarding the former, the Supreme Court handed down an emergency ruling in Trump v. Wilcox that allowed the president’s removal of certain members of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board to remain operative for now. While the ruling in and of itself is a procedural and temporary decision, it suggests that a majority exists on the Supreme Court that, building off of the Selia v. CFPB decision, is willing to overturn the precedent set in Humphrey’s Executor v. U.S. that protected “independent agency” officials from presidential dismissal for reasons other than “for-cause” transgressions. As the Trump Administration continues to press on the actual independence of independent agencies, it is likely only a matter of time before the Court makes a substantive change on this precedent.

Across the street from the Supreme Court in the Capitol, the Senate finally took up consideration of the Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions of disapproval that would repeal series of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) waiver determinations under the Clean Air Act that had allowed California to move forward with its own, more stringent, state-level emissions standards for vehicles. As the American Action Forum (AAF) has previously noted, the determinations in question represented – in more ways than one – fairly unique actions in relation to the CRA.

The proceedings that ensued to pass these resolutions were – to put it mildly – also quite unique. While the general expectation heading into this week was that Senate Republicans would need to stage a direct challenge to the ruling of the Senate parliamentarian on the resolutions’ statuses under the CRA, the actual course of action took a somewhat different route. The primary issue hinged on the seemingly mundane status of “points of order” raised during the consideration of CRA resolutions in the Senate.

As part of the “expedited consideration” process afforded by the CRA to the Senate, “points of order against the joint resolution (and against consideration of the joint resolution) are waived” to avoid their usage as a delaying tactic. During consideration of an otherwise unrelated CRA resolution, Majority Leader Thune challenged this presumption by asserting – in a point of order – that “sections 802(d)(1), 802(d)(2), and 802(d)(4) [of the CRA] are in conflict with one another.” After a series of votes that likely only excites extreme parliamentary procedure enthusiasts, the Senate ultimately affirmed that: A) points of order are in order under the CRA, and B) in regard to a particular point of order on the matter:

Joint Resolutions that meet all the requirements of Section 802 of the Congressional Review Act or are disapproving of agency actions which have been determined to be rules subject to the Congressional Review Act by a legal decision from the Government Accountability Office, be entitled to expedited procedures under the [CRA].

With this framework established, the upper chamber took up and advanced (by respective votes of 51-45, 51-44, and 49-46) the trio of CRA resolutions on the EPA waiver determinations that now head to President Trump’s desk for his expected signature.

Be sure to follow the AAF CRA tracker. As of today, members of the 119th Congress have introduced CRA resolutions of disapproval addressing 44 Biden-era rules that collectively involve $137.5 billion in compliance costs. Given the passage of the look-back window discussed above, it is highly unlikely any more resolutions of disapproval will be introduced this term. Since there are still outstanding resolutions that could move legislatively, however, AAF will continue to monitor and update such developments as appropriate.

TOTAL BURDENS

ifas.ufl.edu | @UF_IFAS — University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (UF/IFAS)","GAINESVILLE, Fla — A new University of Florida study shows how drones can do more than just take aerial pictures and videos—they can help farmers grow better hemp by seeing the health of their crops with some artificial intelligence assistance.

Researchers at the UF Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (UF/IFAS) Tropical Research and Education Center (TREC) in Homestead used drone-based imaging to help determine how much nitrogen fertilizer hemp plants need for optimal growth and flower production.

Their findings could help growers optimize fertilizer use to save money and preserve the environment.

“Farmers are looking for ways to assess their crops throughout the year to make informed fertilizer decisions,” said Zack Brym, associate professor of agronomy at UF/IFAS TREC.

“We’ve shown that farmers with access to aerial images using red and near infrared (NIR) detection can spot differences in plant health by their color when scanning their fields,” he said.

This is crucial because timely and precise fertilizer applications can significantly impact hemp crop yield and quality, Brym said.

“Since nutrients move through the soil so fast in Florida, farmers are applying fertilizer multiple times each year. Technology like the use of drone imaging will help determine how much fertilizer might be needed mid-season, promoting more efficient use of resources and supporting sustainable farming practices,” he said.

Hemp, a plant reintroduced in 2019 for cultivation research in Florida agriculture, provides an alternate opportunity for farmers due to the potential demand for hemp products across various industries. Low-input systems for fiber production may also offer benefits to soil health and carbon sequestration.

One of the biggest challenges is figuring out how much nitrogen—an essential plant nutrient—is needed for optimal crop growth and yield. Too little, and the plant suffers with chlorosis or yellowing of the foliage, stunted crop growth and reduced yield. Too much, and the plant may grow too much leafy material with little benefit to the valuable flower production, while excess nitrogen can leach into the environment.

Brym and his team set out to study this problem using aerial imaging. They grew a popular floral hemp variety called ‘Wife’ over three years and applied six nitrogen fertilizer rates, from none to very high. Using drones equipped with multispectral cameras, they flew over the fields one month before harvest to capture images of the crop from above. These images measured how green and healthy the plants were, indicating how well they grew under different nitrogen rates.

The study found that using a moderate amount of nitrogen — 112 to 168 kilograms per hectare or about 100 to 150 pounds per acre — resulted in the healthiest plants and greatest flower yields. Drone images picked up clear differences in plant size and color, which matched the actual amount of plant material harvested. The drone images provided real-time, accurate insights into the plant conditions on the ground.

As a final step to the research, scientists incorporated artificial intelligence (AI) technology to process the images captured by the drone flights of the canopy’s reflectance. Reflectance refers to the measure of the proportion of light or other radiation that is reflected off the surface of the hemp canopy. Reflectance is critical in remote sensing and agriculture studies, allowing researchers to analyze how much light is being reflected by the plants, which helps identify and map the canopy areas accurately.

“I was eager to see how effective the automated AI would be at identifying hemp canopy,” said Tamara Serrano, a lead author and former agroecology graduate student on Brym’s team. “To my surprise, the process wasn’t as seamless as expected and required manual corrections to address errors in canopy identification.”

This research is especially important in Florida, where fast-growing crops and shallow soils mean nutrients like nitrogen can easily be lost to runoff. Using drones for in-season monitoring could help growers fine-tune fertilizer use, reduce waste and improve profits, all while practicing environmental stewardship. With the hemp industry still evolving, these insights offer a valuable step forward.

“Despite the challenges they faced with AI technology, weed intensity and weather, the data consistently demonstrated a strong positive correlation between canopy size and aboveground biomass across years,” said Serrano. “This shows that drone-based aerial imaging can effectively monitor crop growth and health in field-grown flower hemp and inform nutrient management decisions for growers.”

Fusion Technology The federal government has already been promoting fusion research and development to move nuclear energy utilization beyond fission.
According to the DOE’s “Fusion Energy Strategy” released June 2024, the U.S. should have pilot fusion plants before 2040.","President Donald Trump has signed executive orders to grow nuclear power generation and advance nuclear innovation in the United States.

“After decades of stagnation and shuttered reactors, President Trump is providing a path forward for nuclear innovation”, the Department of Energy (DOE) said in an online statement. “Today’s executive orders allow for reactor design testing at the Department of Energy's National Labs, clear the way for construction on federal lands to protect national and economic security, and remove regulatory barriers by requiring the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to issue timely licensing decisions”.

Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology, commented, “Over the last 30 years, we stopped building nuclear reactors in America - that ends now”.

A new nuclear power plant, however, came online 2023. The newest unit of Plant Vogtle, first put into service in the 1980s, is the first nuclear reactor activated in the country since 2016, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Georgia Power activated another reactor at the plant last year, making it the biggest nuclear plant in the U.S., according to the EIA.

As of last year the U.S. had 94 operating nuclear reactors at 54 power plants, giving the nation the largest commercial nuclear power production fleet in the world, according to an EIA report April 24, 2025. These units had a combined capacity of nearly 97 gigawatts. Most of these were built between 1970 and 1990, according to the EIA.

“The two reactors at Vogtle and one reactor at Watts Bar in Tennessee are the only new nuclear reactors to come online in the United States since 1996”, the EIA report said, adding 12 nuclear reactors have permanently closed in the U.S. since 2013.

Kratsios added, “Today’s executive orders are the most significant nuclear regulatory reform actions taken in decades. We are restoring a strong American nuclear industrial base, rebuilding a secure and sovereign domestic nuclear fuel supply chain, and leading the world towards a future fueled by American nuclear energy”.

“These actions are critical to American energy independence and continued dominance in AI and other emerging technologies”, Kratsios said.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said, “As energy demand continues to surge, expanding our existing nuclear fleet and investing in advanced nuclear technologies ensures we have reliable energy to power our homes, fuel for President Trump’s manufacturing revolution, and a stronger electric grid”.

Concurrently the DOE announced another executive order to “rebuild public trust in the national science enterprise”.

“The EO defines Gold Standard Science and requires federal research agencies to conform their existing programs and activities to these fundamentals”, the DOE said.

“Gold Standard Science is just that - science that meets the Gold Standard”, the agency added. “It’s reproducible, transparent, falsifiable, subject to unbiased peer review, clear about errors and uncertainties, skeptical of assumptions, collaborative, interdisciplinary, accepting of negative results, and free from conflicts of interests”.

Fusion Technology

The federal government has already been promoting fusion research and development to move nuclear energy utilization beyond fission. It has also partnered with Japan and the United Kingdom to advance commercial fusion, as well as the European Union to curb global reliance on Russia in the nuclear supply chain. The U.S. has also signed agreements with foreign countries for civil nuclear cooperation that would promote American technology, including with Lithuania, the Philippines, Singapore and South Korea.

On January 16 the DOE announced the first selections for funding under the Fusion Innovative Research Engine (FIRE) Collaboratives, a program to close knowledge and technology gaps in the design and building of a commercially scalable pilot fusion plant.

Provisionally awarded a total of $107 million, the six selected projects involve building nuclear blanket testing capabilities at the Idaho National Laboratory, developing materials at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, testing materials and developing advanced simulation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, developing target injector technology for inertial fusion energy concepts, and developing fusion fuel-cycle testing capabilities at the Savannah River National Laboratory.

The collaboratives program “represents a significant step forward in FES’s commitment to advancing fusion energy research and development, and aims to create new economic opportunities, maintain US leadership in fusion, bolster US-based manufacturing and supply chains, and enable the development of technologies crucial for national security, energy security, and defense”, the DOE said then, referring to its Fusion Energy Sciences (FES) program.

Concurrently the DOE announced that several privately funded fusion companies that were among those awarded a total of $46 million in May 2023 had completed early critical-path milestones under the Milestone Program.

According to the DOE’s “Fusion Energy Strategy” released June 2024, the U.S. should have pilot fusion plants before 2040. In the 2040s, commercial deployment should already be underway, as envisioned by the strategy.

The policy objectives include accelerating electric vehicle (EV) penetration across all vehicle segments, promoting circular economy through battery recycling, transitioning public transport to electric modes, and reducing vehicular emissions. The policy targets include 30 per cent EV penetration across all new vehicles, 40 per cent for e-buses in top six urban areas, and 50 per cent fleet electrification for aggregators and city utility vehicles. The policy also mandates EV charging facilities every 25 km on highways and at least one charging point in every government office parking complex. It aims to cut approximately 325 tonnes of vehicular particulate matter 2.5 emissions and 1 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector by 2030.

The policy outlines demand-side incentives such as subsidies ranging from Rs 10,000 to Rs 2 million per vehicle across 10 EV categories, including two-wheelers, three-wheelers, four-wheelers, e-buses, tractors, goods carriers, and harvesters. Additionally, all EVs registered in the state during the policy period will receive 100 per cent exemption from motor vehicle tax and registration renewal fees. Furthermore, 100 per cent toll tax exemptions will apply for passenger EVs on select expressways, including Mumbai–Pune, Mumbai–Nagpur and Atal Setu. Charging infrastructure measures include mandatory fast-charging stations at fuel pumps and Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation stations, viability gap funding support for DC charging stations up to Rs 1 million per unit, and one EV charging point per government office complex. New residential buildings must ensure all parking spaces are EV-ready, while commercial buildings must allocate 50 per cent of parking for EV readiness. Existing commercial buildings will need at least 20 per cent of parking spaces equipped with charging stations.

On the supply side, the policy extends ‘D+’ category mega project benefits to all EV and battery manufacturing units in Maharashtra, including medium, small and micro enterprises, irrespective of their location in the state. It also supports development of battery recycling hubs and designation of drop-off points by urban local bodies. Additionally, the policy will establish three centres of excellence for research and development (R&D) in EVs and hydrogen technologies, and allocate Rs 150 million under the Chief Minister’s EV R&D grant. Research will prioritise sodium-ion batteries, power electronics, bi-directional charging, vehicle-to-grid integration, and green hydrogen from biomass.

It continues: “The bill, which now heads to the Senate, repeals or phases out more quickly clean energy tax credits passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act [IRA] during former president Joe Biden’s term. Biden’s climate law has been considered monumental for the clean energy transition, but the House bill effectively renders moot much of the law’s incentives for renewable energy such as wind and solar power.” The newswire adds that “at least four” Senate Republicans “have urged continuation of energy tax credits, including support for traditional and renewable energy sources”. Reuters says the bill would “effectively halt…[the] US clean-energy boom”, but notes that it would “preserve” tax credits for nuclear energy. The Financial Times describes the bill as “Donald Trump’s showpiece” and says that clean-energy tax credits had been among the key sticking points before House Republicans agreed to back the draft legislation. The New York Times says: “The legislation would slash taxes, providing the biggest savings to the wealthy, and steer more money to the military and immigration enforcement, while cutting health, nutrition, education and clean energy programs to cover part of the cost. To win votes for passage, Republican leaders accelerated the implementation of work requirements in the Medicaid program and the repeal of clean energy tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, among other changes.” The newspaper explains that the bill would “quickly end most of the big tax credits for clean energy contained in the Inflation Reduction Act”. The New York Times Climate Forward newsletter says the bill, if passed, “would derail Biden’s signature climate law”. The Los Angeles Times describes the clean-energy rollbacks in the bill as “massive”. For the Hill, the cuts are “sweeping”. NBC News runs down the bill’s contents, saying it “terminates several hundred billion dollars” in clean-energy tax breaks for consumers, including for electric vehicles, as well as for developers in clean power, fuels and hydrogen. The Washington Post says these cuts only “partially offset” lost tax revenue under the bill.

The New York Times says the “divides that plagued the measure in the House are likely to resurface”, adding: “More moderate and politically vulnerable lawmakers have sought to protect Medicaid and fought to preserve clean-energy tax credits.” Bloomberg says the clean-energy tax credit cuts “won’t fly”, citing “key Republican senators”. The Los Angeles Times also says the bill is “facing an uncertain future among Senate Republicans”. Another New York Times story says “some Republican senators are leery of the House push to phase out tax credits for big energy projects in their states”.

Stocks in clean energy firms “tumble[d]” after the bill passed on Thursday, the Financial Times reports, adding that the cuts to tax credits had been “more aggressive than expected”. CNBC, the Wall Street Journal and Reuters all report on falling clean energy stocks in the wake of the bill’s passage. The Guardian reports on analysis saying that the bill would “cost 830,000 jobs and drive up bills and pollution emissions”. Politico asks if the bill would “hurt [Trump’s] energy agenda”. The Financial Times reports the comments of John Podesta, one of the “architects” of the IRA, saying that the bill “hand[s] a victory” to China by cutting clean-energy tax credits. Another Politico piece is titled: “In Trump’s war on clean energy, China (and everyone else) wins.” The Financial Times Energy Source newsletter reports the comments of Democratic senator Joe Manchin calling for Republicans to “kick the living daylights” out of aspects of the IRA that he does not support.

The US Senate on Thursday voted to block California’s “landmark plan to end the sale of petrol-only vehicles by 2035”, Reuters reports. The newswire continues: “The vote is a win for General Motors, Toyota and other automakers that heavily lobbied against the rules and a blow to California and environmental groups that say the requirements are essential to ensuring cleaner vehicles and cutting pollution.” The Financial Times explains that “the upper chamber of Congress passed the measure on Thursday in a 51-44 vote, sending the bill to president Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it”. It adds: “The resolution revokes a waiver that former president Joe Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency gave to California to let the state implement extremely strict emissions standards and require all new vehicle sales be electric by 2035.” The New York Times calls the vote “a victory for the oil and gas industry and for Republicans who muscled through the vote by deploying an unusual legislative tactic that Democrats denounced as a ‘nuclear’ option that would affect the way the Senate operates way beyond climate policy”. The Hill reports that the “controversial” move allows lawmakers to “sidestep the parliamentarian in the process”. The Associated Press says Trump is also expected to sign “two other resolutions that would block California rules curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks”. Politico reports: “Attorney general Rob Bonta said on Thursday that California will sue the Trump administration to protect its ability to set its own vehicle emissions rules.” The Wall Street Journal says the move is “effectively killing the country’s biggest driver of EV investment”. BBC News and the Los Angeles Times also have the news.

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has drafted a plan to remove limits on greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants, the New York Times reports, citing internal agency documents. The newspaper continues: “In its proposed regulation, the agency argued that CO2 and other greenhouse gases from power plants that burn fossil fuels ‘do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution’ or to climate change because they are a small and declining share of global emissions. Eliminating those emissions would have no meaningful effect on public health and welfare, the agency said…The EPA sent the draft to the White House for review on 2 May. It could undergo changes before it is formally released and the public is given the opportunity to offer comments, likely in June.” The newspaper calls the proposed regulation “part of a broader attack by the Trump administration on the established science that greenhouse gases threaten human health and the environment”. Reuters, the Washington Post and Bloomberg also cover the news.

In other US news, the Guardian reports that “this year’s summer months promise to be among the hottest on record across the US”. Elsewhere, the Associated Press says: “Environmentalists are challenging in court president Donald Trump’s executive order that they say strips core protections from the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument and opens the area to harmful commercial fishing.”

“The European Commission will announce next week that the EU is broadly within target to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels,” the Financial Times reports. Emissions are set to fall to 54% below 1990 levels by 2030, the newspaper says, citing EU officials familiar with the figures. It continues: “The data will be published weeks before the commission lays out how the bloc can reach its 2040 climate target, which should amount to a 90% emissions reduction. The EU has committed to reach net-zero by 2050 – one of the most ambitious targets in the world.” It adds: “Countries such as Italy and Poland have pushed for a lower target, while France has also expressed scepticism. Germany’s new coalition government has said it could support a 90% target if carbon credits could count towards the goal.” Euractiv says: “Germany’s new centrist coalition has aligned on an emissions reduction policy shaped by talks with the EU’s top climate official – signalling the likely form of a forthcoming EU proposal to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, according to sources involved in the recent discussions in Berlin.”

Separately, citing internal documents, Reuters reports: “The European Union is facing further pressure from member countries to delay and weaken its upcoming law to restrict deforestation, with 11 governments demanding changes.” The newswire continues: “The world-first policy aims to end the 10% of global deforestation fuelled by EU consumption of imported soy, beef, palm oil and other products, but has become a politically contested part of Europe’s green agenda.” Euractiv reports that under the regulation, all 27 EU countries have “ dodged the ‘high risk’ label”. It adds: “The category determines how strict due diligence rules will be for companies – which also means more checks – on those importing crucial agri-food commodities like cocoa, coffee, soy, palm oil and beef.” According to the outlet, the low-risk category includes countries such as the United States, China, Australia and Canada. Meanwhile, Belarus, Myanmar, North Korea and Russia are “high risk”.

In other EU news, Reuters reports that “Italy fully supports EU efforts to stop Russian gas imports into the bloc by 2027”. The newswire continues: “The EU said this month it would propose legal measures to phase out imports of Russian gas and LNG by the end of 2027, ending a decades-old energy relationship which crumbled after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.” In contrast, Reuters says that Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban told the state radio that the plan to ban Russian energy imports must be prevented “by all means”. Reuters also says that “a European official said on Thursday that the United States is ‘not convinced’ about lowering the Group of Seven nations (G7) price cap on Russian crude oil”. Separately, Reuters says: “The European Parliament backed changes on Thursday to the European Union’s carbon border tariff that would exempt from the scheme companies that import less than 50 metric tons per year of relevant goods.” Meanwhile, Reuters says: “The European Union has rejected a Russian request for consultations on its carbon border adjustment package, a World Trade Organization document showed on Monday, citing Russia’s ‘war of aggression’ against Ukraine as the reason.” A final Reuters story says that the EU is launching “an inquiry into how the European Commission fashioned its recent proposals to simplify sustainability law”.

Last year, the loss of the world’s forests reached the highest level ever recorded, the Guardian reports. Citing analysis from the University of Maryland hosted on Global Forest Watch it says that forest loss in 2024 was driven by “a surge in fires caused by global heating”. It reports that forest loss in Brazil accounted for 42% of all primary rainforest loss in the tropics. It continues: “In Bolivia, the loss of previously untouched forest continued to rise, ranking second behind Brazil in overall loss for the first time, driven by drought, fire and government policies promoting agricultural expansion for soya, cattle and sugar cane. The loss of Bolivia’s primary forest has increased nearly fivefold since 2020.” According to Climate Home News, forest loss in 2024 was equivalent to 18 football fields vanishing every minute. It says this is nearly twice as fast as forest loss in 2023. The Associated Press says: “For the first time since record-keeping began, fires, not agriculture, were the leading cause of rainforest loss, accounting for nearly half of all destruction. Those fires emitted 4.1bn tons of planet-warming greenhouse gases, which is more than four times the emissions from air travel in 2023, the researchers said. Still, land clearing for agriculture, cattle farming and other causes rose by 14%, the sharpest increase in almost a decade.” BBC News reports that “there was more positive news in South East Asia, however, with government policies helping to reduce forest loss”. Mongabay, Reuters and the Independent also cover the news.

There is widespread media coverage of the UK’s upcoming spending review. The Guardian reports that chancellor Rachel Reeves will “put £113bn of new capital investment at the forefront of the spending review and argue that the billions of investment in homes, transport and energy would only have happened under Labour”. The newspaper notes that Starmer confirmed last week that the government would “U-turn on the unpopular winter fuel cuts”. It adds that the Sizewell C new nuclear power station in Suffolk is also “likely to be approved”. The Times reports that Starmer “has been warned that his pledges on policing, housebuilding and climate change are being put at risk at a time of mounting cabinet tensions before the spending review”. The newspaper continues: “Ed Miliband, the energy and net-zero secretary, is fighting to save a pledge to spend an extra £6.6bn on insulating millions of homes by the end of this parliament. The scheme, called the warm homes plan, offers grants and low-interest loans to support investment in insulation, solar panels, batteries and low-carbon heating to reduce bills and cut emissions. Cutting the scheme will make it harder for the government to hit its commitment of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.” The Financial Times says that Miliband is also in negotiations about keeping the £8.3bn promised for GB Energy. It says that according to a person involved in the discussions, “wrangling had also been particularly tense with the Home Office, and both the energy and environment departments”. The Guardian carries a warning from charities that “plans to reinstate the winter fuel payment will be undermined if the government presses ahead with mooted cuts to home insulation upgrades”. The Daily Express quotes a “tax consultant” who says that “Reeves risks saddling the UK with up to £7tn in hidden ‘zombie debt’ thanks to the government’s ambitious net-zero target”.

In other UK news, the Times reports that “Britain’s energy costs could be cut by at least £2bn a year through reforms to stop expensive gas-fired power plants setting the wholesale electricity price”. According to the newspaper, Adam Bell, head of energy strategy at the business department during 2020-21, said that gas plants should be removed from the wholesale electricity market and instead “given regulated returns to fire up when needed to keep the lights on”. The newspaper adds: “Gas plants generate only about 30% of Britain’s electricity, yet set the wholesale price 98% of the time, according to a new report by Stonehaven, the consultancy where Bell is now director of policy.” Elsewhere, the Financial Times covers new analysis which finds that the UK is “likely to fall significantly short of its five-year target for offshore wind power, as developers continue to delay or cancel projects because of rising costs and poor returns”.

BBC News reports that the Rampion windfarm off the Sussex coast has caused a “’surprising’ tourism boom”, according to local residents. DeSmog reports that “a Reform UK mayor who claims ‘net-zero madness’ is ‘bankrupting Britain’ has called for investment in an offshore wind project “to boost growth” in the local economy. The i newspaper covers the impacts of climate change on UK rivers. A Daily Telegraph story trailed on its frontpage says that “Starmer’s bid to boost the economy with a slew of new data centres threatens to undermine Labour’s net-zero goals, campaigners have warned”. Separately, the Daily Telegraph reports that “a massive hydrogen project at the heart of Ed Miliband’s net-zero plans risks being cancelled as BP retreats from green targets”. Further stories in the newspaper attacking the UK’s net-zero target claim that it is a “threat to national security” and “less likely to bring down energy bills”. The Daily Telegraph also covers figures published by the Conservatives which find that Scotland will not reach its net-zero emissions target until 2080. Meanwhile, BBC News reports on a fire in a hospital that “began in solar panels on the roof”.

Donald Trump on Friday signed four executive orders, instructing the Department of Energy to “fast-track” nuclear energy development, with the aim of quadrupling US capacity by 2050, the Financial Times reports. The outlet continues: “In a factsheet accompanying the executive order, the White House said the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had an ‘overly risk-averse culture’, which requires nuclear facilities to emit as few emissions as possible, including below naturally-occurring levels.” According to Reuters, current licensing for nuclear reactors in the US “can take over a decade at times, a process designed to prioritise nuclear safety but which has discouraged new projects”. The New York Times says: “One order directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the nation’s independent safety regulator, to streamline its rules and to take no more than 18 months to approve applications for new reactors…Another order directs the energy and defence departments to explore siting reactors on federal lands and military bases, possibly alongside new data centers. That could allow the agencies to bypass the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and develop their own, faster processes for approving reactors.” Bloomberg reports that the plans include building “small, untested designs that offer the promise of rapid deployment but haven’t yet been built in the US”. The outlet adds that Trump has “cast nuclear energy as a complement, rather than a replacement, for fossil fuels.” However, the Associated Press reports that experts say the goal of quadrupling nuclear energy capacity is ”highly unlikely” to be reached. According to the Guardian, Trump said the new reactors “would satisfy the electricity demands of data centres for artificial intelligence and other emerging industries”. The Washington Post says: “Administration officials say they expect the directives to result in new plants being built during the president’s term.” The Daily Telegraph calls the directives the “Manhattan Project 2”. The Wall Street Journal, Al Jazeera, CNN, Inside Climate News, Forbes, CNBC, Agence France-Presse and the Daily Mail also cover the story.

Donald Trump has urged UK prime minister Keir Starmer to stop building “unsightly windmills” and to instead accelerate drilling in the North Sea, the Times says. The newspaper reports that in a post on Truth Social, Trump said: “I strongly recommend to them, however, that in order to get their energy costs down, they stop with the costly and unsightly windmills, and incentivise modernised drilling in the North Sea, where large amounts of oil lay waiting to be taken. A century of drilling left, with Aberdeen as the hub. The old-fashioned tax system disincentivises drilling, rather than the opposite. UK’s energy costs would go WAY DOWN, and fast.” [Former Conservative ministers said that new drilling would be unlikely to reduce bills, the Guardian reported previously.] Bloomberg reports that the post on Truth Social came a few hours after Reform UK “was reported by the Financial Times to be trying to woo oil and gas companies with the promise of lower North Sea taxes”. The Sun says: “The US president called on the UK to mimic his ‘drill, baby drill’ policy to take advantage of 100 years of supplies left to bring down energy costs.” [North Sea gas production is set to decline 95% by 2050, even if the government issues new licenses.] The Press Association says: “President Trump has made no secret of the fact that he is not in favour of wind energy, and has previously ranted about ‘big windmill’ that “destroy everybody’s property values, kill all the birds”. He has claimed they are unreliable energy sources, once bizarrely saying, ‘and then, all of a sudden, it stops; the wind and the televisions go off.’” Other outlets including the Scotsman, the Daily Telegraph, the Daily Express and Bloomberg also cover the comments from Trump. According to the Press Association, Scotland’s first minister John Swinney has said Trump’s post was no “surprise”, adding that his government is “absolutely committed” to its net-zero targets. The Associated Press reports that “US ambassador Warren Stephens has met prime minister Keir Starmer after president Donald Trump urged the UK to ditch wind power projects and drill for oil”.

Elsewhere, the Press Association adds that according to a report by the Just Transition Commission, “urgent action is needed to ensure the transition from fossil fuels to renewables happens fairly”. The outlet continues: “The independent advisory body warned an unjust transition is possible despite it being known for decades that the North Sea oil and gas sector would decline. Oil and gas workers in Aberdeen told the commission they fear a ‘cliff edge’ for their livelihoods.” The Times says the report, which was published on Thursday, “was critical of the lack of clear planning from governments for the transition away from fossil fuels”. The Daily Telegraph reports that “Labour and SNP ministers have ‘no plan’ for thousands of North Sea oil and gas workers who face losing their jobs as production winds down,” according to the “damming” report. The Guardian reports that Reform UK “has promised to reverse the government’s ban on fresh North Sea oil and gas drilling as a ‘day one’ priority if elected to power, with the taxpayer taking a stake in the projects”. The Sun covers the news under the headline “Net hero. Nigel Farage plans to shred costly net-zero rules on [his] first day if he becomes prime minister.”

Meanwhile, the Times reports that “a record-breaking marine heatwave has hit the seas around much of Britain’s west coast and Ireland”. It says that sea surface temperatures are up to 4C warmer than usual for the time of year.

Ed Miliband, the secretary of state for energy security and net-zero, has penned three separate comment articles carrying similar messages. In the Daily Express, he highlights recent announcements including the energy price cap drop and a consultation on expanding the “warm home discount”. However, he says that “the beating heart of our plan is to bring down bills and get off our dependence on fossil fuel markets controlled by dictators”. Miliband says that “fossil fuel shocks have caused half of Britain’s recessions since 1970”. He continues: “That is why this government is building the UK’s clean energy future- because every solar panel, every wind turbine and every piece of grid infrastructure we build helps get us off the fossil fuel rollercoaster so we can bring down bills once and for all. It is why we are making huge planning decisions to say yes to new homegrown power projects such as solar and wind. Since July we have consented enough wind and solar projects to power 2 million homes. We’ve also lifted the onshore wind ban and set up Great British Energy – Britain’s first publicly owned energy company in more than 70 years.” He concludes: “I know that some in British politics oppose this drive for clean homegrown power- siren voices who want to rip up clean energy projects, say no to the jobs they bring, and plunge the UK deeper into dependency on foreign markets. This Labour government will fight them all the way because the British people deserve energy security now and for the future.” In the Standard, Miliband writes: “Building clean homegrown power is the only way to take back control and protect billpayers from repeated price spikes. That is why the government is driving the most ambitious upgrade to Britain’s energy infrastructure in generations through our ‘plan for change’.” In the Daily Record, Miliband has a piece under the headline: “T​​he UK government is working relentlessly to bring down energy bills for Scots households.”

In other UK comment, Prof Dave Reay and Satwat Rehman, co-chairs of the Just Transition Commission, write in the Times that “the people whose livelihoods are tied to oil and gas production in Scotland need support as we move away from fossil fuels towards greener alternatives”. The piece warns that oil and gas workers in Aberdeen fear “a cliff edge” for their livelihoods. It continues: “So what does a credible plan look like? A key part is to accelerate the growth of offshore clean energy and make sure jobs coming on stream in wind, decommissioning, carbon capture and storage and green hydrogen have robust health and safety regulations and strong protections for workers on pay, conditions and union recognition.” John Redwood, a former Conservative cabinet minister and MP writes in the Daily Telegraph about his opposition to climate policies. A Daily Express editorial says: “The lowering of the [household energy] price cap should result in bills falling by £129 but the cost of powering a home is still far too high…Britain has untapped fossil fuel reserves and there is exciting potential for new small nuclear reactions and the might of nature is waiting to be harnessed. We need an energy revolution to jump-start Britain. Investment and innovation should not be delayed.” Climate-sceptic commentator Dominic Lawson writes in the Daily Mail: “What a farce! Labour is happy to import oil from Norway’s side of the North Sea – while banning drilling on ours”. Also in the Daily Telegraph, the Conservative peer Daniel Hannan argues that “Britain is heading for utter ruin”. He says: “We need to repeal the laws on which that state rests – the Human Rights Act, the Equality Act, the Climate Change Act – and the quangos they spawned.” In the Daily Telegraph, Jordan Peterson writes that “net-zero alarmism is a mental illness”.

An editorial in the Guardian highlights “an alarming new paper” which “shows that even if carbon emissions are slashed to meet the internationally agreed target of 1.5C, sea level rises will become unmanageable during this century”. The editorial continues: “[The paper] argues that a truly safe limit is likely to be 1C or lower, meaning seas would be unlikely to rise more than 1cm per year. Around the world, about 230 million people live within 1 metre above the current sea level.” It adds: “But people will adapt to sea level rises in the future as they have in the past. This is not to deny or underplay the scale of the threat, but to stress the importance of preparing for changes which are now inevitable, as well as trying as hard as possible to avoid the worst-case scenarios.” Elsewhere, an editorial in the Independent says: “Wealthier countries owe their support, financial and practical, to those countries overwhelmingly impacted by climate disaster – not only because it is right but because it has far-reaching implications for global security.” The editorial cites research undertaken by the Independent’s Rethinking Global Aid project, which “reveals the extent to which recent and continuing cuts in international aid programmes are leaving the world’s most vulnerable communities defenceless in the face of existential challenges”.

In other comment, Daniel Malinsky, an assistant professor of biostatistics at Columbia University, writes in the Guardian that “now is the time for scientists to stand up against Trump’s repressive agenda”. He writes: “Trump has also taken steps to sabotage congressionally mandated research on the climate crisis by dismissing expert authors of the National Climate Assessment. Opposing these moves and organising against them as scientists is a no-brainer.” Another Guardian editorial says Trump’s “big beautiful” budget “supercharges inequality”. The editorial notes that the bill “slashes green energy subsidies”. A Sun editorial says that “Trump is right” to tell Keir Starmer “to tear down the Chinese windmills that could be spying on us and start drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea”.

Meanwhile, Dr Kimberley Reid, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Melbourne, writes in the Guardian that “the floods and droughts devastating Australia are fingerprints of a warming planet”. Dominic Jones, an associate in the Energy and Climate Change Program at Grattan Institute, writes in the Guardian that “as the energy transition ramps up, Australia risks becoming a more unequal society”. He says: “Governments must help households to make the switch to cleaner energy, and change the rules so that the benefits and costs are fairly shared.”",,N,,2025-05-27 11:19:37.689450

An appeal against the decision to approve a new gas power station has been lost.

Environmental consultant Andrew Boswell appealed a High Court decision after arguing against the green credentials of Net Zero Teesside, which is planning to use carbon-capture technology at the station.

The case was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on Thursday, with Dr Boswell saying the ruling proved climate laws were ""broken"".

The project's developers said they were ""pleased"" with the decision. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) declined to comment.

In March, Dr Boswell's legal representatives had argued the government did not fully explore the environmental impacts of the scheme before approving it.

DESNZ said it had acknowledged the ""significant"" greenhouse gas emissions the scheme would cause before any decision was made.

Barrister Rose Grogan, for DESNZ, had told the court: ""Fossil fuel remains part of the government's energy mix.

""It's part of the transition to a low-carbon economy... but it needs to be low carbon through the deployment of CCS [carbon capture and storage].""

The plant, which is planned for the Teesworks site, near Redcar, is being developed by a firm called Net Zero Teesside Power – owned by BP and Equinor.

The company previously stated the project could generate up to 860MW of low-carbon electricity.

It has claimed at least 90% of the gas power station's emissions would be captured and funnelled beneath the North Sea.

'No merit in challenge'

In its judgement, the court said its task was simply to determine whether or not the decision-making process surrounding the power plant was lawful.

It said the ""evaluation"" and ""acceptability"" of the estimated emissions caused by the plant was a ""matter of fact and judgement for the decision-maker"".

The government had made ""lawful and properly reasoned conclusions"" regarding the plant's potential greenhouse gas emissions, the court said.

Net Zero Teesside Power said: ""[We] welcome this second judicial confirmation that there is no merit in Andrew Boswell's challenge.""

Dr Boswell called for the government to launch a scientific review into the use of carbon capture and storage technology (CCS) for gas power plants.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5670/live/8b2220a0-f9d3-11ef-8be4-3bf54461d42e.png,N,,2025-05-27 11:21:19.249961

The House passed its controversial 1,000-plus-page budget reconciliation bill by a razor thin 215-214 margin last week, handing down a slate of troubling measures that experts argue will kick millions of people off Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, bar transgender minors and adults from accessing gender-affirming healthcare through government programs, ""effectively halt the clean energy boom,"" impose a new $1,000 fee on immigrants seeking asylum, and much more.

The bill will more than double the current deficit despite steep cuts to social safety net and climate programs, which experts say will be largely used to offset tax perks for the ultra-rich. According to Rep. Rick Larsen (D–Wash.), ranking member on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the legislation will benefit the top 0.1 percent of wealthiest Americans by an average of $255,000 a year, or about $700 a day.

""This budget is so terrible that the GOP had to force it through in the dead of night,"" wrote Larsen in a statement following last Wednesday's vote (thought two Republicans did cross the aisle to vote no with the Democrats). ""The fight isn’t over, and I will keep working to defeat this bill as the legislative process continues.""

Let's focus in on a few of the implications for surface transportation and infrastructure, specifically.

The end of the EV tax credit...

In one of the biggest blows to the nation's transportation decarbonization goals, the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" would eliminate the $4,000 and $7,500 tax credits for used and new electric vehicles, respectively by the end of 2025, giving car buyers just over six months to snap up the rebate before it vanishes on Dec. 31. Those purchasing from automakers which have sold fewer than 200,000 clean vehicles will be granted a little more time until those manufacturers meet their caps, at least until the end of 2026.

A electrification tax credit to qualified commercial vehicles was also axed, which means industrial vehicles that can't easily be replaced with other modes will continue spewing dangerous pollution into communities.

That's bad news for U.S. communities held tightest in the grip of car dependency, for which vehicle electrification represents the only realistic hope to slash emissions and remove harmful pollutants from residents' lungs, at least in the short term. And for those who could displace car trips through stronger local policy to support transit, biking, walking, and other green modes, it means it's more important than ever to take local action to bolster those modes now.

...and new fees for driving them

In addition to making it harder for U.S. residents to buy EVs, the One Big Beautiful Bill would also charge drivers a cool $250 a year just to register them — and the drivers of hybrid cars will have to pony up $100 a year, too.

That move might have been intended to address shortfalls in the highway trust fund that powers America's core infrastructure programs, but Jeff Davis of the Eno Center for Transportation testified to Congress earlier this month that the fee ""wouldn't come close to actually closing the amount of revenue that you need to get another five-year [surface transportation reauthorization] bill.""

Steve Davis of Transportation for America, meanwhile, recently argued that ""it’s not time to rescue the trust fund, it’s time to write its eulogy,"" and that we need to whittle America's transportation spending down to a scale we can actually afford rather than adding new fees — while focusing on projects that deliver on safety, reducing congestions, and reducing emissions. (Spoiler alert: a lot fewer highways.)

Some nasty rescissions

As previously reported by Streetsblog, perhaps the most devastating cut to the transportation sections of the budget bill is to the Neighborhood Access and Equity Grant program, which would lose a staggering 97 percent of its funding – basically, any dollar not yet formally obligated — and defund nearly a hundred projects aimed at reconnecting communities torn apart by past transportation investments.

The bill would also repeal all not-yet-obligated money in a fund designed to help communities do more efficient and effective environmental reviews, which initially totaled $100 million.

Another less-talked-about program called the Low Carbon Transportation Materials Discretionary Grant Program also got the axe, which would have devoted a total of $2 billion to helping agencies green the process of building roadways and other infrastructure before it's actually used — which can itself be a significant source of emissions.

In a release, House T&I chairman Sam Graves (R–Mo.) collectively called those three initiates ""unnecessary Green New Deal style programs"" that represented ""progressive priorities that are either duplicative, are projects that states and other entities may pursue if they prioritize them, or are efforts that should be driven by the industry and not mandated by the federal government.""",https://lede-admin.usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2025/05/Mike-Johnson-e1748288196221.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 14:15:04.133286

BP Pulse, the electric vehicle charging arm of energy and retail company BP, has partnered with restaurant chain Waffle House to bring EV chargers to select locations.

BP will install six 400 kW direct current fast charging bays at select sites, which include Waffle House locations in Texas, Florida, Georgia and other parts of the South and Southeast. The first charging sites, which will offer the two most common EV connectors, are expected to come online in 2026.

The agreement comes as BP continues to install EV chargers across its hundreds of c-store locations under the Thorntons, Amoco and TravelCenters of America banners.

Dive Insight:

BP has roughly 40,000 charge points globally. The company opened a Gigahub with 20 EV fast-charging bays last month just north of Boston Logan Airport in Massachusetts, and earlier this year debuted BP Pulse at a TravelCenters of America site, part of a plan that will add dozens more across the banner.

BP had ambitions of reaching 100,000 EV chargers globally, though recently the company has been pulling back on many of its green energy plans. In February, it announced it would reduce investments in transitional businesses like electric vehicles by about $5 billion per year, to $1.5 billion to $2 billion annually. However, in spite of that broader refocus on its oil and gas business, the company is still expanding its EV charging network.

“We’re building a robust network of ultrafast chargers across the country, and this is another example of third-party collaborations enabling access to charging co-located with convenient amenities for EV drivers,” said Sujay Sharma, CEO of BP Pulse.

Representatives from BP did not return requests for comment on how many sites will be included in this partnership.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/VyYDOeEbYiknIAUHgw9Rr2l72er2IwCsVcImnIdOtkY/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9icC1wdWxzZS1Cb3N0b24tR2lnYWh1Yi0xMDI0eDU3Ni5qcGVn.webp,N,,2025-05-27 11:22:19.349764

According to UBS, “declining EV interest and affordability concerns may limit near-term growth” for the electric vehicle maker.

While Rivian’s brand awareness in the U.S. has improved slightly, from 10% in 2024 to 13% this year, consumer consideration is said to remain low.

“Only ~5% of BEV owners/buyers indicated they would consider purchasing a RIVN (up from 4.5% last year),” UBS said. For comparison, UBS estimates Rivian’s estimated 2024 U.S. BEV market share, excluding vans, was around 3%.

The survey also found that while many consumers still seek more EV alternatives, interest in EVs overall has declined.

“Given potential pushout of EPA requirements and repeal of the California waiver, the EV inflection may be further out than expected,” UBS warned, noting that removing the California waiver could also impact Rivian’s ability to generate and sell Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) credits.

Affordability also remains a key barrier, according to the bank.

“Only ~35% of respondents believed EVs are affordable vs. ICE vehicles,” UBS noted. Rivian’s current models—the R1S SUV and R1T pickup—start at $75,900 and $69,900, respectively, well above the $47,900 average price for a U.S. vehicle.

UBS also flagged risk around the possible elimination of consumer clean vehicle tax credits, which they estimate supported around 59% of Rivian’s 2024 vehicle leases.

“Near-term, especially if U.S. policies move away from an EV world, continued cost out of the R1 and increased manufacturing efficiencies are key,” UBS said.

The pilot programme, named KIRA, is led by Deutsche Bahn (DB) and the Rhein-Main Transport Association (RMV), and operates in the towns of Langen and Egelsbach, south of Frankfurt.

The project uses six modified first-generation ES8 SUVs, Nio’s debut model launched in China in 2018, equipped with autonomous driving systems developed by Intel-owned Mobileye.

The Israel-based company provides the autonomous driving system, including HD maps and advanced sensors. The trial will run through the end of 2025, with an extension under consideration.

While all driving decisions are made by the car, a safety driver remains on board during the test phase. Supervisory staff monitor operations from a remote control centre.

The vehicles, capable of speeds up to 130km/h, operate in regular traffic.

Passengers must register through the KIRA app to book rides. DB said the service will expand to parts of Darmstadt later this year.

The KIRA programme—short for “AI-based regular operation of autonomous on-demand transport”—marks the first time Level 4 automated vehicles are being used with passengers on public roads in Germany.

The pilot project is backed by €2.2 million ($2.5 million) in funding from Germany’s Federal Ministry for Transport, with additional financial support provided by the State of Hesse.

Level 4 automation allows driverless operation within geofenced areas without human intervention.

“Congrats to Deutsche Bahn on launching the autonomous shuttle KIRA pilot project with test users today in Germany,” Mobileye wrote on LinkedIn this Monday.

“We are proud that our Mobileye Drive™ technology is powering this project into its next phase,” the company added.

Dries Acke, deputy CEO, said: “This Act marks an important step in the EU’s strive to diversify and reshore solar manufacturing to Europe.
It creates a dedicated market for EU solar products, giving much-needed relief to European solar manufacturing.
This provision may, then, apply to solar PV capacity auctions.","The Commission has clarified the specific clean energy technology components that will fall under the NZIA requirements, which include a broad list of solar PV supply chain components from polysilicon and silicon ingots to junction boxes, backsheets and inverters.

It also adopted rules for so-called “non-price criteria” in public procurement auctions, which will compel member state governments to consider “responsible business conduct, cybersecurity, and sustainability and resilience contribution”, as well as price, in public renewables auctions. The Commission said that 30% of yearly auction volumes must meet these criteria from 30 December, 2025 – amounting to around 6GW of energy capacity per country each year.

Measures similar to these have already been included in the Clean Industrial Deal (CID), but had not previously been made explicit under the NZIA. The European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC) called for member states’ “resilience” criteria to be included in the NZIA earlier this year.

In response to the new acts, Christoph Podewils, secretary general of the ESMC, said: “This is a major step forward in our efforts to reshore solar manufacturing capacity to Europe. We now look forward to seeing these commitments translated into concrete measures through the Net-Zero Industry Act and the revised Public Procurement Framework.”

European trade body SolarPower Europe expressed similar support. Dries Acke, deputy CEO, said: “This Act marks an important step in the EU’s strive to diversify and reshore solar manufacturing to Europe. It creates a dedicated market for EU solar products, giving much-needed relief to European solar manufacturing.

“We look forward to seeing the first auctions under the Act in 2026 and encourage Member States to effectively implement the resilience principles, including premiums for made-in-Europe solar panels. With solar manufacturers in peril, there is no time to lose.”

The Commission also specifies that EU countries must not rely on any one country for more than 50% of renewable energy component supply, in addition to meeting the 30% “resilience” threshold for non-price criteria. In one section of this act, the Commission states that some technologies may have a level of dependency on an external country “so high that a strict application of the resilience criterion would endanger the security of supply of that component.”

Currently, Chinese producers account for over 80% of the world’s crystalline silicon solar manufacturing capacity, and the top four companies shipped over 65GW of modules between them in the first 3 months of 2025 alone. This provision may, then, apply to solar PV capacity auctions.

In a more explicit move, the Commission implied that the focus of its resilience drive will be on solar module assembly, rather than upstream components, specifically solar cells.

Article 10 of the act states that “the assembly of PV cells…or equivalent components into PV modules would not change the origin of the module. For this reason, it is appropriate to refer to the assembly of the solar photovoltaic system and of the PV module, rather than to their origin, as a reference for the contribution to resilience of those specific manufacturing steps.”

In its statement on the announcement, SolarPower Europe (which includes major Chinese solar manufacturers among its membership) praised the “positive, measured, approach” taken by the Commission. It continued: “This also means the rest of the auction market should remain unaffected, maintaining the necessary pace of solar deployment.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/European_Commission_flags-768x576-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 13:24:26.946819

A new Republican tax plan in the U.S. House of Representatives could eliminate many federal energy-efficient tax benefits, including electric vehicle (EV), solar panel, and clean energy home improvement credits.

According to the Kelley Blue Book, a record-breaking 1.3 million EVs were sold in the U.S. last year, with 87% taking advantage of the federal tax credit. Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury Department reports that over 3.4 million households have received $8.4 billion in tax credits for energy efficiency upgrades.

But the GOP’s latest proposal, called the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” might end affordability for many wanting to use clean energy tax incentives. (Though the U.S. Senate has yet to weigh in.)

Which credits could be eliminated? And in what ways might you still “go green” if the tax breaks do disappear?

Read on.

Clean energy tax credits in the House bill

During the Biden presidency, many clean energy tax credits were created, expanded, or extended under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). As a result of that legislation, the federal government offered several tax credits promoting energy efficiency:

The electric vehicle (EV) tax credit, worth up to $7,500 for new qualifying “clean vehicle” EVs.

The previously-owned clean vehicle credit, worth up to $4,000 or 30% of the sales price (whichever is less), for used EVs.

The alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit, also called the “EV charger tax credit,” worth up to 30% of the cost of qualifying “green” equipment (maximum $1,000).

The energy efficient home improvement credit, worth up to $3,200 on qualifying items like doors, windows, and natural gas heat pumps.

The residential clean energy credit, worth up to 30% of qualifying expenditures, like solar panels.

…there were also various other energy credits included in the IRA. Together, those tax breaks have helped many Americans afford to “go green” and cut their tax bills when installing certain energy-efficient home upgrades.

Most IRA-sponsored clean energy initiatives expire at the end of 2032. However, under the new GOP tax bill, many provisions could be eliminated as early as December 31, 2025.

GOP tax bill on energy tax credits

The latest House GOP tax bill calls for the early termination of many clean energy tax breaks. However, the party seems to be split on the issue:

In March of this year, 21 House Republicans sent a letter to Jason Smith, the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, advocating for preserving the clean energy tax breaks.

In May 2025, thirteen House Republicans warned that suddenly slashing IRA tax credits, including clean energy incentives, could harm new energy investment, according to a joint statement. Among the concerns cited were calls for ""additional time"" on certain tax credit phase-out schedules.

However, the House recently voted to pass its version of Trump’s one big, beautiful reconciliation bill to the Senate, with slashes to clean energy tax breaks in tow. Yet some still speculate whether energy-efficient tax breaks will be eliminated.

Just last month, four Republican Senators voiced concerns about ending federal clean energy tax credits and other incentives in the reconciliation process.

“...We caution against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,” wrote Rep. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), John R. Curtis (R-Utah), Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina), and Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota.

The letter highlights the divide within the party, as some Republicans view clean energy tax credits as “reckless.”

Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) proposed a bill in February calling for the complete elimination of electric vehicle tax credits. In a release regarding the bill, Barrasso said that repeal of the tax credits would “...stop Washington from giving handouts to our adversaries and high-income individuals.”

Energy bill cost if tax credits go away

Tax incentives help people afford clean energy upgrades like solar panels and EVs. By eliminating energy tax breaks, fewer people may obtain the benefits they offer, like lower energy bills.

According to a recent analysis by Energy Innovation, a non-partisan policy firm, repeal of federal clean energy tax credits could make electricity bills rise across the U.S.. The average American household could see an increase in its annual energy bill of:

About $40 to $60 by 2030

By about $56 to $150 in 2035

And about $140 to $220 in 2040

In total, repealing these tax credits could cost taxpayers $6 billion annually over the next five years. By 2040, American households could lose $25 billion per year.

Notably, that analysis doesn’t include any current or potential Trump tariffs.

Parts for clean energy initiatives, like EVs and solar panel pieces, are typically made abroad in countries like Mexico and China. When a tariff war occurs, as happened earlier this year (and continues to progress), consumers generally pay the price.

Consequently, energy-efficient tax breaks would be needed to combat raised prices from tariffs on imported energy products.

Otherwise, the hit to energy incentives would be twofold: Raised prices from tariffs, and elimination of tax credits that could have helped absorb the higher prices.

‘Go green’ clean energy ideas: Rebates and state tax programs

While many clean energy initiatives are under fire from the latest GOP tax plan, it’s important to remember the bill is still in its early days. The Senate will take up the bill and has already signaled that it plans to make revisions. Which provisions will be impacted remains to be seen.

In the meantime, there are ways you may be able to “go green” even if a potential elimination of energy tax credits occurs:

Apply for the High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Program, which offers qualifying homeowners rebates on stoves, heat pump water heaters, electric wiring, and more.

Check out the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps eligible households pay heating or cooling bills.

Regularly schedule maintenance on your HVAC, purchase “smart” energy usage appliances, or look around your interiors for potential air leaks in windows, doors, or attics. Timely repairs may save you up to 15% on heating and cooling costs, according to Energy Star.

Finally, check your state’s Department of Revenue website for energy-related tax credits or rebate programs. Several states have decided to stand against potential federal reform on the clean energy front.

For example, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced last year that if the EV tax credit is eliminated, the Golden State would provide rebates for eligible EV purchases. States like New Mexico and North Carolina have also set goals for 100% clean energy by 2045 and 2050, respectively.

The House version of the GOP tax bill heads to the Senate next, where it will likely face revisions before final legislation may be reached. Republicans have said their goal for passing major legislation is July 4. Stay tuned.

As part of its commitment to sustainability, Virginia Tech has taken a significant step toward reducing its carbon footprint by completing four 1.2-megawatt solar arrays on building rooftops across its Blacksburg campus in fall 2024.

The four solar arrays are located on top of Sterrett Center, Durham Hall, the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine and McComas Hall.

The arrays generate approximately 2,300 megawatt-hours annually, with weather and cloud cover being variables in production. This is equivalent to the energy consumption of approximately 215 to 220 average residential homes.

Installed in September 2024, the project became operational in November, marking progress toward the university’s broader goal of clean energy expansion.

“It was several years in the making — a lot of negotiating and stakeholder engagement around how that was to happen,” says Stephen Durfee, associate director for campus energy management. “You’ve got to start somewhere, and this is how you do it.”

Durfee oversees a team of energy engineers, technicians, field engineers and program managers who work to improve energy efficiency on campus.

“We work together to identify the wasteful areas where we don’t benchmark well,” Durfee said. “Once we figure out why, we develop solutions.”

Mark Owczarski, interim vice president for communications and marketing, said the project aligns with the university’s Climate Action Commitment, which aims for carbon neutrality by 2030 and a transition to 100% renewable electricity.

“It’s a commitment to responsible energy use and recognizing that fossil fuels have a limited supply and consequences,” Owczarski says. “These projects aren’t just about reducing emissions — they also create learning environments and spaces for students to engage.”

According to the Climate Action Commitment, a key component of the plan is to “achieve 100 percent renewable electricity by 2030.” The solar array project moves the university closer to that goal.

“This project is part of a larger plan that benefits business, teaching, research and the environment,” Owczarski says.

Virginia Tech’s sustainability efforts extend beyond Blacksburg. Owczarski pointed to the university’s newly opened Innovation Campus building in Alexandria, Virginia, as another example of sustainable design.

“If you take a real close look at that building — the windows and all that stuff — what you’re actually looking at are little teeny solar panels,” Owczarski says. “The panels make the building look beautiful, and they’re collecting energy.”

He emphasized that sustainability initiatives are part of a broader strategy across all Virginia Tech campuses.

“Educating the engineers who are going to make the next generation of energy makers is part of what we do,” Owczarski says.

Durfee noted the importance of early stakeholder engagement in sustainability projects.

“There’s always pushback from someone, but working through concerns and reaching agreements is key,” he says. “The more successful solar installations we see in the region, the easier it becomes for others to manage risk by learning from those patterns of success.”

When pitching the project, Durfee said the university looked to peer institutions in the Appalachian region for inspiration.

“We absolutely pointed to some peers — other schools, towns and municipalities that have successfully implemented solar design, installs and operations.”

Owczarski added that long-term analysis and review will demonstrate the project’s return on investment.

“It is not only good for the environment, but it’s also good for business because it can lower our bills over time after the initial investment,” Owczarski said. “It provides energy sources that are controllable, which will help economically.”

A third-party solar developer owns and maintains the solar arrays and sells the energy to Virginia Tech through a power purchase agreement.

Owczarski explains how a $500,000 grant from the Virginia Department of Energy helped lower the power purchase agreement cost per kilowatt-hour. Due to this agreement, Virginia Tech now gets about 1.2% of its campus energy from clean sources and saves around $45,000 a year compared to regular market rates.

Looking ahead, Durfee explains that Virginia Tech is “absolutely looking at much larger solar installations.”

The project has generated excitement among sustainability groups on campus.

The EPA did not disclose specific details about the rollback but confirmed that the revised proposal is undergoing interagency review and will be released once signed by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. This latest move continues a back-and-forth over federal authority to regulate power plant emissions.

The Obama-era Clean Power Plan sought to shift power generation toward low-carbon sources, but was replaced by the Trump administration’s Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule.

That rule was struck down by a federal court, and the Supreme Court later ruled in 2022 that the EPA had overstepped its legal authority under the Clean Air Act. The Biden administration’s regulation, finalized in early 2024, immediately faced lawsuits from Republican-led states, energy companies, and coal industry groups.

“Many have voiced concerns that the last administration’s replacement for that rule is similarly overreaching and an attempt to shut down affordable and reliable electricity generation in the United States, raising prices for American families, and increasing the country’s reliance on foreign forms of energy,” an EPA spokesperson said. “As part of this reconsideration, EPA is developing a proposed rule.”

Opponents argue that carbon capture remains too costly and technically uncertain, and say the vast infrastructure required to store captured CO2 safely underground is not yet in place — especially for the nation’s roughly 200 operating coal plants.

The agreement outlines plans to collaborate on the development and global deployment of Oklo’s advanced nuclear technology.

Under the MOU, KHNP and Oklo intend to explore opportunities to jointly advance the standard design development and verification of Oklo’s planned Aurora powerhouse. The parties also plan to cooperate on early-stage project development efforts, including manufacturability assessments and planning of major equipment, supply chain development for balance of plant systems, and constructability assessments and planning.

Oklo plans to deploy its 75 MWe Aurora powerhouse at the Idaho National Laboratory site and is currently advancing through the licensing process. The company is engaged with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission in a Pre-Application Readiness Assessment and intends to submit a formal Combined License Application (COLA) later this year. Oklo also plans to file follow-on applications to support its growing order pipeline, which exceeds 14 GW. Unlike the traditional approach, which requires separate construction and operating licenses, the COLA allows both to be granted simultaneously, streamlining the overall licensing process.

“We’ve recently completed site characterization borehole drilling for our first commercial powerhouse and are preparing for construction, with commercialization as a top priority,” said Jacob DeWitte, Co-Founder and CEO of Oklo. “Partnering with KHNP, one of the most accomplished nuclear builders in the world, who have been building nuclear power plants continuously since 1971, offers meaningful opportunities to align on key execution factors such as manufacturability, constructability, and supply chain development. Their experience in delivering projects at scale can complement our efforts and help us move more efficiently toward commercialization and the ability to build future powerhouses faster.”

KHNP CEO Whang Ju-ho stated, “KHNP is focusing on developing its innovative domestic advanced nuclear technology, the i-SMR, to achieve world-class competitiveness.

Georgia Power’s 2025 Integrated Resource Plan calls for renewable energy but also more fossil fuels.
Georgia Power’s plans include upgrading the nuclear units at Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle and the oil and gas-fired units at Plant McIntosh.
Georgia Power’s plans also include the addition of 1,100 MW of renewable energy from solar and battery storage.
Brionté McCorkle, executive director of Georgia Conservation Voters, argued that the driving reasons behind Georgia Power’s fuel rate increase is the continued reliance on fossil fuels.","The Georgia Public Service Commission is set to hold a second round of hearings on Georgia Power’s controversial long-range plans.

The five-member utility regulator is set to vote July 15 as the state’s largest utility expects to spend billions of dollars to meet skyrocketing energy demands attributed to new electricity-hogging data centers. Georgia Power’s 2025 Integrated Resource Plan calls for renewable energy but also more fossil fuels.

Georgia Power has come under fire after PSC hearings in April when the company disclosed it is considering building new methane gas units to generate up to 9,000 more megawatts of capacity by 2031.

A number of environmental groups are calling on the utility to include a more diverse mix of clean, affordable energy solutions like solar power in its long-range plan instead of relying more heavily on fossil fuels.

Georgia Power’s plans include upgrading the nuclear units at Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle and the oil and gas-fired units at Plant McIntosh.

In addition, the company plans to upgrade nine hydroelectric dams throughout the state and build new transmission lines along more than 1,000 miles of power lines.

Georgia Power’s plans also include the addition of 1,100 MW of renewable energy from solar and battery storage.

“The 2025 IRP provides a comprehensive plan to support Georgia’s continued economic growth and allow us to serve Georgians with clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy well into the future – we look forward to continuing the process through the hearings this week,” Georgia Power spokesman Matthew Kent said.

Three days of hearings about the plan will begin Tuesday, following a proposed agreement reached between Georgia Power and the PSC to freeze base electric rates from 2026 to 2028. Some critics have argued that the proposed agreement is a political maneuver to protect Republican incumbent commissioners Fitz Johnson and Tim Echols. The PSC members are facing voters for the first time in years after a lawsuit delayed the usual six-year election cycle.

Since 2023, the average Georgia Power residential ratepayer is paying $43 more per month due to rising base electric rates, higher natural gas costs and the completion of two nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle.

In April, the Environmental Protection Agency approved a two-year exemption at the request of Georgia Power’s parent Southern Company allowing Plant Bowen and Plant Scherer to bypass federal emission regulations for mercury and other air pollutants.

Fossil fuels under fire

Georgia Power is requesting permission from the PSC to continue burning coal at Plant Scherer near Macon and Plant Bowen outside Cartersville well into the 2030s. Georgia Power planned to retire one of its Plant Scherer units by the end of 2028 and Plant Bowen’s closure date is uncertain.

Georgia Power is also planning to continue to use coal and gas at Alabama’s Plant Gaston for energy generation.

The commission staff filed a recommendation this month that the company should be allowed to satisfy its projected 2033 needs, which would be 5,226 MW instead of 5,989 MW.

Georgia Power’s resource plan will reinforce its energy demands while also adapting to the changing regulatory environment and supply chain requirements, according to the PSC staff recommendations. The increases will provide Georgia Power with greater flexibility and time to adapt, according to the PSC staff.

Brionté McCorkle, executive director of Georgia Conservation Voters, argued that the driving reasons behind Georgia Power’s fuel rate increase is the continued reliance on fossil fuels.

Georgia Conservation Voters is one of several organizations challenging the power company’s models for predicting the growth of massive data centers. According to the company’s projections, data centers will consume 80% of all electricity, and all customers will benefit from these facilities that support the growing use of artificial intelligence.

Critics contend that the company’s projected demand is overstated and that existing ratepayers could be saddled with the cost of unnecessary electricity-generating infrastructure.

“We’ve seen them double down on gas and coal and all of the costs from Plant Vogtle,” McCorkle said. “All of those things have resulted in people’s bills going up despite public comment for years that people want to see the power company investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency. These are measures that will not only promote clean energy, but also help save the money on their power bills.”

Georgia Power has been criticized by environmental groups for reversing its plans to close plants Bowen and Scherer, long among the worst polluters in the region. The company is instead seeking approval from state regulators to extend the life of the two plants and expand its fossil fuel energy capacity.

Last year, Georgia regulators signed off on an amended 2022 Georgia Power plan allowing it to build new biomass power plants that will burn wood waste and other organic material to generate electricity.

Jennifer Whitfield, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the Georgia Power 2025 plan is unusual since there is a large amount of projected demand that is not based on proven analysis.

“How good are their projections, and are they good enough to make big resource decisions right now?” Whitfield said. “We think that they are not and expect that next week you’re going to hear from a lot of people who say their load forecasts are way too high.”

Whitfield gave credit for the Georgia Power proposal calling for significant investments in energy efficiency that can help ratepayers save money on their bills.

“I think there’s going to be some exciting stuff in (the IRP), but the commission shouldn’t take any action making radical decisions based on the data they have before them because the data is not good,” Whitfield said.

Neil Sardana with the Georgia Conservation Voters Education Fund said the organization will present testimony this week on how Georgia Power can reduce emissions, accelerate coal plant retirement and increase clean energy such as solar, wind and battery storage in a way that could potentially save customers $10 billion by the year 2040.

“Georgia Power could be doing a lot better when it comes to planning and developing resources for energy production that not only improves our air quality emissions and also saves everyday customers tons of money,” Sardana said.

New definitions would be included in section 7701(a)(51) with general applicability to the energy tax credits.
A prohibited foreign entity is defined as either a specified foreign entity or a foreign-influenced entity.
However, it’s possible that some buyers of tax credits might be more inclined toward tax equity as a result of their experience with purchases.","The budget bill as passed by the House promises an overhaul of the clean energy tax credits introduced and expanded in the Inflation Reduction Act. The contours of the changes are subject to revision — and that process has already begun — as the bill heads into the next phases of its probable passage. But while the bill spells immediate difficulties for many of the credits, the longer-term implications might be even more challenging for the energy industry because the House bill could be a prelude to putting the clean energy credits on the “permanent extenders” treadmill.

The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the Ways and Means Committee’s proposed changes to the clean energy credits would total almost $561 billion over the 10-year budget window (JCX-22-25 R). The JCT also showed a loss of $2 billion from the addition of income from hydrogen storage and carbon capture as qualifying income of certain publicly traded partnerships. Before the IRA, the tax equity market saw approximately $20 billion in transactions per year; after the IRA, the estimates are roughly $100 billion. If enacted without changes, the proposed budget bill would shrink the transfer market considerably.

The bad news for the energy industry is that the House bill includes extensive new restrictions for prohibited foreign entities for nearly all of the credits, repeals transferability for projects that begin construction after the second anniversary of enactment, and terminates the sections 48E and 45Y tech-neutral investment and production credits much earlier. The good news is that some of the credits would survive the House’s scalpel and none of the changes are retroactive. The only credits that would be completely repealed are the section 25C energy-efficient home improvement credit, the section 25D residential clean energy credit, the section 25E used electric vehicle credit, the section 30C EV charging credit, the section 30D clean vehicle credit (subject to a phaseout), the section 45L new energy-efficient home credit, and the section 45W commercial clean vehicle credit. Although many negotiations remain to be conducted in the Senate, the bill likely represents the worst-case scenario for the industry.

That means some credits are all but gone. The Rules Committee’s final changes to the tech-neutral credits, made hours before the bill passed the House, rendered those credits unavailable except for projects that begin construction within 60 days of the date of the bill’s enactment or are placed in service before December 31, 2028. The bill that initially emerged from Ways and Means proposed a phasedown starting in 2029.

Shutting Out China (and Russia, North Korea, and Iran)

While some changes to the foreign-entity-of-concern rules might have been expected, the breadth of the proposals surprised the industry. Unlike the IRA and the CHIPS Act, which included foreign-entity-of-concern rules only in section 30D’s individual EV credit and section 48D’s advanced manufacturing investment credit, the proposed foreign-entity-of-concern rules would apply to all of the energy tax credits. “The language is incredibly broad and would render the credits useless to a very large portion of the critical U.S. taxpayer base,” said Matt Donnelly of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP. A more recent revision incorporated by the Rules Committee and passed by the House narrowed the constructive ownership rules that apply in the foreign-entity-of-concern context but left the other rules largely unchanged.

New definitions would be included in section 7701(a)(51) with general applicability to the energy tax credits. They would take effect for tax years beginning after the date of enactment, leaving little time for taxpayers to adapt. A prohibited foreign entity is defined as either a specified foreign entity or a foreign-influenced entity. A specified foreign entity is defined as certain types of foreign entities of concern specified under the fiscal 2021 National Defense Authorization Act, a Chinese military company operating in the United States in accordance with that act, certain entities included on lists required by other laws, entities specified by the fiscal 2024 National Defense Authorization Act, or a foreign-controlled entity.

A foreign-controlled entity is the government of North Korea, China, Russia, or Iran; any citizen, national, or resident of one of those countries that is not a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States; an entity or qualified business unit incorporated under the laws of, or having its principal place of business in, one of those countries; or an entity, including subsidiaries, controlled by one of the above governments, individuals, or entities. Control means more than 50 percent by vote or value of the stock in a corporation, more than 50 percent of the profits or capital interests in a partnership, or more than 50 percent of the beneficial interests in any other type of entity. The section 318 rules on constructive ownership of stock apply, but an amendment by the Rules Committee removes the rules in section 318(a)(3) regarding attribution to partnerships and corporations in this context.

A foreign-influenced entity is defined based on its status during the tax year or the previous tax year. There are multiple ways to become a foreign-influenced entity during the tax year: if a specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint a covered officer of the entity, a single specified foreign entity owns at least 10 percent of the entity, one or more specified foreign entities own at least 25 percent in the aggregate of the entity, or at least 25 percent of the debt of the entity is held in the aggregate by one or more specified foreign entities. In addition, if during the previous tax year the entity knowingly pays dividends, interest, compensation for services, rents, royalties, guarantees, or any other fixed, determinable, annual, or periodic amount to a specified foreign entity equal to or greater than 10 percent of the total of such payments made by the entity during the tax year, or makes FDAP payments to more than one specified foreign entity of at least 25 percent of the total of such payments made during the tax year, the entity is a foreign-influenced entity.

Section 7701(a)(52) adds a prohibition on material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity. Material assistance occurs if any component, subcomponent, or applicable critical mineral included in property is extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured, or assembled by a prohibited foreign entity. If the design of property is based on any copyright or patent held by a prohibited foreign entity or any know-how or trade secret provided by one, that too is material assistance. There is an exception for an assembly part or constituent material that is not acquired directly from a prohibited foreign entity. Assembly parts subject to the exception cannot be uniquely designed for use in constructing a qualified facility under sections 45Y and 48E or an eligible component in section 45X or exclusively or predominantly produced by prohibited foreign entities, and there are similar rules for constituent materials.

The definition of control for purposes of the foreign-controlled entity concept applies the broad constructive ownership rules from section 318, and the Ways and Means version of the bill created a big problem for companies with international operations, Donnelly said. Those rules attribute ownership not only from a subsidiary to a parent company, but also from a parent down to the subs. Applying all of these rules for energy credits may treat even brother-sister subsidiaries as owning other subsidiaries in the group. “For many multinational enterprises, if there is a Chinese sub, that could render all of the others foreign-controlled entities,” Donnelly said. The drafters of the Ways and Means version could have intended to include only the upward attribution aspects of the section 318 rules in order to capture situations in which companies in China, North Korea, Russia, or Iran have management and ownership control over the subsidiary; clarifying that is the object of the Rules Committee change, which was included in the bill that passed the House.

Transferability Repeal

Is it time to eulogize the IRA’s novel experiment in transferability? The House bill says yes, but there are more than a few indications that Congress rather likes the idea of making credits transferable. (Prior analysis: Tax Notes Federal, Apr. 21, 2025, p. 439.) The bill repeals transferability for projects that begin construction after the second anniversary of the date of enactment, which offers some lead time for taxpayers to adjust. But even with a transition period, the change is likely to greatly affect the clean energy industry, which has become reliant on transferability, said David Burton of Norton Rose Fulbright US LLP. “It has worked very well and had a big impact,” he added. Smaller developers might be the most affected, and larger developers that previously engaged in tax equity transactions, the least affected. “For smaller developers with a weaker balance sheet, the tax equity market might not be terribly interested,” Burton said. However, it’s possible that some buyers of tax credits might be more inclined toward tax equity as a result of their experience with purchases. Burton said that although some credit buyers who weren’t previously tax equity investors eventually entered those transactions, or at least considered it, they’re likely to remain a minority, even if the repeal passes.

Andy Moon of Reunion, a tax credit transfer platform, said that although the House bill published May 22 would significantly shorten the window of availability for clean energy tax credits, market participants are confident that tax credit transfers will be respected in 2025. For projects that meet the safe harbor requirements, transfers could still be made for the next couple of years, even under the House bill. That assurance will likely accelerate credit transfers through the end of this year, Moon said. “I think there has been some holding back due to a fear of retroactive repeal,” he said. “I expect to see a wave of buyers looking for tax credits in the second half of the year, which will drive prices up similar to what we saw in 2024.” Corporate tax credit buyers and the clean energy industry will now turn their attention to the Senate to advocate for a longer-term tax credit program to incentivize clean energy.

From Phasedown to Repeal

In a surprising last-minute change before the full House voted May 22, the Rules Committee added provisions to repeal the technology-neutral investment and production tax credits in sections 48E and 45Y, setting the stage for a debate in the Senate about those credits’ future. In contrast, the Ways and Means proposal included a phasedown of the tech-neutral investment and production tax credits starting in 2029 that offered a transition period to the industry. It also gave politicians some lead time, coming as it did immediately after the 2028 election. The Ways and Means proposal likely represented a compromise in the House, because it came bundled with a switch from the long-used beginning-of-construction timing to a placed-in-service standard. The latter could pose difficulties for developers, because when a project is planned to be placed in service and when it is actually placed in service may differ due to circumstances beyond their control, Burton said. The switch would increase risk and decrease certainty about what level of credits a taxpayer qualifies for, he added.

Short End of the Stick

The commercial clean vehicle credit in section 45W is slated for a full repeal for vehicles acquired after December 31, 2025, with the only exception being vehicles placed in service before January 1, 2033, that are acquired under a written binding agreement entered before May 12, 2025. Josh Green of the American Fleet Leadership Coalition said that the proposal to eliminate section 45W ignores many of the benefits companies are already seeing from the credit and could harm U.S. competitiveness, national security, and energy dominance. Green, who is also CEO of Inspiration Mobility Group, noted that ending the credit this year jeopardizes investments that businesses have already committed to, because the owners of commercial fleets plan their purchases years in advance. “There are a variety of ways to improve the credit and make it more targeted while still reducing the overall fiscal impact,” Green said. Those might include domestic content rules with a runway for implementation and proration of the credit in accordance with the percentage of domestic content included, or a sunset date further off than the end of the year. In addition to the impact of the proposed bill, section 45W has another source of uncertainty: The proposed regulations for section 45W (REG-123525-23) were only released in January and haven’t been finalized yet.

Wind energy is also poised to take a blow by being removed from the section 45X advanced manufacturing production credit after 2027, while every other technology gets to stay in until 2031. This change appears to be a nod to the Trump administration’s deprioritization of wind power.

Everything Old Is New Again?

Ironically, if the changes in the House proposal are enacted, the result could be a greater interest in traditional tax equity transactions, which were available long before the IRA and have remained unchanged. And the likelihood that clean energy credits wind up being year-end extenders like their pre-IRA predecessors is probably also higher if Congress ultimately goes with the earlier sunset dates.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6835bb656a261e5ebc1a9d4b/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-05-27 11:19:57.729977

But these Texas Republicans are embracing it - The Guardian,Oliver Milman,,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/may/27/texas-republicans-trump-wind-power-turbines,"We are an energy state.” The stampede of new renewables has helped state energy demand that, fueled by data centers, is growing for the first time since the 1960s.
I’ve never seen one,” added Davis, in reference to one of the most common complaints, voiced by Trump himself, about wind turbines.
Some locals still dislike the sight of wind turbines puncturing the prairie, with even Davis initially put off by them.
Meanwhile, in Texas, there are three state bills that would severely restrict any new wind or solar installations.
“This would be extremely damaging to renewable energy and damaging to the whole Texas economy,” said Doug Lewin, a leading Texas energy industry expert.","As a Republican state lawmaker for 16 years, a Texas rancher and a staunch supporter of Donald Trump, John Davis’s conservative credentials are impeccable. But Davis has become horrified at his party’s assault upon an increasingly vital lifeline to many rural, conservative areas of the US – clean energy development.

Davis allowed seven wind turbines to be situated on his ranch, in the rolling hill country near Menard, west of Austin, and has seen the income provide opportunities not only for his family but also his local community in what is one of the poorest counties in Texas.

But a barrage of bills working their way through the Republican-held Texas legislature threaten to reverse the state’s position as the US’s clean energy superpower, even curtailing cherished private property rights by limiting a landowner’s ability to host wind and solar farms.

The bills come as Trump has ramped up anti-renewable rhetoric on the national stage, calling wind turbines “ugly” and “disgusting” and barring major clean energy projects on federal lands and waters. “We don’t want windmills in this country,” Trump, who has enjoyed strong electoral support from farmers, said shortly after being inaugurated as president.

This backlash has left many conservatives, such as Davis, bewildered, with recent polling showing that most Republican voters in Texas oppose moves to squash the state’s booming renewable energy sector. While climate campaigners see renewables as a crucial replacement for the fossil fuels that are overheating the planet, places such as Menard county, Texas – where Trump won more than 80% of the vote in last year’s election – are more inclined to weigh other factors.

“We’re supposed to be the party of common sense but we’ve shifted to be like the Democrats and that is what makes me mad. When you tell me what to do on my own property that sounds more like a Democrat,” Davis said. “Some of the bills they are trying to pass would kill renewables.”

Davis retired as state legislator in 2015 to spend more time on his ranch but has lately been donning a suit and traveling back to Austin to urge his former colleagues to reject the anti-renewables bills. “I testify as a conservative and say: ‘What are you guys doing? Have you lost your mind?’” he said. “Some of these bills are attacking battery storage of all things. How dumb is that? It’s sacrificing your core conservative value principles in order to protect the oil and gas industry.”

Texas’s traditional image may be of cowboy hats, steers and nodding oil wells, but in reality, the state today could just as easily be associated with solar panels, windmills and Teslas. Texas’s combined wind and solar power output is nearly double that of its closest rival, California, it tripled the amount of new battery storage added last year compared to 2023 and is leading the way in emerging alternatives such as geothermal. This year, a third of all new renewable and storage projects in the US will be built in the Lone Star state.

“We are still firmly an oil and gas state and producing more than we ever have but that’s not the full picture,” said Joshua Rhodes, an energy expert at the University of Texas. “We produce and consume more energy than any other state, we have more wind than the next four states combined and regularly have more than 50% of our grid running on renewables. We are an energy state.”

The stampede of new renewables has helped state energy demand that, fueled by data centers, is growing for the first time since the 1960s. It has also generated cash for struggling rural areas. Rhodes’ research has found existing clean energy projects in Texas will pay more than $12bn in taxes to communities where they are located, funding schools, roads and hospitals, while paying out another $15bn to landowners to lease their properties.

“It’s a hard life out here, there’s rocks, mesquite and coyotes and not a lot else – if there’s anything to make life easier, do it,” said Davis as he stood on his property under the whooshing blades of a wind turbine, one of a ragged line of turbines that make up the Cactus Flats wind project. “See any dead birds here? I’ve never seen one,” added Davis, in reference to one of the most common complaints, voiced by Trump himself, about wind turbines.

Places such as Menard, located in central Texas between two large oil and gas regions, have limited options for new income. Davis has several hundred goats and sheep and raises cattle for wagyu beef on his 1,300-acre property, but 40% of his income now comes from the wind turbines, money he hopes he can push back into the sleepy Menard community.

“I struck wind!” said the ebullient Davis, who likes to restyle Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” mantra into “turn, baby turn” in recognition of his wind turbines. “I done turned the money into my back ass pocket,” he said.

Some locals still dislike the sight of wind turbines puncturing the prairie, with even Davis initially put off by them. “I think they look angelic now,” he said. Another nearby rancher, Hoppy Murchison, who has a drooping handlebar moustache, cowboy hat and checked shirt, is less enamored with their appearance and mostly subscribes to Trump’s worldview.

“But for me it made too much sense to not do it,” said Murchison, who now has several wind turbines on his own property, providing him a stable income. “I don’t think we can become totally dependent on renewable energy, but anything will help because we will run out of oil and gas at some point.”

For leaders of poorer counties such as Menard, the aesthetics of wind turbines are beside the point. “I literally have hungry children in my community, so I’m not turning my nose up at any kind of financial windfall,” said Brandon Corbin, the local Republican county judge. Corbin estimates that a proposed battery facility in the county could add as much as 30% to Menard’s stretched annual budget of $5m.

“It’s not productive or helpful when he spouts off like that,” Corbin said of Trump’s comments on wind and solar. “We are the ones on the ground here and he says and does things that puts fear and uncertainty out.”

But senior Republicans in Washington have sought to ape Trump, pushing forward a budget plan that strips away incentives for clean energy and electric cars. Meanwhile, in Texas, there are three state bills that would severely restrict any new wind or solar installations.

One that has already passed the Texas senate, SB819, calls for the “police power of the state” to drastically limit new wind and solar projects by requiring permits not needed for gas, coal or nuclear plants. A wind turbine would have to be 3,000ft from a neighbor’s property line, compared to just 467ft for an oil well.

“I’ve heard from many constituents with valid concerns regarding the reckless installation of these facilities,” said Lois Kolkhorst, a Texas state senator and one of the bill’s sponsors. Kolkhorst, a Republican who calls herself a “lifelong wildlife conservationist” said the legislation will provide “a reasonable approach to the recent proliferation of wind and solar facilities encroaching across Texas with no consideration or safeguards for landowners or the environment”.

While most Republicans don’t share such enmity towards renewables, Kolkhorst has some powerful and wealthy allies, including the Texas Public Policy Foundation thinktank and the Stewards of Texas group, which opposes new clean energy development. The latter group has ties to Dan Friedkin, a billionaire businessman whose interests include owning hotels and whose roles include being the executive producer of the Paramount show Landman (which includes a notable scene critiquing clean energy) as well as being the owner of soccer clubs Everton and Roma.

“Renewable energy has a role in Texas’s energy landscape, but it must be managed responsibly to ensure that our state’s most cherished outdoor spaces are not adversely affected,” a spokesperson for the Friedkin Group, on behalf of Friedkin, said.

Critics of the bills, though, argue that they are counterproductive political posturing designed to aid an oil and gas industry that feels threatened by the rise of renewables. Should the bills pass, 15% of Texas’s wind fleet could shutter, raising energy prices to the point that the typical household’s electricity bill would increase by $225 a year, according to one estimate.

“This would be extremely damaging to renewable energy and damaging to the whole Texas economy,” said Doug Lewin, a leading Texas energy industry expert.

“We desperately need new energy supply, and if we’re saying, ‘No, we don’t want the sources that can be deployed the fastest’ for ideological reasons, then the economy will stagnate.

“Some people have just decided that renewables are bad and they will fight them. To point at solar panels as an environmental problem when we have so many abandoned oil wells in Texas is just absurd.”

While the fate of clean energy support in the federal budget will come down to how many moderate Republicans will fight to preserve the investment flowing to their districts, in Texas the main decider could be time itself. The Texas legislative session ends on 2 June and should the bills get gummed up enough in the system, Davis hopes they will be beaten by the clock, at least until next year’s session.

“The system is set up to kill bills, to have less government,” he said. “So there’s a lot of advantages we have to kill these bills. We want to keep them bottled up. Delay, delay, delay.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a02aeb10ccf91b310b2dccd9e8bf389cb36e9cbd/120_185_3085_2469/master/3085.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aaad5fef849cc81709a52e75ce9387d8,N,,2025-05-27 10:10:14.666895

US shale producers grapple with tariff fallout, Opec

US shale producers grapple with tariff fallout, Opec

New York, 27 May (Argus) — US oil executives remain on the defensive following forecasts for a sharp shale production growth slowdown this year, despite President Donald Trump's 90-day trade truce with China helping oil prices bounce back from four-year lows. The US oil sector is having to contend with surging Opec+ supplies at a time when worldwide demand is flagging, as well as steel tariffs that have raised the cost of oil field equipment. Some companies are already starting to cut spending and drop rigs after warning that the sector is near or already at peak output. And with oil prices still hovering around levels needed to profitably drill new wells, any renewed weakness could accelerate the downturn. Hundreds of producers and suppliers gathered at the Super DUG Conference & Expo in Fort Worth, Texas, earlier this month to discuss how best to navigate the growing challenges facing the industry. Many of them said they were bracing for further headwinds, but they also argued the industry is in better shape to withstand the latest slump after spending the years since the Covid-19 pandemic getting its finances in order. Some attendees expressed frustration that tariffs remain a moving target and are hard to plan for as a result, but services firms noted some upside from a rush of bookings from customers looking to avoid getting hit. Others believe the industry may be able to come together and figure out how to mitigate the effects of tariffs, but consider Opec+ a bigger concern as additional barrels hitting the market from the producer group have the potential to sink prices. Trump has ruffled feathers with his unwavering push for lower oil prices to help tackle inflation, but executives are giving him the benefit of the doubt, given his promise to roll back costly environmental regulations and free up permitting bottlenecks — both of which could bolster the industry in the long term. But oil field services companies are bearing the brunt of this year's slowdown, with the share price of Liberty Energy — founded by US energy secretary Chris Wright — down by about 45pc since January. The company's calendar is ""full"" and activity looks to be ""quite solid"" through to the end of the second quarter, Liberty chief executive Ron Gusek told the conference. ""My expectation is we are going to see a reduction in activity over the back half of the year, barring some meaningful change in the macro,"" he said. Drilling down An uncertain outlook for oil prices could spur a reduction in drilling programmes as companies look to shore up balance sheets and protect free cash flow. ""I don't know how steep that will be... I think it's going to be tens of rigs. Maybe it's in the 30-40 range,"" Gusek said, referring to the number of drilling rigs that are likely be shut down by US onshore producers. For Liberty, that could translate into a decline of 10-15 hydraulic fracturing crews. ""I don't view that as catastrophic by any stretch of the imagination, but I do think we're going to see a wind down,"" Gusek said. ""Certainly, by the time we get out into the fourth quarter, where capital programmes are normally winding down for the year, I think we're going to see a real taper-off there."" It is too early to say what 2026 has in store for the industry but ""we'll have to be ready for that"", Gusek said Meanwhile, upstream independent Continental Resources founder and chairman Harold Hamm — who helped kick-start the shale boom by combining horizontal drilling with fracking in North Dakota's Bakken basin to tap previously hard-to-access reserves — warned that the current bout of oil price weakness could continue as oversupply is likely to remain for some time yet. ""Should people expect lower for longer at this point, with prices where they're at? Probably,"" Hamm said. Hamm still sees potential for US crude output to increase by a further 1.5mn-2mn b/d before levelling off — even though the talk in industry circles is that shale is reaching a peak . Continental has recently expanded overseas and is looking at developing resources in Turkey, but the bulk of the company's spending will remain in the Lower 48 US onshore, Hamm said. The Bakken has been written off many times in the past, but the play keeps coming back. ""It just doesn't go away,"" Hamm said. ""We still find out every day new stuff that works really well."" A major campaigner for Trump, Hamm said he plans to source as much of the oil field equipment needed for his company from domestic suppliers in future, after being shocked to discover how much comes from overseas. ""We're going to buy as much as we can right here in the US. We think it's the right thing to do."" Peak or plateau? Leading operators from Diamondback Energy to Occidental Petroleum have recently talked about US crude output peaking sooner than previously expected, with shale remaining under pressure as prices hover below the $65/bl average breakeven price flagged by executives in a recent Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas shale industry survey as necessary to profitably drill a new well. Diamondback, the largest pure-play producer in the Permian, warned in a recent widely circulated letter to shareholders that US output is at a ""tipping point"", with geological headwinds starting to outweigh the benefits from improvements in technology and operational efficiencies. ""I would maybe caveat it just a little bit different and not call it a peak, necessarily, but I think we're in for a period of a plateau,"" Continental chief executive Doug Lawler told the conference. But he agreed that the industry's ability to offset the impact of lower oil prices is limited. ""There's nothing that we can use in the industry to absorb a $10/bl drop in price from a technology standpoint,"" Lawler said. ""There are no capital efficiencies that can be captured that make up $10/bl."" Still, recent market volatility might not be enough to deter investors that have gradually returned to the sector as returns have improved. The fear of missing out has brought back a growing number of investor groups — from pension funds to endowments — and that is unlikely to change for as long as returns are forthcoming — with the exception of funds modelled along environmental, social and governance investing. ""Most of our investors don't worry about short-term volatility,"" Pearl Energy Investments founder and managing partner Billy Quinn said. ""They rely on us to make good investment decisions through volatile cycles."" The industry is on a much firmer footing these days, having learned the hard way about the pitfalls of spending beyond its means, which resulted in multiple bankruptcies in previous downturns. Gone are the days when shale reinvestment rates exceeded 100pc as producers sought to boost output at any cost. Shareholder distributions are now the priority. ""It's just a much healthier industry than it once was,"" Houston-based EIV Resources' partner and chief executive, Claire Harvey, said. Others spoke about how a sector that has suffered the ups and downs of past downturns has learned over time to prepare for the leaner times. This has meant targeting top-quality acreage, ditching assets with high breakeven prices and using the latest technology to maximise returns. ""Necessity is the mother of invention,"" Denver-based independent SM Energy chief executive Herb Vogel said. SM Energy operates in west Texas' Midland basin, south Texas' Maverick basin and the Uinta basin of northeast Utah. ""Low price cycles make us stronger,"" Vogel said.

Texas’s clean energy sector is experiencing unexpected challenges as lawmakers introduce regulations that could hinder the growth of renewable energy projects. The ongoing tussle between fossil fuel interests and clean energy innovations threatens the state’s energy future, despite recent legislation aimed at enhancing grid reliability. While the sector has created thousands of jobs and attracted significant investments, new proposals could impose stricter regulations on wind and solar initiatives. As demand for energy continues to rise, Texas’s energy landscape may see critical shifts driven by political debates and economic implications.

Texas Clean Energy Faces Legislative Challenges Amidst Rising Demand

In Texas, the clean energy sector is facing legislative obstacles even as the demand for renewable energy continues to rise. Lawmakers are now considering regulations that could significantly impact the development of solar and wind power, critical components of the state’s energy landscape.

The Battle for Energy Innovation

Texas has established itself as a leader in the clean energy movement, successfully leveraging its natural resources to bring forth expansive wind and solar projects. Despite this progress, recent actions by state policymakers are introducing complexities that may hinder the growth of renewable energy projects. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages the majority of Texas’s electricity supply, is now in the midst of a conflict between entrenched fossil fuel interests and the advancing clean energy sector. As the state’s need for a reliable power grid becomes increasingly important, the decisions made in this political arena are critical for the economy and environment alike.

Amid these challenges, promising developments are also on the horizon. Legislation aimed at enhancing the reliability of the electric grid has gained traction, requiring utilities to conduct regular inspections and maintenance on their transmission and distribution systems. This change comes after dire events last year when system failures during outages resulted in losses estimated at $2.3 billion for ERCOT customers in 2023 alone.

Economic Implications of Clean Energy

The discussions surrounding energy production methods have significant ramifications for Texas’s economy. Adjustments in legislation now empower the Public Utility Commission (PUC) to better manage and plan new power line developments. As energy demand escalates, the need to address deficiencies in the transmission system has come under scrutiny. The clean energy industry has shown positive growth, contributing 29,000 new jobs and attracting over $14 billion in investments since the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act. This growth has particularly benefitted rural areas, where jobs and income from renewable initiatives are vital for local economies.

In addition, advancements in technology, including utility-scale batteries expected to provide a capacity of at least 14 gigawatts by 2025, could revolutionize energy storage solutions. Such innovations can enable the conservation of energy generated during peak production, offering a potential lifeline to approximately 2.8 million households in Texas and enhancing grid stability.

Shifting Political Winds

Not all political leaders are aligned with those advocating against clean energy policies. Some conservative voices have emerged, expressing concerns over their colleagues’ resistance to supporting renewable initiatives. These leaders recognize the critical economic advantages that clean energy projects present. Conversely, new legislative measures proposing tighter regulations on wind and solar installation setbacks are emerging, raising apprehensions about potential overreach that could thwart job growth and elevate electricity costs.

Critics of these measures warn that imposing further restrictions on clean energy sources would undermine Texas’s economic prospects. With the future of job creation and affordable energy pricing at stake, maintaining a supportive environment for renewable energy remains crucial for the state.

The Road Ahead

As the implications of climate change and energy needs evolve, Texas stands at a pivotal juncture. The clean energy movement has highlighted inefficiencies within existing fossil fuel frameworks, leading to ongoing political challenges as the state seeks a balance between varying energy sources.

For communities dependent on wind and solar energy, the current surge in clean energy represents not just a trend but an essential economic support mechanism. The direction Texas takes, whether relying on traditional energy sources or adopting a more expansive approach to renewables, remains uncertain. What is evident is that Texas’s energy future will require strategic actions that prioritize both reliability and innovation.

As Texas navigates these complexities, the effects of legislative decisions could resonate throughout the economy and environment, making it imperative to monitor developments closely.

In 2024, green investment once again underpinned Chinese growth, driven by carbon reduction goals, energy security, and a push to lead in green technology. This surge included a record 275 gigawatt (GW) of new solar and 80 GW of wind capacity added, making renewable energy the largest driver of fixed asset investment for the second consecutive year. Investment in water conservation and environmental management also contributed significantly.

Conversely, investment in EV manufacturing moderated, and the contribution from solar and battery manufacturing swung from a strong tailwind to a headwind, reflecting substantial overcapacity.

Peering through the smog

China’s abrupt green pivot since 2023 partly reflects a need to counter the drag from real estate, but it also aligns with the country’s climate targets. As electrification continues at pace, China is likely to have already reached peak emissions or will achieve it very soon, well ahead of its stated 2030 target.

China’s announced “dual control” system for carbon emissions focuses on energy intensity and total emissions, with non-binding targets for absolute emissions until 2030. Details on the targets for its National Determined Contribution related to its Paris Agreement commitments, expected in the coming months, could be unambitious.

Despite this, there is a good chance these objectives will be reached early, as has been the case with China’s renewable agenda. However, emissions reduction will likely remain limited in this decade, as China continues to build coal power plants. The risk of stranded assets and subsidisation of coal power appear to be costs the authorities are willing to pay to guarantee energy security and manage renewable production variability.

China’s industry craves power

China’s electricity consumption and generation capacity surpassed those of the US and the Eurozone combined in 2024, reflecting its energy-intensive manufacturing sector. Industries like semiconductors, aluminium, nickel refining and data centres require vast amounts of electricity. Renewable energy production also demands significant power, with polysilicon needing four times more energy per tonne than aluminium and 150 times more than steel.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that manufacturing green products alone accounts for 16 per cent of total electricity growth.

More broadly, China is witnessing dramatic electrification.

China’s domestic EV adoption has slowed, but long-term electrification of transport will require greater grid capacity as oil powers fewer cars. Rising living standards and temperatures are increasing household electricity use, particularly for air conditioning and electric heating. This suggests solid fundamentals for grid expansion, with potential for exporting excess capacity to neighbouring countries.

Green light, red light

A key question is whether China’s green drive can continue to support growth or turn into a headwind. Investment from EV manufacturing moderated in 2024, and significant consolidation is expected, which could weigh on automotive sector investment over the next few years. Excess capacity in battery manufacturing, which dragged on whole-economy FAI (fixed asset investment) in 2024, may worsen as developed markets reduce reliance on China.

Bloomberg NEF tracks 6.8 TWh (terawatt-hour) of annual battery manufacturing capacity for the end of 2025, with China alone accounting for nearly 5 TWh . Industry reports suggest CATL, the largest Chinese manufacturer, is operating at 60 per cent capacity, with smaller firms at 20 to 30 per cent. Industry standards aimed at culling low-quality capacity will likely amplify consolidation pressures.

The renewable energy rollout must continue to gather pace to support gross domestic product growth in 2025 and beyond. Data to February shows little sign of slowing down, and China may lean more heavily on green investment to counter the trade war with the US. However, China is changing the pricing system for new wind and solar projects from June, moving from fixed prices benchmarked on coal power prices to competitive auctions, which could slow the rollout.

The good news is that investment in grid and ancillary infrastructure could still support growth, even if renewable energy capacity stabilises or eases. China likely needs more ultra-high voltage (+800 kV) power lines to move renewable power from the West to the East, and investments in energy storage, such as solar, battery, and pumped hydro, will be crucial to keep the electricity system operating smoothly.

CarbonBrief noted that storage infrastructure under construction rose to 189 GW (+13 per cent) in 2024, while energy storage was included as an aim for the first time in the government work report presented at the “Two Sessions” .

Unsustainable surge in sustainable investment?

China’s push into green investment in 2023 and 2024 was remarkable. The number of EVs manufactured has almost doubled since 2022 to over 13 million, while surging investment in renewables means that more than half of China’s electricity generation capacity is green. However, the pivot away from real estate and into green investment raises the question of whether China is swapping one unsustainable form of investment for another.

Assessing the time horizons over which different aspects of green investment could support or weigh on growth is complicated. Some aspects of green investment are already dragging on the economy, while others may curtail investment soon. Considering a longer time horizon, the potential for EVs to rise from their current 20 per cent share to a much larger proportion of China’s auto fleet suggests green investment in transportation could still be a significant driver of growth.

We have little visibility on the Chinese Communist Party’s plans for investment in renewable power over the long run. China smashed through its 2030 target of 1,200 GW of solar and wind capacity, reaching 1,400 GW in 2024. The latest IEA Renewables 2024 report forecasts 4,800 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, more than triple its 2023 level. If correct, that would imply the renewable rollout would provide a strong near-term growth boost, as the installation of new capacity could still accelerate.

Our latest modelling work is more cautious, suggesting that such a fast pace of renewable capacity expansion would exceed fundamental demand. Regardless of the timescale and ambitions, the pivot towards renewable energy – which requires a greater amount of capacity to be installed relative to thermal power – suggests substantial expansion is the new norm. This modelling also assumes that coal-fired power capacity may continue to expand modestly over the next five to 10 years.

At some stage, the renewables’ rollout will need to slow, but grid capacity and ancillary infrastructure needs will still have to catch up, providing more long-lasting support to growth. The IEA World Energy Investment report expects investment into grid and storage to almost triple. If correct, green investment should continue to support growth over the coming years.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/5cd103310056d57e33462792c8f44c1098487845e882df1e56d963b5086c6e05?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-05-27 11:20:00.826080

A right-hand drive version of the fully electric hatchback is expected to be ready no later than October, the group’s founder and CEO William Li said in April.

Onvo, Nio’s first sub-brand unveiled a year ago, registered 1,560 units of the debut model L60 last week — down 1.3% from 1,580 recorded in the second full week of May.

The Nio brand launched on Sunday refreshed versions of its ET5 sedan and ET5 Touring models.

The premium EV maker is currently transitioning production to the four facelift versions launched over the last few weeks, including the ES6, EC6, the ET5 and its station wagon version ET5T.

These models feature more than 500 upgraded parts and in-house-developed AD chips while keeping prices unchanged from the previous iteration.

Sales of Tesla vehicles in 32 European countries tumbled 49% to 7,261 in April from 14,228 in the same month the previous year, according to the figures released by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, or ACEA.

At the same time, sales of battery-electric vehicles by all manufacturers rose about 28%, the group's data shows.

The numbers are the latest indication of how much the Tesla brand is suffering because of the backlash against billionaire CEO Elon Musk over his far-right views. Crowds have gathered at Tesla dealerships in both Europe and the U.S., with protesters objecting to Musk's work with President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, which has slashed the U.S. federal workforce and been the subject of multiple lawsuits.

The protesters are aiming at Tesla to dent Musk's fortunes, given that much of his wealth is tied up in shares of the electric vehicle maker.

""2025 started off as a dark chapter for Musk and Tesla as Elon's role in the Trump Administration and DOGE created a life of its own which created brand damage and a black cloud over the story,"" noted Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a May 23 research note.

Musk, meanwhile, said last month he would scale back his DOGE work beginning in May in order to spend more time at Tesla. The EV company's first-quarter earnings fell far short of analyst expectations, with revenue tumbling 9% and profit slumping 71%.

The latest European sales figures, which cover the European Union's 27 member countries and five other nations outside the bloc, back up early data from Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark released at the start of this month that had pointed to a sales collapse.

Tesla's aging model lineup

While Tesla has been reeling from protests and boycotts over Musk wading into politics, it also faces other factors including an aging model lineup and intensifying competition from rival electric vehicle brands, particularly from China.

Mr. Trump's trade war has also turned Europeans off buying American brands. In recent days, Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on EU goods, accusing the bloc of being ""very difficult to deal with,"" before agreeing to delay the duties until July.

In one sign that Tesla appears to be losing ground to cut-price Chinese brands, sales at China's SAIC zoomed up 54% in April, according to the ACEA figures. SAIC owns a slew of auto brands including U.K.-based MG, known for its low-cost EV models.

Tesla is also suffering because it had to shut down factories for several weeks this year while upgrading its best selling Model Y sport utility vehicle, pinching supply.

For the first four months of the year, Tesla's European sales fell roughly 39% to 61,320 while the continent's auto market as a while showed little change during the same period, according to the data.

Trump previously pledged to undo what he called the ""electric vehicle mandate,"" referencing the Biden-era goal for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030.

John Higham, board member of the Electric Vehicle Association, said the administration's approach may slow the growth of the EV industry.

""It's not going to kill the electric vehicle,"" Higham stressed. ""It might slow the acceleration of the adoption of the electric vehicle but it's certainly not going to reverse the trend.""

Data from the U.S. Department of Energy showed about 40,000 EVs are on Utah roads. All EV owners in the state must pay an annual registration fee of about $140. The U.S. House passed the massive budget bill last week, moving it to the Senate for consideration.

House lawmakers have proposed legislation to extend the tax credit until the end of the year. Analysts said Tesla, the largest EV automaker, owned by Trump adviser Elon Musk, would be affected the most by the loss of the tax credit. Higham projected the proposal to repeal the tax credit could break down party lines.

""That economic engine that is in those red districts, where there's new battery manufacturing put in, new automotive manufacturing put in,"" Higham pointed out. ""Those are the voters that are going to feel it the most, are in those red districts.""

According to the Argonne National Laboratory, consumers can save more than $6,000 in lifetime repair and maintenance costs from an EV compared to a gas-fueled vehicle. It is estimated the federal government spent about $2 billion on EV tax credit payments in 2024.

Loss of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Mining Program will reverse decades of progress in preventing disease, injury and death among miners, experts said.

Around 150 researchers are expected to be laid off next month, effectively shuttering the program.

Steve Schafrik, associate professor of mine engineering at the University of Kentucky, said the agency's research labs are conducting studies not easily be replicated, noting the labs contain specialized equipment aimed at reducing hazards to which miners are exposed.

""Facilities for trying to reduce the noise of equipment so that workers aren't exposed to that level of noise all day, every day,"" Schafrik noted. ""That's a pretty difficult task, and you need to have very specific research equipment to do that.""

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said layoffs are part of an effort to combine numerous agencies under the umbrella of the new ""Administration for a Healthy America."" According to federal data, around one of five of the nation's operating coal mines are located in Kentucky.

Schafrik pointed out the program's worker safety materials are used by mining industries around the world. He stressed the shutdown also leaves an uncertain future for grants and contracts needed to recruit new researchers.

""NIOSH has put a big emphasis on generating capacity within the academic institutions for replenishment of the researchers who can go out and work in academia, industry, regulatory bodies and government research,"" Schafrik outlined.

He added the program's closure will affect other industries, such as mineral production.

""While we are looking to get more critical mineral production inside of the United States, to be coupling that with the reduction of the Health and Safety Research Program, I don't understand the reasoning behind that,"" Schafrik observed.

According to the Mine Safety and Health Administration, 10 miner fatalities occurred between Jan. 3 and March 5, 2025, more than triple the number from the same period last year.

The budget bill passed by the U.S. House and now under consideration in the Senate would reform environmental permitting in Illinois and nationwide, potentially streamlining the process and reducing litigation exposure.

Under the National Environmental Policy Act, large projects with the potential to affect the environment must complete environmental assessments or impact statements, including all federal agencies and affects private development projects needing federal permits. The new provision would create an expedited review process for a fee of 25% on top of the usual cost of a review.

Thomas Hochman, director of infrastructure policy at the Foundation for American Innovation, said the new rule would also shield projects from litigation related to permitting.

""There are quotes from folks like an outgoing EPA General Counsel, who say 90% of the details in a NEPA review are purely there for litigation-proofing the document,"" Hochman pointed out. ""You can imagine if you only need 10% of the details in that environmental impact statement, because you know that you are not at risk of litigation, that is almost certainly a radically faster timeline.""

National Environmental Policy Act reform has been attempted by both parties in Congress in recent years but could not pass the Senate. This year's bill marks the first time it has been attempted in the budget reconciliation process. If approved, the permitting reforms may accelerate some of the later phases of the multiyear Rebuild Illinois capital program.

In court, federal agencies have an 80% success rate on appeal and their environmental reviews are not often changed through litigation. One study of reviews showed solar energy projects face the highest litigation rate. Frequent litigation was also seen with pipelines, transmission lines and wind energy projects.

Despite streamlining the process, Hochman pointed out the reforms may also make projects subject to changing political priorities.

""If you let each administration determine what the cost is and also spend time determining what the cost should be, you can potentially see differences in treatment,"" Hochman observed. ""Maybe a Republican administration drags their feet and puts out a really high cost for a wind project that's going through an environmental impact statement. Maybe a Democratic administration does the same for a pipeline that's going through an environmental impact statement.""

Projects may still face litigation under other environmental laws such as the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts.

Supporters of electric vehicle ownership said there are a number of advantages to owning one.

Studies show EVs can convert 85% to 90% of their energy into forward movement. A majority of the electricity used in an EV vehicle is American-made and an EV can be charged at home, just like a cellphone.

Despite the benefits and their popularity, Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., the Speaker of the House, has proposed removing a $7,500 tax credit for EV owners as part of President Donald Trump's goal to restructure the country's budget.

John Higham, board member of the Electric Vehicle Association, wondered if it will cause potential EV car buyers to back away.

""Do I think if this $7,500 tax credit suddenly disappeared, it's not going to kill the electric vehicle?,"" Higham asked. ""It might slow the acceleration of the adoption of the electric vehicle but it's certainly not going to reverse the trend.""

Trump's budget proposal could pass between the end of May and the end of July. Higham acknowledged the tax credit is a strong motivator for people to buy or lease an electric car. And he expects a 10% to 12% growth rate for purchases. Higham admitted the number could drop to between 8% and 9% if the tax credit disappears.

As of December 2023, the Department of Energy shows slightly more than 26,000 Hoosiers own an electric vehicle.

The Republican controlled House has proposed legislation to extend the tax credit until the end of 2025 and analysts said the largest EV automaker, Tesla, owned by Trump associate Elon Musk, would be affected the most if the tax credit ends. Higham noted the fallout of repealing the tax credit could break down along party lines.

""That economic engine that is in those red districts, where there's new battery manufacturing put in, new automotive manufacturing put in,"" Higham pointed out. ""Those are the voters that are going to feel it the most, are in those red districts. And so there are Republican congressmen who are saying, not quite so fast. It is harder to repeal than I think most people realize.""

In 2024, it is estimated the federal government spent about $2 billion in advance point-of-sale EV tax credit payments. Buzz about the tax removal may push consumers to buy EVs sooner than later, to take advantage of the credit before it disappears.

A shared set of policy priorities could help unlock action, and speaking with one voice on the global stage would increase Europe’s influence and visibility in this space.

On May 14, Clean Air Task Force convened developers, researchers, and policymakers for a closed-door roundtable on the sidelines of the Global Geothermal Energy Summit in Warsaw. The discussion focused on enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), closed-loop systems (AGS), and superhot rock geothermal, which could unlock high-density electricity and heat far beyond conventional resource zones.

Participants aligned on challenges across permitting, funding, communication, and collaboration. More importantly, they voiced a clear willingness to work together. The energy in the room reflected a shared urgency to connect, coordinate, and act.

Early-stage innovation needs a better launchpad

Developers need real-world sites to test tools, improve methods, and validate performance. Participants pointed to Switzerland’s Grimsel Test Site and Bedretto Underground Laboratory as working models. These sites provide controlled environments to run experiments and generate field data before commercial deployment. Europe should prioritise the creation of more geothermal testbeds. Geothermal testbeds should focus on EGS and AGS in challenging environments and enable collaboration across countries and institutions. Without this infrastructure, many technologies will stall in lab conditions. collaboration across countries and institutions. Without this infrastructure, many technologies will stall in lab conditions.

Responsible permitting must be more consistent

Permitting delays block projects across Europe. But developers in the room did not call for deregulation. They called for consistency and transparency. The EU can help by identifying these successful approaches and building a suggested framework for other countries to adopt. Governments struggling with slow or inconsistent processes could implement these models to reduce bottlenecks without weakening oversight or safeguards.

Knowledge flows are disconnected

Most publicly funded geothermal projects do share data, but often only with funders, or buried in reports that don’t reach broader audiences. The current structure of many public programs does not encourage sector-wide learning or cumulative knowledge-building. As a result, key lessons, technical advancements, and performance data stay siloed.

More consistent and practical reporting requirements, linked to real outcomes, would help ensure that public support benefits more than just the individual project. Creating a shared data repository, backed by a clear structure for responsible disclosure, would accelerate learning curves and de-risk future projects.

Public support needs to match market realities

Many of the funding streams available to next-generation geothermal developers are mismatched with the realities of developing these systems. Requirements such as holding a permit before applying for EU funds lock out earlier-stage innovators. The lack of long-term contracts and risk-sharing mechanisms limits private investment.

Participants made the case for a more deliberate structure around funding: clear segments for early-stage research, pilot projects, and scale-up. Dedicated programs for next-generation geothermal, such as EGS, AGS, and superhot rock, should form a central part of that structure.

The EU’s Action Plan needs to back innovation

EU’s upcoming Geothermal Action Plan, expected in early 2026, is a critical moment. The European Commission must follow through with its release. More importantly, it must clearly back the innovation that will determine whether geothermal can scale beyond traditional zones.

This means directly supporting innovation as a central part of this plan. This includes the development of EGS and AGS, and these systems in >400°C conditions in order to ensure there remains a vision and pathway to lower cost geothermal energy. These approaches expand the geographic scope of geothermal and offer firm, clean power, exactly the profile needed for a decarbonised energy system. If the EU sidelines these technologies in its strategy, it risks locking out one of the few scalable options for clean baseload power.

Central and Eastern Europe is already moving. Poland, for example, adopted a national Multi-Year Program in 2022 to integrate geothermal into 114 existing plants and construct 78 new geothermal wells. The plan targets a total capacity of 290 MW by 2040. Over half the PLN 108.5 million investment is backed by national environmental funds.

Given the growing interest and concrete developments across Member States, EU policy must support this momentum with clear and sustained support for geothermal. Poland’s example demonstrates the increasing interest in this technology, which can accelerate the energy transition. Now is the time for the EU to match this local drive with a policy framework prioritising scalability, innovation, and long-term investment.

Europe has the pieces, now it needs to move as a team

Europe has the talent, technology, and motivation to lead on next-generation geothermal, but coordination is still missing. That can change. This roundtable was a first step toward building a more visible and coordinated community of next-generation geothermal leaders in Europe, one that speaks clearly to governments, funders, and the public about what this technology can deliver and what it needs to scale.

About Volcon

Based in the Austin, Texas area, Volcon was founded as the first all-electric power sports company producing high-quality and sustainable electric vehicles for the outdoor community. Volcon electric vehicles are the future of off-roading, not only because of their environmental benefits but also because of their near-silent operation, which allows for a more immersive outdoor experience.

Volcon's vehicle roadmap includes both motorcycles and UTVs. Its first product, the innovative Grunt, began shipping to customers in late 2021 and combines a fat-tired physique with high-torque electric power and a near-silent drive train. The Volcon Grunt EVO, an evolution of the original Grunt with a belt drive, an improved suspension, and seat, began shipping to customers in October 2023. The Brat is Volcon's first foray into the wildly popular eBike market for both on-road and off-road riding and is currently being delivered to dealers across North America. In 2024, Volcon entered the rapidly expanding LUV and UTV market and shipped its first production MN1 unit in October 2024. The new MN1 and HF1 products empower the driver to explore the outdoors in a new and unique way that gas-powered units cannot. They offer the same thrilling performance of a standard LUV / UTV without the noise (or pollution), allowing the driver to explore the outdoors with all their senses.

The latest iteration of the NAS battery system, MODEL L24, was launched in April of last year and announced by NGK and its technology partner, German chemicals company BASF.

At that time, NGK said over 720MW/5,000MWh of sodium-sulfur systems have been deployed across more than 250 locations worldwide since the tech first went onto the market more than 20 years ago.

~6-hour duration Toho Gas project in Mie, Japan

Japanese gas company and utility Toho Gas, which is headquartered in Nagoya, the city where NGK is also headquartered, has just completed a grid-scale NAS battery project.

Tsu Storage Battery Plant is located in Tsu City, Mie Prefecture, in the southwestern part of Japan’s main island, Honshu.

The project has been built at the former site of a liquid natural gas (LNG) terminal and features NAS batteries with 11.4MW output and 69.6MWh storage capacity (~6-hour duration at full rated power).

NGK and Toho Gas announced the project in August 2022, as reported by Energy-Storage.news. At the time, Toho Gas said the batteries would charge at off-peak times or times of abundant renewable energy, and discharge during peaks, helping the company adjust the supply and demand of its operations, while also participating in the growing suite of electricity market opportunities energy storage systems are eligible for.

The project also benefited from Japanese government subsidies designed to promote the adoption of energy storage through the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) Agency for Natural Resources and Energy. The central government scheme supports up to 30% of the Capex investment cost for equipment. Toho Gas’ project was approved during the 2021 financial year (FY2021).

Duke Energy selected NAS battery from more than 80 technologies

Duke Energy’s Emerging Technology Assessment (ETA) team selected the NAS technology for pilot deployment after evaluating more than 80 different options, according to a blog post on the US utility company’s website.

The test project will be installed at Duke’s Suwanne River Power Plant in Florida, which has already had numerous upgrades over the years to add natural gas peaking capacity and solar PV generation.

The utility said the system will be 5MW and 8-hour duration (~40MWh) and designed to evaluate the feasibility of sodium-sulfur as an alternative to lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery energy storage systems (BESS).

Duke said attractive aspects of the technology included the abundance and relatively low cost of sodium and sulfur, as well as the NAS battery’s high energy density.

“This pilot will help us study the technology’s performance, efficiency, and interaction with the grid,” Duke Energy’s project originator and execution developer Matt Gilton said.

Gilton added that findings from the project would be shared with organisations including the US Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Toho-Gas-NGK-Mie.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 11:21:53.960871

“We’re no longer talking about the environment,” Chad Farrell, the founder of Encore Renewable Energy, told the paper.
The Inflation Reduction Act’s energy tax credits were designed to lower pollution and reduce energy costs by bringing more zero-carbon electricity supply onto the U.S. power grid.
This turned out to be an accidentally well-timed intervention in the U.S. energy supply.
The IRA’s energy tax credits have helped make this situation slightly less harrowing by providing more incentives to boost electricity supply.","The economics of building offshore wind in the U.S., at least during this nascent stage, are “entirely dependent” on tax credits, Marguerite Wells, the executive director of Alliance for Clean Energy New York, told me.

That being said, if the bill gets through the Senate and becomes law, Empire Wind may still be safe. The legislation would significantly narrow the window for projects to qualify for tax credits, requiring them to start construction by the end of this year and be operational by the end of 2028. Equinor, the company behind Empire Wind, maintains that it aims to reach commercial operations as soon as 2027. The four other offshore wind projects that are under construction in the U.S. — Sunrise Wind, also serving New York; Vineyard Wind, serving Massachusetts; Revolution Wind, serving Rhode Island and Connecticut; and Dominion Energy’s project in Virginia — are also expected to be completed before the cutoff.

Together, the five wind farms are expected to generate enough power for roughly 2.5 million homes and avoid more than 9 million tons of carbon emissions each year — similar to shutting down 23 natural gas-fired power plants.

Still, this would represent just a small fraction of the carbon-free energy eastern states are counting on offshore wind to provide. New York, for example, has a statutory goal of getting at least 9 gigawatts of power from the industry. Once Empire and Sunrise are completed, it will have just 1.7 gigawatts.

If the proposed changes to the tax credits are enacted, these five projects may be the last built in the U.S.

That’s not the case for solar farms or onshore wind, Oliver Metcalfe, head of wind research at BloombergNEF told me. They can still compete with fossil fuel generation — especially in the windiest and sunniest areas — without tax credits. That’s especially true in today’s environment of rising demand for power, since these projects have the additional benefit of being quick to build. The downside of losing the tax credits is, of course, that the power will cost marginally more than it otherwise would have.

For offshore wind farms to pencil out, however, states would have to pay a much higher price for the energy they produce. The tax credits knock off about a quarter of the price, Metcalfe said; without them, buyers will be back on the hook. “It’s likely that some either wouldn’t be willing to do that, or would dramatically decrease their ambition around the technology given the potential impacts it could have on ratepayers.”

Part of the reason offshore wind is so expensive is that the industry is still new in the U.S. We lack the supply chains, infrastructure, and experienced workforce built up over time in countries like China and the U.K. that have been able to bring costs down. That’s likely not going to change by the time these five projects are built, as they are all relying on European supply chains.

The Inflation Reduction Act spurred domestic manufacturers to begin developing supply chains to serve the next wave of projects, Wells told me. It gave renewable energy projects a 10-year runway to start construction to be eligible for the tax credits. “It was a long enough time window for companies to really invest, not just in the individual generation projects, but also manufacturing, supply chain, and labor chain,” she said.

Due to Trump’s attacks on the industry, the next wave of projects may not materialize, and those budding supply chains could go bust.

Trump put a freeze on offshore wind permitting and leasing on his first day in office, a move that 17 states are now challenging in court. A handful of projects are already fully permitted, but due to uncertainty around Trump’s tariffs — and now, around whether they’ll have access to the tax credits — they’re at a standstill.

“No one’s willing to back a new offshore wind project in today’s environment because there’s so much uncertainty around the future business case, the future subsidies, the future cost of equipment,” Metcalfe said.

That’s going to make the economics of an already financially unsteady industry even more difficult. “Especially given the early stage of the direct air capture industry, transferability is really key,” Giana Amador, the executive director of an industry group called the Carbon Removal Alliance, told me. “Without transferability, most DAC companies won’t be able to fully capitalize upon 45Q — which, of course, threatens the viability of these projects.”

We’re not talking about just a few projects, either. We’re talking about the vast majority, Jessie Stolark, the executive director of another industry group, the Carbon Capture Coalition, told me. “The initial reaction is that this is really bad, and would actually cut off at the knees the utility of the 45Q tax credit,” Stolark said. Out of over 270 carbon capture projects announced as of today, Stolark estimates that fewer than 10 will be able to begin construction in the two years before transferability ends.

The alternative to easily transferable tax credits is a type of partnership between a project developer and a tax equity investor such as a bank. In this arrangement, investors give project developers cash in exchange for an equity stake in their project and their tax credit benefits. Deals like this are common in the renewable energy industry, but because they’re legally complicated and expensive, they’re not really viable for companies that aren’t bringing in a lot of revenue.

Because carbon capture is a much younger, and thus riskier technology than renewables, “tax equity markets typically require returns of 30% or greater from carbon capture and direct air capture project developers,” Stolark told me. That’s a much higher rate than tax equity partners typically require for wind or solar projects. “That out of the gate significantly diminishes the tax credit's value.” Taken together with inflation and high interest rates, all this means that “far fewer projects will proceed to construction,” Stolark said.

One DAC company I spoke with, Bay Area-based Noya, said that now that transferability is out, it has been exploring the possibility of forming tax equity partnerships. “We’ve definitely talked to banks that might be interested in getting involved in these kinds of things sooner than they would have otherwise gotten involved, due to the strategic nature of being partnered with companies that are growing fast,” Josh Santos, Noya’s CEO, told me.

It would certainly be a surprise to see banks — which are generally quite risk averse — lining up behind these kinds of new and unproven technologies, especially given that carbon capture doesn’t have much of a natural market. While CO2 can be used for some limited industrial purposes — beverage carbonation, sustainable fuels, low-carbon concrete — the only market for true carbon dioxide removal is the voluntary market, in which companies, governments, or individuals offset their own emissions by paying companies to remove carbon from the atmosphere. So if carbon capture is going to become a thriving, lucrative industry, it’s likely going to be heavily dependent on future government incentives, mandates, or purchasing commitments. And that doesn’t seem likely to happen in the U.S. anytime soon.

Noya, which is attempting to deploy its electrically-powered, modular direct air capture units beginning in 2027, is still planning on building domestically, though. As Santos told me, he’s eyeing California and Texas as promising sites for the company’s first projects. And while he said that the repeal of transferability will certainly “make things more complicated,” it is not enough of a setback for the company to look abroad.

“45Q is a big part of why we are focused on the U.S. mainly as our deployment site,” Santos explained. “We’ve looked at places like Iceland and the Middle East and Africa for potential deployment locations, and the tradeoff of losing 45Q in exchange for a cheaper something has to be significant enough for that to make sense,” he told me — something like more cost efficient electricity, permitting or installation costs. Preserving 45Q, he told me, means Noya’s long-term project economics are still “great for what we’re trying to build.”

But if companies can’t weather the short-term headwinds, they’ll never be able to reach the level of scale and profitability that would allow them to leverage the benefits of the 45Q credits directly. For many DAC companies such as Climeworks, which built the industry’s largest facility in Iceland, Amador and Stolark said that the domestic policy environment is causing hesitation around expanding in the U.S.

“We are very much at risk of losing our US leadership position in the industry,” Stolark told me. Meanwhile, she said that Canada, China, and the EU are developing policies that are making them increasingly attractive places to build.

As Amador put it, “I think no matter what these projects will be built, it’s just a question of whether the United States is the most favorable place for them to be deployed.”

On Thursday, the Republican majority in the House of Representatives passed their megabill — which is dubbed, for now, the “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” — through the reconciliation process. They did so happily. But much like Obama’s sequestration, this bill is the wrong one for the wrong moment. It would add $3.3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next 10 years. The bill’s next stop is the Senate, where it could change significantly. But if this bill is enacted, it will jack up America’s energy and environmental risks — for relatively little benefit.

It has become somewhat passé for advocates to talk about climate change, as The New York Times observed this week. “We’re no longer talking about the environment,” Chad Farrell, the founder of Encore Renewable Energy, told the paper. “We’re talking dollars and cents.”

Maybe that’s because saying that something “is bad for the climate” only makes it a more appealing target for national Republicans at the moment, who are still reveling in the frisson of their post-Trump victory. But one day the environment will matter again to Americans — and this bill would, in fact, hurt the environment. It will mark a new chapter in American politics: Once, this country had a comprehensive climate law on the books. Then Trump and Republicans junked it.

The Republican megabill will make climate change worse. Within a year or two, the U.S. will be pumping out half a gigaton more carbon pollution per year than it would in a world where the IRA remains on the books, according to energy modelers at Princeton University. Within a decade, it will raise American carbon pollution by a gigaton each year. That is a significant increase. For comparison, the United States is responsible for about 5.2 gigatons of greenhouse gas pollution each year. No matter what happens, American emissions are likely to fall somewhat between now and 2035 — but, still, we are talking about adding at least an extra year’s worth of emissions over the next decade. (Full disclosure: I co-host a podcast, Shift Key, with Jesse Jenkins, the lead author of that Princeton study.)

What does America get for this increase in air pollution? After all, it’s possible to imagine situations where such a surge could bring economic benefits. In this case, though, we don’t get very much at all. Repealing the tax credits will slash $1 trillion from GDP over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan group Energy Innovation. Texas will be particularly hard hit — it could lose up to $100 billion in energy investment. Across the country, household energy costs will rise 2% to 7% by 2035, on top of any normal market-driven volatility, according to the energy research firm the Rhodium Group. The country will become more reliant on foreign oil imports, yet domestic oil production will budge up by less than 1%.

In other words, in exchange for more pollution, Americans will get less economic growth but higher energy costs. The country’s capital stock will be smaller than it would be otherwise, and Americans will work longer hours, according to the Tax Foundation.

But this numbers-driven approach actually understates the risk of repealing the IRA’s tax credits. The House megabill raises two big risks to the economy, as I see it — risks that are moresignificant than the result of any one energy or economic model.

The first is that this bill — its policy changes and its fiscal impact — will represent a double hit to the capacity of America’s energy system. The Inflation Reduction Act’s energy tax credits were designed to lower pollution and reduce energy costs by bringing more zero-carbon electricity supply onto the U.S. power grid. The law didn’t discriminate about what kind of energy it encouraged — it could be solar, geothermal, or nuclear — as long as it met certain emissions thresholds.

This turned out to be an accidentally well-timed intervention in the U.S. energy supply. The advent of artificial intelligence and a spurt of factory building has meant that, in the past few years, U.S. electricity demand has begun to rise for the first time since the 1990s. At the same time, the country’s ability to build new natural gas plants has come under increasing strain. The IRA’s energy tax credits have helped make this situation slightly less harrowing by providing more incentives to boost electricity supply.

Republicans are now trying to remove these tax bonuses in order to finance tax cuts for high-earning households. But removing the IRA alone won’t pay for the tax credits, so they will also have to borrow trillions of dollars. This is already straining bond markets, driving up interest rates for Americans. Indeed, a U.S. Treasury auction earlier this week saw weak demand for $16 billion in bonds, driving stocks and the dollar down while spiking treasury yields.

Higher interest rates will make it more expensive to build any kind of new power plant. At a moment of maximum stress on the grid, the U.S. is going to pull away tax bonuses for new electricity supply and make it more expensive to do any kind of investment in the power system. This will hit wind, solar, and batteries hard; because renewables don’t have to pay for fuel, their cost variability is largely driven by financing. But higher interest rates will also make it harder to build new natural gas plants. Trump’s trade barriers and tariff chaos will further drive up the cost of new energy investment.

Republicans aren’t totally oblivious to this hazard. The House Natural Resource Committee’s permitting reform proposal could reduce some costs of new energy development and encourage greater power capacity — assuming, that is, that the proposal survives the Senate’s byzantine reconciliation rules. But even then, significant risk exists for runaway energy cost chaos. Over the next three years, America’s liquified natural gas export capacity is set to more than double. Trump officials have assumed that America will simply be able to drill for more natural gas to offset a rise in exports, but what if higher interest rates and tariff charges forbid a rise in capacity? A power price shock is not off the table.

So that’s risk No. 1. The second risk is arguably of greater strategic import. As part of their megabill, House Republicans have stripped virtually every demand-side subsidy for electric vehicles from the bill, including a $7,500 tax credit for personal EV purchases. At the same time, Senate Republicans and the Trump administration have gutted state and federal rules meant to encourage electric vehicle sales.

Republicans have kept, for now, some of the supply-side subsidies for manufacturing EVs and batteries. But without the paired demand-side incentives, American EV sales will fall. (The Princeton energy team projects an up to 40% decline in EV sales nationwide.) This will reduce the economic rationale for much of the current buildout in electric vehicle manufacturing and capacity happening across the country — it could potentially put every new EV and battery factory meant to come online after this year out of the money.

This will weaken the country’s economic competitiveness. Batteries are a strategic energy technology, and they will undergird many of the most important general and military technologies of the next several decades. (If you can make an EV, you can make an autonomous drone.) The Trump administration has realized that the United States and its allies need a durable mineral supply chain that can at least parallel China’s. But they seem unwilling to help any of the industries that will actually usethose minerals.

Does this mean that Republicans will kill America’s electric vehicle industry? Not necessarily. But they will dent its growth, strength, and expansion. They will make it weaker and more vulnerable to external interference. And they will increase the risks that the United States simply gives up on ever understanding battery technology and doubles down on internal combustion vehicles — a technology that, like coal-powered naval ships, is destined to lose.

It is, in other words, risky. But that is par for the course for this bill. It is risky to make the power grid so exposed to natural gas price volatility. It is risky to jack up the federal deficit during peacetime for so little gain. It is risky to cede so much demand for U.S.-sourced critical minerals. It is risky to raise interest rates in an era of higher trade barriers, uncertain supply shocks, and geopolitical instability.

This is what worries me most about the Republican megabill: It takes America’s flawed but fixable energy policy and replaces it with, well, a longshot parlay bet that nothing particularly bad will happen anytime soon. Will the Senate take such a bet? Now we find out.

The policy seeks to foster innovation and skill development while promoting battery recycling and reuse to support a circular economy.

The draft policy outlines, an ‘Operational Guidelines for Supply Side Incentives’ would be issued by the Industries Department. The State encourages the establishment of EV battery recycling hubs in strategic locations, prioritizing proximity to battery manufacturing hubs and EV charging infrastructure. Potential locations for these hubs may include the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Pune, Nagpur, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, etc. Through this investment, the state aims to ensure widespread access to charging infrastructure to enable seamless EV operations across both urban and rural areas. Additionally, to promote research and development, A dedicated corpus of Rupees 15 crore will be created under the “CM EV R&D Grant” initiative to fund the R&D activities.

The policy targets EV penetration for:

30% of all new vehicle registrations,

15% of new e-bus registrations, and

10% of new agricultural vehicles, including tractors and combine harvesters.

It also proposes extending EV adoption across six major urban agglomerations—Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Nashik, Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar, and Amravati. The policy will be applicable to 50% of all new vehicle purchases, and 50% of fleet operators and aggregators will be eligible for EV incentives.

Charging Infrastructure Push

To promote EV usage, the state will install EV charging facilities at 25 km intervals along state and national highways. It will also mandate at least one charging station in the parking area of every government office.

To ensure large-scale, high-power charging availability, Maharashtra plans to establish a Viability Gap Funding (VGF) framework to support the installation of DC fast charging stations.

Urban Infrastructure Guidelines

The draft policy proposes regulatory measures to ensure building readiness for EV charging:

The Urban Development Department (UDD) may amend the Development Control Regulations (DCR) to incorporate these provisions.

Upon adoption, No Objection Certificates (NOCs) will be granted to facilities meeting safety norms and technical standards.

Key requirements include:

a. All new residential buildings must be designed to ensure that 100% of parking spaces are EV charging-ready.

b. All new commercial buildings must allocate at least 50% of total parking spaces for EV charging, including wiring and installation provisions.

c. Existing commercial buildings with shared parking must have 20% of total spaces equipped with operational EV charging stations.

d. Every new residential building must provide at least one dedicated community charging point.

e. Existing housing societies must allocate shared EV charging spaces, subject to approval by at least 50% of members, with society management ensuring safety and operational compliance.",https://img.saurenergy.com/2020/12/ev-electric-vehicle.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 11:20:39.223184

If the moment is seized, today's fragmentation could catalyze a more resilient, decentralized clean tech economy.","Within months of each other, both Donald Trump and Ursula von der Leyen began their second terms as President of the United States and President of the European Commission, respectively. As they embark on new political chapters, their economic divergence is casting a long shadow over the future of clean tech.

Under President Trump’s renewed leadership, the U.S. has pivoted away from climate action, turning back to oil and gas. Meanwhile, nearly every link in the international supply chain is now tangled in tariffs, prompting swift retaliatory measures from Canada and China. Once-stable trade relationships are now marked by uncertainty and geopolitical tension.

Still, the outlook for technology development remains bright. The global economy is growing more diversified, perhaps because, and not despite, different regions pursuing divergent approaches to prosperity. The U.S. is doubling down on access to critical minerals and spearheading AI innovation; the EU remains a beacon of climate leadership; China continues its trajectory of unprecedented levels of renewable buildout and manufacturing capacities; and emerging economies across Africa and South America are asserting their place in the global value chain.

Despite rising tensions, each region is vying for leadership in the technologies that will define the next economic and industrial era – hinting that behind the tariffs, there may lie a hidden opportunity for clean tech to scale, compete, and thrive.

Climate Action In Disguise?

The U.S. trade conflict reflects a high-risk strategy to reshape economic terms in the region’s favor. While criticizing clean tech, the Trump Administration has actively championed investment in Artificial Intelligence.

Silicon Valley Bank recently "">reported that 40% of U.S. venture capital in 2024 was directed toward AI, up from just 10% in 2021, a trend expected to continue, with Trump attracting massive AI investments from all over the world.

Often dismissed in climate circles, AI actually holds massive potential for climate mitigation through efficiency gains across sectors. In this sense, attracting AI infrastructure investment can be seen as climate action in disguise.

Similarly, Trump's negotiation with President Zelenskyy, while controversial, led to the U.S.-Ukraine Minerals Deal, a strategic win in diversifying upstream supply chains for technology components currently dominated by China. Despite the optics, this too is a climate-relevant outcome.

However, such wins exist within a broader context of economic fragility.

The Limit Of Blunt Instruments

Originally designed to protect nascent industries, tariffs without complementary tools such as innovation funding, workforce development, and infrastructure investment often do more harm than good.

So, while it is true that the U.S., similar to the EU, is too dependent on imports, the same can be said for exports. For example, in 2024, China supplied 70 percent of all lithium-ion batteries consumed in the U.S. On the flipside, major U.S. states like Texas, California, New York, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, and Michigan each export over $30 billion annually to Chinese, Canadian, and EU markets. These states are now on the frontlines of potential reciprocal tariffs.

Still, Trump's tariff strategy, albeit blunt, does have a goal: to reignite domestic industries like steel and auto manufacturing. But without a long-term plan for sustainable growth, the policy risks turning inward at a moment when global cooperation is essential.

The contrast with Biden's approach is stark. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) showcased how policy can attract investors and manufacturers while being coupled with targeted tariffs and support mechanisms like the CHIPS Act. Between Q3 2022 and Q1 2025, a total of 380 clean technology manufacturing facilities were announced, nearly half of which were operational as of March 31 2025. This represents a five-fold increase in investments in clean manufacturing, from $2.5 billion in Q3 2022 to $14 billion in Q1 2025.

Yet, due to the Trump Administration’s funding freeze, combined with its approach to tariffs, a total of $6.9 billion of investments were cancelled – the highest value of quarterly cancellations on record. What’s more, the new budget bill which passed the House of Representatives, could effectively halt the US clean energy manufacturing boom.

The irony here should not be overlooked. Of the $289 billion invested in the clean tech manufacturing facilities, 77% went to Republican led districts. Thus, they have become the biggest beneficiaries of clean energy investment. And since President Trump is well known for being a dealmaker, renewable energy – with its falling costs and growing strategic importance – may well turn out to be the best deal on offer.

A Model For Stability Amid Volatility

While U.S. policy undergoes significant overhaul, the EU has spent decades preparing for a sustainable economic transition. That preparation has sometimes been a challenge for industry, but it has also laid solid groundwork. Decarbonization targets are binding. Renewable energy deployment is accelerating. Emissions are priced through the ETS. And carbon leakage is being addressed via the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).

Now, the EU is aligning trade and climate goals, using tools like carbon pricing to create a level playing field without isolating itself.

For U.S.-based investors and innovators navigating political unpredictability at home, Europe increasingly stands out as a stable, rules-based market with long-term industrial clarity.

An Historic Opportunity For Clean Tech

Europe’s deliberative policymaking offers something rare in today’s climate: predictability. Combined with a cooperative stance toward China, the U.S., and emerging blocs like Mercosur and the African Union, the EU remains a pragmatic and reliable partner.

At the same time, behind the smokescreen of U.S. tariffs and retaliatory measures lies an unexpected upside. In the race to reshape supply chains, secure resources, and dominate future-defining technologies, climate progress may emerge not despite geopolitical tensions, but because of them.

Patty Murray, D-Wash., faced off with Energy Secretary Chris Wright about the Hanford budget.

The hearing with the new energy secretary was called by the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee on Wednesday to discuss the Trump administration’s fiscal 2026 budget request for the Department of Energy.

But Murray, told Wright that the energy department’s Office of Environmental Management had not released money for work under the current fiscal 2025 budget that Congress appropriated.

On March 15, President Trump signed the fiscal 2025 budget resolution for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, 2024, with a spending plan required by law within 45 days, Murray reminded Wright.

But DOE had not yet given that plan to Congress, which needs to know where the money is being spent, Murray said.

“Hanford site is on the brink of having to lay off subcontractors and restart an entire procurement process on an important project because they are being directed now to hold off on implementing projects at FY’25 spend levels,” she said at the hearing.

Murray is the vice chairperson of the Senate Appropriations Committing and the ranking member of the subcommittee holding the hearing.

Funds for Hanford waste disposal

DOE responded the next day by releasing money for the Environmental Restoration Disposal Facility at Hanford, which had subcontract work that was reportedly most immediately at risk.

The lined landfill in the center of Hanford has been used since 1996 to dispose of more than 19 million tons of waste from environmental cleanup at the nuclear reservation.

It accepts low level radioactive waste and hazardous chemical waste, that includes contaminated soil, debris from demolished buildings and debris from burial grounds that do not meet modern environmental standards.

Waste is disposed of in cells, which are added as needed.

This summer, work is planned to start on adding an 11th cell, called a super cell because it is twice the size of the landfill’s first eight cells.

It will be 2,000 feet long and 1,000 feet wide and hold about 2.8 million cubic yards of waste, providing disposal capacity to allow environmental cleanup to continue.

While money was released for the ERDF subcontract, Murray indicated during the hearing that it was not the only Hanford subcontract at risk due to money appropriated by Congress for the current year not released.

DOE provided no information last week to the Tri-City Herald on subcontracts potentially at risk.

Flat Hanford budget inadequate

For the fiscal 2026 DOE budget, DOE has released only limited information

Hanford is called out in the budget as the only cleanup site that the Trump administration proposes giving steady funding, while 13 other DOE sites and the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico are targeted for cuts totaling $389 million.

A flat budget for Hanford “has serious repercussions,” Murray told Wright.

In January, DOE and the Washington state Department of Ecology finalized an agreement on treating tank waste after nearly four years of negotiations.

But flat funding means the only way to meet deadlines in the new plan for preparing and treating high level radioactive waste for disposal would be to pull money from other Hanford cleanup priorities, Murray said.

That “would have ripple effects for workers carrying out critical projects across the site and ultimately would delay remediation along the Columbia River,” Murray said. “That is unacceptable. We cannot rob Peter to pay Paul.”

Long-term plans for Hanford cleanup outlined in the 2025 Hanford Lifecycle Scope, Schedule and Cost Report call for increasing annual spending at Hanford by billions of dollars to finish most remaining environmental cleanup as early as 2085 at a cost ranging from $364 billion to $589 billion.

Wright criticizes ‘political science’

Other DOE programs that impact research at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory would have deep cuts under the Trump administration’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget, Murray said.

“Your budget slashes $1.1 billion from the Office of Science,” Murray said to Wright. “Who is telling you that we should cede ground to China in the race for innovation and lay off scientists at our national labs?”

That spending reduction will undermine research projects, including in areas that are key for the national lab in Richland, for artificial intelligence, quantum computing and nuclear energy, she said.

But Wright responded that the $1.1 billion cut would not impact important research, including in fundamental basic science, fusion and quantum computing.

“The problem is the labs drifted into things that are not fundamental basic science — that are political science,” he said.

He named “a crazy range of things on climate change” as an example.

Sen. Murray says calls not returned

Murray called out Wright in the hearing for not responding to Congressional questions on staffing and other issues and not spending money as directed in budgets approved by Congress.

At a House subcommittee hearing May 7 Wright said he received too many requests for information and briefings from Congress to have time to respond. But he said he would be happy to take phone calls from Congress.

But Murray said not only was she not getting written responses, but he has not been returning her calls.

It took a month and a half for her to get a call scheduled, and the seven letters she and colleagues have sent him over the past several months requesting information were ignored until the day before the Senate subcommittee hearing, she said.

Wright said at the House subcommittee hearing that less than a thousand workers had left DOE since he became energy secretary.

That was untrue, Murray said.

“We know over 3,500 DOE employees have taken the so-called buyout that you offered and we know you fired 500 more,” she said.

She also pressed him on a statement that no contracts have been canceled “when you have plainly canceled electric vehicle and low-income energy assistant grants in Colorado,” she said.

“And it is false for you to say there are no unpaid invoices, when we have heard from organizations still waiting on payments, including hydrogen hubs, which have unpaid invoices,” Murray said.",https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/bfq9h8/picture306771886/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/72e63f57-a69e-45ed-b19c-827c35b97745,N,,2025-05-27 10:10:46.240220

Latin America will now not have any new coal projects coming up. This development comes after Brazil and Honduras scrapped their plans of opening two new coal plants this year, according to a report by Global Energy Monitor.

Last week, Honduras announced that it was joining the Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA), a coalition of governments and others committed to transitioning away from coal, signalling an intent to not invest in coal anymore.

In other words, the country’s last coal plant proposal — the 0.1 GW Puente Alto Energy power station — will be shelved. According to GEM, there hasn’t been any development at Brazil’s last active coal plant proposal — the 0.6 GW Pedra Altas power station — since the licensing work completed in 2023. This can also be considered as shelved.

GEM’s data points that the scrapping of these two coal plants means that there has been an overall collapse of 18 plants totaling 7.3 GW of capacity proposed in 2015.

More importantly, Latin America now seems to follow UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres’s 2019 call for “no new coal,” which calls for the cancelling of all unabated coal proposals not already under construction.

All eyes on Brazil

Even though Brazil hasn’t proposed any new coal plants, it also hasn’t joined the PPCA, therefore its stance on this matter is still hanging in the balance. If it does join the PPCA, it would be a clear-cut signal that it will not build any new coal plants.

According to GEM’s report, another worrying phenomenon is that the coal-generated power in Brazil is heavily subsidised. Just two coal plants received over R$5 billion (Brazilian real) between 2020 to 2024, and these costs are ultimately borne by the Brazilian people.

GEM’s report also found that there are also no new coal plants proposed in Brazil’s national energy auctions this year, with a decrease in coal power generation projected through 2034 in the country’s most recent 10-year energy plan.

“It is crucial for Brazil to formally join the PPCA, especially amid intense pressure from Congress advocating for coal and gas subsidies to be extended until 2050. As this year’s COP host, we cannot miss the opportunity to officially commit to no new coal,” said Juliano Bueno de Araujo, presiding director at Arayara.

Latin America following Paris Agreement guidelines

According to the report, the Latin America region is close to achieving the 1.5°C target of the Paris Climate Agreement, if it stays on course. Meeting the Agreement goals requires phasing out unabated coal power globally by 2040, following the IEA’s Net Zero scenario.

If one looks at planned retirements and phaseout commitments, over 60% or 10 GW of the region’s 16.3 GW of operating coal power capacity is scheduled to come offline by 2040, found the report.

The only anomaly is Argentina’s Río Turbio power station, the report noted. The lone coal plant is still under construction. The project is not only long-delayed, but also faces technical difficulties, cost overruns, and allegations of corruption, according to the report.

“Honduras is signaling a decisive shift away from coal. The country is an example for others in Latin America that a coal-free future is possible. The baton is now being passed to Brazil. Brazil is in a prime position to lead the charge in the global coal-to-clean energy transition – and help keep the Paris Climate Agreement on track,” said Christine Shearer, project manager at Global Energy Monitor.

“If we are serious about an America-first energy strategy, then we need serious investments in our energy future from both the private and the public sectors.

“Here in Pennsylvania, the impact of this legislation cannot be overstated. Billions of dollars in private sector investment in Pennsylvania’s two regional hydrogen hub projects are now at risk, along with the tens of thousands of good paying jobs the hubs are estimated to create, as a result of the repeal of the hydrogen tax credit. Efforts to reinvigorate nuclear power in the state – including restarting the former Three Mile Island Unit 2 – could be snuffed out, because of the proposed repeal of the nuclear production tax credit and the elimination of the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office.

Electrical generation by the combination of all renewables in March alone reached a new record and provided almost one-third (31.9%) of total U.S. electrical generation.","The latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reveals that the mix of renewable energy sources produced over one-quarter of the nation’s electrical generation in the first three months of 2025 and provided nearly one-third of total U.S. electrical generation in March specifically.

Utility-scale solar expanded by 43.9% while estimated small-scale/rooftop solar PV increased by 11.1% during the first quarter of 2025 compared to same period in 2024. The combination of utility-scale and small-scale solar increased by over one-third (33.7%) and was almost 6.8% of total U.S. electrical generation for January through March — up from 5.3% a year earlier. This means solar-generated electricity surpassed the output of the nation’s hydropower plants (5.7%).

Moreover, in March alone, electrical generation by utility-scale solar increased by 45.6% while that from small-scale systems rose by 13.0%. Combined, they provided 9.1% of the nation’s electrical output during the month. This is based on a review of the data by the SUN DAY Campaign.

Wind also got off to a strong start in 2025, producing 9.5% more electricity in the first three months of 2025 than the year before. That output was nearly one-eighth (12.2%) of total U.S. electrical generation and more than double that produced by the nation’s hydropower plants. In March alone, wind-generated electricity increased by 11.1% and provided over one-seventh (14.8%) of the nation’s electricity supply.

In the first quarter of 2025, electrical generation by wind plus utility-scale and small-scale solar provided nearly one-fifth (19.0%) of the U.S. total, up from 17.0% during the first three months of 2024. In just the month of March, solar plus wind accounted for almost one-fourth (23.9%) of U.S. electrical output.

During the first three months of this year, the combination of wind and solar provided 6.8% more electricity than did coal and 6.0% more than the nation’s nuclear power plants. In March alone, the gap increased significantly when solar + wind outproduced coal and nuclear power by 66.5% and 31.0%, respectively.

The mix of all renewables produced 10.5% more electricity in Q1 than they did a year ago (12.5% more in March alone) and provided over one-quarter (26.1%) of total U.S. electricity production compared to 24.8% one year earlier. Electrical generation by the combination of all renewables in March alone reached a new record and provided almost one-third (31.9%) of total U.S. electrical generation. Moreover, for the first time, it came close to that of natural gas (34.8%) whose electrical output dropped by 8.9%.

The mix of renewables has strengthened its position as the second largest source of electrical generation, behind only natural gas — with the gap closing rapidly.

“Renewable energy sources, led by solar and wind, are clearly outpacing fossil fuels and nuclear power,” noted the SUN DAY Campaign’s executive director Ken Bossong. “It therefore defies logic that the Trump Administration and the Republican Congress would be making efforts to curtail that growth in favor of dirtier and more expensive technologies.”

(NYSE: OKLO), an advanced nuclear technology company, announced today that it has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP), a leader in nuclear operation and construction. The agreement outlines plans to collaborate on the development and global deployment of Oklo’s advanced nuclear technology.

Under the MOU, KHNP and Oklo intend to explore opportunities to jointly advance the standard design development and verification of Oklo’s planned Aurora powerhouse. The parties also plan to cooperate on early-stage project development efforts, including manufacturability assessments and planning of major equipment, supply chain development for balance of plant systems, and constructability assessments and planning.

Oklo plans to deploy its 75 MWe Aurora powerhouse at the Idaho National Laboratory site and is currently advancing through the licensing process. The company is engaged with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission in a Pre-Application Readiness Assessment and intends to submit a formal Combined License Application (COLA) later this year. Oklo also plans to file follow-on applications to support its growing order pipeline, which exceeds 14 GW. Unlike the traditional approach, which requires separate construction and operating licenses, the COLA allows both to be granted simultaneously, streamlining the overall licensing process.

“We’ve recently completed site characterization borehole drilling for our first commercial powerhouse and are preparing for construction, with commercialization as a top priority,” said Jacob DeWitte, Co-Founder and CEO of Oklo. “Partnering with KHNP, one of the most accomplished nuclear builders in the world, who have been building nuclear power plants continuously since 1971, offers meaningful opportunities to align on key execution factors such as manufacturability, constructability, and supply chain development. Their experience in delivering projects at scale can complement our efforts and help us move more efficiently toward commercialization and the ability to build future powerhouses faster.”

KHNP CEO Whang Ju-ho stated, “KHNP is focusing on developing its innovative domestic advanced nuclear technology, the i-SMR, to achieve world-class competitiveness. In addition to enhancing safety, successful entry into the advanced nuclear market requires cooperation with leading technology firms. By combining the strengths of KHNP and Oklo, we expect to create strong synergy in the design, construction, and operation of advanced nuclear technology.”

About Oklo Inc.: Oklo Inc. is developing fast fission power plants to deliver clean, reliable, and affordable energy at scale; establishing a domestic supply chain for critical radioisotopes; and advancing nuclear fuel recycling to convert nuclear waste into clean energy. Oklo was the first to receive a site use permit from the U.S. Department of Energy for a commercial advanced fission plant, was awarded fuel material from Idaho National Laboratory, and submitted the first custom combined license application for an advanced reactor to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Oklo is also developing advanced fuel recycling technologies in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. National Laboratories.

The Chesapeake Bay Journal

As Crisfield Mayor Darlene Taylor sees it, the low-lying Maryland town has no future unless it can hold back rising water. Computer models suggest that the adjacent Chesapeake Bay could get high enough by 2050 to trigger daily floods that are deep enough to stall cars on roads.

Hope arrived in the form of a federal grant program created during the first Trump administration under the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program helped rural communities like hers to invest in massive projects to fight disaster threats, ranging from wildfires to floods.

Crisfield officially got word from FEMA last July that it had secured $36 million from the program to launch the first phase of its massive flood-protection initiative. “Everything had lined up and everything was in place for this to be a highly successful project,” Taylor said.

A lot has changed since then. Trump returned to office in January, vowing to drastically shrink the size of the federal government. In a terse April 4 press statement, FEMA announced it was pulling the plug on the disaster-preparedness funding, not just for Crisfield but for all applicants and grantees, calling it “wasteful and ineffective,” though without citing evidence to support those claims.

The administration announced that any undistributed funds from the program’s inaugural year, 2020, through 2023 would be returned to the Disaster Relief Fund or the U.S. Treasury. The agency also canceled the 2024 funding opportunity, just days before the application deadline for that year’s $750 million allocation.

The reversal has left hundreds of communities nationwide scrambling to find alternative sources for the billions of dollars they had been promised. Among the six states and the District of Columbia in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, BRIC grants had been on track to disburse nearly $1 billion across about 350 applications, according to a Bay Journal analysis of FEMA’s database.

Among the region’s losses: $32 million to restore wetlands along the Patapsco River’s Middle Branch near Baltimore; $2.7 million to acquire 21 flood-prone properties in Scranton, Pennsylvania; and $20 million toward finishing a floodwall in Washington, D.C., around the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant, the largest sewage plant in the Bay watershed.

And, of course, there’s Crisfield. With an annual budget of just $4 million, the town of 2,500 residents can’t afford to fight sea level rise without financial help from beyond its borders, Taylor said.

“We’re pretty much devastated,” she added. “Without this, we know that we will be in a really bad position to protect our citizens, protect our property, protect our community and really protect our way of life.”

Wasteful?

The FEMA announcement described the program as “more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters.” Many experts contend the opposite is true.

Recent studies suggest that investments in flood hazard mitigation yield a return of up to $8 in benefits for every $1 spent, according to the Association of State Floodplain Managers. Chad Berginnis, the association’s executive director, acknowledged that the BRIC program had flaws, but said it was making important strides in warding off disasters.

“I don’t [doubt that we] have debt issues in this country, but I take very strong exception to the FEMA press release that characterizes this program as wasteful and ineffective,” he said. “Those are just flat-out lies.”

Berginnis said he largely agreed with the findings of a recent Republican-led task force’s report, which called for reforming the BRIC program. The 61-page report offered a broad range of recommendations to improve the nation’s overall disaster response and preparedness efforts.

Among them: creating a pathway for smaller communities to obtain BRIC grants, so they don’t have to compete against “coastal elites” who have access to caravans of consultants and grant writers. During the 2023 grant year alone, about 75% of the program’s funding benefited such “high capacity” applicants, according to the report.

But the report was notable also for what it didn’t say, Berginnis pointed out. It didn’t say anything about getting rid of BRIC.

‘The water doesn’t care’

The BRIC program was established by Congress through the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018, which Trump signed into law in October of that year. Beginning in 2020, applicants could receive up to $50 million for projects designed to help communities reduce their exposure to catastrophes.

Such “pre-disaster” funding, backers say, is necessary now more than ever with climate change exacerbating a variety of threats and driving up the costs of “post-disaster” spending.

The abrupt cancellation of the program has drawn strong criticism, especially from Democratic lawmakers.

“When we talk about government cuts to environmental programs, I will caution that rising seas don’t care who is in the White House,” said Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd). “The water doesn’t care how a small town that experiences 90 days of flooding or more a year voted in the last election. Flooding will continue to devastate communities, even if the president does not believe in climate change.”

Some Republicans, while supportive of Trump in general, appeared to be quietly working to get the president to change his mind and restore at least some funding.

“We were made aware of this cancellation in funds and are reaching out to the appropriate federal agencies for a better understanding of this decision,” said Rep. Andy Harris’s (R-1st) office in a statement. Harris, Maryland’s only Republican congressman, chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, and his district includes Crisfield.

His office noted that Harris had written a letter in support of Crisfield when the community was applying for BRIC funding. Harris remains “supportive of the city’s need to become more safe, resilient and prosperous by reducing the negative impacts of flooding,” according to the statement.

Because of the sluggish manner in which FEMA disburses funding, some of the grants now being canceled date back to the program’s inaugural year in 2020. In many cases, communities have already expended millions of their own dollars designing, engineering and permitting projects that now may never see the light of day, Berginnis said.

For multiphase projects, FEMA said its regional offices will work with applicants on previously obligated projects to determine what it called the “best path forward,” adding that “this may include ending the project after the completion of Phase 1 or at another appropriate stopping point.”

In the April 16 FEMA memo, the administration also cited BRIC’s purported failure to produce “concrete results” and the distribution of the “majority of funding … to only a few states.”

Community impacts

From small-town mayors to state emergency management coordinators, officials have reacted to the administration’s action with shock and disbelief.

“I don’t know what facts they are looking at to call this [program] wasteful,” said Maryland Secretary of Emergency Management Russell Strickland. “I know of nothing in Maryland that I would call wasteful.”

His agency estimates that communities across the state stand to lose more than $80 million across 26 applications that were in FEMA’s approval pipeline. The impact remains “undetermined” for $8.7 million that was allocated to 17 projects but hadn’t been spent as of the April 4 announcement.

Meanwhile, 31 Maryland-based applications for the 2024 funding year were dropped. Those $70 million in requests would have included $36 million for the second phase of Crisfield’s flood project and $16 million for a long-planned effort to fight frequent flooding in Cambridge, another Eastern Shore community struggling to transition its economy from seafood to tourism.

“We’re in a holding patten now,” Strickland said, adding that he hopes Congress and the administration work together to create a replacement for BRIC. He also is waiting to see whether Maryland and other states take legal action to overturn the decision.

The South Baltimore Gateway Partnership, along with other partners, has raised $67 million to restore the first phase of what will ultimately be 11 miles of the shoreline along the Middle Branch of the Patapsco River. BRIC funding accounted for about $32 million of that total. About $5 million has been used for designing the project, but the rest stands to be clawed back, said Brad Rogers, the partnership’s executive director.

So, Rogers said, the wetlands to be added along the shore by MedStar Harbor Hospital will be scaled back from 12.3 acres to 8 acres. And instead of simultaneously launching another project at the BGE Spring Gardens campus in Ridgely’s Cove, that phase will be delayed until more funds are raised.

“We are saddened that the federal construction funds won’t be available going forward, but we are confident this will still be a terrific project,” Rogers said. “We’re not being deterred. We’re just moving forward on a slightly different timeline.”

In Virginia, the affected projects included $12 million to upgrade Richmond’s water treatment plant and $24 million to repair and modernize Portsmouth’s Lake Meade Dam, which holds back the city’s main drinking water reservoir.

In Pennsylvania, outcry followed the cancellation of FEMA’s $2.5 million award to the city of Scranton to acquire 21 flood-prone properties and demolish 18 homes standing on them. The properties were set to be repurposed into infrastructure to help prevent future flooding, city officials say.

“You have people that are in limbo,” Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti said. “Going forward, we are always going to have natural disasters. It’s absolutely untenable that cities and municipalities won’t have access to federal dollars to fend off and prevent [them] but also prepare.”

Many of the places impacted by the program’s cancellation abound with Republican voters. For example, in Crisfield’s main voting precinct, Trump won a 56% margin of victory in last November’s election.

Plans there call for installing a tidal flood barrier that will surround most of the city as well as adding sewers, pump stations, water-retention facilities, tide gates and wetlands. The goal is to ensure protection from up to 5 feet of flooding above ground level — akin to the inundation from Superstorm Sandy in 2012.

Several residents recently completed coursework in a “resilience academy” program, hosted by the city and several partners. As part of their final project, three younger residents — all under 20 years old — pitched a plan to share knowledge with a “sister city” facing similar flooding issues.

“I live in this area,” said Emily Napier, indicating a point on the map near downtown, “and we flood on a daily basis.”

Dennis Marshall was on hand to collect his wife’s certificate in her absence. He owns a vacation rental in town that he says could benefit from the project.

“People come down here, and if they have to wear boots, they aren’t coming back,” he said. But Marshall added he is far from confident that the flood project, if built, would deliver the results it promises. “If it works, it’s fine,” he noted. “That’s the problem.”

Does he regret voting for Trump now that the Republican president has nixed the city’s massive windfall? “I think if he did it, he did it for a reason,” said Marshall, clad in a black Trump T-shirt.

Barbara Mete, another enrollee in the three-month resilience academy, moved to Crisfield about six years ago after retiring from a job in New York. She hoped the course would give her a deeper appreciation for her new home and the estuary at its doorstep. In the wake of the loss of funding, she is deeply concerned about her community’s future, she said.

Her message to Trump and FEMA? “Please think about the people who live here and the children that will come after your administration,” Mete said. “Nature is the key. If we take care of her, she will take care of us.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/6823846caf447.image-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 09:07:08.055456

Ever since, solar energy has been established as a firm pillar of carving out a future for the present industries within the country. High wind of electricity costs, global climate obligations, and possible incentives at the policy level make solar not just a green option but a competitive advantage for the factories of tomorrow in India.

Rising Energy Demand in Manufacturing

Being an intensive consumer of electricity, manufacturing, and production in India have been subject to higher prices and cost increases. With the initiation of Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes in various sectors like electronics, pharma, textiles, and others, a further increase in demand of 5-6% yearly is foreseen.

At the same time, such conventional sources do keep posing their issues: with coal-based electricity, the conditions are the prices that can fluctuate and are also subject to logistical problems, regulatory issues regarding environmental concerns. Against this background, solar energy is gaining a foothold as a clean, scalable source of power for industrial units.

India’s Solar Surge

India has made beautiful strides so far in solar capacity. As of March 2025, India’s solar power installed capacity had reached 73.31 GW, an enormous surge from just 2.6 GW in 2014. Solar capacity of 292 GW is targeted by the government for the year 2030 under its renewable energy roadmap. Growth is provided via big solar parks and smaller rooftops. Manufacturing units, particularly MSMEs in industrial clusters, are opting more and more for captive solar installations, thereby reducing operational costs.

Economic Benefits for Factories

The move to solar power provides strong financial incentives. A 1 MW rooftop solar concept can make nearly 1.4 million units of electricity in a year; this, in turn, brings potential savings of 1 crore every year, depending on the site and areas in the tariff. Such systems have a payback of 3-5 years; thereafter, electricity is considered virtually free for at least 20 more years of system life.

It also serves as an escape from outages and fuel cost fluctuations, and traditional grid-based power or diesel generation. Also, solar integration helps export-oriented manufacturers with ESG compliance and improves competitiveness in the international markets where the carbon footprint is getting attention.

Government Policies and Incentives

Multiple policy mechanisms have been introduced in India to nurture solar adoption in the industrial sector. Accelerated Depreciation: Business houses can claim depreciation up to 40% in the first year for solar assets. Solar Park Scheme and PM-KUSUM are targeted toward scaling solar in rural and semi-urban areas where many small factories exist.

With Green Open Access Rules being announced in 2022, the industries are to be able to procure renewable energy straight from the developer, thus reducing dependence on Discoms and achieving price efficiency.

Challenges and Road Ahead

These, though, remain promising times, yet challenges are there to be faced. High upfront capital cost, land acquisition for huge plants, and variability in state-level regulations stand as hurdles before integrating solar systems at a fast pace. The shortage of skilled manpower for solar system installation and maintenance remains acute, especially in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities.

Converging efforts from policymakers, financiers, and industry associations need to come together to tackle these issues. Though innovative finance models such as RESCO and green bonds are gaining traction, there is still a lot of scope for mass awareness and adoption.

Conclusion

No longer a distant dream, the convergence of energy sustainability with industrial growth is unfolding along the length and breadth of manufacturing corridors across India. Solar power offers a natural, economic, and green solution to energise forthcoming factories. As the first seeds of this paradigm are being sown, the reducing cost and evolving technology shall ensurethat at no point in history should India’s dream of a solar-powered world manufacturing be far-fetched.",https://timestech.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-design-2025-05-27T111357.623.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 10:10:36.592285

Under the newly elected government, Energy Minister Tim Hodgson has set out plans to identify and fast-track various renewable energy projects over the next 2 years. A Major Federal Projects office will be created to simplify the process of obtaining permits for clean energy projects. Hodgson stated that this would improve efficiency leading to ‘less red tape, more certainty, better outcomes.’

The government will focus on specific technologies such as hydrogen, geothermal, biofuels and nuclear as they are scalable and exportable. An importance will also be placed on the integration of electricity grids with Hodgson saying, “A pan-Canadian grid means more reliable, affordable, sustainable power for Canadians. It means powering industries from AI to manufacturing. And it means exporting energy between provinces who want Canadian solutions.”

A report from April 2025 has also highlighted significant wind power opportunities in the Atlantic Canada region, which will help to drive this clean energy growth. This area has some of the world’s greatest onshore and offshore wind resources and projects here could generate thousands of jobs. An existing skilled workforce makes the region well-placed to succeed with these wind projects.

Earlier this year Canada joined the Global Offshore Wind Alliance (GOWA) to help expand their wind power market. The alliance was launched in 2022 at COP27 and the members states aim to install a total capacity of 380 GW of wind power by 2030.

Potential provisions deal with incentives for renewable power, energy efficiency regulations, nuclear power, data centers and more.","Customers around Illinois will see significantly higher prices on their electric bills next month.

The average residential customer of northern Illinois’ Commonwealth Edison will pay about $10.60 per month more this summer, according to a company statement. Downstate Ameren Illinois says customers can expect an 18% to 22% increase in their monthly bill, or about $45 per month depending on usage. Prices will likely decrease in October once winter electric rates go into effect.

Increasing energy prices are causing alarm among some consumer advocates and state policymakers, who worry that the long-term problems underlying the rising costs could lead to even higher prices or rolling blackouts.

Clara Summers, who advocates for consumer-friendly energy policy on behalf of the nonprofit Citizens Utility Board, said the ComEd price increases were for two reasons: increasing demand from data centers and large manufacturing as well as procedural issues slowing down new renewable projects.

CUB officials said the issues underlying Ameren’s increase were similar, while noting that both were due in part to the way grid regulators structure pricing.

The price hikes are a major undercurrent of escalating tensions over a package of energy reforms making its way through Springfield as lawmakers race toward their scheduled May 31 adjournment.

“We’re trying to keep prices low while combating climate change,” Jen Walling, head of the Illinois Environmental Council, told Capitol News Illinois. The IEC has been heavily involved in advocating for parts of the bill.

In December, federal officials at the North American Electric Reliability Corporation — the nonprofit oversight agency for grid operators — designated the grid for central and southern Illinois as “high risk” for not having enough electricity to meet demand on hot days in the summer and cold days in the winter over the next five years. The grid that stretches from central Canada to the Mississippi river delta is the only power grid in the nation to have that designation, with much of its risk stemming from power plants closing.

Illinois’ northern grid, which includes parts of 13 states and Washington, D.C. from Illinois to the east coast, faces “elevated” risk. That means extreme weather events are “likely” to cause shortfalls in energy reserves.

The increased demand stems from data centers, increasing adoption of electric heat pumps and the rise of electric vehicles, according to NERC.

David Braun, an executive at the energy technology company Intelligent Generation, said demand on the electric grid is the highest it’s been in the 30 years he’s worked in the energy sector.

“We haven’t seen this in a long time,” Braun told Capitol News Illinois. “So, it’s catching planners by surprise, and it takes a long time to build power plants.”

Shrinking supply

That demand, according to NERC’s December report, is coming at the same time supply is going down — increasing pressure on the grid.

Around the country, fossil fuel plants are closing as states move to limit their greenhouse gas emissions. While Illinois exports energy overall, plant closures elsewhere in the country can affect the price of energy, raising prices for Illinoisans. Grid operators nationwide, meanwhile, face yearslong red tape-induced backlogs on new renewables.

Downstate Illinois’ grid might run out of energy reserves as soon as 2034, per NERC. Northern Illinois’ grid has more reserves but will face decreased levels throughout the next decade. If nothing is done to either reduce demand or increase supply, this means prices could continue to increase or blackouts could become necessary to stabilize the grid.

To address these issues, lawmakers in Springfield are weighing sweeping energy legislation. The bill’s proponents say its provisions to incentivize new developments are the only way to prevent serious problems without walking back the state’s climate goals.

Republican critics contend that the main reason for the legislation is to fix problems with the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. Gov. JB Pritzker’s marquee climate policy, they say, is a major cause of the supply shortfalls because it requires fossil fuel-burning power plants to shut down by 2045.

Others say provisions aimed at reducing data centers’ energy demands on the grid will hurt businesses in the state.

Lawmakers and advocacy groups are currently reviewing draft language for the bill, which has not been made public. Even with complex procedural maneuvering to avoid long-passed deadlines, lawmakers face a tight turnaround to reach an agreement before the legislative session ends.

The process could have become more complicated, some suggest, after the U.S. House passed a wide-ranging bill early Thursday that could drastically alter federal energy incentives if it becomes law.

Higher prices

Bills for customers of private electric utilities — most notably ComEd and Ameren — will go up in June.

The increase was determined at two recent capacity auctions, which are how grid operators set energy prices for years into the future. High prices at these auctions can indicate low supply relative to demand.

PJM Interconnection, the grid operator for northern Illinois, saw a roughly eight-fold jump in its most recent capacity auction compared to the year prior. Downstate’s energy grid, Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, saw more than a 20-fold year-over-year price jump at its capacity auction in April.

Representatives of the state’s two largest electric utilities stressed that these increases occurred beyond their purview.

“ComEd does not profit from this increase, was not part of the auction, does not supply capacity, and does not retain any proceeds of the capacity charge payments,” ComEd spokesperson John Schoen said in a statement.

An Ameren spokesperson echoed the sentiment, noting that the state requires utilities to pass this type of cost to customers “dollar-for-dollar, without markup.”

The price is lower for ComEd customers than it could have been due to a provision in CEJA, which credits customers when energy generated by nuclear power plants is above a certain level. Consumer watchdogs at CUB estimate that the policy cut the increase for ComEd customers by about 17%. Customers in the Ameren area, which has much less nuclear power, are not eligible for the credit.

Other energy providers

While millions of Illinoisans get their power from ComEd and Ameren, some get their electricity through other means, including alternate retail suppliers, municipal utilities and electric cooperatives. Many of these energy suppliers are not affected directly by the capacity auctions.

Municipal customers in towns like Naperville, St. Charles and Rantoul are largely insulated from the spike, according to Staci Wilson, the head of government affairs for the Illinois Municipal Electric Agency. The IMEA is a private entity that provides electricity to 32 of the 42 municipal electric systems in the state.

IMEA sometimes participates in capacity auctions. But Wilson said the agency tends to secure energy through other means, such as having ownership stakes directly in power plants.

“IMEA member municipalities have rates that are currently lower than private utilities and our ownership model continues to gain value as we transition to a carbon-free future in an affordable and reliable manner,” Wilson said.

But other municipal utility officials, including those at Springfield’s City Water, Light and Power, are less optimistic about future prices.

“Regulations are forcing plant retirement a little too soon,” CWLP spokesperson Amber Sabin said. “And the grid operators that are here, they have resources that they can’t connect to the grid. They’re waiting, or they don’t get financing or ever developed. They have supply chain issues, workforce issues, right? There’s a cost to all of that.”

CWLP didn’t participate in the recent MISO auction, although it could have. The utility shut down several coal-fired generators over the past five years but continues to operate one coal-fired power plant on the southeast side of Springfield. That plant will need to shut down permanently at some point in the next two decades under state law.

“In the future, all the costs are going to go up,” Sabin said. “We do expect that capacity auction prices will affect our customers.”

That echoes what some state officials expect as well. Sen. Bill Cunningham, D-Chicago, has worked on energy legislation for years and said that there is “nothing we can do” to reduce prices for this summer as capacity auctions have concluded, but he said lawmakers should do what they can to address the root causes of the spike.

“We think this is going to be the new normal,” Cunningham said.

Legislative moves

Negotiations over energy reforms in Springfield have included lawmakers, the governor’s office, and interest groups including environmentalists, organized labor and business associations. The process is sparking heated debate.

Over the past week, a draft of legislation began circulating among lawmakers and advocates, many of whom discussed portions of the bill with Capitol News Illinois.

CUNINGHAM PHOTO

“I don’t think, by any stretch, you’ll see a bill the size and scope that CEJA was, that we passed four years ago — certainly won’t see that,” Cunningham, who was involved in the negotiations, said.

Potential provisions deal with incentives for renewable power, energy efficiency regulations, nuclear power, data centers and more.

Environmental groups clashed with business and labor this week over a provision meant to lower the energy burden brought by data centers. That proposal would require large energy consumers to build their own energy generation through renewable sources like wind or solar power or pay the state to do so.

The pitch sparked fierce pushback from business and labor groups, which sent a collective letter to Pritzker, urging him to oppose the specific provision. The letter was co-signed by groups including the AFL-CIO, Climate Jobs Illinois, Illinois Manufacturers’ Association and Constellation Energy — the last of which operates all the state’s commercial nuclear power plants.

The proposal is being pushed by environmentalists, who say they want more accountability from data centers and other large consumers.

“We cannot allow these power-hungry facilities to drive up costs for consumers who are already struggling to pay their bills,” Gina Ramirez, director of Midwest environmental health at the National Resources Defense Council, said at a Wednesday rally.

Other issues are less controversial, largely because they’ve been negotiated for months.

Cunningham, a prominent player in the passage of CEJA, has his own proposal in the current draft: incentives for the energy storage industry. The current draft of that provision closely parallels recommendations made by the Illinois Commerce Commission. That agency was directed by a bill passed earlier this year to study how to handle energy storage projects.

While legislative Republicans have largely been shut out of negotiations over the bill, some of their ideas are being considered.

Sen. Sue Rezin, R-Morris, put out a pitch to ease the pressure on electric demand earlier this year by expanding nuclear energy. She was the architect of a bill two years ago that eased the state’s moratorium on new nuclear power plants, lifting it for next-generation, small generators.

This year, Rezin introduced a bill that would eliminate the remaining state restrictions on new nuclear power plants. Language similar to Rezin’s was included in draft legislation circulated this week.

REZIN PHOTO

Rezin, who leads several energy-related groups of lawmakers as part of her involvement at the National Conference of State Legislatures, said all states are facing similar issues around electricity.

“All energy buildout will take years because of the regulatory process,” Rezin said. “That’s why it’s important now. The state of Illinois needs to send positive messages to companies that are looking to invest in technology — whether it’s nuclear or any other kind of energy producing plant — that we are open for business.”

The feds’ ‘big, beautiful bill’

Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday morning passed a bill containing many domestic policy priorities of President Donald Trump that many fear could upend state energy policy.

The bill contains provisions rolling back several clean energy tax incentives. Several key solar company stock prices fell sharply Thursday morning in response, including NextEra Energy, FirstSolar and Enphase Energy among others.

The solar industry has been a key part of Illinois’ renewable energy plans and efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Lesley McCain, the head of the Illinois Solar Energy & Storage Association, said that the bill could “cause solar energy companies of all sizes to cancel projects, and many will be forced to shut their doors.”

Environmentalists were quick to criticize the federal bill, which still requires negotiation and an eventual vote in the U.S. Senate before it can become law.

“It strips funding for climate programs, guts clean energy manufacturing, kills good union jobs, drives energy prices up, and abandons farmers and small business owners,” Walling said in a statement.

Illinois Republicans, meanwhile, expressed optimism that some of the bill’s provisions could help the fossil fuel sector in the state.

Do you plan to cross-shop the 2026 Toyota bZ with any other EVs?","Four versions of the ’26 Toyota bZ will use a 74.7-kWh battery and achieve estimated range of between 278 miles and 314 miles. A front-drive XLE trim will get a new 57.7-kWh battery and 236 miles of range.

Early next year, bZ shoppers can step up to something more rugged: the 2026 bZ Woodland edition with a range-topping 375 hp and standard AWD.

The new instrument panel overall is streamlined and looks more upscale than the one in the 2025 bZ4X, and the design team moved the gauge cluster higher, making it easier to see in the ’26 model.

It’s much more than just a name change.

Yes, Toyota has ditched the clumsy and awkward bZ4X moniker for its most recent battery-electric vehicle for the US market, in hopes that the simplified name “bZ” will resonate with shoppers and bear fruit when this updated 2026 model starts arriving at Toyota showrooms later this summer.

The bZ4X has been in the market for three years—and has taken its lumps along the way. The 2022 launch was plagued by an embarrassing recall for loose hub bolts that might cause wheels to detach. Barely 1,200 units sold in 2022.

But the bZ4X recovered well enough to achieve 9,329 sales in 2023 in the US and then another 18,570 in 2024.

But for context, higher-priced luxury EVs like the BMW i4, Cadillac Lyriq, and Rivian R1S handily outsold the bZ4X in 2024, as did mainstream EVs like the Mustang Mach-E, Nissan Ariya, and Honda Prologue.

So Toyota clearly has work to do in this volatile and politically charged segment for all-electric vehicles, and the latest changes to this refreshed (and renamed) 2026 bZ are notable on a number of fronts.

On the outside, you can barely see the difference in the trim and unaltered sheetmetal compared to the 2025 bZ4X.

But the mechanical changes for the new bZ are meaningful. The ’25 bZ4X offered two battery packs (71.4 kWh and 72.8 kWh), capable of range between 222 and 252 miles.

Four versions of the ’26 bZ will use a 74.7-kWh battery and achieve estimated range of between 278 miles (with AWD) and 314 miles (with front-wheel drive).

Even better, a front-drive XLE trim will be offered with a new, smaller 57.7-kWh battery, rated at 236 miles of range and likely coming in at a lower price point—but with a meager 168 hp.

Look for 338 hp combined with AWD (Limited and XLE trim) for ’26, up from 214 hp combined on the prior AWD bZ4X.

We didn’t get to drive that new 338-hp bZ, but even the 221-hp Limited FWD model felt lively on a short route last week in and around Plano, Texas, near the Toyota North American headquarters.

For some people, 168 hp and 236 miles of range might be the perfect vehicle, at a lower price point.

The spec sheet shows a big step up in acceleration to 60 mph, from 6.5 seconds with AWD for the bZ4X to 4.9 seconds with the 338-hp AWD system in the new bZ.

But at the lower end with FWD and the smaller 57.7-kWh battery, the bZ is slower to 60 mph: a leisurely 8 seconds compared to 7.1 in the base bZ4X with a larger battery.

Toyota’s basically giving EV shoppers more options—at both the lower and upper end of the bZ range. For some people with shorter range and power requirements, 168 hp and 236 miles of range might be the perfect vehicle, at a lower price point.

And early next year, bZ shoppers can step up to yet another option if they are looking for something more rugged. The 2026 bZ Woodland edition will bring a range-topping 375 hp, standard AWD, up to an estimated 260 miles of range, 3,500 pounds of towing capacity, and 8.3 inches of ground clearance for adventuring off-road.

Another important addition for the ’26 bZ, including the Woodland: Standard on all of them is the Tesla-designed North American Charging System (NACS) port, giving access to thousands of DC fast charging stations nationwide.

If you have a favorite charging station that still uses the Combined Charging System (CCS) port that has been standard for most other EV makers, then you’ll be glad to find an adapter that comes with your bZ, at no extra charge. Consider it an insurance policy giving you a lot more charging options during road trips.

The 2025 Toyota bZ4X at right saw substantial interior changes for the 2026 Toyota bZ (left).

Look inside the 2026 bZ and you’ll see significant design upgrades.

The instrument panel is all new and now gets a larger 14-inch multimedia touchscreen in the center that integrates more neatly within the instrument panel. That new screen is positioned higher for better visibility.

The old screen had tiny buttons positioned at the base for adjusting volume up and down—good luck working those while moving. Below that were climate controls that were also poorly organized and hard to read.

The new configuration is cleaner and simpler and includes two chunky dials for adjusting cabin temperature for both driver and passenger.

And right between those dials is another welcome new addition: a physical volume knob (which could use some brightwork to stand out from the all-black background).

The instrument panel overall is streamlined and looks more upscale than the one it replaces. The digital gauge cluster in the bZ4X sat too low, and the steering wheel blocked its visibility. But for ’26 the design team moved the cluster higher, making it easier to see, and pushed it a bit closer to the windshield.

2026 bZ Woodland edition will bring 375 hp, standard AWD, up to an estimated 260 miles of range.

And there was just too much going on with the old gauge cluster, which had arms on either side reaching forward toward the driver. In between those arms was a hump that extended and tapered back from the steering wheel toward the cluster. The mess is cleaned up.

Also for ’26, that steering wheel (which is unchanged and has lots of buttons) comes with paddles to crank up the regenerative braking force (up to four clicks) with the right side, or down with the left.

Those paddles weren’t there for the bZ4X, so you had to use a switch in the center console. The new paddles work great, but you still don’t get full one-pedal driving, just like with the bZ4X.

There’s another big interior change worth mentioning. The bZ4X center console had one port for wireless phone charging, while the new bZ gets two. And the console has been reconfigured to bring the gear shifter closer to the driver. It all looks better than it did.

Starting price for the 2025 bZ4X was $38,205, and we’ll have to wait until later this summer for the new pricing when the ’26 bZ starts arriving at Toyota showrooms, in XLE and Limited trims. Toyota builds the bZ4X in Japan and China.

China, the world’s largest EV market, reported a 55% jump in BEV sales to 1.64 million units in Q1 2025.
After three consecutive quarters of year-on-year declines in BEV sales, Q1 2025 experienced a significant revival in Europe, according to the report.
In Q1 2025, the United States saw an 18% rise in BEV sales to 301,000 units, even as PHEV sales slipped by 11% to 79,000 units.","India’s battery electric vehicle (BEV) market posted solid growth in the first quarter of 2025, with sales reaching 31,661 units, a 22% increase from 25,842 units in the same period last year. However, the country’s performance lagged behind the 42% global surge in BEV sales to 2.66 million units, driven by robust demand in markets such as China, Europe, the UK, and the US, according to a report from Strategy&, a consulting business unit of PricewaterhouseCoopers.

India’s BEV growth was particularly robust in March 2025, with monthly sales climbing to 12,163 units—up 24% year-on-year. This was on account of incremental volumes from Mahindra & Mahindra and Hyundai Motor India BEVs.

The rise in BEV sales highlights India's expanding shift toward clean mobility, spurred by government incentives, evolving consumer preferences for premium vehicles, and new product launches by domestic and global automakers.

Currently, India’s electric passenger vehicle market is led by players like Tata Motors, MG Motor India, Mahindra and Mahindra, and Hyundai Motor India. Maruti Suzuki India, the country’s largest passenger vehicle maker, is expected to launch its first EV domestically in September. In the luxury segment, brands like BYD, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz are also expanding their EV offerings in India.

Despite the growth, India’s EV share remains modest—just 2.5% of total passenger vehicle sales in 2024—held back by high prices and limited charging infrastructure. S&P Global expects a shift in the coming years as affordable EVs, better financing options, and expanded charging networks bridge the price gap with conventional vehicles. The Indian government aims for EVs to comprise 30% of all passenger vehicle sales by FY2030.

In Q1 2025, India’s hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) segment recorded a modest 1.5% rise in sales to 93,173 units, while plug-in hybrid (PHEV) volumes remained negligible at 30 units.

Global Sales

Globally, BEV sales momentum was even stronger. China, the world’s largest EV market, reported a 55% jump in BEV sales to 1.64 million units in Q1 2025. PHEV sales rose 37% to 994,000 units, while hybrids increased 18% to 213,000 units—bringing China’s total EV sales to nearly 2.85 million units for the quarter. The BEV and PHEV numbers include commercial vehicles, and hybrid numbers include only passenger cars

The Chinese market continues to be boosted by a series of government measures, including the expansion of the trade-in scheme which offers financial incentives that encourage consumers to upgrade to newer vehicles, Strategy& said. The country ICE sales were down 7% year on year, the tenth successive quarter in which such a decline was registered.

Europe–including the European Union, UK and European Free Trade Association--also witnessed robust growth, with BEV sales climbing to 574,000 units in Q1 2025, a 28% increase from a year earlier. PHEVs grew 6% to 268,000 units, and hybrid sales expanded 20% to 1.22 million units. The total EV volume for Europe stood at 2.06 million units, as per the report.

After three consecutive quarters of year-on-year declines in BEV sales, Q1 2025 experienced a significant revival in Europe, according to the report. Sales of BEVs increased in the top five European markets by 30%, resulting in the highest BEV market share on record for the first quarter of the year (15%). The relatively large BEV markets of the UK and Germany were responsible for much of that growth, up by 43% and 39%, respectively.

Germany’s strong growth can be partly attributed to a sudden fall in sales in the equivalent quarter last year in the wake of the sudden withdrawal of incentives. Despite the overall strong performance, Germany remains in second place for the largest market for BEVs in Europe, following the UK's lead in both the first quarter and full year of 2024, Strategy& said.

In Q1 2025, the United States saw an 18% rise in BEV sales to 301,000 units, even as PHEV sales slipped by 11% to 79,000 units. Hybrid vehicles, however, saw a sharp 47% increase, with 473,000 units sold during the quarter.

Tesla Loses Ground

Tesla, one of the world’s largest EV makers, lost ground in several key markets in Q1 2025. In Europe’s leading markets (Germany, Italy, Spain), Tesla’s Model Y fell to fifth place in sales rankings, with 5,797 units sold, while the Tesla Model 3 dropped to sixth. The top-selling models in Europe were the VW ID.7 (9,515 units), VW ID.4/ID.5 (8,301 units), and Skoda Enyaq (7,515 units).

In China, Tesla’s Model Y ranked third with 81,889 units sold, behind the Geely Geome Xingyuan (89,215 units) and the Wuling Hongguang Mini EV (86,946 units). The Model 3 held sixth place with 52,718 units sold.

In the US, Tesla retained its lead, with the Model Y topping the charts at 64,051 units and the Model 3 following at 52,520 units. The Ford Mustang Mach-E, with 11,607 units sold, rounded out the top three.

As global and domestic markets transition toward electrification and software-centric automotive technologies, industry analysts expect continued momentum in EV sales in the coming quarters, with India’s efforts to build out local supply chains and charging infrastructure playing a key role.",https://img.autocarpro.in/autocarpro/769f8f5d-50dd-4457-94c3-2df26d94a715_Screenshot-20250527-163437.png,N,,2025-05-27 11:20:44.316623

The Toyota bZ goes on sale in second half of 2025.

PLANO, Texas – The 2026 Toyota bZ makes a leap forward with improvements for everything from the subcompact EV's name to its charging system. The 2022 bZ4X was an uncharacteristic disappointment from the world’s largest automaker. Overpriced and under-equipped, it was hamstrung by everything from uncompetitive technology to a ludicrous name.

Toyota listened to its critics and turned one of the world’s most formidable continuous improvement machines loose.

Renamed the bZ ― still not poetry, but the badge no longer looks like a laser printer threw up ― the new model is competitive with small electric SUVs like the Kia Niro, Hyundai Kona and Fiat 500e.

The 2026 bZ goes on sale in the second half of 2025. Detailed figures for price, range and charging will be available later.

I recently drove a loaded bZ Limited through the exurbs surrounding Toyota’s North America headquarters in Plano. It felt like a completely different vehicle from the bZ4X Limited I tested a couple of months ago.

Key improvements to 2026 Toyota bZ

25% range increase to 314 miles

50% power increase to 338 horsepower

NSCS charging port

Plug & Charge compatibility

Radical makeover

Improvements to the ’26 bZ start at the EV’s heart: battery, charging and motors.

The bZ gets two sizes of lithium-ion battery: a 74.7 kWh unit delivers up to 314 miles range and a 57.7 kWh unit rated at 236 miles. The battery is now capable of pre-conditioning, which speeds up charging and reduces energy use in cold weather.

A built-in NACS charging port provides access to Tesla’s DC fast charging network. An adaptor will be necessary for CCS chargers common at other charging stations. An onboard charger upgraded from 7 to 11 kW will hasten charging at the 240v connections most EV owners use at home. Plug & Charge software makes charging fast and easy at participating chargers including Electrify America, EVgo, ChargePoint and Tesla.

Maximum power increases dramatically, from 214 to 338 hp for the AWD model and 201 to 221 hp for FWD.

The exterior styling benefits from updated front LED running lights and fascia that bring the nose into harmony with Toyota’s ""hammerhead"" nose. Body-color front fascia and cladding around the wheels is also new.

Driving impressions

The ’26 fairly leaps away from stops compared with its under-power predecessor. Toyota claims a 4.9-seconds 0-60 mph for the AWD bZ. It was mum on the previous model’s acceleration, and not out of modesty.

The steering was responsive in my time in neighborhoods, shopping districts and along wide, smooth roads that curved between corporate campuses and public parks.

The brakes are firm and easy to modulate. New steering column paddles adjust regenerative braking to recapture energy, but there’s no one-pedal setting to bring the bZ to a full stop.

The front seat is roomy, with a big center console that holds two new wireless charging pads. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard.

The new dash has a 14-inch touch screen. The instrument cluster is new, too, bigger and easier to read.

A heat pump reduces energy use for heating and cooling the cabin.

Standard heated steering wheel and front seats further reduce cold-weather energy use. Climate control options include ventilated front seats, heated rear seats and a radiant front-seat foot and leg heater.

Why buy a 2026 Toyota bZ?

Price and charging time are huge unknowns, but there’s lots to like about the 2026 Toyota bZ.

Its improved power and battery size give it competitive performance and range. Revised lights and exterior color pattern make it look like a grown-up vehicle, as opposed to the bZ4X’s cobbled-together appearance.

The interior of my bZ Limited was comfortable, trimmed in appealing soft materials and roomy.

It’s a huge step forward to Toyota’s EV status, worth a look from anybody shopping for a small electric SUV.

This expansion will drive further cost optimisation and increased adoption of lightweight solar technology.","The Solar HEliup Energy for Flat roofTop (SHEEFT) project is setting a new benchmark in renewable energy thanks to the support of the Innovation Fund. Traditionally, flat rooftops with low bearing capacities have been overlooked for solar installations because they cannot support the heavy weight of standard photovoltaic installations and mounting systems. Fortunately, SHEEFT tackles this problem as it manufactures cutting-edge, lightweight photovoltaic (PV) panels specifically designed for flat rooftops, allowing for the installation of more solar panels and in turn, enabling the uptake of renewable energy and lowering carbon emissions.

Led by the French start-up, HELIUP, the project uses ultra-thin glass technology in its innovative Stykon® PV panel. This panel is tailor-made for large existing commercial, industrial and logistic buildings with low load-bearing capacities. Unlike conventional solar panels, SHEEFT’s panels are glued directly to waterproof membranes, cutting weight by 60% without compromising performance or reliability.

‘The SHEEFT project addresses the unrealised needs of buildings traditionally unsuitable for solar installations due to structural limitations’, explained Yannick Veschetti, CEO of HELIUP. ‘

The support of the Innovation Fund was crucial to scaling this solution, accelerating our ability to contribute substantially to Europe’s decarbonisation objectives’.

The factory is now fully operational and meeting its targets, marking a major milestone in demonstrating Europe’s ability to industrialise innovative solutions rapidly. Reaching this point required selecting equipment and a production site, securing permits, managing procurement, recruiting skilled staff, and maintaining strict control over budget and timeline. These achievements reflect the dedication and coordinated efforts of the entire project team.

Environmental and local benefits

Supported by a €3.22 million grant from the Innovation Fund, the project will deliver substantial environmental and economic benefits. Notably, the technology harnesses the untapped potential of pre-existing building rooftops once unable to use PV panels to generate clean energy.

Over a 10-year operational period, SHEEFT will generate approximately 3.76 terawatt-hours (TWh) of clean electricity. Based on an average EU household consumption of 3.76 megawatt hours, this is enough to supply an equivalent of 100 000 EU households, significantly enhancing Europe’s energy independence and sustainability. Also within a 10-year operational period, the project expects to avoid emitting over 360 000 tonnes of CO₂, which is the equivalent of eliminating the annual carbon emissions of approximately 20 000 EU households.

SHEEFT also champions key industrial growth within Europe. Its pilot line for pre-production and product development in Bourget-du-Lac, and its 4 000 m2 production line in Le Cheylas, one of the largest production capacities in France, contribute significantly to local economic growth and employment stability by creating 100 direct jobs.

Looking forward and scaling up

The next steps focus on commercial development to fully leverage the 100 megawatt-peak annual capacity of Le Cheylas plant by 2030. To this end, a gradual ramp-up is planned, expanding from one to three shifts while maintaining high yield and efficiency.

HELIUP will also launch a second phase beyond the Innovation Fund project, scaling industrial production units by five to ten times their initial size from 2026 onwards. This expansion will drive further cost optimisation and increased adoption of lightweight solar technology. With rapid execution and strong European roots, the project continues to show its potential to be a highly credible player in the clean energy sector.

SHEEFT is a startup-led initiative bringing certified French energy technology to market via a new 100 MWp production line. With rapid execution and strong European roots, it’s a credible player in the energy sector.

Trump on Friday gave the NRC until February to prepare and publish “a wholesale revision of its regulations and guidance documents,” in consultation with White House budget officials and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The Department of Energy and the Defense Department were also given totally new nuclear missions that could support — or compete — with the NRC’s charter.

NRC was directed to review “unsound” and “myopic” rules that limit radiation exposure. And the new rules must include 18-month deadlines for approving new reactor designs.

Trump’s four executive orders signed Friday support the goal of a fourfold increase in U.S. nuclear output by 2050 to power data centers that can help fuel American leadership in artificial intelligence technology. Some clean energy groups shun nuclear power. But nuclear advocates inside the environmental community say it’s a vital source of carbon-free power after 2030. Other backers point to rising electricity demand and long-term energy reliability as reasons to advance nuclear technology and build more plants.

Responses to the orders have landed far apart.

Adam Stein, director of nuclear energy and innovation at the Breakthrough Institute, a supporter of expanded nuclear power, said the White House is requiring the NRC to reconsider radiation standards, but the executive orders don’t order the agency to change nuclear power’s safety threshold. Instead, Trump calls for adoption of “credible and data-backed” safety standards, he said. “The orders do not undermine safety.”

“The executive order is challenging the agency to reexamine its processes … to make sure they are appropriately balancing risks and benefits and are not imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens,” said Jeffrey Merrifield, a former NRC commissioner and an attorney with Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman. “I believe at the end of the day, the agency still has the last word on what it needs to do to meet its safety mission.”

The orders offer no clarity on how differences would be resolved by the NRC commissioners and administration officials, even if much of NRC’s legal authority is still in place.

Allison Macfarlane, a former NRC chair, said Trump’s intervention in the NRC process smacks of political interference, which will “crater” essential public confidence in nuclear power. “I think it’s really going to damage public trust,” she said.

“I’m concerned about this intrusion on the historic independence of the agency,” said another former NRC chair, Stephen Burns. “You’re seeing this in how they’re acting with other independent agencies.”

A White House official confirmed that staff reductions are planned at the NRC. “There will be turnover and changes in roles,” a White House official said Friday, speaking on background. “Total reduction in staff is undetermined at this point, but the executive orders do call for a substantial reorganization.”

Ambition and resources

“It will be impossible for NRC to maintain a commitment to safety and oversight with staffing levels slashed and expertise gone,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), a nuclear power critic, said Friday. (The Trump order said specialists could be added to NRC staff if necessary to evaluate certain reactor technology).

Trump’s orders called on the departments of Defense and Energy to vet new reactor designs in parallel if not in competition with the NRC. The U.S. Army is ordered to have a new reactor operating at a U.S. military installation within three years. Under the White House plan, DOE must coordinate construction of new reactors to power data centers within 30 months.

Reactor technologies approved by DOE and DOD should receive expedited approval at the NRC. The commission would have limited authority to reconsider the DOE and DOD decisions, the president directed.

“There’s a question about whether the resources are going to match the ambition,” said Judi Greenwald, CEO of the Nuclear Innovation Alliance, which supports zero-carbon advanced nuclear technology as a way to address emissions in the power sector.

The first few new reactor designs will take at least a couple of years to review, she said. “That’s a process that we think NRC is competent to do.”

Once nuclear builders get construction experience, she added, regulators can accelerate processing of standard designs. “You can just keep licensing the same thing repeatedly, and we should get pretty fast at that,” she said.

New, unproven technologies

The NRC’s yearslong process of creating a new regulatory review process for advanced reactors generated bipartisan frustration in Congress. That paved the road for enactment of last year’s ADVANCE Act to speed up reviews, passed with significant majorities from both parties.

Today, a dozen reactor builders are in preliminary discussions with the NRC about their designs. Four small modular reactor developers have applied for licenses. Most of the advanced reactors Trump is counting on to bring about a nuclear “renaissance” use fuel or heat management technologies that are far different from currently operating U.S. reactors.

New fuels and technology pose unique safety review challenges, according to a 2023 study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.

Much of the licensing of new reactors revolves around testing and licensing new cooling technology. Instead of the water-cooled systems, advanced reactors employ less familiar cooling systems such as liquid sodium, helium gas or molten salt. While the projects include some built-in safety improvements over existing reactors, “the designs will need to demonstrate that they can meet [NRC] standards through testing and safety analysis,” the National Academies report said.

Former NRC Chair Richard Meserve, who chaired the National Academies panel, said the NRC is deeply engaged with the new reactor vendors. “The NRC has been tackling the issues, but the hard decisions have not yet been completely confronted. There is no way to cut corners on ensuring that these new features are carefully analyzed,” he said.

“Sodium-cooled reactors face significant fire risk, as sodium ignites explosively on contact with air,” said Amir Afzali, a retired utility senior director with more than three decades experience in nuclear power.

One potential engineering solution, he noted, is to enclose sodium-carrying pipes within a secondary containment pipe. “While effective, this approach requires rigorous testing, inspection, and monitoring — raising construction and operating costs,” Afzali said.

History across industries — whether it’s nuclear, banking or aerospace — raises alarms about an approach that weakens oversight and blurs the lines between promotion and regulation. “Maintaining independent, effective regulation is essential to avoid serious consequences,” Afzali said.

In the preamble to his order for rule changes at NRC, Trump said the basis for his orders was an “overly risk-averse culture” at the NRC that imposed unnecessarily lengthy licensing timetables and high costs, thwarting the expansion of nuclear power in the United States.

“America’s great innovators and entrepreneurs have run into brick walls when it comes to nuclear technology,” Michael Kratsios, Trump’s science and technology adviser, said Friday.

The history is more complex.

Around 2000, the NRC licensed 14 new reactor applications from seven utilities, including 10 of Westinghouse’s AP1000 units — the large reactor designs used by Georgia Power to expand its Vogtle plant.

The Vogtle expansion ended up the only project completed. Costs ran up to $35 billion and the project was seven years late.

But the NRC can’t be blamed for the issues Vogtle faced, Afzali said. The high costs deterred utilities that had been considering a nuclear build-out.

“The NRC has plenty of areas where they need to improve,” Afzali said. “But undermining them as an effective regulator isn’t consistent with the facts.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/a9/41/0d0188994ca2aecda650d718cd86/trump-30115.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 08:05:06.958923

Risks of fragmented remote access The risks facing the sector are exacerbated by the widespread use of low-grade, unsecured, or ungoverned remote access software.
The abundance of remote access tools creates operational challenges as well.
Centralised remote access not only reduces the attack surface but also improves productivity and ensures that critical operations are maintained securely and reliably.","In Section 889 of the National Defense Authorization Act 2019, the US Congress sought to protect national security by preventing government procurement or contracting of Chinese telecommunications and video surveillance equipment and services which allegedly contain backdoors for espionage.

While the adversaries of Western democracies seek to use access to cyber-physical systems for espionage and to disrupt critical infrastructure, many industrial environments rely on a sprawling patchwork of remote access tools for day-to-day operations that is frequently insecure, uncontrolled, unmonitored and thus highly vulnerable.

This isn’t an isolated risk but an issue which spans the energy sector and beyond. If we are to protect the resilience of our energy infrastructure, we must confront the reality that remote access, while essential, has become one of the least governed aspects of cybersecurity with real world potential consequences.

The European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC)’s call for an EU-wide“Inverter Security Toolbox” reflects this shift in understanding. Security must extend beyond the device to the ecosystem of access surrounding it.

Solar’s security blind spot

For energy providers, the issue isn’t that remote access exists, but that it exists in such unmanageable volumes that are invisible to security teams.

Tools are regularly onboarded for practical reasons such as vendor maintenance, emergency fixes, or legacy system support. Over time, though, these legitimate needs accumulate into a fragmented jumble of digital doors, many of which inadvertently remain open.

In one notable case, a manufacturer discovered it had more than 7,000 remote access points across its plants. Any one of these connections, if compromised, could act as a highway through established security controls into the heart of its production systems.

This encapsulates the gulf between operational needs and cybersecurity fundamentals. While automation vendors and machine builders must maintain uptime and minimise onsite interventions, asset owners commonly overlook the security implications of their procurement and deployment decisions.

Once you see the scale of the sprawl, you can’t unsee it. Even more vexing: once seen, what was once ignorance becomes negligence if left untreated.

In the solar sector, this risk is no different. A recent analysis from US cybersecurity firm DER Security foundthat 45% of global solar capacity was exposed to nation-state adversaries or cybercriminal threats in the past year alone. As the sector matures, so too must the rigour applied to its cybersecurity practices throughout the entire procurement, deployment, and operations lifecycle.

Risks of fragmented remote access

The risks facing the sector are exacerbated by the widespread use of low-grade, unsecured, or ungoverned remote access software.

Claroty’s research found that 55% of industrial organisations have four or more non-enterprise-grade tools operating within their OT environments. While using multiple vendors may not necessarily be problematic, the number of remote access points – sometimes measured in hundreds or thousands – quite certainly is.

Some of these tools have been directly implicated in recent security breaches. For example, TeamViewer was reportedly compromised by the APT29 threat group, while AnyDesk disclosed a breach that forced the revocation of passwords and code-signing certificates across its user base. These widely deployed tools, when not properly managed, become significant liabilities within industrial settings.

But the risks extend beyond cybersecurity alone. The abundance of remote access tools creates operational challenges as well. A fragmented environment is less efficient, adding to the workload on both IT and OT teams, and is more complicated to enforce consistent security policies.

This sprawl increases costs and generates blind spots which hinder visibility and control. In environments where uptime, safety, and precision are critical, these operational consequences can be just as damaging as a direct cyberattack.

Fragmentation, centralisation, governance

Fortunately, organisations have an alternative. Leading energy companies are beginning to adopt centralised and policy-driven approaches to remote access management. These programs begin by mapping all access points and identifying outdated or risky tools. From there, they can consolidate access pathways under a single, secure entry point.

Importantly, this process involves not just internal restructuring but renegotiation with third-party vendors. Organisations are now requiring that vendors use the company’s preferred access method, rather than shipping their own tools or relying on outdated practices.

However, this transition is neither fast nor easy, and vendors regularly resist changes. The energy sector must put pressure on vendors to ensure that these standards are upheld. Centralised remote access not only reduces the attack surface but also improves productivity and ensures that critical operations are maintained securely and reliably.

A strategic imperative for the future

The alleged incident with Chinese solar inverters shouldn’t be a surprise. Yet, what might surprise asset owners is the deeper issue – a fragmented approach to remote access that frequently and silently proliferates in asset-intensive organisations.

If the energy industry is serious about securing its future, it must address this sprawl head-on. Visibility, standardisation, and accountability must become the new benchmarks.

Cybersecurity is not a matter of convenience or compliance. In the context of energy infrastructure, it is a matter of national resilience, economic security, and public safety.

This can include converting waste-to-energy, recycling e-waste for critical mineral recovery, and developing circular microgrids that maximise resource efficiency.
Lastly, sustainable agriculture and the bio-economy offer crucial avenues for green investment.
These diverse opportunities highlight Africa’s strategic importance in the global shift towards a green economy.","At the forefront of this green industrial revolution is critical minerals beneficiation. Africa holds approximately 30% of the world’s mineral reserves, including vast deposits of critical minerals like cobalt, lithium, manganese, graphite, copper and platinum-group metals – essential for electric vehicles, renewable energy systems and energy storage solutions. Immense opportunity lies in moving beyond raw material extraction to value addition and beneficiation at source. This means investing in sophisticated processing plants and even integrated manufacturing facilities for battery components, or electric vehicle parts, directly within Africa. The African Union’s “African Green Minerals Strategy” explicitly highlights this potential, aiming to position Africa as a global hub for critical mineral processing, transforming its mineral wealth into genuine industrial power. For example, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Zambia are already exploring alliances to develop regional battery manufacturing capabilities.

Another cornerstone of Africa’s green future is renewable energy generation. The continent possesses immense untapped potential in solar, wind and hydropower, boasting some of the best solar irradiation and wind resources globally. Investment opportunities span large-scale utility projects, which can feed into national and regional grids, as well as distributed generation solutions like rooftop solar for commercial and industrial users, and innovative off-grid solutions crucial for electrifying rural communities. The demand for clean energy is rising rapidly across Africa, driven by industrialisation needs, population growth and persistent energy access deficits. Countries like South Africa, through the recent adoption of the South Africa Renewable Energy Master Plan (SAREMP) and Namibia, through the adoption of its Namibia Green Industrialisation Blueprint are actively working towards further localisation of renewable energy manufacturing, creating additional opportunities for component production and assembly. Public-private partnerships (PPP) are crucial for financing and developing these large-scale renewable energy projects, particularly those designed to integrate into a future interconnected continental grid under the African Continental Free Trade Area.

Africa is also rapidly emerging as a potential global leader in green hydrogen production. Leveraging its abundant and low-cost renewable energy resources, countries like Namibia, South Africa, Morocco and Egypt have launched ambitious green hydrogen projects aimed at both domestic consumption and export to decarbonise heavy industries in Europe and Asia. Investment opportunities exist in the entire green hydrogen value chain, from electrolysis plants powered by vast renewable energy farms to critical infrastructure for storage and transport, such as pipelines and port facilities for green ammonia, e-methonal or liquid hydrogen. PPPs are essential for developing the significant infrastructure required for a green hydrogen economy.

Beyond raw materials and energy, there are substantial prospects in green manufacturing and the circular economy. Africa can establish itself as a hub for the production of components for renewable energy technologies, electric vehicles and other sustainable goods. The continent’s growing population and expanding consumer base provide a ready and increasingly affluent market for such products. Furthermore, there are significant opportunities in the circular economy, focusing on innovative waste management solutions, recycling and remanufacturing. This can include converting waste-to-energy, recycling e-waste for critical mineral recovery, and developing circular microgrids that maximise resource efficiency. Initiatives like the African Development Bank’s Africa Circular Economy Facility are supporting countries in developing national roadmaps and attracting investment into these high-potential areas.

Lastly, sustainable agriculture and the bio-economy offer crucial avenues for green investment. Investing in sustainable agricultural practices, such as precision farming and drought-resistant crops, can not only enhance food security for the continent but also significantly contribute to climate resilience and carbon sequestration. Opportunities also exist in the broader bio-economy, including the sustainable production of biofuels, bio-based chemicals and advanced biomaterials, leveraging Africa’s vast biodiversity and agricultural resources.

These diverse opportunities highlight Africa’s strategic importance in the global shift towards a green economy. However, realising this potential requires not only robust investment but also a clear understanding of the legal and regulatory landscape that governs these projects.",https://www.cliffedekkerhofmeyr.com/export/sites/cdh/images/news-thumbnails/industrials-manufacturing-04.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 09:05:46.701848

The U.S., already the world’s largest exporter of the superchilled gas with 91.3 million tonnes of annual capacity, should triple that before 2030 thanks to projects awaiting final investment decisions. Those come on top of 95.7 mtpa under construction, according to an April note to clients from Poten and Partners.

Trump has said he wants to vastly expand U.S. energy production and exports, and his administration has lifted a freeze on new LNG export permits, declaring an energy emergency.

The trade war has complicated construction of new plants, analysts and developers said, especially Trump’s 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum which are heavily used at LNG facilities. Some worry this might ultimately raise prices for U.S. LNG exports, making customers look for cheaper alternatives.

Still, at least seven proposed U.S. LNG projects are in various stages of development, with owners saying they intend to make a final investment decision in 2025, according the Reuters survey of recent earnings reports and analyst calls.

Five of the seven are expansions of existing facilities. The other two are on green field sites without existing infrastructure like port facilities: Energy Transfer’s ET 16.5 mtpa LNG plant at Lake Charles and Commonwealth LNG’s proposed 9.5 mtpa facility at Cameron, both in Louisiana.

Among companies expected to soon approve construction of additional export facilities are the two largest U.S. LNG exporters, Cheniere Energy LNG and Venture Global VG.

Cheniere is on track to approve this year its 5 MTPA expansion of its Corpus Christi, Texas plant, called mid-scale 8 and 9, the company’s CEO Jack Fusco said last Friday during its earnings call.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued a “permit on mid-scale Trains 8 and 9, one of the key remaining steps ahead of an expected FID later this year,” Fusco said. FID stands for final investment decision.

Venture Global VG aims to approve the 28 MTPA CP2 project in Louisiana, the largest single LNG plant in the U.S., in the “middle of this year”, its CEO Mike Sabel said at an earnings call on Tuesday.

Last week, the company said it received the final supplemental environmental study on its CP2 plant. It also has its non-FTA export permit, allowing it to export to a broad range of markets.

“An essential permit ahead of our FID for phase one of the project, which is anticipated for the middle of this year,” Sabel told the earnings call.

Commonwealth LNG, Port Arthur LNG and Next Decade announced several long-term supply deals in 2025, building commercial momentum toward final investment decisions they promise will come this year.

TRADE HEADWINDS

Venture Global’s Sabel said increased steel, aluminum and other tariffs could raise the cost for CP2 by about 1%.

Sempra aims to make a final investment decision (FID) this year on phase 2 of its Port Arthur facility but will exercise patience to lock in favorable long-term economics, said Jeffrey Martin, Sempra’s SRE CEO.

“Uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment may affect the timing of product development,” he said.

Since 2021, almost all U.S. LNG projects under construction have faced price escalation or cost overruns due to supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, high borrowing costs and other factors.

Woodside’s Louisiana LNG project price jumped by 31%, Next Decade’s Rio Grande facility increased by 29% and Port Arthur Phase 1 by 18% from the original pre-FID figures, said Alex Munton, director of global gas and LNG research at consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group.

He noted those increases hit largely before Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum. Even if the White House totally cancels country-specific reciprocal tariffs, those 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum and the 10% blanket levy remain in place putting pressure on LNG construction costs, Munton said.

Cheniere has promised to maintain capital discipline and will ensure it sells over 90% of its capacity before FID, said the company’s Chief Commercial Office Anatol Feyin.

Woodside, in contrast, said it gave the financial go ahead for its Louisiana LNG terminal with long-term sale contracts for only 1 MTPA in place.

“We saw the first FID in two years here. And very little commercial activity to underpin that,” Feyin told the earnings

call. “We’re not changing our stripes. We’ll stay disciplined.”

On Wednesday, Woodside announced it entered into a non-binding agreement with Saudi Aramco that could lead to the Saudis taking a stake in the Louisiana project

On the agenda tomorrow is an application filed by SWA Lithium, a joint venture between Canada-based Standard Lithium and Norwegian energy giant Equinor, known for its Empire Wind offshore wind farm off the coast of New York.

Standard Lithium has already gone before the commission twice for a royalty determination — first in December 2023 and then again in November 2024. Both times, questions were raised as to whether Standard Lithium and its co-applicants — in 2023, Lanxess; in 2024, Lanxess, Albemarle, Tetra Tech and ExxonMobil-subsidiary Saltwerx — had provided enough data to justify the proposed royalty rates.

Neither time resulted in a royalty being set.

The commission will have to decide if Standard Lithium’s new proposed 2.5% royalty rate and royalty structure are fair and equitable.

What’s the deal with lithium, anyway?

Multiple companies — from oil and gas behemoths like ExxonMobil, to major chemical companies like Lanxess and Albemarle, to relative-newcomers like Standard Lithium — are trying to get in on the valuable lithium reserves trapped in South Arkansas’ subterranean brine, thousands of feet below the earth.

Arkansas state officials have touted the economic benefits such industrial investments could bring to the state while passing legislation to incentivize it.

Albemarle, Lanxess and their predecessors have extracted this brine for decades, as bromine is also abundant in the fluid. Brine is also extracted as a byproduct of the region’s century-old oil and gas industry.

Companies have cited Arkansas’ extensive and unique regulatory structures as one of the points that makes the state attractive for developing a U.S. lithium industry. Now-retired AOGC director and current AOGC Commissioner Larry Bengal previously told the Advocate he believed Arkansas is the only state in the U.S. with a brine statute.

A widely reported study from the U.S. Geological Survey last year estimated that the brines in the parts of the Smackover formation under South Arkansas held enough lithium to meet U.S. demand for decades. The study used machine learning to predict lithium quantities for the region using existing well data. However, one of the authors of the study told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that the report said nothing on whether that much lithium could feasibly be extracted from the formation, saying the study was meant to provide a birds-eye view of the potential of the region as a whole.

Geologists have known about the high lithium content of South Arkansas’ brine for decades, but until recently, the technology to extract it profitably wasn’t there. Companies said they’ve already spent millions in pursuit of lithium in the state, even though those companies haven’t yet given the final green light for large-scale extraction projects.

Standard Lithium and Equinor’s SWA Lithium project has already been awarded hundreds of millions in federal funding to build up a lithium extraction operation in South Arkansas as part of federal investments into critical minerals and other supply chains that have increasingly become concentrated in China. Lithium is a key component of rechargeable batteries, including those used in electric vehicles.

That’s great and all, but how are they going to get lithium out of water?

In short, it’s a process called “direct lithium extraction,” or DLE. It’s similar to the process used to treat hard water, just on a much larger scale. It hasn’t been used at commercial scale to extract lithium in the U.S. before, but some companies in China already use it. It’s different from other lithium mining methods, such as hard-rock mining and evaporation pond methods.

Why does the royalty matter?

There are a few reasons. The first is that none of the companies that have expressed interest in growing a lithium extraction industry in South Arkansas can actually begin extracting lithium from brine for profit before the AOGC approves a royalty. They have said previously that having a set royalty is crucial in order to know how much a full-scale extraction project will cost.

The royalty is required by the Arkansas Brine Conservation Act (ABCA), which first passed in the 1970s as a result of court cases that saw mineral rights owners demanding compensation from big chemical companies for diminishing the value of their owned mineral rights through the companies’ bromine operations, which would sometimes push spent brine towards their owned tracts and unextracted brine away from them. An amendment was added in the 1990s establishing the “other substances” provision, which sets the framework to determine royalties for substances extracted from brine other than bromine, such as lithium.

The second reason is that some, like former AOGC commissioner Mike Davis, believe the only real economic benefit many ordinary Arkansans will get from lithium extraction will come from royalty payments.

“When the drilling rigs are gone, when the completion process is complete, you’ve got two things left. You have the maintenance and you have the royalty income,” Davis said at the November hearing. “For the majority of the citizens and for the state of Arkansas itself, the real benefit to the mineral owners and royalty owners and citizens of the state of Arkansas will be the royalty that you gentlemen determine.”

Other issues affecting the 2024 royalty decision

The commission agreed with the opinion of Administrative Law Judge Charles Moulton that a royalty could be applied only to existing brine units — geographic areas approved by the commission for mineral extraction. However, the November applicants wished to apply their proposed royalty to “existing units … and proposed future units” within certain counties — but only after amending their application. Originally, they asked for a royalty determination for the entire Smackover Formation within specific counties.

Since then, both Standard Lithium and Saltwerx have applied for and received permission to create new brine units. You can read more about the brine units here.

Why wasn’t a royalty determined in the last two hearings?

The AOGC unanimously rejected the application it heard in November for a few reasons.

The state brine law says a royalty must be “fair and equitable,” and that a substance must be “profitably extracted” in order for a royalty to be paid. The commission must determine if a company’s proposed royalty meets that bar.

One of the key hang-ups last year was that many people, the AOGC commissioners included, felt the royalty proposed by the so-called “Big 5” — Albemarle, Lanxess, Tetra Tech, Standard Lithium and Saltwerx — was not fair and equitable. The companies, for the most part, refused to provide any project data to justify the proposed royalty, citing antitrust concerns.

Multiple commissioners cited that refusal as the key reason they voted to reject the application in November, even as they said they believed the proposed royalty at the time, 1.82%, was not fair and equitable in the first place.

Similarly, the 2023 application filed by Standard Lithium and Lanxess ran into justification issues, with commissioners requesting the companies return with further documentation to support the proposal before they made a decision. Instead, the two companies withdrew the application and eventually signed onto the second application last summer.

Are all of the same companies involved in the royalty the commission is hearing this week?

No. Only Standard Lithium and Equinor, its partner in the SWA Project, are party to this royalty hearing. That means that if the commission decides to approve the proposed royalty, it would apply only to Standard Lithium’s and Equinor’s Reynolds Unit, which encompasses parts of Columbia, Lafayette and Miller Counties. It would not apply to Saltwerx’s Pine Unit, Tetra Tech’s Evergreen Unit, or any of Lanxess’ long-established brine units in Union County.

If the joint venture decides it wants to expand the royalty’s applicability to other units it establishes in the future, it would need to go back before the commission for another royalty determination.

What else should we know about the November 2024 royalty hearing?

The run-up to tomorrow’s hearing has been much quieter than last year’s hearing. Dozens of people objected to the 1.82% royalty proposed in the Big Five application last year.

The South Arkansas Minerals Association, a group representing mineral-rights holders, objected to the first proposed royalty in December 2023, and their objection led to the hearing being delayed from September to November so that the administrative law judge could hold a hearing on certain legal matters. Moulton’s recommendations to the commission after that hearing were largely adopted and played a role in why the Big Five application was rejected.

As of Friday, only one person had filed an objection to the Standard Lithium-Equinor royalty application. Robert Reynolds, the president of SAMA, has not filed an objection, but told the Advocate he would be watching carefully to see if the applicants brought forward sufficient evidence to support their royalty proposal this time around. Until they did, he said, he had no way of knowing if 2.5% is “fair and equitable.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47649/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/el-dorado-chemical-jcs10101-1024x6621748340309.jpg?h=21017897&itok=LI2kSb4q,N,,2025-05-27 09:07:12.229966

President Donald Trump has signed seven CRA resolutions into law.

Resolutions signed by Trump

A Bureau of Ocean Energy Management rule protecting archaeological resources: In March, Trump signed a resolution introduced by Rep. Mike Ezell (R-MS) to overturn the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s Protection of Marine Archaeological Resources rule.

The regulation was supposed to protect and identify archaeological resources on the Outer Continental Shelf before oil and gas operations could take place. The rule required surveys to be conducted of the area by a marine archaeologist who meets the Department of the Interior’s standards. Republicans argued that the rule blocked domestic energy production and burdened oil and gas lessees with costly surveys.

An Environmental Protection Agency rule on methane emissions: In March, Trump signed a resolution offered by Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND) to undo an Environmental Protection Agency rule imposing an annual fee on oil and gas facilities that emit methane emissions exceeding a certain threshold.

A Department of Energy rule on refrigerators and freezers: This month, Trump signed a resolution from Rep. Craig Goldman (R-TX) canceling stringent Department of Energy standards for commercial refrigerators, freezers, and refrigerator-freezers under the agency’s Energy Conservation Program. The regulation aimed to reduce energy consumption and emissions.

A Department of Energy rule on water heaters: Trump also signed Rep. Gary Palmer’s (R-AL) resolution to undo DOE standards on gas-fired water heaters.

A Department of Energy appliance energy conservation program: Trump also signed Rep. Andrew Clyde’s (R-GA) resolution to cancel an energy conservation program run by the DOE that grants appliances a label that shows consumers they are energy-efficient.

A Department of Energy rule on walk-in coolers: Trump also signed a measure to cancel standards for walk-in coolers and freezers.

An IRS rule on crypto brokers: In April, Trump signed Rep. Mike Carey’s (R-OH) resolution canceling an IRS rule classifying some decentralized digital asset entities as brokers subject to reporting rules.

A Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule on bank overdraft fees: In May, Trump signed into law a resolution overturning a CFPB rule that would have limited large banks’ ability to charge clients for overdrawing their bank accounts.

Resolutions sent to Trump’s desk

There are two CRA resolutions that have been sent to Trump’s desk to sign.

A National Park Service limiting ATVs in Glen Canyon: One measure awaiting Trump’s signature is Rep. Celeste Maloy’s (R-UT) resolution overturning a NPS rule limiting the use of all-terrain vehicles and other motor vehicles in environmentally vulnerable areas within the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area.

An Environmental Protection Agency rule on rubber tire factory pollution: Another measure on Trump’s desk is a resolution from Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-VA) to eliminate the EPA’s new standards relating to hazardous air pollutants from rubber tire facilities.

Resolutions that have passed both chambers

Three California emission standards rules: The Senate last week passed three resolutions related to California vehicle emissions. One repeals California’s vehicle emissions waiver, granted by the Biden EPA, that allows the state to set stringent vehicle emission standards, which would encourage the use of electric vehicles and eventually ban gas-powered cars. The other standards that the Senate passed to overturn are state emission regulations on heavy-duty vehicles and nitrogen oxide emissions. The California rules are significant because they are followed by several other states.

A Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule on regulation of digital wallets: Both chambers have passed a resolution from Sen. Pete Ricketts (R-NE) to repeal a CFPB rule for supervising large nonbank companies that offer digital wallets or payment apps.

An Office of the Comptroller of the Currency rule ending expedited bank mergers: Both chambers have passed a resolution from Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) that would cancel an Office of the Comptroller of the Currency rule limiting expedited mergers under the Bank Merger Act.

Legislation that has passed one chamber

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rules on hydrogen vehicles: This month, the Senate passed a measure from Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) that would cancel National Highway Traffic Safety Administration safety rules for hydrogen-powered vehicles.

Federal Communications Commission: In January, the Senate passed a resolution from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) to undo a Federal Communications Commission rule allowing E-Rate funds to subsidize off-campus use of Wi-Fi hot spots.",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/trump-ngo.webp,N,,2025-05-27 10:11:03.493027

Clean energy advocates also say the combined moves will hurt Colorado’s economy by wiping out thousands of jobs, from rooftop solar panel installers to battery makers to wind turbine electricians and mechanics.
Clean energy trade groups are calling for Senate changes, but do not appear overly hopeful.
They pointed to both an end to what they call unfair and unproductive clean energy subsidies, and opening up of more federal and offshore spaces to oil and gas drilling and expanded coal production.
The near-complete House rollbacks of Biden-era green energy subsidies last week were only the latest blows to national and Colorado environmental advocates.","Congressional actions in the past week essentially killed Colorado’s electric vehicle mandate and threaten billions of dollars in solar and wind power construction meant to ease greenhouse gas emissions and ozone, environmental and state political leaders said.

Congress overturned an EPA waiver granted to California to allow that industry-dominating state to ban fossil fuel vehicle sales by 2035, a move that Colorado officials say also negates copycat EV mandates passed by Colorado and a dozen-odd other states.

In 2023, Colorado air regulators voted to require 82% of new vehicles be EVs by 2032, and an increasing share of heavy trucks as well, going well beyond floors set by the EPA. They also required a study of how Colorado could match California’s fossil fuel car ban by 2035.

“I think that this is going to block Colorado from implementing our Clean Car and Truck Rules for now. States need the waiver to enforce their rules,” said Travis Madsen, transportation analyst with the nonprofit Southwest Energy Efficiency Project. “The approach here” — getting Congress instead of an EPA administrator to overturn the waiver “is unprecedented,” Madsen said.

“If it holds up in court, EPA may not be able to issue a similar waiver again in the future. Who knows what that means — it’s totally untested law,” he said. States are vowing to fight the Congressional overturn in court, Madsen said, but “while those challenges move forward, I’d bet that states will not be able to enforce the rules.”

Killing the California and copycat state plans by Congressional vote is at least “inappropriate” given that the General Accounting Office and the Senate parliamentarian said the Congressional Review Act could not be used that way, Colorado Energy Office CEO Will Toor said. California and others are vowing to fight Congress in the courts.

“States should have the ability to take action to protect clean air and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in their state,” Toor said. “So we’ll see where that heads going forward. But it was a very disappointing action.”

Not only California, but all the other following states will lose their authority to establish standards more strict than federal rules, said John Boesert, president of the CalStart clean transportation trade group, in an interview. And the Trump administration has announced it plans to further reduce the already-weaker EPA targets for clean car and truck sales.

“The authority for California and other states to enact stronger standards has been an unqualified success,” Boesert said. “All of the states have been able to grow their economies while significantly improving air quality.”

Colorado’s targets for greenhouse gas reduction and finally meeting EPA ozone caps in the Front Range nonattainment area rely on the goal of nearly 1 million EVs on the road here by 2030. State officials said dealers and consumers were making good progress on that goal with the help of lucrative federal and state subsidies for EV buyers.

But wiping out the mandate on car manufacturers to produce steadily-rising percentages of EVs, along with Congressional budget action to eliminate the $7,500 consumer tax credit, could reverse that, environmental advocates said.

The budget passed by the U.S. House last week also erases many clean energy subsidies including tax credits that made it cheaper to develop utility-scale solar and wind farms, as well as battery and solar panel factories.

“Republicans are showing that they will take unprecedented congressional action to attack a growing and successful market to defend the desires of the polluting oil and gas industry,” said Sierra Club Colorado Chapter political director Garrett Royer.

“The Senate illegally and unconstitutionally” ended California’s EV mandate in a way that will “infringe on states’ rights to pursue clean air protections for their residents. We will continue to fight Congress’ attacks against our environment and affordability,” Royer said.

Clean energy advocates also say the combined moves will hurt Colorado’s economy by wiping out thousands of jobs, from rooftop solar panel installers to battery makers to wind turbine electricians and mechanics.

“The budget reconciliation bill that the U.S. House of Representatives passed overnight is deeply disappointing,” said Nate Bernstein, executive director of the union-backed Climate Jobs Colorado. “it completely guts the federal investments that we were counting on to create good union jobs and drive down energy bills. We hope this damaging proposal is walked back in the Senate.”

The Senate could make changes to the House version of the bill, including restoring some subsidies. But because the budgets are being voted on through a “reconciliation” process, they require only the small majority Republicans hold in both chambers and are not subject to a filibuster by Senate Democrats.

Clean energy trade groups are calling for Senate changes, but do not appear overly hopeful.

“The bill that House Republicans passed will devastate the Colorado solar industry, which accounts for over 8,000 employees and over $600 million of investment in solar installations in 2024 alone,” said KC Becker, CEO of the Colorado Solar and Storage Association and the regional EPA administrator under former President Joe Biden.

“I don’t want to sugarcoat it,” Toor said. “I think we are very concerned about all of the actions that both the administration and now potentially Congress are taking. I’m not sure that I can predict, but we’re certainly hopeful that cooler and wiser heads will prevail in the Senate than in the House.”

Western GOP lawmakers who supported both the killing of clean car waivers and the House budget were as jubilant as progressives were devastated. They pointed to both an end to what they call unfair and unproductive clean energy subsidies, and opening up of more federal and offshore spaces to oil and gas drilling and expanded coal production. They have been referring to the Obama and Biden clean economy efforts, dubbed the Green New Deal, as the “Green New Scam.”

The conservative-led Congressional Western Caucus said the House budget bill “saves Americans approximately $300 billion over 10 years by ending Biden-era electric vehicle mandates.”

U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans, a Republican representing a rare swing constituency in Colorado’s 8th District that takes in north-metro suburbs along U.S. 85 into Greeley, supported the budget but also pointed to earlier statements advocating to preserve some clean energy tax credits that have boosted Colorado solar and wind farms and manufacturing. Evans calls it an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy, expanding fossil fuel production while supporting new technology.

“With all this in mind, we request that any proposed changes to the tax code be conducted in a targeted and pragmatic fashion that promotes conference priorities without undoing current and future private sector investments which will continue to increase domestic manufacturing, promote energy innovation, and keep utility costs down,” Evans wrote in a letter to Congressional leaders.

Some Republican Senators now say they are hopeful the subsidy rollbacks, which went much farther in the final House version than some expected, can be reversed by the time the Senate votes.

The near-complete House rollbacks of Biden-era green energy subsidies last week were only the latest blows to national and Colorado environmental advocates.

Trump administrators had already frozen spending from a $5 billion Biden fund to build more EV charging stations around the country, calling it wasteful and mishandled spending. The Sierra Club, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and others have sued to end that freeze, saying the executive branch doesn’t have constitutional authority to reject Congressionally authorized spending.

The station-building program “benefits everyone, whether you drive an EV or not,” Sierra Club Executive Director Ben Jealous said. “And the only people who benefit from blocking it are big oil and auto executives seeking to keep us hooked on fossil fuel-powered cars.”",https://i0.wp.com/newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rivencharger2-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1443&quality=85&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-27 09:05:50.744797

WATT FUEL CELL COMPLETES INSTALLATION OF ITS LATEST GENERATION FUEL CELL SYSTEM, WATT HOME™, WITHIN PEOPLES NATURAL GAS SERVICE TERRITORY

Locally made fuel cell systems can serve as backup power source for homes by connecting to existing natural gas infrastructure

WATT Fuel Cell, in partnership with Essential Utilities, has successfully installed the next-generation WATT HOME solid oxide fuel cell system in Peoples Natural Gas’ Western Pennsylvania service territory. The installation marks a significant step forward in enhancing energy efficiency and reliability for residential customers.

The WATT HOME system is a cutting-edge technology designed to provide safe, clean, efficient, and reliable energy directly to homes. This system operates by converting natural gas into electricity through an electrochemical process without combustion, offering a sustainable complement or alternative to traditional energy sources.

The installation of a WATT HOME system brings numerous advantages to the homeowner and community at large. Those advantages include increased efficiency, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and a smaller physical footprint. As a back-up power solution, the WATT HOME system provides a dependable source of electricity, minimizing the impact of grid outages.

With the increasing strain on the PJM electric grid from extreme weather events and the retirement of baseload generators, the need for reliable backup power has never been greater. On average, U.S. electricity customers experience approximately 5.5 hours of electricity interruptions annually. WATT HOME fuel cell systems keep the lights on during outages without the noise or pollution created by standard backup power generators.

""The rising frequency and severity of power disruptions highlight the urgent need for resilient, efficient, and clean energy solutions,” said Caine Finnerty, CEO and Founder of WATT Fuel Cell. “When the power goes out, the WATT HOME system activates to ensure your electricity is working all the time.”

Looking Ahead: Future Installations and Rollout Program

As part of Peoples’ commitment to advance innovative energy solutions, Pennsylvania’s largest natural gas utility plans pilot installations of the WATT HOME system in multiple company field offices. These projects will help define the installation and operational process across different use cases, informing a future public rollout.

“The partnership with WATT is the latest in a series of innovative concepts championed by Peoples to meet modern-day energy demands,” said Peoples President Michael Huwar. “The WATT HOME system’s groundbreaking technology has the potential to protect homeowners from volatility in power generation, offering a reliable, resilient and sustainable energy solution that leverages our region’s abundant natural gas supply.”

Here's what consultants say about the industry's future.,Lakshmi Varanasi,,,,,https://www.businessinsider.com/nuclear-power-future-obstacles-2025-5,"Public sentiment is still a headwind There are 94 nuclear reactors in the United States, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.
Last October, Amazon invested $500 million in X-Energy, a developer of small nuclear reactors and fuel.
The Trump administration is also working to jumpstart nuclear reactor construction, building on Biden's ADVANCE Act last year, which sought to remove regulatory hurdles.
There are also lingering concerns about the government's capacity to mitigate nuclear disasters and nuclear power's association with nuclear weapons proliferation.
However, nuclear power remains only a ""medium-term solution,"" McKinsey said in a 2024 report on data centers and power.","It wasn't long ago that the very mention of ""nuclear"" was enough to unsettle people across the ideological spectrum.

Between the meltdown of a nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island, explosions in Chernobyl, and an earthquake-powered disaster at Fukushima, the one thing people seemed to agree on was that nuclear was a dirty, if not dangerous, word.

But times have changed, new insights and new data have emerged, and what once seemed unethical has been rebranded as clean, in every sense.

The nuclear energy renaissance — fueled by Big Tech investment, a more favorable legislative climate, and shifting public opinion — hinges on a change in perspective: Nuclear energy has the potential to be one of the cleanest and most reliable forms of energy on Earth.

But the construction of nuclear reactors in the United States — where nuclear accounted for 19% of electricity generated in 2023, according to the US Energy Information Administration — is lagging compared to efforts in China and elsewhere, according to the Boston Consulting Group.

That's part of why consulting firms are searching for ways for nuclear energy companies to cut costs, improve efficiencies, and remove the obstacles holding up progress.

Public sentiment is still a headwind

There are 94 nuclear reactors in the United States, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute. And tech giants are investing considerably to bring new ones online.

Last October, Amazon invested $500 million in X-Energy, a developer of small nuclear reactors and fuel. Around the same time, Google said it would purchase nuclear energy from Kairos Power, a California-based company developing small modular reactors. The month before, Constellation Energy struck a deal with Microsoft to provide the tech giant with nuclear power for the next two decades by resurrecting part of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania.

The Trump administration is also working to jumpstart nuclear reactor construction, building on Biden's ADVANCE Act last year, which sought to remove regulatory hurdles. Trump issued four executive orders on Friday to accelerate the development of the domestic nuclear energy industry, touching on areas from fuel cycle development to reactor construction, testing, and licensing, to workforce training.

However, hurdles persist.

""Growth in nuclear power is projected to be almost flat to 2050 due to more stringent regulatory requirements than for other low-carbon energy sources, negative public perception, perceived safety issues, supply chain constraints, and uncertainty around waste disposal,"" McKinsey & Company wrote in its 2024 Global Energy Perspective.

Some of the persisting negative sentiment can be attributed to concerns about how the radioactive waste that nuclear reactors generate will be stored. The federal government once planned to direct all waste to Yucca Mountain in Nevada, but lawmakers and the public objected.

There are also lingering concerns about the government's capacity to mitigate nuclear disasters and nuclear power's association with nuclear weapons proliferation.

There is hope, however. In 2024, three-quarters of respondents, out of a sample of 3.5 million people used by Bisconti Research, said they favored the use of nuclear energy for electricity, up from about half in the 1980s and 1990s.

The efficiency of construction

Large-scale nuclear reactors require a significant investment in time and money. They necessitate significant upfront capital and require long construction windows that are often beset by delays, cost issues, and regulatory hurdles.

BCG says that the ""simpler the design, the better."" The firm said the optimal design should follow ""a 'design-for-manufacturing' approach, which has delivered compelling results in other industries such as aerospace and defense.""

The goal, according to BCG, should be to standardize the components and material needed for construction, along with reducing the number of construction steps to promote ""modularity,"" the firm said. That applies to both large-scale and small-scale reactors, Benjamin Vannier, managing director and partner at BCG, told BI by email. The AP1000, a large-scale pressurized water reactor, is an example of a reactor designed for modular construction, he added.

Modularity is perhaps the biggest trend in nuclear right now. There are a number of small modular reactor companies, like Oklo, which was until recently chaired by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman; TerraPower, which is backed by Bill Gates; and X-Energy, which Amazon invested $500 million in last year. These more compact nuclear reactors are designed to be built in factories and then shipped to sites for installation and are, therefore, easier to standardize for production.

The economics of scaling

Nuclear fission, which produces energy by splitting uranium atoms, releases almost no greenhouse gas emissions. Many AI executives consider nuclear fission the only reliable way to power their data centers.

Tech leaders are also excited by recent advances in fusion technology, which involves combining two atomic nuclei to release energy and is considered safer than fission. Type One Energy, funded by Gates, published research in March that shows there are no scientific barriers left to making commercial fusion a reality.

However, nuclear power remains only a ""medium-term solution,"" McKinsey said in a 2024 report on data centers and power. ""The timeline to scale nuclear so it can achieve rapid, repeated deployment is nearly a decade, while constraints on data center power are appearing today.""

It added, ""The early economics of nuclear are challenging compared with other energy options, and implementing various technologies to try to reduce its costs may or may not work.""

While power plants are relatively cheap to run in the long term and can last as long as 60 years, they require considerable upfront investment.

In a report published in 2017, the World Nuclear Association said that nuclear plants are strongly influenced by capital cost, which accounts for at least 60% of their total levelized cost of electricity, which is essentially a measure of a plant's economic efficiency. It is calculated by dividing the total cost to build and operate a power plant over its lifetime by the total electricity output.

Generative AI may help improve efficiencies on the operating side. Rafee Tarafdar, the chief technology officer of Infosys, a global consulting firm, told BI that the firm is helping companies integrate AI into their plans.

""One proof of value that we built is: How do we use all the logs, all the sensors that come from all these machines in order to triage, predict failures, and help resolve issues much earlier,"" he said, in reference to the work the firm did with a large US energy company.

The consensus among consulting firms is that solving early construction bottlenecks is key to scaling nuclear energy as a viable power source for AI and beyond.",https://i.insider.com/682e624dac40ae2b0c9eb9f8?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-05-27 09:06:48.099976

India’s renewable advantage India’s vast solar and wind resources provide a strong base for green hydrogen production.","As the world races to address the climate crisis, green hydrogen emerges as both a promising solution and a potential disruptor in the clean energy landscape. Unlike conventional hydrogen derived from fossil fuels, green hydrogen is produced using renewable energy sources and emits zero carbon in the process. For India—committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2070—green hydrogen is not merely an opportunity; it is a necessity.

Why green hydrogen matters

Green hydrogen, produced using renewable electricity through electrolysis, is gaining global attention as a versatile and zero-emission fuel. Unlike grey hydrogen derived from fossil fuels, green hydrogen offers a clean energy alternative that can be applied across diverse sectors—transportation, industry, and power. It acts as both a fuel and an energy carrier, capable of stabilising grids by storing excess renewable power and meeting peak demand. More importantly, it plays a pivotal role in decarbonising “hard-to-abate” industries such as steel, cement, ammonia, and long-haul transport, where direct electrification is impractical or costly. For a developing country like India, green hydrogen is not just a technological opportunity—it is an essential enabler for sustainable growth. It bridges the gap between the present carbon-intensive infrastructure and a future powered by renewables. By integrating green hydrogen, India can balance economic development with environmental goals, making strides toward its 2070 net-zero target. The adoption of green hydrogen also offers energy security, reducing dependency on imported fossil fuels. As climate change intensifies, India must embrace green hydrogen as a strategic solution—both to meet its international climate commitments and to transition into a resilient, clean-energy economy.

For India, green hydrogen offers a pathway to reconcile economic development with environmental stewardship.

A bold beginning

India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission, launched in January 2023 with Rs 19,744 crore, aims to produce 5 million metric tonnes (MMT) of green hydrogen annually by 2030. The initiative supports over 125 GW of renewable energy and could reduce 50 MMT of CO2 per year while creating 600,000 jobs. Financial support under the SIGHT program and pilot projects in steel and shipping show India’s intent to lead in green hydrogen. These steps aim to align clean energy goals with national development..

To drive this mission, the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) program offers financial incentives—Rs 17,490 crore to support production and electrolyser manufacturing. Pilot projects in sectors like shipping and steel are already underway, including plans to retrofit vessels and develop green ammonia refuelling hubs at key ports. These are not just technical experiments; they are strategic moves to anchor India’s place in the global hydrogen economy.

India’s renewable advantage

India’s vast solar and wind resources provide a strong base for green hydrogen production. With 180 GW of renewable energy already installed and a 2030 target of 500 GW, India can produce green hydrogen affordably. Large corporations like Reliance and Adani plan major investments, potentially increasing production beyond the government’s targets. These efforts support India’s climate goals under the Paris Agreement, helping reduce carbon intensity and dependence on coal.

Green hydrogen could become the cornerstone of India’s clean energy strategy, combining low costs with global competitiveness.

Staying competitive in a global race

Green hydrogen costs currently range between $2.7-8.8/kg but are expected to fall to $2-6/kg by 2030. Countries like China are scaling fast, lowering global costs through technology and manufacturing dominance. India must stay competitive by expanding domestic electrolyser production, building full hydrogen value chains, and forming strategic partnerships. Government incentives—such as capital subsidies and tariff waivers—could help green hydrogen reach parity with fossil-based alternatives. With coordinated efforts, India can be a leader in the global hydrogen economy.

To stay competitive, India must act swiftly and strategically. Building robust domestic manufacturing capabilities is crucial—not just for electrolysers but for the entire green hydrogen value chain. India must also actively engage in global partnerships, secure access to critical minerals, and create a business environment that attracts both domestic and foreign investment.

Overcoming key challenges

India faces several hurdles—high capital costs, raw material dependence, safety issues, and limited infrastructure for hydrogen transport and storage. Financing is another major concern, especially in emerging markets. Innovative funding models and policy support are needed to attract investments. Environmental oversight is also essential, as hydrogen could indirectly affect greenhouse gases like methane and ozone. India must ensure robust monitoring to maintain its green credentials. Overcoming these issues is key to unlocking the full potential of green hydrogen.

Environmental safeguards also need to evolve. Though hydrogen is a clean fuel, it can indirectly impact greenhouse gas levels by affecting methane and ozone concentrations. India must therefore adopt strong monitoring and regulatory mechanisms to ensure that green hydrogen truly remains green.

A call to action

The National Green Hydrogen Mission is a strong first step, but India must adopt a whole-of-economy approach to scale its efforts. Integrating green hydrogen into national policies, trade strategies, and urban planning is crucial. International partnerships, such as with the EU, can support technology transfer and market access. India has a unique chance to lead the global green hydrogen movement. But quick action, bold investments, and strategic planning are needed to ensure long-term success and global leadership in clean energy.

India has a window of opportunity to lead the world in green hydrogen—but this window will not stay open forever. With bold leadership, targeted investments, and strategic global engagement, India can position itself as a clean energy powerhouse, proving that climate responsibility and economic ambition can go hand in hand.",https://gumlet.assettype.com/downtoearth%2F2025-05-27%2Fjsg6rctk%2FGreen-Hydrogen.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-05-27 09:06:17.942663

Voters will take up the 46-article warrant, which includes a $7.68 million municipal operating budget, starting at 9 a.m. at the Shutesbury Elementary School.

The budget is up 5.8%, or $425,451, from this year’s $7.25 million, and includes a $1.78 million assessment for the Amherst Pelham Regional Schools. That assessment is increasing 7.8%, or $126,789, from this year’s $1.65 million assessment, with Shutesbury obligated to pay this amount because Amherst, Pelham and Leverett have already adopted their assessments toward the $37.08 million regional schools budget.

Also included in the town spending is the budget for the elementary school, up by 5%, or $124,241, from $2.47 million to $2.59 million. Other changes include boosting the administrative assistant position to $44,265, up $14,701, for 32-hour workweeks, and increasing health insurance payments by 19%, or $99,000, from $520,000 to $619,000.

Other spending will mostly be covered by free cash, with $50,000 going toward establishing a mitigation fund for PFAS contamination, and another $100,000 coming from the stabilization account. Another $30,000 in free cash will cover legal expenses related to protecting the town’s solar bylaw.

The warrant includes several capital purchases and repairs through free cash, including fixing the Highway Department grader for $16,600, buying a zero-turn lawn mower for the Highway Department for $11,400, completing Town Hall meeting room repairs for $10,000 and replacing the Town Hall fire alarm system for $8,648.

Finally, $8,000 in free cash will serve as matching funds for an $80,000 Rural Development Fund Grant that will evaluate sources of erosion into Lake Wyola and potential mitigation and management measures.

Several projects are being supported by Community Preservation Act money. They include $72,900 to restore, repair and preserve the recreational trails in the South Brook Conservation Area; $13,775 to develop a scope of work for dam repair and maintenance of the Lake Wyola dam; $9,000 to preserve, rehabilitate and restore historic gravestones at West Cemetery; and $4,000 to remove invasive plants and replace them with native species at the Top of the Lake Conservation Area.

Also, $6,482 in CPA spending will complete the work of fixing up the historic Town Common guideboard, with an additional $2,250 going toward building a concrete foundation base for the guideboard.

Green articles

The Energy and Climate Action Committee is seeking endorsement of the “Zero-Emission First Vehicle” policy and to repeal a policy adopted in 2011 in which only fuel-efficient vehicles are purchased.

The purpose of this is to “advance the economic, energy and climate sustainability of municipal operations by achieving long-term reductions in energy costs, energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions,” with hopes to accelerate the adoption of emissions-reduction technologies and the transition of the fleet to all electric or other environmentally advantageous vehicles. The new policy does allow for the town’s purchases of such vehicles “as financially feasible and practicably appropriate.”

That committee is also recommending adoption of the state’s specialized energy, which will impact new construction and existing buildings by further reducing the climate impacts of buildings, with the goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from the buildings sector no later than 2050. This means the town will go beyond the existing stretch energy code.

Shutesbury voters will also be asked to commit to a “municipal decarbonization,” defined as the elimination of all on-site burning of fossil fuels in municipal buildings and vehicles, by 2050, in accordance with state climate goals.

Other bylaws and policies

A citizen petition is promoting the town as a safe and welcoming community, building on the “Honoring our Differences in a Safe Community” passed in 2017.

A petition also seeks support for Massachusetts Medicare for All, which would promote the idea of establishing a single-payer health care system in the state.

Revised rules for use of Lake Wyola are in the “Watercraft and Persons Using Lake Wyola” bylaw, last amended in 2014.

Sponsored by the Lake Wyola Safety and Boating Committee, this makes minimal changes to the current bylaw, which has rules setting the speed limit at 30 mph during the daytime, and 5 mph from dusk to dawn, requiring motorboats to go counterclockwise, limiting water skiing to daylight hours and requiring swimmers to be accompanied by a boat when they are 150 feet or more from shore.

The major change includes adding a statement to the bylaw that “reckless or unsafe boating is prohibited, including speeding near shorelines, swimmers, or docks, boating under the influence, and failing to maintain a proper lookout,” setting 8 a.m. as the specific dusk time and increasing the speed limit to 6 mph, which matches state regulations.

Matt Borowiec, who chairs the Lake Wyola Boating & Safety Review Committee, told the Select Board that there has been a strong push for more education, but not other major changes.

The Planning Board is updating the town’s zoning bylaws. One will remove the rate-of-growth provisions from the town’s zoning, because the effective dates have expired. A second will add language regulating so-called tiny houses, which are now included in the state building code. Finally, accessory dwelling units, which are now part of the state’s Affordable Homes Act and a protected use, will be included in the bylaws.

Town Clerk Grace Bannasch is bringing forward the amended “Dog Licensing And Control Bylaw” adopted in 2002. The impetus for this is the kennel license procedure and Ollie’s Law passed last year by the state Legislature, though this doesn’t impact any residents. The bylaw change will be to have the dog tag year be done on the calendar year rather than fiscal year, so licenses will be renewed in January, which Bannasch said will “make a lot more sense to the average dog owner than renewing them in July.”

Finally, another citizen petition seeks to create a bylaw requiring a landowner’s written permission before anyone is allowed to “trap, fish, hunt, or discharge a firearm, bow, or other weapon for the purposes of hunting animals, fish, birds, or any game on any private property in the town.”

Few revolutions happen as quickly or as quietly as the rise of the e-bike. In 2023 alone, 40 million e-bikes were sold globally, matching, and in many places outpacing, new car sales. That’s a scale of adoption not seen since the smartphone boom. And yet, this story is only just beginning.

One of the key reasons Upway was founded is our strong belief that the car industry, and car-centric culture more broadly, is already in decline and will no longer hold a dominant share of mobility within the next 50 years. Why? Because lightweight electric mobility is better suited to the demands of modern urban life, and more crucially, to the existential challenges we face today.

The car’s waning reign

The 20th century was undeniably shaped by the car. It brought freedom, convenience, and economic growth. Entire cities were designed around the automobile. But since the car’s golden era between 1970s and early 2010s, when production in the US ballooned from 30 to nearly 60 million vehicles annually, the cracks have started to show.

We now know the costs: cars account for around 60% of global transport emissions, and a staggering 80% of car trips in the US are under 10 miles. This is a distance that could easily be replaced by cleaner, smaller modes of transport.

Congestion, too, has spiralled out of control, costing the US economy an estimated $90 billion annually. In fact, last year the average American spent longer than a work-week sitting in traffic.

Then there’s the human toll. Road traffic accidents cause 1.2 million deaths per year, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries. And despite decades of innovation, car-related deaths in the US have remained high, falling only 21% from 1991 to 2021, while countries like Spain saw reductions of up to 86%.

Add to this the growing body of evidence linking car emissions to pollution-related illnesses. The 2017 Lancet Commission attributed nine million deaths per year globally to pollution, many of which stem from fossil fuel combustion. These are not just numbers; they represent a massive public health failure that disproportionately affects the poorest communities worldwide.

At the same time global oil reserves, the lifeblood of the car market, are in long-term decline. Oil is a finite resource and experts warn that conventional reserves are being depleted faster than they are replaced. As demand continues to rise, especially from the transport sector, the industry is becoming increasingly reliant on harder-to-extract and environmentally damaging sources. This growing scarcity not only threatens energy security but also underscores the unsustainable foundation of a car-dependent economy.

The electric car: Not a silver bullet

It’s tempting to believe electric cars are the answer, but the data tells a more complicated story. EV production relies heavily on rare metals, which are resource-intensive and geopolitically volatile. Battery manufacturing has a large environmental footprint, and the global electricity grid remains largely fossil-fuel based. Transitioning to an all-EV fleet will take decades and the infrastructure to support that vision is nowhere near ready.

Meanwhile, insurance premiums are soaring, raw material costs are volatile, and car ownership is becoming increasingly unaffordable for younger and lower-income populations.

So where do we turn?

The case for e-bikes

Electric bikes provide a radically different and compelling alternative. Their carbon footprint is microscopic compared to cars: just 21g of CO₂ per kilometre.

E-bikes take up a fraction of the space that cars do in crowded cities, cause no local pollution, and are agile enough to dodge traffic. They’re increasingly diverse in function too, covering use cases from daily commuting to heavy-duty cargo hauling.

Affordability is a major part of the equation. Consider the cost breakdown: a typical car priced just under $50,000 loses around $4,000 in value each year. Factor in fuel, maintenance, insurance, and financing, and you’re looking at an annual outlay of around $10,000. In contrast, an e-bike might cost around $2,500, with depreciation of just $250 per year. When you add up the significantly lower maintenance and insurance costs, the total annual spend comes to roughly $725—a fraction of what it costs to run a car.

It comes as no surprise then, that e-bikes are already outselling electric cars in the US. In 2021, e-bike sales surpassed those of electric cars, with Americans buying around 800,000 e-bikes compared to estimated 650,000 electric vehicles. This milestone went largely unnoticed in mainstream discourse but signals a fundamental shift in how people are choosing to move.

This shift is being turbocharged by policy. From New York’s congestion pricing scheme, to Paris converting four-lane roads into bike boulevards, and California, Vermont and Minnesota offering e-bike incentives, governments are beginning to dismantle car-first infrastructure in favour of more sustainable options. Cities like Milan and NYC are building hundreds of miles of protected lanes.

Why second-hand is the key

If we want to democratise this movement, we must make e-bikes more accessible. That’s where the second-hand market comes in.

At Upway, we’ve built our business around three core pillars: trust, affordability, and choice. By refurbishing high-quality e-bikes and offering them at up to 60% off the retail price, we’re lowering the barrier to entry and giving people a reliable alternative to car ownership.

The opportunity is enormous. With e-bike sales projected to nearly double by 2030—reaching 77 million units annually—a thriving resale market will be essential to meet demand sustainably. And unlike electric cars, which depreciate rapidly and are expensive to maintain, e-bikes are simpler, cheaper, and easier to reuse.

Make no mistake: cars will still play a role, particularly for rural travel, freight, and users with mobility needs. But for the vast majority of short urban trips, the kind that clog roads, pollute air, and waste time, there is a better way.

The transition away from car dominance is not just desirable; it’s inevitable. What’s exciting is that we’re not waiting for the future to arrive, it’s already happening. And it’s arriving on two wheels.",https://zagdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Upway-Maxime-Renson-fotor-20250214162341.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 06:11:18.103756

“The utility limits the fuel cell project economics to the onsite fuel cell customer, whichultimately bears the cost of the system.","The economy is rapidly shifting to one where a big factor limiting growth is the availability of electrical power.

Driven by AI, the US will consume more electricity to process data in 2030 than it will to manufacture all energy-intensive goods combined, including aluminum, steel, cement and chemicals, according to a recent report from the International Energy Agency.

If data centers cannot get the power they need, their growth will be stifled — and rate payers will revolt if they are asked to bear the cost of the utility upgrades needed to serve those data centers.

Utilities are recognizing that the centralized grid approach to generating and distributing power, which has reigned for a century, isn’t always the most effective way to provide quick time-to-power. Thus, it is no surprise that utilities are increasingly turning to onsite or distributed power solutions which can be installed fast and supplement grid power.

Among the host of approaches, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) represent a proven, flexible, scalable technologythat empowers utilities to deliver clean, resilient power quickly, when and where it's needed most, often deployable in months versus years.

For energy leaders confronting mounting capacity constraints and growing interconnection queues, SOFCs represent not just a response, but a strategic advantage.

How fuel cells work

A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that generates electricity and heat by directly converting the chemical energy of a fuel to electric energy through a reaction with oxygen, without combustion. Unlike traditional power generation, which burns fuel to drive turbines or pistons, fuel cells use a cleaner, more efficient reaction that significantly reduces the generation of criteria pollutants.

The basic principles of fuel cells have been known since the mid-1800s, but it was not until the 1960s that practical systems arrived and gained prominence in NASA space missions. Today, there are many varieties of modern fuel cell technologies, and they are used in everything from vehicles to large-scale power plants.

Solid oxide fuel cells stand out because of their high efficiency, long life and lower operating costs. While other types of fuel cells use precious metals, corrosive acids or molten materials to generate electricity, SOFCs use a solid ceramic electrolyte coated with proprietary inks. Fuel and air pass over different sides of the fuel cell, while oxygen ions pass through the electrolyte and recombine with fuel elements to release electrons that generate electricity. Operating very quietly at around 850˚C, SOFCs achieve high thermal efficiencies and have great reliability, given their small number of moving parts.

The technology is compact and scalable, enabling utilities to install it and bring it online quickly, then expand it easily as customers’ power needs grow. Multiple SOFCs can be stacked into modules that can be combined to form power generation systems tailored to customer needs. Their modularity means capacity is limited only by available space. Bloom Energy, a leader in onsite power solutions, can deliver up to 100 MW of electricity in an acre, more than twice the power density compared to traditional combustion generation technologies.

Given their operational profile, SOFCs are not just backup power options: They serve as primary power providers for multi-technology systems, where they complement other energy resources. SOFC power systems can operate as either grid-connected or standalone resources, offering flexibility and supporting resilience strategies such as operating during outages.

In fact, SOFCs even eliminate the need for backup power by offering a cleaner and more cost-effective alternative to traditional generation, such as diesel generators. They also offer increased electrical reliability and improved energy security because they produce power at or near the point of consumption, so they do not require miles of high-tension power lines.

SOFC power generation can achieve commercial operation faster than traditional solutions

Utilities can benefit from fuel cell systems in several ways. One major advantage is reducing the time to power for new large-load customers, such as data centers, manufacturing facilities or hospitals. Rather than waiting for Transmission & Distribution upgrades, utilities can deploy fuel cell systems directly at the customer site, bypassing long interconnection queues or bridging the power gap while transmission and distribution infrastructure is built.

“Fuel cells are a win-win move for utilities with power-hungry data center customers,” said Kris Kim, Vice President, Global Power & Utilities for Bloom Energy. “The utility limits the fuel cell project economics to the onsite fuel cell customer, whichultimately bears the cost of the system. That satisfies the utility commission because there's no impact to the rest of the ratepayers. Meanwhile, the customer gets power faster, the utility remains the energy provider, and no other ratepayers are affected. Everyone wins.”

This is not just theory: Utilities have already started using fuel cells as a cost-effective alternative to billion-dollar grid investments. For example, Consolidated Edison avoided a $1.2 billion system upgrade by incentivizing 52 MW of local energy efficiency and distributed generation projects, which included storage, demand response, and fuel cells, at a cost of just $200 million.

In addition to faster capacity deployment, SOFC systems are also fuel-flexible. SOFCs can operate on natural gas, biogas, hydrogen or blends, enabling utilities to meet today’s needs while preparing for the future. SOFCs do not require additional water during normal operation, enhancing their sustainability. And because there is no combustion used for power generation, they emit almost no smog-forming pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide.

Finally, fuel cells support decarbonization goals by simplifying carbon capture and sequestration and helping customers achieve near-zero carbon power, while still having a reliable, consistent source of power.

“Because SOFCs can operate on different fuels, the technology is future-proofed for customers who value decarbonization and want the ability to use different fuels as they become more widely available,” Kim said.

Infrastructure isn’t being built fast enough, and supply-side solutions are struggling to keep up. But what if the answer has been right under our roofs all along?

Welcome to the new frontier of grid reliability: the rise of residential Distributed Energy Resources (DERs).

The rise of residential DERs

DERs are transforming the way energy is generated, stored, and consumed. Devices like rooftop solar panels, home batteries, smart thermostats, EV chargers and electric water heaters aren’t just saving homeowners money, they’re becoming strategic grid assets.

Once these technologies were considered fringe or supplemental; now foundational to a distributed, resilient energy system. And the numbers reflect it. According to Guidehouse Insights, flexible residential DER capacity is expected to triple from 28.4 GW in 2023 to more than 96 GW by 2032.

That’s not just growth, it’s grid-scale transformation.

Virtual power plants: Real value

When aggregated at scale, these devices combine into what’s known as a Virtual Power Plant (VPP), a coordinated network of DERs that collectively responds to grid conditions. Think of it as a community-powered solution, where households work together to balance supply and demand.

And the value to utilities isn’t just theoretical. A 2023 report from The Brattle Group estimates that VPPs could provide up to 60 GW of capacity in the U.S. at 40–60% of the cost of traditional supply-side alternatives. That equates to $15–35 billion in potential savings over the next decade.

VPPs help utilities:

Reduce peak demand without major infrastructure investments

Mitigate blackout risk during extreme weather events

Advance decarbonization efforts with clean, distributed assets

The time to act is now

With flexible load adoption on the rise and DER ownership growing rapidly, utilities have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to shape the future of energy delivery.

Several key trends are converging including increasingly affordable smart home and electrification measures, and strong public interest in sustainability, resiliency and energy savings. To capitalize on these trends, utilities should go beyond traditional infrastructure planning. This moment calls for a strategic shift from traditional grid management to proactive customer engagement.

The path forward: Partner with experience

Turning DER potential into real capacity requires more than just technology. It requires trust, education, and thoughtful program design.

That’s where Franklin Energy comes in.

We partner with utilities to deliver turnkey residential load management programs integrating smart devices, customer behavior insights and grid-optimization strategies into seamless solutions.

There is also the possibility of adding more renewable energy generation and storage that is reliable and consistent in its supply.

The statement said: “To this end, the consortia will work closely with the relevant national authorities throughout the development process, seeking necessary approvals at various project phases, and paving the way for this significant regional power integration and energy interconnection.”

It added that the agreement, inked on the sidelines of the ongoing Asean summit in Kuala Lumpur during Malaysia’s stint as Asean chair, marked “a significant step forward in operationalising the tripartite collaboration and affirmed a shared commitment to advancing cross-border renewable energy trade”.

“This milestone reflects growing momentum in the realisation of the Asean power grid, reinforcing regional cooperation towards a more resilient, sustainable and interconnected energy future.”

This partnership aims to open pathways for a scalable model of cross-border renewable energy cooperation in South-east Asia, which would position the region as a global leader in collaborative decarbonisation and energy transition.

Wong Kim Yin, chief executive officer of Sembcorp Industries, said that this agreement highlights Singapore’s strategic role as a demand centre and a key enabler of cross-border power imports to support its decarbonisation goals.

“We are committed to support Asean’s low-carbon transition through shared infrastructure and strengthened partnerships,” he added.

Tenaga’s chief executive officer Megat Jalaluddin Megat Hassan and Petronas chief executive officer Tengku Muhammad Taufik – who are members of the Malaysian energy consortium – said in a joint statement that the country’s participation in this initiative reflects its strong commitment to the vision of establishing an Asean power grid, which aims to strengthen regional energy security through the creation of a power transit hub.

“This tripartite partnership is a step forward in advancing transnational green infrastructure, tapping into Vietnam’s renewable energy potential, and delivering stable, low-carbon electricity to communities and businesses,” they added.

Vietnam’s Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính had previously highlighted offshore wind as a national priority.

By participating in this trilateral collaboration, Vietnam aims to catalyse new economic opportunities, stimulate sustainable growth and generate quality employment, the statement said.

Tran Ho Bac, chief executive officer of PTSC, said: “This agreement highlights the role of PTSC in particular, and PVN as a whole, in advancing national energy transition strategies. We expect its effective implementation will mark a significant milestone – a starting point for renewable energy investment in Vietnam.”",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/c5c0bf0425654829d7596f2205263cad4c161d8484d1730c5a12452fae90b57f?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-05-27 06:11:51.256866

Strengthen policy levers The official support for investment and demand stimuli needs policy enablers to accelerate the market uptake.
This provides direction to the EV policy 2.0 of the Delhi government.","Within a tight timeframe of 2026-2030, both the automobile industry and the battery manufacturing industry — that have qualified for production linked incentives (PLI) — are expected to make huge investments to localise manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs) and components and ensure the market uptake of the new production to avail of the incentives.

Yet, the regulatory enablers to create committed market demand to absorb this investment within the same time frame are uncertain.

Similarly, under different demand incentive programmes, the consumers are also required to absorb an assigned number of EVs to stimulate a much larger market demand to move towards the intended ambition of at least 30 per cent fleet electrification by 2030 or even higher level for two-three wheelers. But the current annual market penetration is still hovering at only 6.5 per cent.

The continuous policy flip flop on the expected regulatory target for EV market penetration is making the investment climate as well as the trajectory of zero tailpipe emissions transition, uncertain.

Risking localisation

Even when the official policy is so deeply interested in pushing its industry to localise the value chain and use demand incentives to create a critical mass of market demand, the policy steps on setting firm targets for time-bound upscaling of the EV transition, is weak and hesitant. There is no firm signal.

Take for instance, the PLI schemes for local manufacturing of 50 GW of advanced chemistry cell and battery storage with support of Rs 25,938 crore by 2030. The beneficiary firms under this scheme are required to achieve a domestic value addition of up to 60 per cent within five years and make mandatory investment of Rs 225 crore /GWh for committed manufacturing capacity within two years and sell between 2025 and 2029 to access the PLI incentives within this period.

So far, three beneficiary firms have been allocated a total capacity of 30 GWh. The information from the Press Information Bureau (PIB) statement of December 2024 shows only a capacity of 1 GWh is pilot-run by Ola Cell Technologies Private Limited. Where is the policy to create a market for 50 GW within that time frame?

If industry has to sell at least 30 GW of batteries by 2030, the current fleet of EVs are absorbing just about 4 GWh of battery (as of 2023) — according to the S&P Global. According to the estimates of the International Council on Clean Transportation, the FAME incentive for 1 million electric two-wheelers can create demand for only about 2.3 GWh of battery cells. The larger demand for GWh scale of battery development will come from four wheelers as their battery capacity is about 10 to 20 times larger than the electric two-wheelers. Only scale can make the PLI scheme more viable by 2030. But what will change dramatically in the next five years without strong policy enablers and levers?

Similarly, in the case of the PLI Scheme for Automobile and Auto Components scheme that has been extended by one year to 2027-28, the incentive will be provided for determined sales for a total of five consecutive financial years, starting from the financial year 2023-24 to 2027-28.

Yet again, the PIB information shows that of the Rs 25,938 crore allocated, the actual disbursement of the aggregate incentive is only about Rs 322 crore (1.2 per cent) for FY 2023-24 — the first performance year of the scheme, that has been disbursed only in FY 2024-25.

It’s too little and too late. While industry needs to be pushed to ramp up its assembly line quickly, firm policy signals are also needed on the expected scale of the market to be supported by regulatory targets.

Already, the massive committed investments for incentive support (adding up the PLIs and all the incentive programmes), adds up to Rs 74,023.33 crore until 2030. The PLI schemes have further attracted more proposals of additional investment from the industry reflecting the market interest. But this has to materialise.

There is a significant lesson in the first generation compressed natural gas programme in Delhi when its market was created with a firm regulatory mandate when the conventional and incremental technologies of petrol and diesel dominated.

Moreover, the government’s own investments in supply chain of critical mineral supply for a self-reliant ecosystem also requires certainty in the EV industry roadmap.

Strengthen policy levers

The official support for investment and demand stimuli needs policy enablers to accelerate the market uptake.

Need state level drivers: It is encouraging how some state governments are coming forward to accelerate the EV transition.

The most significant is the lead taken by the Maharashtra government to set the overall as well as vehicle segment-wise electrification targets in its newly released ‘Maharashtra Electric Vehicle Policy 2025’ this month. While aiming for 30 per cent electrification of all new vehicles by 2030, it has apportioned further targets to vehicle segments — 40 per cent of all new 2/3 wheelers, 30 per cent of new cars, 25 per cent of the of four-wheeler goods carriers, 40 per cent of buses, among others, by 2030. The policy also provides for state-level incentives for a fixed number of vehicles in each category. The passenger vehicles will also be exempted from toll tax. This policy has not been diluted by including incremental, alternative fuel-powered internal combustion engine (ICE) technologies and hybrids.

Similarly, the new draft EV policy 2.0 of the Delhi government under discussion has aimed for an ambitious 95 per cent fleet electrification based on battery operated fully EVs in the time frame of 2027-30.

Further, the Supreme Court has asked all government owned, public institution and public undertaking-owned vehicles in Delhi to be EVs. This provides direction to the EV policy 2.0 of the Delhi government.

From this perspective, it will be beneficial if the recent advisory from the Commission for Air Quality Management — that has put both EVs and the alternative fuel-powered ICEs including CNG, ethanol and hybrid modes in the same bracket as the EVs — to further refine and develop a more differentiated policy approach to support rapid electrification for clean air and to support the Delhi government’s ambition.

This is much needed in this polluted region, as a 2025 study from the National Institute of Advanced Studies has shown that if Delhi achieves full EV adoption, the highest reduction in ambient PM2.5 concentration will be possible with a 26 per cent reduction in mortality, related healthcare costs, 13 per cent in morbidity costs, and 27 per cent in per capita healthcare costs.

Need central drivers: At the same time, nationally, more stringent fuel economy norms and zero emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandates are needed to build strong obligation for the industry to quicken the pace of electrification across segments.

While efforts are underway to develop these norms for two wheelers and heavy duty segments, the car norms have been revised. But the draft corporate average fuel consumption standards (CAFÉ) for cars that was put up for consultation way back in April, is not yet out.

The proposed CAFÉ III and IV norms are proposed to be 91.7gCO2/km for the period 2027-2032 and 70gCO2/km during 2032-37. This needs to be firmed up immediately even though there is a scope of further tightening of these norms. As a reference, by 2030, the European Union (EU) would begin to enforce the standard 49gCO2/km that will require massive electrification.

India’s draft norms need to achieve the desirable increase in the actual and absolute EV numbers. The system of giving extra points or super credits to different technology approaches to meet the norms need to create stronger opportunities for EVs and not the incremental technologies including alternative fuels or hybridisation that are well-established technologies for improving fuel efficiency of the ICE vehicles. These super credits need to taper off.

Placing regulatory obligations through ZEV mandate can be a stronger driver of change.

Create policy stakes in new industrial transition

Despite the challenges, the reality is that even with the current policy signals and the incentive programmes, industrial investments in EV manufacturing have begun to expand and the product portfolio is diversifying.

There is, therefore, no room for policy uncertainty and turnaround anymore.

This change is evident in the official information on the domestic value addition certification (DVA) from the testing agencies. As per the PIB statement of March 27, 2025, six applicants under the original equipment manufacturing (OEM) category have received DVA certification for 66 variants, while seven applicants under the Component Champion category have received DVA certification for 22 variants.

According to the available information, the first movers are Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Motors, and Ola Electric. Mahindra & Mahindra is the first company to meet the DVA criteria in the three-wheeler category, while Tata Motors is the first company to meet the DVA criteria for both four-wheeler and bus categories. Ola Electric is the first two-wheeler company to meet the DVA criteria. Individually these companies have achieved noticeable EV share in their total annual production.

The growing industry interest in manufacturing is also evident in the fact that a total of 115 companies have filed 120 applications under the PLI scheme for automobiles and auto components. Of these, 85 applicants have been approved. This also reflects the optimism in the market.

Frontrunners, including Tata Motors, Mahindra and Mahindra and MG Motors dominate EV car sales. A Centre for Science and Environment analysis of the VAHAN database for the year 2023-24 shows rapid diversification of car models and variants from 15 in 2021 to 30 in 2024.

There is higher diversity in vehicle models and improved range for the same price range, reduced battery prices and improved battery energy densities. Upcoming models are bridging the price diversity gap, and integrating advanced features.

Similarly, e-two-wheeler models have increased from 195 models in 2021, to over 350 models today. The e-two-wheeler segment that was primarily start-up led, has now seen entry and growing market share of the traditional OEMs including Bajaj Auto Ltd and TVS. Considerably more dormant demand can be unlocked in all segments with reliable charging infrastructure.

Future is electric

Clearly, there is no scope of turning back to stop India from developing an electric vehicle programme as a self-reliant industrial policy to meet the needs of climate and clean air action, industrial development, and clean energy transition in the automotive sector. Sooner the targets are set, the better.",https://gumlet.assettype.com/downtoearth%2F2025-05-27%2Fpkpri7g2%2FEV-1.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-05-27 06:11:21.354118

Australia’s Queensland cancels planned 450MW wind farm

Sydney, 26 May (Argus) — Australian state Queensland's Liberal National Party (LNP) government has cancelled the proposed 450MW Moonlight Range wind farm, following a majority of public submissions supporting the rejection. The government received over 550 submissions, 142 from local residents, with 85pc supporting a review of the project's application, according to a press statement from deputy premier Jarrod Bleijie released today. The project — located northwest of Rockhampton — included 88 wind turbines, a battery energy storage system and the clearing of 434 hectares of vegetation. Developer Greenleaf Renewables expected the project to start construction by 2026. Moonlight Range was originally approved by the State Assessment Referral Agency in December last year. But the new LNP Queensland government vowed to tighten regulations for wind power in January this year, ensuring that local communities must be consulted on new wind farm developments. This resulted in wind projects being delayed, allowing for the consultation period. The previous Queensland government passed the Clean Economy Jobs Bill in April 2024, which includes a 75pc emissions reduction target by 2035 and net zero by 2050. The new government will provide a Net Zero Roadmap and Energy plan by 31 December. Brisbane-based environmental lobby Queensland Conservation Council (QCC) is urging the government to accelerate its planning for the renewable energy sector. But the state LNP government has vowed to keep coal-fired power stations. Black coal-fired power contributed 64.2pc of the state's energy demand in 2024, according to Australian platform Open Electricity.

UK N2EX peak-load discount reaches record in May

London, 22 May (Argus) — Peak-load power on the UK's N2EX day-ahead spot market has cleared at its widest discount to the base load this month, driven by rising solar generation and falling national demand. The N2EX has cleared at £75.92/MWh ($85.66/MWh) for base load so far this month, while peak-load hours have delivered at £70.23/MWh. This is on track to be the widest peak-base discount on record in the UK, surpassing the peak discount of £4.40/MWh in August last year — which came amid record low peak demand for the month and unseasonably strong wind output. UK solar generation has averaged 7GW in peak hours so far this month, up from 6.2GW last month and 4.7GW in May last year. In these hours, solar has accounted for around 22.5pc of domestic generation, the highest share for any month on record. Embedded solar output during peak hours for the remainder of the month is currently forecast at 6.1-10.4GW, peaking on 23 May and bottoming out on 24 May. And national demand is forecast to range 16.0-22.4GW over the same period, with peak demand ranging 14.1-23.9GW. Solar output is on track to generate more power than gas-fired units during peak-load hours for the second time on record after August last year. Gas-fired generation has been 6.2GW in peak-load hours so far this month, around 800MW below solar. In comparison, peak-load gas burn was just 50MW below solar in August last year. The rise in solar generation has also continued to weigh heavily on the UK's net imports in the hours around midday. Net imports during base-load hours have stood at 3.9GW so far this month, down from 4.3GW in April and well below 4.8GW in May last year. Imports have only been around 4.6GW in settlement periods 27-28, between 13:00-14:00 local time, below 5.9GW during the same interval last year and 5.1GW in 2023. A decline in peak-load demand compared with previous years has also weighed on power prices in these hours. UK national demand has been 22GW so far in May, the lowest for the month aside from May 2020. But demand in peak hours has been around 200MW lower than in May 2020 at 21.7GW, while late-night and early morning demand has been 1GW above 2020 levels. This has largely been driven by a rapid increase in embedded solar for self-consumption in recent years, which could accelerate further with the recently passed Great British Energy Act, allocating £200mn for rooftop solar and other renewable energy schemes in 7,000 schools, hospitals and community buildings. The bulk of solar installations in the UK are between 0-4kW, totalling 1.4mn as of March and equivalent to 4.2GW, or 23pc of the UK's total solar capacity, government data shows. Some 73pc of the new solar installations in March were on residential buildings, adding a total of 68MW. And 3.3GW between transmission and distribution-connected solar projects won contracts for difference in the last allocation round held last year. Almost 1.1GW of this is due on line in 2026-27 and 2.2GW in 2027-28.

US could undermine global climate co-operation: Podesta

London, 22 May (Argus) — The global climate community will have to pay close attention to the fact that the administration of US president Donald Trump ""may do whatever they can to undermine global co-operation in the energy transition"" in forums such as the G7 and the UN Cop 30 climate summit, former US government climate advisor John Podesta told the Financial Times Climate and Impact Summit Europe today. ""I hope people will resist them,"" he said, after pointing out that during Trump's first term, the US administration was ""essentially… passive"" on the climate on a global stage. Podesta said that through Trump's attacks on former president Joe Biden's clean energy-supporting Inflation Reduction Act , the US has ""handed a victory particularly to China"". The act had become an energy transition model around the world, Podesta said, pointing to the EU's Green Industrial Deal. ""The way to decarbonise and deal with climate change is through investment, innovation and technology… and what we have done is thrown in the towel and thrown in the hand"", he said. ""There was I think, bi-partisan consensus in the US and consensus in Europe that we need to react to [China's domination in the green industry sector],"" he added, saying that there is an economic security dimension with leaving China in a dominant position. Clean energy deployment in the US is likely to stay robust in the short term, he said. Some Republican state governors have raised objections to the administration's rollback of clean energy support, but business investing in that area is keeping its collective head down, Podesta said, largely because ""the administration has been engaged in a process of intimidation"". Podesta said that there remains significant sub-national action in the US, but warned that the Trump administration is trying to undermine that too. The administration has moved to ""attack the underlying science"" and the ""human capital"" in institutions such as US climate and weather agency the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Podesta said. ""If you eliminate all the information sources maybe the problem goes away"", he added. The government has already pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement and could withdraw from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) — the UN's climate body. But there are legal issues around this, including whether the government may need a ""supermajority"" in the Senate, Podesta said. ""The law has not been a constraint on this government,"" Podesta added.

Iraq signs integrated energy deal with China’s Geo-Jade

Dubai, 22 May (Argus) — Iraq's oil ministry has signed an agreement with China's Geo-Jade Petroleum and local firm Basra Crescent to expand the capacity of the 20,000 b/d Tuba oil field and develop a suite of downstream and power assets, in a move that mirrors recent integrated energy deals with international partners. A key component of the South Basrah Integrated Energy Project will be to raise Tuba's production capacity to 100,000 b/d, oil minister Hayan Abdulghani said at the signing ceremony in Baghdad on 21 May. The project will also include processing of up to 50mn ft³/d of associated gas. Downstream components include a 200,000 b/d refinery, a 620,000 t/yr petrochemical plant and a 520,000 t/yr fertilizer facility. A 650MW thermal power plant and a 400MW solar plant will also be part of the project, Abdulghani said. No financial details or project timelines were disclosed. The agreement marks a further step in Geo-Jade's expansion in Iraq, following its successful participation in the country's fifth and sixth licensing rounds. While the company now holds multiple upstream assets in Iraq, it has yet to bring any into production. The deal follows a similar multi-billion dollar agreement signed with TotalEnergies in 2023 , which bundled gas processing, water treatment and solar power with development of the Ratawi field. In February this year, BP signed a major upstream deal with Iraq that also includes power, water and potentially exploration.

Some agencies delay their funding distribution while trying to comply with legal requirements for a program, the GAO wrote.
​“NEVI is a vital step toward reducing that harm through zero-emission transportation.
​“The NEVI program offers a real chance to change that — with public investment in EV charging that finally includes rural Black and brown neighborhoods.","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy, and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

Sixteen states, the District of Columbia, and more than a half dozen environmental groups have alleged in a lawsuit that the Trump administration has indefinitely and unlawfully frozen funds for a nationwide electric vehicle program.

The complaint was filed on Thursday last week in U.S. District Court in Seattle. Plaintiffs’ attorneys are asking the judge to require the Trump administration to unfreeze the funds and distribute them to the states according to a formula established by Congress.

During the Biden administration, Congress appropriated $5 billion for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, also known as NEVI, as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021. The money would have been disbursed each year to all 50 states, plus Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, to build a nationwide network of electric vehicle charging stations along designated Alternative Fuel Corridors.

“Transportation is the leading source of climate pollution in the U.S., and halting the NEVI program directly threatens our progress toward clean, reliable transportation options — especially in the Southeast, where EV infrastructure is still catching up,” said Megan Kimball, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. ​“In rural and urban areas alike, more charging access means cleaner air, economic growth, and real savings for families. We’re defending that future.”

The legal challenge coincided with a Government Accountability Office report published Thursday that found the U.S. Department of Transportation is unauthorized to withhold the congressionally appropriated funds. The Transportation Department could petition Congress to pass a law to rescind the funds or change the NEVI program, the GAO wrote, but it can’t act unilaterally.

A department spokesperson said in a prepared statement that the GAO report ​“shows a complete misunderstanding of the law” and ​“conflicts with Congress’ intent.”

Less than three weeks after Trump was elected to a second term, the Transportation Department ordered states to stop distributing their funds for fiscal years 2022-2025, worth about $2.7 billion. States could reimburse contractors for money already spent, but no new funding could be obligated.

DOT justified the funding freeze by saying the Federal Highway Administration was ​“updating the NEVI Formula Program Guidance to align with current policy and priorities.”

The GAO report concluded that the Transportation Department erroneously froze funding when it determined that funding was available only for signed project agreements. Instead, the GAO wrote, the effective date for funding was much earlier: when the law made money for the program available for obligation.

Some agencies delay their funding distribution while trying to comply with legal requirements for a program, the GAO wrote. In the NEVI case, however, DOT imposed requirements that exceed what the law prescribes. For example, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act requires states to submit plans to DOT, but does not provide authority for the secretary of transportation to approve or disapprove such plans.

A DOT spokesperson said the GAO was ​“cherry-picking language in the program statute.”

The agency is updating NEVI program guidance, according to the spokesperson, ​“because the implementation of NEVI has failed miserably, and DOT will continue to work in good faith to update the program so it can be utilized more efficiently and effectively.”

Attorneys for the environmental groups — including CleanAIRE NC, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, West End Revitalization Project, Sierra Club, and the Natural Resources Defense Council — wrote that in blocking the distribution of funds, the Trump administration directly defied congressional directives.

The funding freeze nullified more than 150 state implementation plans, according to court documents, which harmed local communities. NEVI requires EV charging stations in the first phase to be installed every 50 miles along the federally approved Alternative Fuel Corridors, and that they be within one mile of those routes.

“By reducing access to reliable public charging,” the plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote, ​“DOT and the FHWA are restricting electric vehicle owners’ ability to travel and use their EVs, increase their fuel costs, delay EV purchases, worsen health impacts from vehicle pollution, and deprive communities of promised public investment.”

In the Charlotte, North Carolina, metro area, for example, air quality — such as levels of ozone and particulate matter — has worsened, according to the 2025 American Lung Association State of the Air Report. The largest city in North Carolina, Charlotte is ringed and bisected by several highways clogged with cars.

“Tailpipe pollution is a public health crisis — fueling asthma, heart disease, and respiratory illness in communities already overburdened by environmental harm,” Jeff Robbins, executive director of CleanAIRE NC, said in a prepared statement. ​“NEVI is a vital step toward reducing that harm through zero-emission transportation. Freezing the program blocks progress and keeps our most vulnerable residents breathing dirty air. Clean air and climate justice cannot be put on hold.”

Interstate 85 and U.S. Highway 70 run through many underserved communities in Alamance County, North Carolina, about 30 miles west of Durham.

“For decades, communities like ours in Alamance County have been denied access to basic infrastructure,” said Omega Wilson, codirector of the West End Revitalization Association. ​“The NEVI program offers a real chance to change that — with public investment in EV charging that finally includes rural Black and brown neighborhoods. Suspending the program delays critical investments, widens infrastructure disparities, and sends the message that once again, the taxpayers who’ve been left behind the longest will be the last to benefit.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/53236936038_549d46144d_k.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=9130c6ad6d76860c001c5add4fabef84,N,,2025-05-27 09:06:58.493031

The third step is to plan how to fairly share the costs of the energy transition.
The energy transition is essential to tackle climate change, and it’s good for many consumers, who can save on gas, petrol and power.","The great energy transition is happening before our eyes. You can see it on our roofs: more than one in three Australian homes now have solar. You can see it on our roads: nearly 10% of new cars sold in Australia last year were electric.

But the greening of Australia is creating losers as well as winners. While wealthier households are saving on their energy bills by installing solar panels and switching from gas to all-electric, many people have no choice but to stay with more expensive fossil fuels.

The newly returned Albanese government should urgently lead action to ensure all Australians benefit from a greener grid.

People who own their own homes have the flexibility – and often the income – to upgrade their house when it makes sense. With solar panels and a battery, you’re able to draw less energy from the grid and use it when it’s cheapest. If you can afford to swap your gas stove for an electric one, or buy an EV, you’re able to save even more.

But if you rent, you are eight times less likely to have solar panels on your house. That’s because most landlords aren’t interested in buying new tech, upgrading appliances, or switching from gas to all-electric when they’re not the ones paying the energy bills.

Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter

So, while wealthier Australians switch, everyone else is stuck. And the way our gas and electricity bills are calculated means the people least able to afford it will pay the most for their energy.

On average, about 40% of your gas bill goes to maintaining the network, not the amount of gas you use. The more people that are connected to the same network, the cheaper your bill. Those who can afford to switch to electric will do so and save. Those who are left behind on the gas network will foot the bill. If you end up being one of the unlucky few who are still paying for gas – mostly renters and people on low incomes – your energy prices are set to skyrocket.

When it comes to electricity, if you can’t afford to install solar panels and batteries, you’ll have to pay more to help maintain the grid. Customers are increasingly being charged different prices depending on when they use electricity or how much they use at once. That’s a big advantage if you own an electric vehicle and can charge it in the dead of night, or you can afford a battery so you can store your solar energy and use it when you need it.

But it’s hard to change the time you cook dinner, and no one is checking tariff rates while they’re watching the footy. If you don’t have a battery to shift when you draw from the grid, you’re going to bear the brunt of peak-time prices.

As the energy transition ramps up, Australia risks becoming a more unequal society. Here’s what needs to change to avoid windfall savings for the well-off, while everyone else gets whacked with the costs.

First, governments need to create a clear plan to get off gas. It’s an essential step on the road to net zero. Each state government should set a date – following the lead of the ACT – for when there will be no more gas in homes. They should put these dates into rental standards, requiring landlords to make the switch.

The second step is to help the people who can’t upgrade their houses. In public housing, state governments should pay for the switch to all-electric, and have solar panels and batteries installed where appropriate. The federal government should increase funding for upgrades to social housing and push the states to move faster. To help other renters switch, landlords should be given an instant write-off if they convert gas appliances to electric.

The third step is to plan how to fairly share the costs of the energy transition. As the gas network is wound down and new poles and wires are built, someone will have to pay. If households pay the same way they have been, the result will be unfair. If networks wear the whole bill, they will go broke.

The federal government needs to coordinate this process and, building on the work of the Australian Energy Market Commission, reform the way we pay for electricity and the grid. The new rules should be designed to ensure costs are distributed equitably for all households.

The energy transition is essential to tackle climate change, and it’s good for many consumers, who can save on gas, petrol and power. But without action, the transformation risks worsening inequality. Governments must help households to make the switch, and change the rules so that the benefits and costs are fairly shared.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6fb67759b27b9aadc8f7075d28355b7fcb244f1/815_0_3835_3070/master/3835.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d5d9b21ff18112fd407a5d4673a2ed9e,N,,2025-05-27 06:12:12.583184

These actions mark a significant turning point after decades of stagnation in the US nuclear energy industry, setting the stage for what is being hailed as a modern nuclear renaissance.

The newly signed directives empower the Department of Energy (DOE) to take the helm in accelerating nuclear innovation.

Among the measures announced are the authorisation of reactor testing at DOE’s National Laboratories, streamlined construction on federal lands, and a mandate for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to expedite licensing processes.

These initiatives dismantle long-standing regulatory roadblocks and inject momentum into the development of next-generation nuclear reactors.

A strategic energy move amid rising global demand

The revival of American nuclear technology comes at a crucial time, as global energy demands surge and concerns over energy independence intensify.

The Trump Administration’s actions support the expansion of the existing nuclear fleet and pave the way for scalable, advanced nuclear technologies capable of delivering clean, consistent energy regardless of weather conditions.

The emphasis on civil nuclear infrastructure also aligns with broader economic strategies, including the reinforcement of domestic manufacturing and the securement of a sovereign nuclear fuel supply chain.

These advancements are poised to play a pivotal role in powering artificial intelligence systems, supporting heavy industry, and ensuring a stable electric grid for future generations.

Reinforcing trust in science through “Gold Standard” principles

In addition to energy-focused initiatives, President Trump has implemented a science directive aimed at restoring integrity and public trust in federal research.

The executive order introduces “Gold Standard Science” as a benchmark for all federally supported scientific activities.

This framework prioritises transparency, reproducibility, and peer-reviewed rigour while demanding clarity around uncertainty and objectivity in research.

The initiative is intended to align government science efforts with traditional academic values, encourage interdisciplinary collaboration, and foster a research environment free from conflicts of interest. It signals a national call to excellence for scientists and institutions across the country.

White House Office of Science and Technology Director Michael Kratsios added: “President Trump is making Gold Standard Science the cornerstone of the federal science enterprise and rebuilding public trust in science.

“With this executive order, we are recommitting ourselves to scientific best practices and empowering America’s researchers to achieve groundbreaking discoveries.

“Gold Standard Science starts in the policies and programmes of our great federal research institutions and continues with partnership across academia, industry, and philanthropy.”

Why nuclear technology is vital for America’s future

Expanding America’s nuclear technology capabilities is a national imperative. Nuclear power offers a reliable, emissions-free energy source that enhances energy security, strengthens the grid, and provides a critical backbone for future technological advancements.

By investing in modern reactor designs and breaking down bureaucratic hurdles, the US positions itself to lead globally in clean energy innovation while protecting its strategic interests.

After U.S. President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on select imports this April, ASEAN countries swiftly launched negotiations in a bid to cushion the blow.

According to analysis by financial advisory firm S&P Global, nations that had previously benefited from the China+1 strategy now face rising tariff risks. Steep U.S. tariffs could dampen electricity demand from Southeast Asia’s manufacturing sector, casting uncertainty over the region’s energy transition.

Solar costs keep falling, firms urged to reassess power strategies

In a recent webinar hosted by S&P Global Commodity Insights, experts examined the implications of U.S. tariffs on ASEAN’s clean energy and power sectors. The discussion focused on projected trends in solar development and how companies might adapt.

Cecillia Zheng, an analyst specializing in natural gas, power, and climate solutions, noted that stricter U.S. trade rules have already affected Chinese production lines and are beginning to erode the value-added exports of ASEAN countries—particularly in sectors such as electronics, automotive, machinery, clean energy, and solar which face higher tariff pressure.

According to S&P Global data, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia—ASEAN’s top solar exporters—shipped nearly 30 GW of solar modules and cells to the U.S. in 2023, valued at over USD $9.5 billion.

Vince Heo, another analyst, pointed out that Chinese solar manufacturers have ramped up production, leading to global oversupply and offsetting post-pandemic inflation effects. This has kept capital expenditures for utility-scale solar projects in Southeast Asia from rising significantly—some have even seen slight declines. Heo forecasts continued drops in solar power costs.

In Vietnam, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from onshore wind and solar is already lower than coal-fired power, with solar-plus-storage costs also steadily falling. Within 2–3 years, these costs are expected to reach parity with coal, prompting large energy users to reconsider their power sourcing strategies.

Heo added that if the U.S. enforces anti-subsidy and anti-dumping tariffs, a wave of low-cost solar modules and storage systems could flood into ASEAN markets. The Philippines is particularly well-positioned to benefit, with its relatively liberalized electricity market and strong governmental support for renewable energy.

Vietnam most vulnerable as tariffs threaten energy progress

Given their deep reliance on the U.S. market, ASEAN countries face reduced foreign investment and lower manufacturing-related power demand if tariffs are enacted. Vietnam appears most at risk.

Heo emphasized that Vietnam exports USD $70 billion worth of computers and electronics to the U.S. annually. With 90% of Apple’s wearables and nearly half of Samsung’s export goods produced in Vietnam, any new tariffs could deter foreign manufacturers, decrease output, and subsequently reduce electricity consumption.

Tariffs may also drive up fuel prices in ASEAN countries, pushing electricity costs higher. Vietnam is particularly exposed due to its expanding LNG imports and weakening currency, raising the risk of foreign exchange losses and pressuring utility profit margins—potentially stalling the nation’s energy transition.

Overall, the research team at S&P Global believes U.S. tariffs could significantly affect power demand and solar manufacturing in Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia. The clean energy supply chain may shift, and energy developers could face increasing risks in procurement and cost structures.

Despite the uncertainties surrounding U.S. tariff outcomes, Cecillia Zheng recommended that companies monitor these three key developments:

How will evolving tariff policies influence energy firms’ investment decisions?

How can companies balance cost competitiveness while securing resilient supply chains?

In the face of protectionist measures like the April tariffs, how can energy companies use regional or global partnerships to build effective buffers?

Allen Wang, Executive Director of the research team, concluded that cautious market sentiment is slowing short-term energy investments. He noted that the prospects for other clean energy sources, such as geothermal, remain difficult to assess under the current uncertainty.",https://reccessary.com/data/news/cover/1748327651818833028.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 06:12:33.568872

Georgia Power’s 2025 Integrated Resource Plan calls for renewable energy but also more fossil fuels.
Georgia Power’s plans include upgrading the nuclear units at Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle and the oil and gas-fired units at Plant McIntosh.

Brionté McCorkle, executive director of Georgia Conservation Voters, argued that the driving reasons behind Georgia Power’s fuel rate increase is the continued reliance on fossil fuels.","The Georgia Public Service Commission is set to hold a second round of hearings on Georgia Power’s controversial long-range plans.

The five-member utility regulator is set to vote July 15 as the state’s largest utility expects to spend billions of dollars to meet skyrocketing energy demands attributed to new electricity-hogging data centers. Georgia Power’s 2025 Integrated Resource Plan calls for renewable energy but also more fossil fuels.

Georgia Power has come under fire after PSC hearings in April when the company disclosed it is considering building new methane gas units to generate up to 9,000 more megawatts of capacity by 2031.

A number of environmental groups are calling on the utility to include a more diverse mix of clean, affordable energy solutions like solar power in its long-range plan instead of relying more heavily on fossil fuels.

Georgia Power’s plans include upgrading the nuclear units at Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle and the oil and gas-fired units at Plant McIntosh.

In addition, the company plans to upgrade nine hydroelectric dams throughout the state and build new transmission lines along more than 1,000 miles of power lines.

Georgia Power’s plans also include the addition of 1,100 MW of renewable energy from solar and battery storage.

“The 2025 IRP provides a comprehensive plan to support Georgia’s continued economic growth and allow us to serve Georgians with clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy well into the future – we look forward to continuing the process through the hearings this week,” Georgia Power spokesman Matthew Kent said.

Three days of hearings about the plan will begin Tuesday, following a proposed agreement reached between Georgia Power and the PSC to freeze base electric rates from 2026 to 2028. Some critics have argued that the proposed agreement is a political maneuver to protect Republican incumbent commissioners Fitz Johnson and Tim Echols. The PSC members are facing voters for the first time in years after a lawsuit delayed the usual six-year election cycle.

Since 2023, the average Georgia Power residential ratepayer is paying $43 more per month due to rising base electric rates, higher natural gas costs and the completion of two nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle.

In April, the Environmental Protection Agency approved a two-year exemption at the request of Georgia Power’s parent Southern Company allowing Plant Bowen and Plant Scherer to bypass federal emission regulations for mercury and other air pollutants.

Fossil fuels under fire

Georgia Power is requesting permission from the PSC to continue burning coal at Plant Scherer near Macon and Plant Bowen outside Cartersville well into the 2030s. Georgia Power planned to retire one of its Plant Scherer units by the end of 2028 and Plant Bowen’s closure date is uncertain.

Georgia Power is also planning to continue to use coal and gas at Alabama’s Plant Gaston for energy generation.

The commission staff filed a recommendation this month that the company should be allowed to satisfy its projected 2033 needs, which would be 5,226 MW instead of 5,989 MW.

Georgia Power’s resource plan will reinforce its energy demands while also adapting to the changing regulatory environment and supply chain requirements, according to the PSC staff recommendations. The increases will provide Georgia Power with greater flexibility and time to adapt, according to the PSC staff.

Brionté McCorkle, executive director of Georgia Conservation Voters, argued that the driving reasons behind Georgia Power’s fuel rate increase is the continued reliance on fossil fuels.

Georgia Conservation Voters is one of several organizations challenging the power company’s models for predicting the growth of massive data centers. According to the company’s projections, data centers will consume 80% of all electricity, and all customers will benefit from these facilities that support the growing use of artificial intelligence.

Critics contend that the company’s projected demand is overstated and that existing ratepayers could be saddled with the cost of unnecessary electricity generating infrastructure.

“We’ve seen them double down on gas and coal and all of the costs from Plant Vogtle,” McCorkle said. “All of those things have resulted in people’s bills going up despite public comment for years that people want to see the power company investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency. These are measures that will not only promote clean energy, but also help save the money on their power bills.”

Georgia Power company has been criticized by environmental groups for reversing its plans to close plants Bowen and Scherer, long among the worst polluters in the region. The company is instead seeking approval from state regulators to extend the life of the two plants and expand its fossil fuel energy capacity.

Last year, Georgia regulators signed off on an amended 2022 Georgia Power plan allowing it to build new biomass power plants that will burn wood waste and other organic material to generate electricity.

Jennifer Whitfield, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the Georgia Power 2025 plan is unusual since there is a large amount of projected demand that is not based on proven analysis.

“How good are their projections, and are they good enough to make big resource decisions right now?” Whitfield said. “We think that they are not and expect that next week you’re going to hear from a lot of people who say their load forecasts are way too high.”

Whitfield gave credit for the Georgia Power proposal calling for significant investments in energy efficiency that can help ratepayers save money on their bills.

“I think there’s going to be some exciting stuff in (the IRP), but the commission shouldn’t take any action making radical decisions based on the data they have before them because the data is not good,” Whitfield said.

Neil Sardana with the Georgia Conservation Voters Education Fund said the organization will present testimony this week for how Georgia Power can reduce emissions, accelerate coal plant retirement and increase clean energy such as solar, wind and battery storage in a way that could potentially save customers $10 billion by the year 2040.

“Georgia Power could be doing a lot better when it comes to planning and developing resources for energy production that not only improves our air quality emissions and also saves everyday customers tons of money,” Sardana said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Fayette-QTS-data-center-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 05:02:32.833822

Loss of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Mining Program will reverse decades of progress in preventing disease, injury and death among miners, experts said.

Around 150 researchers are expected to be laid off next month, effectively shuttering the program.

Steve Schafrik, associate professor of mine engineering at the University of Kentucky, said the agency's research labs are conducting studies not easily be replicated, noting the labs contain specialized equipment aimed at reducing hazards to which miners are exposed.

""Facilities for trying to reduce the noise of equipment so that workers aren't exposed to that level of noise all day, every day,"" Schafrik noted. ""That's a pretty difficult task, and you need to have very specific research equipment to do that.""

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said layoffs are part of an effort to combine numerous agencies under the umbrella of the new ""Administration for a Healthy America."" According to federal data, around one of five of the nation's operating coal mines are located in Kentucky.

Schafrik pointed out the program's worker safety materials are used by mining industries around the world. He stressed the shutdown also leaves an uncertain future for grants and contracts needed to recruit new researchers.

""NIOSH has put a big emphasis on generating capacity within the academic institutions for replenishment of the researchers who can go out and work in academia, industry, regulatory bodies and government research,"" Schafrik outlined.

He added the program's closure will affect other industries, such as mineral production.

""While we are looking to get more critical mineral production inside of the United States, to be coupling that with the reduction of the Health and Safety Research Program, I don't understand the reasoning behind that,"" Schafrik observed.

According to the Mine Safety and Health Administration, 10 miner fatalities occurred between Jan. 3 and March 5, 2025, more than triple the number from the same period last year.

Supporters of electric vehicle ownership said there are a number of advantages to owning one.

Studies show EVs can convert 85% to 90% of their energy into forward movement. A majority of the electricity used in an EV vehicle is American-made and an EV can be charged at home, just like a cellphone.

Despite the benefits and their popularity, Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., the Speaker of the House, has proposed removing a $7,500 tax credit for EV owners as part of President Donald Trump's goal to restructure the country's budget.

John Higham, board member of the Electric Vehicle Association, wondered if it will cause potential EV car buyers to back away.

""Do I think if this $7,500 tax credit suddenly disappeared, it's not going to kill the electric vehicle?,"" Higham asked. ""It might slow the acceleration of the adoption of the electric vehicle but it's certainly not going to reverse the trend.""

Trump's budget proposal could pass between the end of May and the end of July. Higham acknowledged the tax credit is a strong motivator for people to buy or lease an electric car. And he expects a 10% to 12% growth rate for purchases. Higham admitted the number could drop to between 8% and 9% if the tax credit disappears.

As of December 2023, the Department of Energy shows slightly more than 26,000 Hoosiers own an electric vehicle.

The Republican controlled House has proposed legislation to extend the tax credit until the end of 2025 and analysts said the largest EV automaker, Tesla, owned by Trump associate Elon Musk, would be affected the most if the tax credit ends. Higham noted the fallout of repealing the tax credit could break down along party lines.

""That economic engine that is in those red districts, where there's new battery manufacturing put in, new automotive manufacturing put in,"" Higham pointed out. ""Those are the voters that are going to feel it the most, are in those red districts. And so there are Republican congressmen who are saying, not quite so fast. It is harder to repeal than I think most people realize.""

In 2024, it is estimated the federal government spent about $2 billion in advance point-of-sale EV tax credit payments. Buzz about the tax removal may push consumers to buy EVs sooner than later, to take advantage of the credit before it disappears.

In a particularly egregious policy twist, the GOP bill would not only extend Biden’s tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) until 2031, it would also ban any consideration of those land-use emissions when calculating which fuels are sustainable.
The European Union specifically excludes the use of crop-based fuels for aviation because its land-use effects are so devastating.
Currently, most of the world’s aviation fuel classified as sustainable is recycled cooking oil that’s genuinely climate-friendly.
The stakes of this purportedly technical debate were so high that Biden climate czar John Podesta led a boringly named Sustainable Aviation Fuel Lifecycle Analysis Interagency Working Group to hash it out.","The “Big, Beautiful Bill” that Republicans are pushing under President Trump would roll back almost all the clean energy incentives that Democrats enacted under President Biden, shredding federal support for solar, wind, nuclear, electric vehicles, and other climate-friendly technologies. But it would make a lavish exception for one supposedly green form of energy that isn’t green at all: farm-grown jet fuels.

Aviation, which generated about 2 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2024, is a notoriously difficult sector to decarbonize, and the U.S. aviation industry has committed to using so-called “sustainable aviation fuels” to reach its net-zero climate goals. But using crops like corn and soybeans to produce fuel instead of food not only increases food prices and global hunger, it spurs farmers around the world to tear down more forests and plow up more grasslands to create new farmland to replace the lost food. That’s why farm-grown biofuels have been a climate problem masquerading as a climate solution for cars, and they would have the same problem in planes.

In a particularly egregious policy twist, the GOP bill would not only extend Biden’s tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) until 2031, it would also ban any consideration of those land-use emissions when calculating which fuels are sustainable. That would be like banning consideration of smokestack emissions when calculating which power plants are sustainable. And in legislation that otherwise slashes energy spending, the biofuels giveaway would cost U.S. taxpayers an extra $45 billion.

The European Union specifically excludes the use of crop-based fuels for aviation because its land-use effects are so devastating.

But such is the power of U.S. agricultural interests, which are increasingly worried that electric vehicles will crush demand for corn ethanol and soy biodiesel on the road and have been furiously lobbying Washington to create new demand in the sky. In case there was any confusion about the purpose of the biofuels provision, it’s not in the energy policy section of the Big Beautiful Bill: It’s in the section that claims to “Make Rural America Grow Again.”

The political twist is that it’s not just a Republican provision. While the overall bill has no Democratic supporters, and even some Republicans have objected to its assault on other energy subsidies, the biofuels carve-out has strong backing from farm-friendly Democrats, who created the original tax credit for SAFs in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. There’s always been broad bipartisan support for the federal mandate requiring corn ethanol to be blended into gasoline, and even though the overall Big Beautiful Bill aims to dismantle Biden’s climate policies and extend Trump’s tax cuts, its biofuels language was lifted from a bipartisan “Farm to Fly” bill explicitly designed to get ethanol to qualify for SAF credits of up to $1.75 a gallon.

“It’s shocking but it’s not surprising,” says Dan Lashof, a climate scientist and senior fellow at the World Resources Institute. “Agriculture has an extremely well-oiled lobbying machine. So even as Congress guts all these things that reduce emissions to save money, they get Congress to spend lots of money to expand the one thing that increases emissions.”

The impacts on the global landscape could be dramatic. An analysis by the American Enterprise Institute concluded that producing about 10 percent of U.S. jet fuel from SAF by 2030 — an explicit Biden Administration goal — would require about half the U.S. soybean crop, occupying enough farmland to cover the state of Nebraska. Princeton senior research scholar Tim Searchinger has calculated that using vegetable oils like soybean for one fourth of global aviation fuel would require 40 percent of global cropland, an area twice the size of India. Flying a plane with corn ethanol would be particularly inefficient; it takes 1.7 gallons of ethanol to make a gallon of jet fuel, and producing ethanol uses almost as much fossil fuel as ethanol replaces.

The world is already losing a soccer field worth of tropical forest every six seconds, most of it to agricultural expansion, and heightened demand for feedstocks like corn, soy, canola, and palm could overrun vast swaths of forests and undeveloped land, releasing its sequestered carbon and eliminating its ability to absorb atmospheric carbon in the future. The European Union specifically excludes the use of crop-based fuels for aviation because the land-use effects are so devastating, but even when Biden was still president, the U.S. farm lobby was fighting to make sure that didn’t happen here.

Currently, most of the world’s aviation fuel classified as sustainable is recycled cooking oil that’s genuinely climate-friendly.

At one Biden cabinet meeting in 2023, agriculture secretary and former Iowa governor Tom Vilsack handed treasury secretary Janet Yellen a one-page briefing document, flagging it as a high-priority issue. Yellen’s high-priority issues usually involved inflation, threats of recession, and global economic crises, so she was perplexed to read a page of acronym-laden biofuels-industry talking points about the methodological superiority of the GREET computer model over the CORSIA model for calculating carbon emissions from ILUC.

“Can someone tell me what this is about?” she later asked her top aides.

It was about billions of dollars, because the CORSIA model put enough emphasis on “indirect land-use change,” known as ILUC, to make crop-based aviation fuels ineligible for tax credits, while the farm-friendly GREET model downplayed ILUC enough to give corn and soybeans a chance to look sustainable. The stakes of this purportedly technical debate were so high that Biden climate czar John Podesta led a boringly named Sustainable Aviation Fuel Lifecycle Analysis Interagency Working Group to hash it out.

As I recount in my forthcoming book We Are Eating the Earth, the working group held weekly meetings that were clearly less about improving climate analytics than justifying the creation of a lucrative new market for farmers. “Nobody talked about the elephant in the room,” one administration official recalled. “It was theater of the absurd.”

The GREET modeling implied that all of Iowa’s corn production could be converted to ethanol while inducing virtually no farmers anywhere on Earth to expand their fields to grow more grain, but the results didn’t have to make sense when Biden was declaring at an Iowa ethanol plant that “we want to see facilities like this all over the Midwest.”

In 2024, the Biden administration agreed to use GREET — and since even GREET didn’t make ethanol look quite climate-friendly enough to qualify for credits, Vilsack secured several additional conditions that made the model even more favorable for farm-grown fuels. He barely even pretended the decision was driven by science in his public statement, hailing it as “a great beginning as we develop new markets for… home-grown agricultural crops.” The initial U.S. biofuels mandate for cars, in 2007, unleashed a torrent of deforestation in the Amazon, but Nikita Pavlenko, director of fuels and aviation for the International Coalition for Clean Transportation, says the farm lobby’s influence in Washington helped persuade the White House to ignore fears of a reprise. “We spent two years wrangling,” he says, “and in the end everyone who wanted to take land-use change seriously got steamrolled.”

It’s hard to imagine politicians bucking the powerful agriculture lobby over the proper way to assess indirect land-use change.

Today, only 0.3 percent of the world’s aviation fuel is classified as sustainable: Most of it is recycled cooking oil that’s genuinely climate-friendly because it doesn’t use farmland or spur deforestation. United Airlines has an ad campaign touting its commitment to making SAF from waste instead of crop-grown feedstock, featuring Oscar the Grouch as its “Chief Trash Officer.” Environmentalists also hope to see planes fly on “green hydrogen” produced with clean energy; pongamia oil made from the seed of a climate-friendly tropical tree; and electricity, at least for short-haul flights.

But for the airlines, the most scalable alternative fuel opportunity would be subsidized crop-based fuels, which is why they have joined farm interests to push the current Congress to extend the SAF credit and make it even easier for farm-grown SAF to qualify. The Biden team had already diminished the role of indirect land-use change in its emissions analyses — the critics say its ILUC value should have been at least five times higher, and perhaps 40 times higher — and the U.S. has already built enough biorefineries since 2021 to increase its production capacity for crop-based SAF sixfold. Still, the industry lobbyists wanted to make sure that ILUC would pose no threat whatsoever to fuels brewed from crops, and they got what they wanted on page 208 of the Big Beautiful Bill: “the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions shall be adjusted as necessary to exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land-use change.”

This is like Congress dictating that financial regulators can’t look at how much banks owe their creditors when determining whether they’re solvent; one environmentalist compared the provision to a legislative decree that pi equals nine.

“There’s a lot of hype about how this kind of legislation can jumpstart SAF and make a lot of money for farmers, and I think that’s right,” says Dan Blaustein-Rejto, who runs the Breakthrough Institute’s food and agriculture program. “I just don’t think that’s good.”

Abraham Lincoln liked to tell a riddle: How many legs does a dog have if you call a tail a leg? His answer was four: A tail is still a tail, even if you call it a leg. And using farmland to grow fuel still induces the expansion of farmland elsewhere to grow more food, even if emissions analysts aren’t allowed to acknowledge those indirect land-use changes. The brazen ban on even evaluating indirect land-use change could create problems for airlines that want to sell carbon credits for using alternative fuels, since a Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance, funded by Jeff Bezos, is working with environmental groups to make sure the credits are scientifically credible. But it’s not clear how much buyers like Microsoft and Meta really care about scientific credibility.

In any case, the biofuels lobby tends to get its way in Washington. The Biden administration issued an “emergency waiver” to get more ethanol blended into gasoline last summer, and the Trump administration plans to issue the same waiver this summer. The first specific item the Trump White House mentioned in a May 8 press release hailing its preliminary trade deal with the U.K. was increased access for U.S. ethanol, with celebratory quotes from the U.S. Grains Council, the Renewable Fuels Association, and the National Corn Growers Association. Those groups have a lot of influence, and it’s hard to imagine politicians bucking them over the proper way to assess indirect land-use change in life-cycle analyses.

“It’s hard to build a constituency for addressing an issue that seems so technical,” Lashof says. “And even if we could, it’s even harder to fight the farm lobby.”",https://yale-threesixty.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/Corn-Ethanol_AP-HEADER.jpg?w=1200&q=60&auto=format&fit=max&dm=1748014090&s=ed5aa80ddb2b10abdc07d70ef2239b72,N,,2025-05-27 06:11:25.762067

But Thomas Hochman, director of infrastructure policy at the Foundation for American Innovation, warned that the new rules may push developers to focus on easier, cheaper sites.

""There are quotes from folks like an outgoing Environmental Protection Agency general counsel, who say that 90% of the details NEPA review are purely there for litigation proofing,"" said Hochman. ""If you know that you are not at risk of litigation that is almost certainly a radically faster timeline.""

Hochman said that could leave rural areas behind.

The U.S. House narrowly passed the bill. It now moves to the Senate.

Hochman said for developers with large projects, fees aren't a problem.

""For a developer who has a project that still will go through environmental impact statement, the vast majority of time $5 million - or whatever it might be - is peanuts,"" said Hochman. ""I think this will become the common avenue for private developers.""

Advocates fear this progress could slow if project scoring continues to prioritize cost-efficiency over need.

The Florida Legislature's failure to pass a budget before adjourning has left key environmental projects in limbo, including a Senate-approved proposal to restore the Ocklawaha River by dismantling the Rodman Dam.

For residents like Samuel Carr, president of the Bartram Trail Society who fished the river before the dam's 1971 construction, the more than $6 million project represents a chance to revive what he called a ""free-running wild river"" from what he said he believes turned into ""a mud hole.""

""Since they put that dam in, 150 million gallons of fresh water doesn't come into the St. Johns River now per day, as it did before 1971,"" said Carr. ""So, the restoration would literally turn the faucet back on to get that cool, clear water to the St. Johns River.""

Carr noted the dam blocks 20 springs and forces periodic pollution releases into the St. Johns, which he said has suffered catastrophic algae blooms and lost critical eelgrass.

Lawmakers will reconvene sometime after June 2 to resume budget talks. The Senate has already approved the funding, but House approval remains uncertain amid broader disputes over tax cuts.

A Florida Atlantic University study projects the restoration would deliver a 214% return on investment, yielding over $15 million a year in recreation revenue and 340 jobs.

Former Putnam County Commissioner Linda Myers framed restoration as an economic imperative for rural Florida.

""This area of northeast Florida has so many rivers that connect to the St. Johns and this specific structure, the dam, has actually eliminated some of that connectedness,"" said Myers. ""So, opening that up would just give the opportunities - and here in Florida, we know the tourism dollars, we know how important they are.""

Myers said she believes the project aligns with lawmakers' stated priorities of water quality, conservation and leveraging Florida's tourism industry.

The study also shows restoring the Ocklawaha River would reconnect 213 river miles for fish migration, revive 20 submerged springs, and reduce algal bloom risk by 63% by restoring natural water flow.

Support for this reporting was provided by The Pew Charitable Trusts.

There are more than 20,000 abandoned oil and gas wells scattered across West Virginia, putting communities at risk for water contamination and increased exposure to environmental pollutants.

State lawmakers said a new law will make it easier to fill those wells. Previously, state code required removal of mining infrastructure before wells could be plugged with cement and other materials.

Gov. Patrick Morrisey said at a recent news conference the new law will allow operators to fill wells without removing the largest mine shaft.

""This will provide operators with greater flexibility, especially when dealing with older wells in poor structural condition,"" Morrisey explained.

West Virginia historically has only been able to plug just a few wells a year because of lack of funding. Federal investments through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 has led to the plugging of around 275 wells within the last three years. The state's new well plugging law goes into effect July 10.

Morrisey noted safely plugging a well can cost between $60,000 and $200,000 but argued doing so is necessary because untreated wells can expose communities to harmful chemicals.

""Abandoned and orphan wells can pose a significant threat and safety risk and can potentially impact surface and groundwater drinking water sources, land and air quality,"" Morrisey outlined.

According to advocacy group West Virginia Rivers, more than half of West Virginians live within a mile of an active oil and gas well.

As the Environmental Protection Agency scales back enforcement because of staff shortages and new federal rollbacks, concerns are growing in Michigan and across the country about who will hold polluters accountable.

Michigan, with more than 11,000 inland lakes and access to four Great Lakes holding 90% of the nation's freshwater, faces challenges as EPA budget cuts reduce enforcement by nearly 20% and eliminate more than 200 staff.

Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law & Policy Center, said in a recent webinar that his organization commissions polling and focus groups every two years on clean-water issues in the Great Lakes.

""And it's an 85% issue. It's almost as if, when you push people and you say, 'How much should we do to protect the Great Lakes and restore them?' he asked, ""It's like, whatever it costs, you do it.""

Supporters of EPA cuts, especially in energy, manufacturing and agriculture, contend strict environmental rules are too costly for businesses. In late 2024, more than 100 industry groups urged then-President-elect Donald Trump to roll back regulations they said were ""strangling"" the economy.

Partisanship continues to shape the debate over environmental laws, with lawmakers often split along party lines when it comes to regulations.

David Uhlmann, a former EPA official and environmental law attorney, stressed in the webinar the need to take politics out of environmental protection.

""The environmental laws require EPA working with the state to promote clean air, healthy rivers and streams, to make sure that we're living in communities free of toxic waste,"" he said. ""Those laws apply regardless of who the president is.""

In Fiscal Year 2024, the EPA's enacted budget was more than $9 billion, with a workforce of more than 15,000 employees.

""Do I think if this $7,500 tax credit suddenly disappeared, it's not going to kill the electric vehicle?,"" Higham asked.

Trump previously pledged to undo what he called the ""electric vehicle mandate,"" referencing the Biden-era goal for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030.

John Higham, board member of the Electric Vehicle Association, said the administration's approach may slow the growth of the EV industry.

""It's not going to kill the electric vehicle,"" Higham stressed. ""It might slow the acceleration of the adoption of the electric vehicle but it's certainly not going to reverse the trend.""

Data from the U.S. Department of Energy showed about 40,000 EVs are on Utah roads. All EV owners in the state must pay an annual registration fee of about $140. The U.S. House passed the massive budget bill last week, moving it to the Senate for consideration.

House lawmakers have proposed legislation to extend the tax credit until the end of the year. Analysts said Tesla, the largest EV automaker, owned by Trump adviser Elon Musk, would be affected the most by the loss of the tax credit. Higham projected the proposal to repeal the tax credit could break down party lines.

""That economic engine that is in those red districts, where there's new battery manufacturing put in, new automotive manufacturing put in,"" Higham pointed out. ""Those are the voters that are going to feel it the most, are in those red districts.""

According to the Argonne National Laboratory, consumers can save more than $6,000 in lifetime repair and maintenance costs from an EV compared to a gas-fueled vehicle. It is estimated the federal government spent about $2 billion on EV tax credit payments in 2024.

Loss of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Mining Program will reverse decades of progress in preventing disease, injury and death among miners, experts said.

Around 150 researchers are expected to be laid off next month, effectively shuttering the program.

Steve Schafrik, associate professor of mine engineering at the University of Kentucky, said the agency's research labs are conducting studies not easily be replicated, noting the labs contain specialized equipment aimed at reducing hazards to which miners are exposed.

""Facilities for trying to reduce the noise of equipment so that workers aren't exposed to that level of noise all day, every day,"" Schafrik noted. ""That's a pretty difficult task, and you need to have very specific research equipment to do that.""

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said layoffs are part of an effort to combine numerous agencies under the umbrella of the new ""Administration for a Healthy America."" According to federal data, around one of five of the nation's operating coal mines are located in Kentucky.

Schafrik pointed out the program's worker safety materials are used by mining industries around the world. He stressed the shutdown also leaves an uncertain future for grants and contracts needed to recruit new researchers.

""NIOSH has put a big emphasis on generating capacity within the academic institutions for replenishment of the researchers who can go out and work in academia, industry, regulatory bodies and government research,"" Schafrik outlined.

He added the program's closure will affect other industries, such as mineral production.

""While we are looking to get more critical mineral production inside of the United States, to be coupling that with the reduction of the Health and Safety Research Program, I don't understand the reasoning behind that,"" Schafrik observed.

According to the Mine Safety and Health Administration, 10 miner fatalities occurred between Jan. 3 and March 5, 2025, more than triple the number from the same period last year.

The budget bill passed by the U.S. House and now under consideration in the Senate would reform environmental permitting in Illinois and nationwide, potentially streamlining the process and reducing litigation exposure.

Under the National Environmental Policy Act, large projects with the potential to affect the environment must complete environmental assessments or impact statements, including all federal agencies and affects private development projects needing federal permits. The new provision would create an expedited review process for a fee of 25% on top of the usual cost of a review.

Thomas Hochman, director of infrastructure policy at the Foundation for American Innovation, said the new rule would also shield projects from litigation related to permitting.

""There are quotes from folks like an outgoing EPA General Counsel, who say 90% of the details in a NEPA review are purely there for litigation-proofing the document,"" Hochman pointed out. ""You can imagine if you only need 10% of the details in that environmental impact statement, because you know that you are not at risk of litigation, that is almost certainly a radically faster timeline.""

National Environmental Policy Act reform has been attempted by both parties in Congress in recent years but could not pass the Senate. This year's bill marks the first time it has been attempted in the budget reconciliation process. If approved, the permitting reforms may accelerate some of the later phases of the multiyear Rebuild Illinois capital program.

In court, federal agencies have an 80% success rate on appeal and their environmental reviews are not often changed through litigation. One study of reviews showed solar energy projects face the highest litigation rate. Frequent litigation was also seen with pipelines, transmission lines and wind energy projects.

Despite streamlining the process, Hochman pointed out the reforms may also make projects subject to changing political priorities.

""If you let each administration determine what the cost is and also spend time determining what the cost should be, you can potentially see differences in treatment,"" Hochman observed. ""Maybe a Republican administration drags their feet and puts out a really high cost for a wind project that's going through an environmental impact statement. Maybe a Democratic administration does the same for a pipeline that's going through an environmental impact statement.""

Projects may still face litigation under other environmental laws such as the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts.

Supporters of electric vehicle ownership said there are a number of advantages to owning one.

Studies show EVs can convert 85% to 90% of their energy into forward movement. A majority of the electricity used in an EV vehicle is American-made and an EV can be charged at home, just like a cellphone.

Despite the benefits and their popularity, Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., the Speaker of the House, has proposed removing a $7,500 tax credit for EV owners as part of President Donald Trump's goal to restructure the country's budget.

John Higham, board member of the Electric Vehicle Association, wondered if it will cause potential EV car buyers to back away.

""Do I think if this $7,500 tax credit suddenly disappeared, it's not going to kill the electric vehicle?,"" Higham asked. ""It might slow the acceleration of the adoption of the electric vehicle but it's certainly not going to reverse the trend.""

Trump's budget proposal could pass between the end of May and the end of July. Higham acknowledged the tax credit is a strong motivator for people to buy or lease an electric car. And he expects a 10% to 12% growth rate for purchases. Higham admitted the number could drop to between 8% and 9% if the tax credit disappears.

As of December 2023, the Department of Energy shows slightly more than 26,000 Hoosiers own an electric vehicle.

The Republican controlled House has proposed legislation to extend the tax credit until the end of 2025 and analysts said the largest EV automaker, Tesla, owned by Trump associate Elon Musk, would be affected the most if the tax credit ends. Higham noted the fallout of repealing the tax credit could break down along party lines.

""That economic engine that is in those red districts, where there's new battery manufacturing put in, new automotive manufacturing put in,"" Higham pointed out. ""Those are the voters that are going to feel it the most, are in those red districts. And so there are Republican congressmen who are saying, not quite so fast. It is harder to repeal than I think most people realize.""

In 2024, it is estimated the federal government spent about $2 billion in advance point-of-sale EV tax credit payments. Buzz about the tax removal may push consumers to buy EVs sooner than later, to take advantage of the credit before it disappears.

The Senate must reject this reckless bill and we urge our entire delegation to fight to restore these provisions.” Unfortunately, it didn’t end with the House’s reconciliation bill.
At a time when we should be accelerating the transition to clean energy, Congress must not slam on the brakes.”","When the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in August of 2022, it was the biggest, boldest climate legislation in U.S. history. It promised to accelerate the clean energy transition, create green jobs across the country, and invest in a healthier, more sustainable future.

Now those promises are at risk of being broken. The reconciliation bill that passed the House, if enacted, would unravel key provisions of the IRA, rescind billions in clean energy investments, slash funding for key climate programs at the EPA and Department of Energy, and pull the rug out from under American families and businesses that have begun to rely on clean energy tax credits.

It’s a dangerous step backward, and the New York League of Conservation Voters is urging lawmakers in the U.S. Senate to reject this reckless legislation and restore the critical climate measures the House is attempting to strip away.

To understand how we got to this point, and with such a narrowly divided Congress no less, it helps to understand exactly what a reconciliation bill is.

“Budget reconciliation is a legislative procedure made available as a result of the 1974 Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act,” states to the Bipartisan Policy Center website. “Reconciliation allows for expedited consideration of certain and specified changes in law to align spending, revenue, and the debt limit with agreed-upon budget targets.”

The website for House Budget Committee Ranking Member Brendan Boyle explains it this way: “If the budget calls for reconciliation, it tells certain committees to change spending, revenues, deficits, or the debt limit by specific amounts. […] Each committee writes a bill to achieve its target, and if more than one committee is told to act, the Budget Committee puts the bills together into one big bill.”

Like the budget itself, that bill cannot be filibustered in the Senate and only needs a simple majority to pass. That’s why the content of reconciliation bills matter so much, and why the version that passed the House this year is so alarming.

“Early Thursday morning, the House of Representatives passed a reconciliation bill on party lines that guts nearly all federal tax credits for clean energy production and adoption, and slashes funding for key climate programs at the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy,” NYLCV said in a statement following the vote. “This bill – worse than the initial proposal – would bring New York’s clean energy progress to a grinding halt. Families and businesses would face higher utility bills, a less dependable grid, and increased air pollution. We are especially disappointed that New York’s Republican representatives, who championed the clean energy tax credits, ultimately failed to protect them. The Senate must reject this reckless bill and we urge our entire delegation to fight to restore these provisions.”

Unfortunately, it didn’t end with the House’s reconciliation bill. Separately, the anti-environment majority in Congress also removed a key tool for states to rein in air pollution.

“Just as troubling, both chambers voted to rescind the California Clean Air Waiver – a dangerous attack on states’ rights and one that strips New York and more than a dozen other states of the ability to set stronger tailpipe emissions standards, which are essential to our clean transportation strategy,” the League’s statement continued.

“These actions are a direct assault on our health, our economy, and our climate future. At a time when we should be accelerating the transition to clean energy, Congress must not slam on the brakes.”",http://nylcv.org/wp-content/uploads/D2F5EA00-C5B7-F538-0D33DD9DB13B2BBF.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 03:01:18.529889

The EPA was reported as arguing in its proposed regulation that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from power plants that burn fossil fuels ""do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution"" or to climate change because they are a small and declining share of global emissions.

It should be no surprise for the world what the Donald Trump administration will do on climate change since he signed an executive order for the US' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on his first day in the White House on Jan 20, as he did during his first term.

""It is the policy of my administration to put the interests of the United States and the American people first in the development and negotiation of any international agreements with the potential to damage or stifle the American economy,"" said Trump's day-one executive order on global environmental deals.

As part of Trump's first day orders, the US also halted all financial contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, leaving the UN climate body with a 22 percent shortfall in its core budget. In 2024, US contributions totaled $13.3 million.

Washington has not only turned a blind eye to the international obligations it has because of the huge amount of CO2 it has contributed during its industrial development, it has now also started to encourage the use of coal and gas in generating electricity by scrapping the limits on gas emissions from such plants.

Furthermore, it is trying to make things hard for renewable energy power plants, and even starts to add annual federal registration fees for EV and hybrid car owners. The fee will be $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids.

As one of the largest contributors of green house gas emissions and definitely the largest on a per capita basis, the US' withdrawal of its financial aid to emissions cutting projects will greatly compromise global climate actions. What the US government has done to roll back clean energy projects and encourage the use of fossil fuel in power generation represents a huge disservice to what the world has achieved in its fight against climate change.

""Interest of the US and American people first"" has become a pretext for the Trump administration to shirk its due international responsibility as the world's sole superpower. With ""make America great again"" as the guide for its policymaking, Trump's US has become an irresponsible superpower without a smattering of vision about the future of humanity.

Without making its due contribution to the global fight against climate change and to global endeavors to address other common challenges facing humanity, how can the Trump administration put the interests of the US and American people first?

The extreme climate conditions caused by climate change such as droughts and flooding will not exempt American people from their devastation, nor will environmental pollution.

""India’s clean energy growth outpaces global trends"" was originally created and published by Energy Monitor, a GlobalData owned brand.","India is addressing its rapidly growing electricity demand using affordable, clean, and efficient renewable energy sources, according to a new report from Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), an independent, non-profit organisation based in the US.

Titled ‘Empowering India: The Clean Energy Growth Opportunity’, the report highlights that India is achieving this through policy initiatives and innovation while minimising costs, boosting jobs and domestic production, and increasing competitiveness.

India's electricity demand could triple by 2050 due to a surge in vehicle use and air conditioning needs.

This development presents a unique chance to establish efficient and sustainable infrastructure from the outset, the report stated.

The report underscores that India is moving away from fossil fuels and import dependency by adopting clean and efficient energy solutions.

Importing fossil fuels currently costs India 5% of its GDP, but the shift to renewable energy, including solar and wind power, is proving to be a cost-effective alternative.

The largest renewable energy project under construction in India is nearly four times the size of the largest projects in the US or Europe.

Furthermore, India is advancing towards self-sufficiency in producing solar modules, wind generators, and battery cells.

The report also reveals that electricity generated from new solar plus storage facilities is now more affordable than new coal power plants. Moreover, solar power alone is cheaper than operating existing coal-fired plants.

Despite these advancements, India attracts only 4% of the global clean energy investment.

The report suggests that with adequate financial support, India's energy transition could lead to significant emission reductions by mid-century, surpassing those of Europe and North America, and setting a precedent for other emerging economies.

Earlier this month, India formalised a renewed memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Denmark to extend their collaboration in the energy domain.

Trump believes in “clean” coal technology that the industry itself finds overly expensive with questionable environmental gains.","When Donald Trump’s in a hole, he digs deeper.

As he does with other policies affecting immigration, trade and culture wars, Trump is still — or once again — pushing coal, beautifully clean coal as he calls it, as an energy goal. In pursuit of his belief that coal is being overlooked or displaced by “woke” concerns for solar, wind and alternative energy sources, last month Trump signed a series of executive orders towards reviving the dying coal industry.

Whatever political sense it makes for Trump to court miners (or mine owners) in West Virginia and Wyoming, his efforts seem a tad shy of recognizing environmental, economic or market condition realities. Apart from all else, Trump’s tariffs-driven trade war would seem on its face to discourage exports of coal to China and other Asian countries — the biggest markets for it.

To underscore the strategic pretzels being created around coal, China could turn to its increasingly warm ally Russia to buy yet more of its coal.

Earth.org, one of the myriad environmental groups critiquing Trump on coal, reminds us that coal remains the dirtiest fossil fuel, at 40%, the single largest source of fossil fuel carbon emissions and a major contributor to air pollution. “In fact, nations worldwide are turning away from coal,” the group said after the executive orders came out.

Similar coal promotion efforts during the first Trump administration fell flat and more than 100 plants shut down and others preferring cheaper, cleaner alternatives.

Trump on Coal

In four executive orders signed in April, Trump claims emergency authority to allow some older coal-fired power plants set for retirement to keep producing electricity to meet rising U.S. power demand amid growth in data centers, artificial intelligence and electric cars.

Trump has directed federal agencies to identify coal resources on federal lands, lift barriers to coal mining and prioritize coal leasing on U.S. lands — ending a “war on coal.” Basically, the orders rescind any existing rule that gets in the way of mining coal or distributing it and calls for acceleration of coal technologies. Trump believes in “clean” coal technology that the industry itself finds overly expensive with questionable environmental gains. The difference concerns sulfur content, according to the Institute for Energy Economic and Financial Analysis says

As a further incentive to coal-fired power companies, Trump offered a two-year exemption from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene because, well, ridding of regulation and dismissing concern about pollutants apparently are good.

In particular, Trump’s orders push to use coal to power new artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, which strikes one as using outmoded, dirty energy to power something Trump sees as cutting edge and “clean.” For context, Microsoft wants to re-power the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania to power its AI operations.

Together, the orders accept that coal is essential to national and economic security; he sees the supply as vast, while others see it as finite.

Of course, the coal promotion fits with incentives to the oil and natural gas industries and is meant to counter climate-driven government policies towards harnessing more solar, wind and nuclear sources — all part of the “Green New Deal” that Trump ridicules and hates. And, in the Trump way, the energy push is another national emergency that requires setting aside regulations and cutting Congress or courts out of policymaking.

The Environmental View

Consensus among environmentalists has been that Trump’s oil-heavy view of energy-at-any-cost policies are bad across climate, business and individual economics and strategic concerns, and that his chosen path to declare a national emergency to bulldoze over years of legislative and regulatory protections are a “sham.” We have Trump emergencies for immigration, tariffs, education, justice and more.

The Sierra Club says that since taking office Trump has weakened domestic energy production by pausing all wind projects, for example, and promising to slash hundreds of clean energy projects promoting under Joe Biden’s infrastructure project legislation.

Indeed, wind and solar now account for more U.S. energy power by percentage than does coal, which two decades ago reflected fully half of all electro power, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) predicts that Trump’s push will fail again. Coal is more costly, pollutes more and offers less reliability than other sources, and promoting it for power will increase consumer costs. No new plant has kicked in in more than a decade and the average age of existing plants is 53 years because coal has trouble competing. Studies suggest that emissions from it had a role in a half-billion U.S. deaths between 1999 and 2020.

Once again, coal policy offers us an interesting perch to watch the Trump administration at work. Clearly there are elements of politics at work here over, say, concern about environmental concerns, but we also see how anything related to “energy” that comes out of the ground is a personal trigger for Trump action. The idea that a nation could have some coal and some oil and some wind and solar just doesn’t seem to add up for Trump; to promote coal means to halt wind power — even as the world’s power needs as a whole are increasing.

Unless you are Trump or a fan, pushing coal to the exclusion of other energies makes little sense.

After a successful debut last year, the program returns with triple the size, double the duration and a stronger lineup of sustainability initiatives. This season, green-minded travelers have even more reasons to choose Copenhagen.

Known for its commitment to environmental policies, Copenhagen is already putting climate solutions into action and redefining its tourism approach. As visitors explore famous landmarks, dine at Michelin-starred restaurants and walk around the city, CopenPay offers unique experiences and rewards, encouraging longer stays and participation in environmental efforts.

A new currency: Responsible actions

The World Travel & Tourism Council reported in 2024 that the travel and tourism sector contributed $10.9 trillion to global GDP, about 10% of the world’s total economy. It also supported 357 million jobs, roughly 1 in 10 positions worldwide.

However, the environmental downsides of tourism are significant. The World Counts says that the industry often puts pressure on natural resources through overconsumption, especially in areas where those resources are already limited. Common issues include water scarcity, pollution, waste buildup and harm to local ecosystems. Over time, tourism can also lead to soil erosion, habitat loss and increased pressure on wildlife, which can sometimes damage the very environments that draw visitors in the first place.

That’s exactly where CopenPay steps in. The initiative offers a practical response to tourism’s environmental toll by shifting the focus from high-impact habits to low-emission alternatives. Instead of racking up costs, visitors earn access to experiences by doing things that align with Copenhagen’s values, like taking public transit, eating plant-based meals and even joining a cleanup.

This year, CopenPay runs for nine weeks from June 17 to Aug. 17 and spans 90 attractions across the city. That includes everything from bike rentals and yoga to discounted entry at world-class museums like the National Gallery of Denmark and the Danish Architecture Center. More than just perks, the initiative encourages travelers to rethink not just what they do on vacation, but how they get there in the first place.

Rewards for traveling responsibly

Tourists travel to Copenhagen in all sorts of ways, from planes and cruise ships to buses and private cars. But transportation has a major environmental impact, and not all travel modes are created equal. In the words of Søren Tegen Pedersen, CEO of Wonderful Copenhagen, “The biggest climate impact from tourism comes from transportation. So, this year, we encourage travelers to take the train to Copenhagen. Furthermore, we want visitors to travel less but stay longer.”

Travelers who arrive by train are rewarded not just with a lighter carbon footprint but with experiences that showcase the best of Copenhagen. Rewards include complimentary meals made from surplus food, free bike rentals, yoga sessions and guided tours at the city’s cultural spots.

Visitors who collect flower seeds in the city center and plant them in designated green areas or pots get free entry to Kronborg Castle, and some travelers may even be invited to a dinner by JunkFood CPH, the nonprofit founded by Michelin-starred chef Rasmus Munk.

People arriving in electric cars also qualify for perks such as discounted parking. And those staying four days or more unlock additional benefits, like vegetarian meals, free bike rentals and more rewards tailored to longer visits.

“By integrating more responsible actions into the visitor experience, CopenPay is redefining how we in Copenhagen approach tourism. Rather than bringing more tourists to the city, the goal with CopenPay is to nudge our visitors and raise their awareness about traveling in a more sustainable way, exploring Copenhagen more responsibly while being rewarded with unique experiences,” added Pedersen.

Stay longer, travel less

Today’s travelers are rethinking the impact of their trips, with growing awareness of how tourism affects both the environment and local communities. CopenPay taps into this shift by encouraging longer, lower-impact stays over quick, high-emission getaways. The rewards program promotes slower, more thoughtful travel that allows visitors to engage more deeply with Copenhagen. The result is a better experience for the traveler and a lighter footprint on the city.

Copenhagen leads, others follow

CopenPay started as a small pilot last year and exceeded expectations by boosting sustainable choices and earning strong participant endorsements. Yahoo Finance reports that, in just four weeks, the initiative drove a 29% rise in bike rentals, led to widespread litter collection and earned a 98% recommendation rate from participants. Now, back at triple the scale, it has become a case study in how cities can engage visitors in low-impact travel.

But the ambition behind CopenPay stretches beyond city limits. Wonderful Copenhagen has since shared its results with more than 100 destinations around the world, hoping to inspire similar programs elsewhere. The idea is not just to change behavior during a single trip, but to plant lasting habits that travelers carry home with them.

“One of the great things about tourism is cultural exchange,” says Søren Tegen Pedersen. “We learn a lot from our visitors, and in return, we hope they’ll leave Copenhagen inspired to bike more, choose more plant-based meals and continue making more responsible choices wherever they are.” The program encourages visitors to reduce their environmental impact while contributing positively to the places they visit.

A model for what travel can be

CopenPay proves sustainable tourism works when it’s grounded in real actions. The program makes responsible travel easy and rewarding, without taking away from the experience. It’s built on trust, shaped by local values and designed to inspire long-term change. As more cities look to Copenhagen, the future of travel seems more thoughtful, connected and sustainable.

New Delhi: In a push to electrify its roads and reduce vehicular emissions, the Maharashtra government has notified its EV Policy 2025, setting an ambitious target to convert 30 per cent of all new vehicle sales to electric by 2030. The policy is in effect from April 1, 2025 to March 31, 2030, and offers incentives across the EV ecosystem, from buyers and manufacturers to charging infrastructure developers.

The policy outlines specific category-wise EV adoption targets by 2030, including 40 per cent for new two-wheelers (L1 & L2) and three-wheelers (L5M), 30 per cent for passenger four-wheelers (M1), 25 per cent for light goods carriers (N1), and 20 per cent for heavy goods carriers (N2, N3). Public transport electrification goals include 40 per cent for State Transport Undertaking (STU) buses and 15 per cent for non-STU public transport buses in six urban regions.

To accelerate adoption, the government will offer purchase subsidies of up to ₹2 lakh per electric transport vehicle (M1), capped at 25,000 vehicles. For buses (M3, M4), the subsidy can go up to ₹20 lakh per unit, with a maximum of 1,500 vehicles. Electric tractors and harvesters will receive subsidies up to ₹1.5 lakh, with 1,000 units covered.

All EVs registered within the policy period will be exempt from motor vehicle tax and registration renewal charges. Additionally, electric passenger vehicles will be exempt from tolls on major state and national highways, including Mumbai–Pune Expressway, Samruddhi Mahamarg, and Atal Setu.

The policy mandates the installation of charging stations every 25 km on highways. All fuel stations in the state will be required to install at least one charging point. Up to 1,500 high-power DC fast charging stations will receive capital support of up to ₹10 lakh per station.

Fleet electrification will be made compulsory in select areas. This includes 100 per cent electrification of government fleets, 25 per cent for aggregator and e-commerce fleets, and 50 per cent for last-mile delivery vehicles in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Nashik, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, and Amravati.

The policy extends “D+” category incentives under the 2019 Package Scheme of Incentives to EV and battery manufacturing units across the state. It also outlines the development of EV battery recycling hubs in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar.

Advt

According to the government, implementing this policy could reduce vehicular PM2.5 emissions by 325 tonnes and greenhouse gas emissions by 1 million tonnes by 2030.

For real estate and infrastructure, the policy mandates that all new residential buildings must provide 100 per cent EV-ready parking spaces. Commercial buildings will need to reserve at least 50 per cent of their parking capacity for EVs.

A Chief Secretary-led Steering Committee will oversee implementation. All relevant departments have been directed to issue implementation guidelines within 30 days of the policy’s notification on May 23, 2025.

The policy also outlines support for R&D, including the establishment of three Centres of Excellence in EV innovation, to be supported by a ₹15 crore Chief Minister’s R&D Grant.

Models like the Baker Electric Coupe and Riker Electric Roadster ran smoothly on U.S. roads, with electric taxis making up a third of New York’s fleet at one point. But as oil-based fuels became widely available and the Ford Model T offered a cheaper, longer-range alternative, battery cars began losing ground. By the mid-1930s, electric vehicles had almost completely vanished, overtaken by gas-powered cars and the rise of the oil industry, which was heavily supported by federal tax incentives.

The politics that powered gasoline — and sidelined EVs

In 1926, US lawmakers offered generous tax breaks to oil companies, letting them deduct 27.5% of their sales from taxable income. This helped cement gasoline’s dominance for decades. Today’s Republican leaders are taking similar steps — but in reverse. The Trump administration is pushing to eliminate tax credits for electric vehicles, impose a new annual fee of $250 on EV owners, and halt federal investment in EV charging infrastructure. The proposed changes could stall the industry’s momentum just as it's beginning to grow, the New York Times reported.

Infrastructure remains a key challenge — then and now

One of the main reasons electric cars failed a century ago was the lack of electricity in many parts of the country. Rural America wasn’t fully electrified until the 1970s. Today, the challenge lies in the lack of accessible charging infrastructure. US Congress approved $7.5 billion under the Biden administration to build public chargers, but the Trump administration has stopped that rollout. As in the past, range anxiety and slow charging times continue to hurt EV adoption, particularly in areas outside major cities.

From feminine to macho: The changing image of EVs

Early electric cars were marketed as clean, easy-to-use alternatives — often pitched to women. Jay Leno’s 1909 Baker Electric, still operable, includes space for Victorian hats and even features a built-in makeup case. That image of quiet refinement contributed to gendered stereotypes, which played a role in their decline. Today, the narrative has shifted. Critics like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene say EVs are an attempt to “emasculate” driving culture, while Elon Musk’s Tesla Cybertruck represents an attempt to rebrand EVs as powerful and masculine. Yet Musk’s political alignment with Trump may be alienating many of Tesla’s environmentally conscious customers.

EV sales are booming globally — but slowing in the U.S.

Electric vehicle sales grew by 35% in China and 25% in Europe during early 2025. But in the U.S., sales grew just 11%. Policy uncertainty and the rollback of federal support are dampening growth. Analysts warn that while the Republican proposals may not kill the EV sector, they could delay progress by years — especially with infrastructure expansion on hold.

Lessons from history: Technology isn’t always enough

Electric cars didn’t fail a century ago due to poor design — they were simply outmatched by lower costs, better fuelling options, and political bias toward oil. As historian Leslie Kendall notes, a Ford Model T cost one-third of what an electric car did in 1908. Carrying extra gas was easy; carrying extra electricity was not. Richard Riker, the grandson of electric car pioneer Andrew L. Riker, says the same issues remain today: until fast, widespread charging is available, gas will remain more convenient.

The future of EVs may again rest on political will

Despite the setbacks, Riker believes EVs can still win the race — if charging becomes quick and widespread. “If you can charge a car in five minutes and go 500 miles,” he said, “the gasoline engine is history.” But for that future to arrive, policy support may matter as much as innovation — just as it did a century ago.",https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2025/05/20250527041958_EVs.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 01:03:44.282100

About Alterra, an Akron company

Alterra already has permission to use a process called pyrolysis to convert hard-to-recycle plastics into raw oil products, said Katie Boyer, an EPA spokesperson.

Omar Terrie, a spokesperson for Alterra, said the company heats post-consumer plastics — like milk jugs and plastic bags — back into an oil. The oil is then sent to chemical companies to make new plastics or for other uses.

Alterra’s process turns plastics into a gas by heating them in a kiln with no oxygen, Terrie said, then converting the gas into a liquid known as a feed stock for other purposes. The process, he said, is rigorously regulated.

The company, which was founded in 2009 and has been in operation since 2015, does this work at a facility on East Waterloo Road near the Akron Fulton Airport.

If renewed, Alterra’s permit would reduce the maximum amount of plastic the company can feed into its kiln each hour — from 6,250 pounds to 5,000 pounds. Boyer said in an email the reduction request was made because Alterra found it could not meet its maximum; Terrie said the reduced number is what the plant is run at.

Terrie said the permit renewal had been delayed “out of an abundance of caution” while the EPA learned more about the technology.

The permit was first issued in 2012 and was good for 10 years; it was modified in 2013, 2015 and 2017. Boyer said the renewal was delayed because of the modifications.

Opposition concerned with ‘pollution of toxic chemicals into the air’

Big Love has for months organized in opposition to Alterra’s permit, holding meetings and rallies.

“Our concerns, obviously, are pollution of toxic chemicals into the air from the Alterra facility,” said Beth Vild, The Big Love Network’s chief operating officer and director of programming. Vild is also a member of People Over Polymers.

Vild said she has particular concerns about benzene and vinyl chloride emissions. The draft permit provides limits for a number of pollutants: volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxide and particulate emissions.

If approved, Boyer said, the permit would set limits on Alterra’s emissions of those pollutants. Terrie said Alterra has operated in compliance and does not have any violations.

“We’re a good corporate neighbor and partner,” he said.

‘Barely recycling anything’ or reducing the amount of plastic in landfills?

The process that Alterra uses, Vild said, is akin to incinerating plastic waste, not recycling it. She said Alterra is “barely recycling anything” and instead just burning plastic.

Terrie said Alterra is producing 20,000 tons of synthetic oil annually, with a staff of more than 50 people that is consistently growing. While he understands there are “a lot of legacy issues in the area that predate us,” and Alterra’s technology can seem scary, he said it’s used to reduce the amount of plastic that goes into landfills.

Still, Vild is concerned that the company is “greenwashing” — claiming to care about the planet while “doing really awful, terrible things to the planet.”

Boyer said in an email that, if approved, the permit “allows the company to operate in a manner that is protective of human health and the environment, following both Ohio and U.S. EPA air requirements set under the Clean Air Act.”

The permit process included an environmental justice screening. A representative from the Akron Regional Air Quality Management District, which completed the screening, did not respond to a request for the report or for comment.

The Akron Regional Air Quality Management District will make a recommendation to the EPA about whether the permit should be issued. Boyer said there’s no timeframe for the recommendation.

Public comment to the EPA can also be submitted, using permit number P0133062, online or by mail to:

The Mexican state aims to enhance security and project a modern image with the Tesla Cybertrucks.

Jalisco is preparing to welcome millions of visitors as Guadalajara, its capital, joins Mexico City and Monterrey as one of three Mexican host cities for the global event. The 2026 FIFA World Cup will feature 13 matches, including an opening ceremony game.

The Tesla Cybertrucks are part of Jalisco’s broader security strategy to ensure safety during the international tournament. With an expected influx of over 5 million visitors, the state is focusing patrols in key tourist areas. Acquiring Tesla’s all-electric pickup trucks underscores Jalisco’s commitment to blending innovation with security.

Governor Pablo Lemus defended the decision to integrate three Tesla Cybertrucks into the State Public Security Department’s fleet.

“We also need to work a lot on the perception of security; we are going to deliver 678 patrol cars for the State Police, State Highway Police, and State Police, including some ‘Black Mambas,’ which are this kind of tanks,” Lemus said.

The Cybertrucks are part of a larger delivery of 678 patrol vehicles to state and municipal forces, enhancing capability and public perception. Lemus’ comment reveals one of the reasons that Tesla Cybertruck continues to attract buyers despite its out-of-the-box design.

The Tesla Cybertruck’s unveiling received mixed reviews, with many commenting on its origami-like form. Over time, the pickup truck was seen as a good commercial vehicle since it attracted attention and could be imposing.

During President Donald Trump’s visit to Doha, Qatar, two Tesla Cybertruck police vehicles accompanied his motorcade. Their iconic light bars and striking design made them stand out, showcasing their versatility beyond Jalisco’s borders.

As Jalisco prepares for the global spotlight of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the Tesla Cybertrucks symbolize a fusion of cutting-edge technology and strategic security planning. The initiative aims to protect visitors and positions Jalisco as a forward-thinking region, leveraging Tesla’s innovative vehicles to enhance its global image. With the tournament approaching, these patrols could set a new standard for security at international events, blending sustainability with strength.

A controversial tax set on cars that are above the £40,000 price threshold in the United Kingdom could be abandoned, as the “Tesla Tax,” as it is commonly referred to, is taking the blame for poor EV sales.

The tax has been imposed on ICE vehicles since 2017, but on April 1, 2025, the “Expensive Car Supplement,” or ECS, was applied to new EVs sold after that date, a move that was initiated in an act of fairness.

Tesla best-rated car brand in UK, beats Toyota in reliability: survey

However, the tax is now being blamed for sluggish EV sales across various parts of Europe. In the UK, manufacturers are blaming the tax for making it more difficult to reach sales quantities for binding green car sales targets. Missing these sales goals could cost manufacturers millions or even billions of dollars.

A leaked letter seen by This Is Money and MailOnline shows the UK is ready to reconsider the tax, which is combined with a Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) on cars in the second year after they are registered.

The tax could be applied to vehicles at a higher price point, or it could be eliminated altogether. However, Ben Maguire, a Lib Dem MP for one region in the UK, said:

“We will consider raising the threshold for zero-emission cars only at a future fiscal event to make it easier to buy electric cars.”

Several companies said an adjustment to the tax would be “a move in the right direction,” and one of the major new car retailers in the UK said sales targets are “unrealistic” with the tax currently set at where it is.

UK reconsiders EV sales targets, listening to automakers

Even still, without the adjustment, retailers are concerned that EVs are not at a spot where consumers truly can justify them as a purchase. One company said “cost, lack of incentives, and lack of a public charging infrastructure” are the biggest bottlenecks in the adoption of EVs.

Tesla has been hinting for a few months now that the flagship Model S and Model X would be getting some attention in 2025 as the vehicles continue to be sold in extremely low volumes.

Both models seem to be under the knife, especially as their newest versions were spotted in California earlier this week.

However, images of the vehicles seem to show that Tesla is not planning a major overhaul, which begs the question: why even do it in the first place?

Tesla makes a decision on the future of its flagship Model S and Model X

The Model S and Model X are grouped with the Cybertruck in Tesla’s quarterly delivery releases, and Q1 saw just 12,881 units of the three cars delivered. The Cybertruck likely made up the majority of this number, as some outlets reported around 6,400 deliveries of the all-electric pickup in Q1.

This is unconfirmed.

The Model S and Model X have stuck around for “sentimental reasons,” according to CEO Elon Musk, who said back in 2021:

“I mean, they’re very expensive, made in low volume. To be totally frank, we’re continuing to make them more for sentimental reasons than anything else. They’re really of minor importance to the future.”

However, the cars seem to be in need of a serious refresh. As Tesla changed up the exterior aesthetic on both the Model 3 and Model Y, recent images captured of the Model X by The Kilowatts seem to show this is not the strategy with the Model X or Model S:

As we can see, the overall aesthetic of the X, if this is what Tesla plans to release, has literally no changes from a purely visual standpoint. There is the addition of the front bumper camera, which was first implemented on the Cybercab unveiled in October 2024, and then on the new Model Y this year.

There are some new 20″ wheels, and the interior has been fitted with ambient lighting.

The Model S looked to be relatively the same, other than these few hardware changes, including a rear diffuser on this Plaid that was spotted:

While these changes are welcome and should be beneficial, they don’t seem like they will encourage major sales growth, which might be something Tesla is okay with.

Admitting the two cars are low volume and not contributors to the company’s long-term goals, Musk is likely willing to just upgrade things to make these more compatible and better functioning with the Full Self-Driving suite.

Earlier this year, VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy said the S and X were not going anywhere and would get “some love” before the end of 2025:

“Just give it a minute. We’ll get there. The upgrade a couple of years ago was bigger than most people thought in terms of architecture and structure of the car got a lot better, too. But, we’ll give it some love later this year and make sure it gets a little bit…you know, with the stuff we’ve been putting in 3 and Y. Obviously, with 3 and Y, the higher volume stuff, you’ve gotta focus there.”

It seems these strategies have held true — the S and X appear to be getting what the 3 and Y got with the ambient lighting and front bumper camera (at least on the Model Y).

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is set to kick off its own “golden age of autonomous growth” as its Robotaxi platform nears launch and a “dark chapter” for the company has evidently come to a close, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.

Ives has jostled his price target on Tesla shares a few times already this year, usually switching things up as the market sways and the company’s near-term outlook changes. His price target on Tesla has gone from $550 to $315 to $350 back to $500 this year, with the newest adjustment coming from a note released early on Friday.

As CEO Elon Musk has essentially started to dwindle down his commitment to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) altogether, Ives believes that Tesla’s “dark chapter” has come to a close:

“First lets address the elephant in the room…2025 started off as a dark chapter for Musk and Tesla as Elon’s role in the Trump Administration and DOGE created a life of its own which created brand damage and a black cloud over the story….but importantly those days are in the rear-view mirror as we are now seeing a recommitted Musk leading Tesla as CEO into this autonomous and robotics future ahead with his days in the White House now essentially over.”

Ives believes Tesla’s launch of Robotaxi should be the company’s way to unlock at least $1 trillion in value alone, especially as the Trump White House will fast-track the key initiatives the automaker needs to get things moving in the right direction:

“The $1 trillion of AI valuation will start to get unlocked in the Tesla story and we believe the march to a $2 trillion valuation for TSLA over the next 12 to 18 months has now begun in our view with FSD and autonomous penetration of Tesla’s installed base and the acceleration of Cybercab in the US representing the golden goose.”

There are some concerns moving forward, but none of which relate to the AI/autonomous play that Ives primarily focuses on within the Friday note. Instead, they are related to demand in both Europe and Asia, as Ives said, “there is still wood to chop to turn around Model Y growth” in both of those markets.

Nevertheless, the big focus for Ives is evidently the launch of Robotaxi and the potential of the entire autonomous division that Tesla plans to offer as a ride-sharing service in the coming months. Ives also believes a 50 percent or more penetration of Full Self-Driving could totally transform the financial model and margins of Tesla moving ahead.

Aware of the setbacks Tesla could encounter, Ives still believes that Tesla will establish itself as “the true autonomous winner over” and that investors will recognize the AI vision the company has been so bullish on.

Ives pushed his price target to $500. Tesla shares are down just under 1% at the time of publication. They are trading at $337.88 at 11:45 on the East Coast.",https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tesla-Cybertrucks-join-Jaliscos-police-fleet-before-2026-FIFA-World-Cup--1000x600.jpeg,N,,2025-05-27 01:04:08.287946

Because of slower than expected adoption, Porsche will offer additional vehicles with combustion engines and plug-in hybrid powertrains. The company also announced a “realignment of battery activities.”

More notably, Porsche has launched an “extensive cost and rescaling program.” This will result in around 3,900 job cuts by 2029. The company is also planning to have discussions with their works council on a “structural package” that is “intended to make Porsche even more efficient in the medium and long term.”

Porsche CEO Dr Oliver Blume didn’t mince words as he said, “The world has changed” and “We are experiencing a fierce storm.” However, he said “We accept the challenge. We have a plan. We are acting. And we’re not wasting any time.”

Volvo Is Cutting 3,000 Jobs Globally

Over in Sweden, Volvo revealed a number of cuts as part of their previously announced “cost and cash action plan.” The latest effort targets redundancies and is slated to see the elimination of around 3,000 jobs globally. The automaker said these will “primarily affect office-based positions in Sweden and will represent around 15 percent of the total office-based workforce globally.”

The automaker went on to explain the figure includes approximately 1,000 consultants as well as 1,200 employees in Sweden. These eliminations are slated to occur this fall and the company expects the latest restructuring costs to total up to SEK 1.5 billion ($157.6 / £116.2 / €138.5 million).

Volvo CEO Håkan Samuelsson said, “The actions announced today have been difficult decisions, but they are important steps as we build a stronger and even more resilient Volvo Cars.” He added, “The automotive industry is in the middle of a challenging period. To address this, we must improve our cash flow generation and structurally lower our costs.”",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Porsche-Volvo-hgfgd.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 23:58:54.499994

Tax credits under the IRA were meant to continue through 2032, but Yale Climate Connections reports that the following measures will be phased out at the end of this year:

• For individuals: Credits for clean vehicles, used clean vehicles, alternative fuel vehicle refuelling, energy efficient home improvements, and residential clean energy;

• For businesses: Commercial clean vehicles, new energy-efficient homes, and clean hydrogen production.

And if passed, the bill would eliminate environmental and climate justice block grants.”

“This policy about-face couldn’t come at a worse time: Energy prices have surged 30% since 2020,” Ari Matusiak, CEO of the non-profit Rewiring America, said in a statement. “Maintaining these tax credits gives American households an opportunity to offset these price hikes.”

Climate author and Third Act co-founder Bill McKibben has a summary of the day on his The Crucial Years blog.

The House measure, literally titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, eliminates technology-neutral clean energy tax credits for projects that go into service after 2028, or begin construction more than 60 days after the bill is adopted, Utility Dive writes, while allowing longer lead times for nuclear projects. It also creates a “truly untenable” situation for renewable energy developers by tightening restrictions on “foreign entities of concern” like China, one analyst told the industry publication. And it shuts down a tax credit transfer arrangement under the IRA that helped small and medium projects arrange financing and previously had support from Republicans as well as Democrats.

The bill “abruptly dismantles bipartisan, long-standing tax policy that has catalyzed billions in private investment for affordable, reliable energy while sparking a rebirth of manufacturing across America,” said Heather O’Neill, president and CEO of Advanced Energy United. “If enacted as written, this bill will weaken our power system and send shockwaves throughout the U.S. economy by raising electricity prices, killing tens of thousands of jobs, and ceding energy dominance to China.”

“This unworkable legislation is willfully ignorant of the fact that deploying solar and storage is the only way the U.S. power grid can meet the demand of American consumers, businesses, and innovation,” the Solar Energy Industries Association said in a statement. “If this bill becomes law, America will effectively surrender the AI race to China and communities nationwide will face blackouts.”

As recently as March, 21 House Republicans were urging their colleagues to protect the IRA tax credits from a premature phaseout. Last week, 14 of the original signatories were still standing behind the credits, Inside Climate News reports.

In the end, none of them voted against the bill. One of them, Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-NY) missed the vote, but had planned to support the measure.

“They’re feeling pressure to go along with whatever Trump wants and whatever the [Republican House] leadership wants,” David Spence, a professor and energy law specialist at the University of Texas at Austin, told Inside Climate. “What’s putting counter pressure on them is that for some of them that means giving up a lot of jobs and money” that their districts received thanks to the IRA. “And for others, it’s about how far they can be pushed away from their principles.”

“These clean energy tax credits have been a game changer for communities across the nation, including in the districts of the Republican representatives,” said BlueGreen Alliance Executive Director Jason Walsh. “The GOP caved to the MAGA extremists in their party so they could screw over America’s workers to stuff the pockets of billionaires.”

Princeton University associate professor and energy transition veteran Jesse Jenkins says the bill will:

• Increase U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 500 million tonnes per year in 2030 and more than a billion tonnes per year in 2035;

• Raise U.S. household and business energy expenditures by US$25 billion per year in 2030 and more than $50 billion in 2035;

• Increase average U.S. energy costs by roughly $100 to $160 per household per year in 2030 $270 to $415 per household per year in 2035;

• Reduce U.S. electricity and clean fuels production by a cumulative $1 trillion through 2035;

• Imperil $522 billion in announced but pending investments in U.S. clean energy supply and manufacturing;

• Reduce annual electric vehicle sales by roughly 40% in 2030 and “end America’s battery manufacturing boom”;

• “Substantially slow” new grid additions, raising national average retail electricity rates and monthly household electricity bills by about 9% in 2030, and up to 17% in states like Texas, Oklahoma, and swing state Pennsylvania;

• Kill off the country’s emerging clean hydrogen, carbon dioxide management, and nuclear power sectors.

Now, after Donald Trump campaigned last year against what he called the “Green New Scam”, Republicans in the U.S. Senate “must grapple with the reality behind the slogan: cutting hundreds of billions of dollars of clean energy subsidies that are flowing to their own states,” the Washington Post reports.

“The majority of the government spending is creating jobs and manufacturing capacity in red states,” Jason Bordoff, founding director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy y, told the Post. “So this puts Republicans, generally and now in the Senate, in the position of having to choose whether to support the party line or maintain support for government programs that are creating a lot of economic activity in their states.”

After the House adopted the bill, the U.S. fossil lobby weighed in in support of a measure it said would “help restore American energy dominance.”

“By preserving competitive tax policies, beginning to reverse the ‘methane fee,’ opening [oil and gas] lease sales, and advancing important progress on permitting, this historic legislation is a win for our nation’s energy future,” American Petroleum Institute President and CEO Mike Sommers said in a statement. “We look forward to working with the Senate to strengthen pro-investment provisions and keep America at the forefront of energy innovation.”

But despite the U.S. president’s loud mutterings about his “Drill, Baby, Drill” agenda, the country’s fracking executives say the combination of higher costs due to Trump’s tariff wars and lower prices due to higher OPEC+ output will likely drive down U.S. production, the Financial Times reports this week.

“We’re on high alert at this point,” Devon Energy CEO Clay Gaspar told investors earlier in May. “Everything is on the table as we move into a more distressed environment.”

• Reduce annual electric vehicle sales by roughly 40% in 2030 and “end America’s battery manufacturing boom”;

• “Substantially slow” new grid additions, raising national average retail electricity rates and monthly household electricity bills by about 9% in 2030, and up to 17% in states like Texas, Oklahoma, and swing state Pennsylvania;

• Kill off the country’s emerging clean hydrogen, carbon dioxide management, and nuclear power sectors.

Now, after Donald Trump campaigned last year against what he called the “Green New Scam”, Republicans in the U.S. Senate “must grapple with the reality behind the slogan: cutting hundreds of billions of dollars of clean energy subsidies that are flowing to their own states,” the Washington Post reports.

“The majority of the government spending is creating jobs and manufacturing capacity in red states,” Jason Bordoff, founding director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy y, told the Post. “So this puts Republicans, generally and now in the Senate, in the position of having to choose whether to support the party line or maintain support for government programs that are creating a lot of economic activity in their states.”

After the House adopted the bill, the U.S. fossil lobby weighed in in support of a measure it said would “help restore American energy dominance.”

“By preserving competitive tax policies, beginning to reverse the ‘methane fee,’ opening [oil and gas] lease sales, and advancing important progress on permitting, this historic legislation is a win for our nation’s energy future,” American Petroleum Institute President and CEO Mike Sommers said in a statement. “We look forward to working with the Senate to strengthen pro-investment provisions and keep America at the forefront of energy innovation.”

But despite the U.S. president’s loud mutterings about his “Drill, Baby, Drill” agenda, the country’s fracking executives say the combination of higher costs due to Trump’s tariff wars and lower prices due to higher OPEC+ output will likely drive down U.S. production, the Financial Times reports this week.

“We’re on high alert at this point,” Devon Energy CEO Clay Gaspar told investors earlier in May. “Everything is on the table as we move into a more distressed environment.”",https://www.theenergymix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/u.s.-capitol-2-credit-Mitchell-Beer-sized.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 22:59:35.008234

The experts recognized that the initiative achieved some successes, but noted that there have been debates on its overall effectiveness, with concerns raised on unmet targets, limited industrial impact, and overstated achievements.

Power Africa, launched by the US in 2013 aimed at improving access to electricity in Africa, was operated by USAID and terminated earlier this year, with the majority of its staff having been dismissed.

Nj Ayuk, the executive chairman of the African Energy Chamber, an energy advocacy group based in South Africa, said while the initiative had a good strategy, it accomplished few projects in the continent since its inception more than a decade ago.

He said the project didn't invest in natural gas, one of the continent's precious resources which is capable of powering entire Africa. In addition, it failed to implement major projects that could potentially generate a significant amount of electricity to ease the shortage of power in the continent. That includes the Inga Dam in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Similar sentiments were shared by Damilola Ogunbiyi, special representative of the UN Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All, who said even though any reduction in aid is unfortunate, the glass is seen as half full in the case of the closure of Power Africa.

""While reduced aid could potentially risk increasing the number of people living without electricity to well beyond the current 660 million people who mostly reside in Africa, we are also seeing signs of tremendous ambition in the sector,"" she said.

Lending support

She said China could help build Africa's renewable energy manufacturing capacity, lending support to existing projects such as the Africa Renewable Energy Manufacturing Initiative, while also bridging the financing gap.

Ogunbiyi noted that globally, from 2000 to 2020, Africa received less than 1.5 percent of the $2.8 trillion invested in renewable energy projects — with a downward trend indicated in subsequent years.

""Investments are critical for Africa to achieve a clean energy transition, estimated to cost over $200 billion annually,"" she said, adding that China could play a significant role in reducing the financing deficit while also helping build renewable energy markets.

She said African governments are committed to transitioning their energy systems, while tackling energy poverty.

""Because most African countries are on the front lines of climate change and its impacts, governments recognize that they need to build resilient structures and sustainable economies, but they require financing to achieve these goals. I believe China's knowledge, combined with their resources, could help,"" Ogunbiyi said.

The plan to build the reactors was approved at a State Council executive meeting in April. Eight will be third-generation Hualong One reactors, which China’s state-owned China National Nuclear Corporation and China General Nuclear Power Group claim to have independently developed based on US and French pressurized water reactors (PWR).

The remaining two reactors will be CAP1000 units based on the AP1000 PWR developed by US-based Westinghouse. The total power generation capacity of the 10 reactors is expected to reach around 12,000 megawatts.

The reactors will be built in the provinces of Shandong, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, with all planned locations along the coast.

The power plants will be operated by the two nuclear energy companies, as well as such state-owned power companies as State Power Investment Corporation and China Huaneng Group.

The Chinese government has been promoting nuclear power plant construction since the 1980s, using technology from France and other countries. The disaster at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in 2011 led to the tightening of safety measures and Beijing halting new licenses for nuclear plants.

Approval for new projects resumed in 2019 and the pace quickened to about ten reactors per year from 2022.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has made nuclear power part of his efforts to cut air pollution.

Gasoline-powered vehicles contribute to air pollution and pose risks to energy security due to oil imports. China relies on overseas sources for about 70% of the crude oil it consumes. Beijing is pushing electric vehicles as an alternative to gasoline-powered vehicles, creating a need to secure more electricity.

The nuclear push also serves as a measure against global warming. In 2020, Xi said China would strive to make carbon dioxide emissions peak before 2030 and to achieve net zero emissions before 2060.

As a result, there were 57 nuclear reactors in operation in China at the end of 2024, with a total generating capacity of 59,760 MW, according to an April report by a Chinese government-affiliated nuclear power industry group. In terms of capacity, China is third in the world after the US and France, the report said.

Generating capacity of China’s nuclear power plants in 2030 will reach 110,000 MW, according to projections in the report, and that if the current construction pace around the world continues, China will overtake the US and France to become the leader.

Nuclear power accounted for 4.7% of China’s power mix based on generation in 2024, according to government statistics. Conventional power generation, which mainly uses coal and other fossil fuels, remains the highest at 67.4%.

The report predicts that the proportion of nuclear power will reach 10% by 2040.

In the US, construction costs for large nuclear power plants have soared, and new construction has stagnated. A large nuclear power plant built in Georgia led to the bankruptcy of Westinghouse and heavy losses for its parent company, Toshiba.

Construction costs are also rising in Europe. In China, state-owned enterprises build plants one after another, helping to increase proficiency and curb sudden cost increases.",https://console.kr-asia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nuclear-1.webp,N,,2025-05-26 22:04:39.056562

To the grief of the world, the US is reversing global endeavors against the common challenges facing humanity.","The House of Representatives of the United States passed a bill last week, which advanced a sweeping spending package that would roll back Biden-era tax credits for renewable energy projects. They include an early phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles, moving up the timeline to end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants as well as requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028.

At the same time, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced on Saturday that it is working on a proposal to remove all existing restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from coal- and gas-fired power plants in the country.

The EPA was reported as arguing in its proposed regulation that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from power plants that burn fossil fuels ""do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution"" or to climate change because they are a small and declining share of global emissions.

It should be no surprise for the world what the Donald Trump administration will do on climate change since he signed an executive order for the US' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on his first day in the White House on Jan 20, as he did during his first term.

""It is the policy of my administration to put the interests of the United States and the American people first in the development and negotiation of any international agreements with the potential to damage or stifle the American economy,"" said Trump's day-one executive order on global environmental deals.

As part of Trump's first day orders, the US also halted all financial contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, leaving the UN climate body with a 22 percent shortfall in its core budget. In 2024, US contributions totaled $13.3 million.

Washington has not only turned a blind eye to the international obligations it has because of the huge amount of CO2 it has contributed during its industrial development, it has now also started to encourage the use of coal and gas in generating electricity by scrapping the limits on gas emissions from such plants.

Furthermore, it is trying to make things hard for renewable energy power plants, and even starts to add annual federal registration fees for EV and hybrid car owners. The fee will be $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids.

As one of the largest contributors of green house gas emissions and definitely the largest on a per capita basis, the US' withdrawal of its financial aid to emissions cutting projects will greatly compromise global climate actions. What the US government has done to roll back clean energy projects and encourage the use of fossil fuel in power generation represents a huge disservice to what the world has achieved in its fight against climate change.

""Interest of the US and American people first"" has become a pretext for the Trump administration to shirk its due international responsibility as the world's sole superpower. With ""make America great again"" as the guide for its policymaking, Trump's US has become an irresponsible superpower without a smattering of vision about the future of humanity.

Without making its due contribution to the global fight against climate change and to global endeavors to address other common challenges facing humanity, how can the Trump administration put the interests of the US and American people first?

The extreme climate conditions caused by climate change such as droughts and flooding will not exempt American people from their devastation, nor will environmental pollution.

To address common challenges such as climate change and ecological destruction, joint endeavors of all countries are important. This is common sense.

That explains why China has proposed the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative. China has also proposed the building of a community with a shared future for humanity, which is meant to mobilize global resources for addressing common challenges in order to make human development sustainable.

Even highly modularized DAC units like those envisioned by Climeworks represent significant, capital-intensive systems, each processing hundreds of thousands to millions of cubic meters of air per ton of CO₂ captured.
The fundamental minimum energy required to capture CO₂ at the dilute concentrations found in ambient air sets a hard, non-negotiable energy floor.
Unlike digital technology or small-scale consumer goods, DAC units cannot shrink significantly or dramatically reduce material inputs without sacrificing performance.
More realistic projections settle higher, acknowledging inherent thermodynamic limits, persistent energy costs, and material constraints.","The remarkable cost declines in solar photovoltaic (PV) and lithium-ion batteries over the past several decades have fueled optimism in the climate policy and investment community, with many hoping direct air capture (DAC) technologies might follow a similar trajectory. Policymakers, investors, and industry proponents frequently draw analogies between DAC and these wildly successful clean-energy technologies, invoking Wright’s Law—a rule of thumb where costs fall predictably with cumulative doubling of production—to justify unjustifiably bullish projections for DAC’s future costs. Given the unrealistic scenarios requiring carbon removal to achieve net-zero emissions, the attractiveness of DAC scaling cheaply and quickly is understandable, yet such optimism demands critical scrutiny grounded in the realities of technology, markets, and physics.

I’m drawn back to this space, one I’ve been exploring for 15 years, doing technoeconomic assessments of Global Thermostat’s applicability in heavy rail, Carbon Engineering’s natural market of enhanced oil recovery and speaking to many of the leading researchers and entrepreneurs in the space. Why am I drawn back? Because I wrote about Climework’s ongoing trainwreck—105 tons total captured from a 40,000-ton annual homeopathy device and now 22% layoffs—recently, and many commenters made it clear that they thought DAC would follow solar and batteries into the nirvana of cheapness.

Solar PV and batteries achieved their cost revolutions through clear, consistent factors. Foremost was Wright’s Law itself: with each doubling of global cumulative production, solar PV saw about a 20% reduction in cost, while lithium-ion batteries experienced roughly a 19% drop per doubling. Historically, Wright’s Law saw 20% to 27% decreases, depending on the simplicity of the product. These impressive and predictable learning rates emerged for solar and batteries because both technologies quickly found mass-market applications with billions of end-users—solar panels across rooftops worldwide and lithium-ion cells powering consumer electronics and, later, electric vehicles. Such enormous, diverse markets spurred massive economies of scale, standardization of manufacturing processes, and continuous incremental innovation, driving down prices dramatically over relatively short periods.

In solar manufacturing, scale-up to gigawatt-scale factories allowed for unprecedented efficiency gains. Automation, production-line standardization, reduced material usage, and steady incremental improvements in cell efficiency combined to achieve a 99% reduction in costs since the 1970s. Batteries followed a similar pattern. Initially expensive lithium-ion cells rapidly benefited from global consumer electronics markets, then exploded in scale with the electric vehicle boom of the 2010s. Innovations in chemistry, manufacturing methods, and supply chain management drove battery costs down by over 90% since 2010 alone. Crucially, both technologies became genuinely commoditized, their costs falling sufficiently low to be attractive purely on market economics, independent of ongoing subsidies.

In stark contrast, DAC technology faces fundamental structural, thermodynamic, and market constraints that severely limit its potential to emulate these learning-curve successes. While DAC systems like those developed by Climeworks and Carbon Engineering also involve engineered modular units, their scale and replicability differ drastically from solar and batteries. Solar PV and battery units are small, identical, easily mass-produced components numbering in the billions, allowing rapid parallel production and iterative optimization. DAC, conversely, involves large, complex industrial-scale modules that process massive volumes of air. Even highly modularized DAC units like those envisioned by Climeworks represent significant, capital-intensive systems, each processing hundreds of thousands to millions of cubic meters of air per ton of CO₂ captured. Achieving large-scale global deployment would involve thousands of units—not billions—limiting opportunities for rapid learning through repetition and optimization.

Further compounding this problem, DAC relies heavily on mature, off-the-shelf technologies. Key components such as large industrial fans, chemical sorbents, heat exchangers, compressors, and pumps are already widely used across industries. Unlike emerging semiconductor processes or battery chemistries that initially featured substantial inefficiencies ripe for innovation, DAC’s hardware components are closer to their optimized cost floors, having already benefited from decades of engineering and scale in other applications. Incremental improvements in sorbent chemistry or component efficiency may yield modest savings, but the potential for radical cost reductions through fundamentally new approaches or extensive technological simplifications is inherently limited.

Perhaps the most stubborn barrier DAC faces in following a PV-like cost curve is rooted in basic physics: the energy-intensive nature of extracting CO₂ from the atmosphere. Unlike solar cells, whose primary cost drivers are fabrication efficiency and material utilization, DAC confronts unavoidable thermodynamic constraints. The fundamental minimum energy required to capture CO₂ at the dilute concentrations found in ambient air sets a hard, non-negotiable energy floor. Current DAC operations use energy at several times the theoretical minimum, but even highly optimistic scenarios still require substantial energy input, typically hundreds to thousands of kilowatt-hours per ton of CO₂. Thus, DAC will always incur significant operational energy costs that place a lower bound on achievable pricing, unlike solar panels and batteries, whose unit costs dropped rapidly with better manufacturing processes and materials science advances.

Adding complexity, DAC is physically and materially intensive. Capturing millions of tons of CO₂ per year demands enormous amounts of infrastructure—steel, concrete, sorbent materials, and sophisticated capital equipment. Unlike digital technology or small-scale consumer goods, DAC units cannot shrink significantly or dramatically reduce material inputs without sacrificing performance. Indeed, the large physical dimensions of air contactors, substantial volumes of sorbent material needed, and considerable infrastructure for regeneration and compression suggest that DAC systems will remain heavy, complex installations. As DAC scales, rather than benefit from continuously cheaper materials, increased demand for specialty chemicals and industrial materials may drive prices upward, potentially offsetting some manufacturing efficiency gains. This scenario contrasts sharply with the declining per-unit material intensity that helped accelerate solar and battery cost reductions.

Critically, DAC lacks the autonomous, self-sustaining market demand that propelled solar PV and batteries. Solar power and battery storage offered direct economic benefits to millions of end-users, enabling them to become cost-competitive with conventional energy sources over time. DAC, however, provides an environmental service—carbon removal—whose value remains purely policy-dependent. Without robust carbon pricing, governmental incentives, or regulatory mandates, DAC has no inherent private market demand, severely limiting its potential cumulative production growth. Whereas solar panels and batteries rapidly scaled through consumer and business demand, DAC expansion hinges exclusively on sustained public policy support. Such policy-driven markets are vulnerable to political shifts, budget constraints, and public sentiment, making exponential growth in DAC production far less predictable or assured.

Historical analogues from other large-scale industrial and environmental technologies underscore DAC’s challenging trajectory. Technologies such as nuclear power, large-scale carbon capture on fossil plants, and industrial chemical plants have all faced similar complexities and constraints, often resulting in slow, incremental cost reductions—or even cost escalation—as they scaled. These technologies offer more instructive benchmarks for DAC than solar or batteries, highlighting the cautious reality that DAC may experience only modest learning curves of around 10% per cumulative doubling, far slower than the 20% or more seen in clean-energy consumer markets.

All of this leads to 10% or less cost take out for a lot fewer doublings for DAC fan units, the only component which will have any volumes. The chart ends at just below 10,000 units. For context, a million ton per year Carbon Engineering system might have 250 contactor units, the basic module in a wall two kilometers long and 20 meters high. They’d have to build 64 km of their system to get to 8,000 fans, and that’s exceedingly unlikely. To get another 10%, they’d have to build 128 km of walls of their system with 16,000 units. To get another 10, 256 km with 32,000 units.

Meanwhile, a single one GW solar farm has around 1.8 million solar panels. The volumes are radically different, and the rate of cost decreases per doubling are radically different.

Looking forward, expert analyses from independent institutions like the International Energy Agency, Harvard’s Belfer Center, and the National Academies broadly agree: DAC costs will likely remain in the triple-digit dollar range per ton even after decades of scaling. Starry eyed scenarios predict DAC might achieve costs around $150 to $250 per ton by mid-century under aggressive deployment assumptions. More realistic projections settle higher, acknowledging inherent thermodynamic limits, persistent energy costs, and material constraints. Industry-driven forecasts that envision DAC below $100 per ton are simply delusional, hinging on technological breakthroughs that would require changing the laws of physics and ludicrously low energy cost assumptions as a result.

Given these realities, policymakers and investors must fundamentally rethink their near-term engagement with DAC. Aggressively reducing emissions through proven, lower-cost technologies such as electrification, renewable energy, and energy efficiency should remain the clear and unambiguous priority until energy systems are fully decarbonized and surplus renewable electricity is abundant—likely not until after 2040 and probably beyond 2050. DAC, due to its inherently high energy intensity and substantial infrastructure requirements, should not divert limited resources from direct emission-reduction strategies until we reach a point where clean energy is inexpensive and plentiful.

Policymakers and investors should limit current DAC involvement strictly to research and development, aiming to improve technology performance, reduce energy requirements, and better understand realistic long-term potential. Public spending on commercial-scale DAC deployment or infrastructure is premature and risks locking in inefficient, high-cost solutions before cleaner, lower-cost alternatives are fully exploited.

Carbon removal strategies in the immediate decades should instead emphasize nature-based methods and improved soil carbon sequestration—technologies with significantly lower energy demands and clearer short-term scalability. The belief that we can vacuum enough CO2 out of the atmosphere to reach 2050 goals should be abandoned, and more aggressive decarbonization scenarios driven through.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ChatGPT-Image-May-26-2025-02_31_21-PM-800x533.png,N,,2025-05-26 22:04:28.040266

Why it matters: The move to remove California's authority to set vehicle-emissions rules will deprive the state of a major tool in its pollution-reduction toolbox. It also shows how far Republicans are willing to go to defy congressional norms in the name of overturning Democrats' climate policies.

What would the rules have done? The first of the three rules would have required automakers to sell increasing percentages of zero-emission vehicles through 2035, when all new-car sales would have to be zero-emission. The other two would impose zero-emission sales targets for heavy-duty trucks and require them to reduce their nitrogen oxide emissions. Ten other states are signed on to follow California's car rules.

Partisan breakdown: The Senate's vote Thursday came after weeks of Republican deliberations over whether to flout the opinion of the Senate parliamentarian, who had said that federal approval of California's standards shouldn't be subject to the Congressional Review Act. In previous Republican administrations, the U.S. EPA had tried to revoke the rules administratively. One Democratic senator — Elissa Slotkin of Michigan — joined Republicans in the vote against the car standards, compared with dozens of Democrats in the House.

What's next? Trump is expected to sign the bills in the coming weeks. California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta said last week they'll sue once he does.

GreenPower Motor Company sent a letter to multiple employees last week, stating “the imposition of new tariffs has significantly increased our operational costs and disrupted our ability to build and deliver buses in a timely manner.”

The letter said the financial impact will result in layoffs despite “best efforts to manage these challenges through cost-cutting and restructuring.”

The company launched later in 2022. Boone, Clay, Wirt and Wyoming counties were next in line thanks to .

Earlier this year, the company worked through along with dealer contract setbacks leading to delays.

Last week’s letter said the company evaluated multiple options, including reallocating resources, making internal transfers and offering voluntary separations, but none of those avenues would offset the financial burden.

“This is not a reflection of your performance, but rather an unfortunate consequence of external economic forces,” the letter said.

Eyewitness News reached out to the company for more information. A statement from GreenPower did not specify the number of employees affected, but it did detail “staggering” issues school bus manufacturers are facing:

Today, GreenPower Motor Company had to make a very difficult decision to pause manufacturing and layoff a portion of its workforce at its manufacturing facility in South Charleston, West Virginia. The imposition of new tariffs has significantly increased GreenPower’s operational costs and disrupted the company’s ability to build and deliver buses in a timely manner. Despite best efforts to manage these challenges through cost-cutting and restructuring, the financial impact has been too severe to sustain current workforce levels. This decision was not made lightly. GreenPower carefully evaluated all options, including reallocation of resources, voluntary separations and internal transfers. Unfortunately, none of these measures could fully offset the economic burden GreenPower is facing due to the tariffs.The recent implementation of trade tariffs is causing much harm to the entire school bus manufacturing sector. This business instability and the significantly increased costs impacts all school bus manufactures whether they are producing electric, diesel, propane or gas school buses. The implications are staggering.If a school bus manufacturer were able to pass these costs on to a school district, it would amount to a tax on the government as the cost would be paid by either local, state or federal government funding. But a school bus original equipment manufacturer (OEM) cannot pass on the increased cost since there are state contracts in place for the purchase of school buses. The new tariffs leave no pathway for a school bus OEM to build vehicles in the United States and it completely halts GreenPower’s efforts to on-shore and friend-shore the supply chain, especially non-Chinese battery cells and components.GreenPower is committed to supporting its employees during this transition. Employees will receive assistance from GreenPower with any questions regarding unemployment benefits or references.

This just a week before the controversial Guana Tomomato Matanzas Reserve land swamp proposal was posted online to the public.

No word if there's a connection between the two, but her resignation letter has some people scratching their heads.

Callie DeHaven is a well-respected person in conservation circles and very familiar with northeast Florida. She has abruptly resigned as the director of the Florida Division of State Lands within the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.

Her resignation letter was a simple piece of notebook paper, written in pen, stating: To whom it may concern, I hereby resign my position... effective June 2nd, 2025 close of business.

This is the agency that would have been the second entity to approve the controversial land swap that would have given 600 acres of protected land inside the Guana River Wildlife Management Area in St. Johns County to a private and mysterious entity. That deal is now a no-go because the applicant -- The Upland, LLC -- withdrew the application due to public outcry.

First Coast News does not know if this issue had anything to do with DeHaven's decision to resign. We do know the letter is dated one May 6, which is one week before the land swap proposal was posted online inside a state meeting agenda.

DeHaven has been the Director of the Division of State Lands for eight years. According to her LinkedIn pages, she has also been the Manager of the Conservation Program with Rayonier and she's also worked with The Nature Conservancy.

The DEP sent us a statement saying DeHaven has dedicated “more than two decades to conservation planning, land acquisition and land stewardship. During her tenure, Florida Forever surpassed one million acres of conservation land acquired.”

We want to reduce and prevent the power outages as best as possible and that’s where grid modernization comes in.”

Hardening the grid looks different depending on where customers live. Some who live in areas where power lines are vulnerable to being brought down are seeing those lines move underground.

“Our goal in the strategic underground program is to bury about 4000 miles of power lines,” said Newsome. “So far, we’ve buried about 2500 miles of power lines. That represents about 13% of our power lines. What that does is reduce the elements that those power lines are exposed to. It’s been able to reduce outage times from about 11 hours to around 2 minutes.”

Additionally, for power lines in less vulnerable areas, Dominion Energy has upgraded the installation and size of power poles.

“We have a grid hardening program which uses taller poles rooted more deeply in the ground so that they can better withstand the elements of extreme weather conditions like thunderstorms and lightning,” Newsome said.",https://www.wavy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/09/AP18191677914574.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-05-26 20:01:46.354253

The Volvo FL Electric, leased by TR Group, will be integrated into key transport routes, demonstrating the feasibility of low-emission freight at scale.

The companies say the partnership aligns with KCA’s broader sustainability commitment and Ofload’s ongoing push to decarbonise Australia’s supply chains.

“This isn’t just about one electric truck on the road, it marks a pivotal moment where we prove the viability, efficiency, and significant carbon reductions that electric freight can deliver at scale,” said Ofload CEO Geoffroy Henry.

“This is the future of logistics, and we’re leading the way.”

“Our freight partnership with Ofload is a key lever within our supply chain and we’re proud to partner with them on this transformative project,” Renton said.

By replacing even one diesel truck with an electric alternative, Ofload and Kimberly-Clark Australia say they are proving that zero-emission freight isn’t a distant vision but a reality that can be scaled today.

Ofload and TR Group worked closely with Brisbane Transport to determine the financial viability, network integration, and operational efficiency of this transition.

Using detailed commercial modelling that factored in variables such as vehicle utilisation, kilometre range, driver hours and revenue margins, Ofload said it demonstrated the positive operational and sustainability impacts of introducing an electric truck to Brisbane Transport’s fleet.

This highlights how small and medium carriers can embrace electric freight solutions with the right logistics partners, utilisation guarantees, and financial support models, Ofload said.

That’s because the construction machinery giants that grew fat off the country’s property bubble are looking for new markets to offset the downturn at home. Combined with looming electrification, the effects could be quite as dramatic as the other Made-in-China export booms which have so troubled trading partners.

Consider Sany Heavy Industry. In 2020, 83 per cent of its business was selling excavators, cranes, concrete mixers and the like to domestic developers. In the space of just four years, China’s property crash has caused its turnover in that market to shrink by two-thirds.

Overseas markets now account for more than 60 per cent of revenue. It’s hoping to raise US$1.5 billion via a Hong Kong initial public offering to help it double international sales to 100 billion yuan (US$14 billion), the South China Morning Post reported this month.

Sany isn’t alone. Its local rivals XCMG Construction Machinery, Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science & Technology, and Guangxi LiuGong Machinery are all facing the same collapse of activity on the home front, where housing starts in the first four months of 2025 fell to their lowest level since 2003.

That’s left dismal returns on all the assets they built to service a market that’s since disappeared – below 5 per cent, less than half what Caterpillar manages and well below the 7.7 per cent at Komatsu.

EXPORTS AND ELECTRIFICATION

The best way out of this problem is to find export markets to get the production lines for all those diggers, dozers, lifters and trucks humming again. Zoomlion’s international sales have followed Sany’s in becoming the largest element of its revenue, and XCMG and LiuGong aren’t far behind.

There’s plenty of work to go around. In the Persian Gulf, governments are using the windfall from the oil boom of the early 2020s to build a swath of major infrastructure projects, from the Middle East’s first Walt Disney theme park in Abu Dhabi to a new international airport in Riyadh and a US$22 billion five-year infrastructure plan for Qatar.

Construction markets are also booming across South and Southeast Asia and in parts of Africa. China’s export market share in major categories of work vehicles has soared in recent years.

As with passenger cars, electrification offers a potent route for further disruption. Batteries are often considered an ill fit for construction machinery, which has extreme power needs that diesel is particularly well-placed to deliver.

But that’s changing as lithium-ion cell-makers build cheaper and longer-lasting power packs that can often keep running as long as an eight-hour work day, according to IDTechX, a consultancy. Electric construction equipment sales will grow at 21 per cent annually up to 2044, when they’ll hit US$126 billion, IDTechX predicted last year.

Chinese manufacturers have an advantage here. Local battery-makers CATL and BYD are market leaders in LFP, the cathode chemistry that’s likely to be best-suited to site vehicles, thanks to its stability and low costs.

Already, local construction machinery manufacturers produce about two-thirds of the electric bucket loader models on the market.

RAISING THE DRAWBRIDGE INSTEAD OF COMPETING

Circumspect governments should be looking at ways to outcompete this shift. Instead, they’re raising the drawbridge.

The European Union last month set tariffs as high as 67 per cent on Chinese construction machinery, while the UK has more recently imposed duties of more than 30 per cent on excavators made by Sany, Liugong and XCMG. The Indian joint venture between Tata Motors and Hitachi Construction Machinery last year called on New Delhi to raise levies against imported Chinese products, saying they’d already grabbed 22 per cent of the market.

Things are even worse in the US, where the Trump administration is busy unpicking the heavy-duty vehicle emission standards introduced by former President Joe Biden. That removes much of the incentive for US-exposed manufacturers such as Caterpillar, Komatsu, Volvo and Deere & Co to innovate and compete with the coming onslaught.

Work vehicles have tended to fly below the radar in discussions of urban emissions, but their vast size and power requirements give them a disproportionate share of engine pollution. China’s 10 million construction machines emit more particulates than its 417 million road vehicles, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation.

With low-emission zones spreading across cities worldwide and older diesel vehicles increasingly restricted on the roads of major cities such as London, Paris and Madrid, construction machinery is increasingly going to find itself in the crosshairs as one of the biggest contributors to urban pollution.

When that happens, Chinese manufacturers will have a solution ready to be driven from their parking lots. Will their incumbent overseas competitors be ready, too?","https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--Zq0lXdKq--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:ap_data-1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/one-cms/core/china_economy_64284.jpg?itok=Cc2rr0hm",N,,2025-05-26 20:02:12.488141

Just last week, the J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant was working to shutter the facility, then DOE Secretary of Energy Chris Wright declared an emergency and ordered the plant to remain open temporarily.

Wright's order declares an emergency for portions of the Midwest grid after a report showed the potential for tight electric reserves for the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), which operates an electric grid across 15 states in the central United States. The DOE's order aims to increase reliability and reduce rates

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) released its 2025 Summer Reliability Assessment and it forecasts that MISO is at an elevated risk of shortfalls during high-demand periods this summer, particularly in August.

The J.H. Campbell Complex—which is capable of generating 1,560 MW—was set to be retired this month, with operations ceasing on May 31.

Consumers Energy and MISO had planned for the reduction in electric capacity on the grid with the closure of J.H. Campbell and acquired a 1,200 MW natural gas power plant in Covert to supplement the reduction in electricity generated.

But despite the acquisition, the NERC Assessment still anticipates “elevated risk of operating reserve shortfalls.”

Wright's order, issued on May 23, 2025, takes immediate effect and requires MISO to ""take every step to employ economic dispatch of the Campbell Plant to minimize cost to ratepayers."" Consumers Energy is directed to comply with all orders from MISO.

The order has received both praise and pushback from lawmakers and official government bodies. The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) says that the order will do just the opposite of its intention, calling it ""unnecessary"" and claiming it will raise prices on customers.

Dan Scripps, Chair of the MPSC, issued the following statement in response to the order:

“The unnecessary recent order from the U.S. Department of Energy will increase the cost of power for homes and businesses in Michigan and across the Midwest.

“Michigan is proud of its robust approach to resource planning which balances reliability and affordability. We currently produce more energy in Michigan than needed. As a result, there is no existing energy emergency in either Michigan or MISO.

“The MPSC will continue to work with MISO and Consumers Energy to assess the impacts of the DOE’s order and work to limit unnecessary cost increases imposed as a result of this order.”

Rep. Dave Prestin (R-Cedar River) issued a statement in support of the emergency order to keep the power plant open:

“I want to thank the administration and Secretary Wright for hearing our concerns and taking action to protect this critical energy asset and keep J.H. Campbell operational. The baseload energy produced there is crucial to tens of thousands of people who count on reliable and affordable energy.

“This facility is a regional asset, not just to Michigan, but to the entire Midwest. Its importance cannot be understated. If J.H. Campbell goes down, we enter into dangerous territory, where one bad day for any generation asset — whether it be baseload, wind, or solar — could mean widespread outages.

“The President and his administration continue to recognize the importance of safeguarding American energy production. I’m grateful for their never-ending commitment to protecting the American people’s access to affordable and reliable energy.”

According to the order, the power plant will remain open until August 21, 2025. Consumers Energy did not say if they plan to continue with the plant's retirement and closing after the order expires.",https://media.kvue.com/assets/WZZM/images/ef6619dd-5033-4fe1-b1e5-2de0dd17c8ca/20250526T181859/ef6619dd-5033-4fe1-b1e5-2de0dd17c8ca_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 20:01:53.171846

As climate disasters strain state budgets, a growing number of lawmakers want fossil fuel companies to pay for damages caused by their greenhouse gas emissions.

Last May, Vermont became the first state to pass a climate Superfund law, reports Grist. The concept is modeled after the 1980 federal Superfund law, which holds companies responsible for the costs of cleaning up their hazardous waste spills. The state-level climate version requires major oil and gas companies to pay for climate-related disaster and adaptation costs, based on their share of global greenhouse gas emissions over the past few decades. Vermont’s law passed after the state experienced torrential flooding in 2023. In December, New York became the second state to pass such a law.

This year, 11 states, from California to Maine, have introduced their own climate Superfund bills. Momentum is growing even as Vermont and New York’s laws face legal challenges by fossil fuel companies, Republican-led states, and the Trump administration. Lawmakers and climate advocates told Grist that they always expected backlash, given the billions of dollars at stake for the oil and gas industry—but that states have no choice but to find ways to pay the enormous costs of protecting and repairing infrastructure in the face of increasing floods, wildfires, and other disasters.

The opposition “emboldens our fight more,” said Maryland state delegate Adrian Boafo, who represents Prince George’s County and co-sponsored a climate Superfund bill that passed the state legislature in March. “It means that we have to do everything we can in Maryland to protect our citizens, because we can’t rely on the federal government in this moment.”

While the concept of a climate Superfund has been around for decades, it’s only in recent years that states have begun to seriously consider these laws. In Maryland, federal inaction on climate change and the growing burden of climate change on government budgets have led to a surge of interest, said Boafo. Cities and counties are getting hit with huge unexpected costs from damage to stormwater systems, streets, highways, and other public infrastructure. They’re also struggling to provide immediate disaster relief to residents and to prepare for future climate events. Maryland has faced at least US$10 billion to $20 billion in disaster costs between 1980 and 2024, according to a recent state report. Meanwhile, up until now, governments, businesses, and individuals have borne 100% of these costs.

“We realized that these big fossil fuel companies were, frankly, not paying their fair share for the climate crisis that they’ve caused,” Boafo said.

Recent bills have also been spurred by increased sophistication in attribution science, said Martin Lockman, a climate law fellow at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. Researchers are now able to use climate models to link extreme weather events to greenhouse gas emissions from specific companies. The field provides a quantitative way for governments to determine which oil and gas companies should pay for climate damages, and how much.

Vermont’s law sets up a process for the government to first tally up the costs of climate harms in the state caused by the greenhouse gas emissions of major oil and gas companies between 1995 and 2024. The state will then determine how much of those costs each company is responsible for, invoice them accordingly, and devote the funds to climate infrastructure and resilience projects. New York’s law, by contrast, sets a funding target ahead of time by requiring certain fossil fuel companies to pay a total of $75 billion, or $3 billion per year over 25 years. The amount each company has to pay is proportionate to their share of global greenhouse gas emissions between 2000 and 2024. Both Vermont and New York’s laws apply only to companies that have emitted over 1 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions over their respective covered periods. That would include Exxon Mobil, Shell, and other oil and gas giants.

Maryland Governor Reverses Course

Maryland’s law is so far the only climate Superfund-related legislation to pass a state legislature this year, although Governor Wes Moore vetoed the measure. The original draft of the bill would have required major fossil fuel companies to pay a one-time fee for their historic carbon emissions. But over the course of the legislative session, the bill was amended to instead simply require a study on the cumulative costs of climate change in Maryland, to understand how much money an eventual program would need to raise. The study would be due by December 2026, at which point Maryland lawmakers would need to propose new legislation to actually implement a climate Superfund program.

“I wish it wasn’t amended the way it was,” Boafo said, adding that lawmakers devoted much of their energy this legislative session to addressing Maryland’s $3.3 billion budget deficit.

In a veto letter, Moore stated that Maryland’s “budget situation” and “chaos from Washington, D.C.” mean that the state needs to reconsider any bills that require resource-intensive studies. “We face a real and present danger from a White House that continues to attack our economy with reckless abandon,” Moore wrote. “In this time of profound uncertainty, we must evaluate every expenditure with a critical eye towards our future.”

Climate advocates decried the governor’s decision, calling it “an inexplicable reversal of a position that threatens to stymie Maryland’s climate progress for negligible budget savings.” In a joint press release by three environmental groups, Kim Coble, executive director of the Maryland League of Conservation Voters, said, “This veto is not fiscal responsibility, it’s a definitive step in the opposite direction of our climate goals.”

California Tries to Build Consensus

In California, environmental groups are optimistic about the chances of a bill passing this year. This is the second year a climate Superfund bill has been introduced in the state, and the sponsors of the new bill have focused on building a broad coalition of environmental, community, and labor groups around the proposal, said Sabrina Ashjian, project director for the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the UCLA School of Law. This year’s legislation was introduced shortly after the devastating Los Angeles wildfires in January, which could amplify lawmakers’ sense of urgency. The bill has now passed out of each legislative chamber’s environmental committee and is awaiting votes in their respective judiciary committees. If passed, the bill will next move to the full Senate and Assembly for a final vote.

Vermont, New York, and Other States Face Legal Pushback

In the meantime, legislators are keeping a close eye on ongoing legal challenges to Vermont’s and New York’s laws. In January, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute, two trade groups, launched a lawsuit against Vermont’s climate Superfund law. In February, 22 Republican state attorneys general and industry groups filed a lawsuit against New York’s law. Both challenges claim that the laws violate interstate commerce protections and are preempted by federal law. Because the federal Clean Air Act regulates greenhouse gas emissions, the groups argue, states cannot pass laws related to climate damages.

Now the Trump administration has joined the legal battle. On May 1, the Department of Justice sued the states of New York and Vermont over their climate Superfund programs, echoing the same arguments raised by the fossil fuel industry. The same day, the department also sued the states of Hawaiʻi and Michigan over their intentions to sue fossil fuel companies for climate-related damages. All four lawsuits frequently use identical language, Lockman pointed out. The lawsuits follow last month’s executive order by President Donald Trump that called for the Justice Department to challenge state climate policies, and directly targeted Vermont and New York’s climate Superfund laws. Shortly after the Justice Department’s lawsuits were filed, West Virginia and 23 other states announced they would join the existing lawsuit against Vermont’s law led by the Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute.

Legal experts noted that Trump’s executive order itself has no legal impact, and that states have well-established authority to implement environmental policies. Patrick Parenteau, a legal scholar at Vermont Law and Graduate School, told the New York Times he expected the Justice Department’s cases to be dismissed. A court could end up consolidating the federal suits with existing challenges against Vermont and New York’s laws, although given that they raise the same arguments, “there’s really nothing new being added here,” said Lockman.

Climate experts told Grist that with huge amounts of money and liability at stake, lawsuits from the fossil fuel industry weren’t unexpected. Boafo said that given how much financial and political support the Trump campaign received from oil and gas corporations, it’s not a surprise that the Justice Department has sued New York and Vermont. Pursuing these laws invites inevitable opposition—but avoiding the growing costs of climate devastation is even riskier, advocates said.

Lawmakers are “passing these bills because in writing budgets, in dealing with the day-to-day operation of their states, they’re facing really serious questions about how our society is going to allocate the harms of climate change,” said Lockman. “I suspect that the lawmakers who are advocating for these bills are in it for the long haul.”

Momentum is growing even as Vermont and New York’s laws face legal challenges by fossil fuel companies, Republican-led states, and the Trump administration. Lawmakers and climate advocates told Grist that they always expected backlash, given the billions of dollars at stake for the oil and gas industry—but that states have no choice but to find ways to pay the enormous costs of protecting and repairing infrastructure in the face of increasing floods, wildfires, and other disasters.

The opposition “emboldens our fight more,” said Maryland state delegate Adrian Boafo, who represents Prince George’s County and co-sponsored a climate Superfund bill that passed the state legislature in March. “It means that we have to do everything we can in Maryland to protect our citizens, because we can’t rely on the federal government in this moment.”

While the concept of a climate Superfund has been around for decades, it’s only in recent years that states have begun to seriously consider these laws. In Maryland, federal inaction on climate change and the growing burden of climate change on government budgets have led to a surge of interest, said Boafo. Cities and counties are getting hit with huge unexpected costs from damage to stormwater systems, streets, highways, and other public infrastructure. They’re also struggling to provide immediate disaster relief to residents and to prepare for future climate events. Maryland has faced at least US$10 billion to $20 billion in disaster costs between 1980 and 2024, according to a recent state report. Meanwhile, up until now, governments, businesses, and individuals have borne 100% of these costs.

“We realized that these big fossil fuel companies were, frankly, not paying their fair share for the climate crisis that they’ve caused,” Boafo said.

Recent bills have also been spurred by increased sophistication in attribution science, said Martin Lockman, a climate law fellow at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. Researchers are now able to use climate models to link extreme weather events to greenhouse gas emissions from specific companies. The field provides a quantitative way for governments to determine which oil and gas companies should pay for climate damages, and how much.

Vermont’s law sets up a process for the government to first tally up the costs of climate harms in the state caused by the greenhouse gas emissions of major oil and gas companies between 1995 and 2024. The state will then determine how much of those costs each company is responsible for, invoice them accordingly, and devote the funds to climate infrastructure and resilience projects. New York’s law, by contrast, sets a funding target ahead of time by requiring certain fossil fuel companies to pay a total of $75 billion, or $3 billion per year over 25 years. The amount each company has to pay is proportionate to their share of global greenhouse gas emissions between 2000 and 2024. Both Vermont and New York’s laws apply only to companies that have emitted over 1 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions over their respective covered periods. That would include Exxon Mobil, Shell, and other oil and gas giants.

Maryland Governor Reverses Course

Maryland’s law is so far the only climate Superfund-related legislation to pass a state legislature this year, although Governor Wes Moore vetoed the measure. The original draft of the bill would have required major fossil fuel companies to pay a one-time fee for their historic carbon emissions. But over the course of the legislative session, the bill was amended to instead simply require a study on the cumulative costs of climate change in Maryland, to understand how much money an eventual program would need to raise. The study would be due by December 2026, at which point Maryland lawmakers would need to propose new legislation to actually implement a climate Superfund program.

“I wish it wasn’t amended the way it was,” Boafo said, adding that lawmakers devoted much of their energy this legislative session to addressing Maryland’s $3.3 billion budget deficit.

In a veto letter, Moore stated that Maryland’s “budget situation” and “chaos from Washington, D.C.” mean that the state needs to reconsider any bills that require resource-intensive studies. “We face a real and present danger from a White House that continues to attack our economy with reckless abandon,” Moore wrote. “In this time of profound uncertainty, we must evaluate every expenditure with a critical eye towards our future.”

Climate advocates decried the governor’s decision, calling it “an inexplicable reversal of a position that threatens to stymie Maryland’s climate progress for negligible budget savings.” In a joint press release by three environmental groups, Kim Coble, executive director of the Maryland League of Conservation Voters, said, “This veto is not fiscal responsibility, it’s a definitive step in the opposite direction of our climate goals.”

California Tries to Build Consensus

In California, environmental groups are optimistic about the chances of a bill passing this year. This is the second year a climate Superfund bill has been introduced in the state, and the sponsors of the new bill have focused on building a broad coalition of environmental, community, and labor groups around the proposal, said Sabrina Ashjian, project director for the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the UCLA School of Law. This year’s legislation was introduced shortly after the devastating Los Angeles wildfires in January, which could amplify lawmakers’ sense of urgency. The bill has now passed out of each legislative chamber’s environmental committee and is awaiting votes in their respective judiciary committees. If passed, the bill will next move to the full Senate and Assembly for a final vote.

Vermont, New York, and Other States Face Legal Pushback

In the meantime, legislators are keeping a close eye on ongoing legal challenges to Vermont’s and New York’s laws. In January, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute, two trade groups, launched a lawsuit against Vermont’s climate Superfund law. In February, 22 Republican state attorneys general and industry groups filed a lawsuit against New York’s law. Both challenges claim that the laws violate interstate commerce protections and are preempted by federal law. Because the federal Clean Air Act regulates greenhouse gas emissions, the groups argue, states cannot pass laws related to climate damages.

Now the Trump administration has joined the legal battle. On May 1, the Department of Justice sued the states of New York and Vermont over their climate Superfund programs, echoing the same arguments raised by the fossil fuel industry. The same day, the department also sued the states of Hawaiʻi and Michigan over their intentions to sue fossil fuel companies for climate-related damages. All four lawsuits frequently use identical language, Lockman pointed out. The lawsuits follow last month’s executive order by President Donald Trump that called for the Justice Department to challenge state climate policies, and directly targeted Vermont and New York’s climate Superfund laws. Shortly after the Justice Department’s lawsuits were filed, West Virginia and 23 other states announced they would join the existing lawsuit against Vermont’s law led by the Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute.

Legal experts noted that Trump’s executive order itself has no legal impact, and that states have well-established authority to implement environmental policies. Patrick Parenteau, a legal scholar at Vermont Law and Graduate School, told the New York Times he expected the Justice Department’s cases to be dismissed. A court could end up consolidating the federal suits with existing challenges against Vermont and New York’s laws, although given that they raise the same arguments, “there’s really nothing new being added here,” said Lockman.

Climate experts told Grist that with huge amounts of money and liability at stake, lawsuits from the fossil fuel industry weren’t unexpected. Boafo said that given how much financial and political support the Trump campaign received from oil and gas corporations, it’s not a surprise that the Justice Department has sued New York and Vermont. Pursuing these laws invites inevitable opposition—but avoiding the growing costs of climate devastation is even riskier, advocates said.

Lawmakers are “passing these bills because in writing budgets, in dealing with the day-to-day operation of their states, they’re facing really serious questions about how our society is going to allocate the harms of climate change,” said Lockman. “I suspect that the lawmakers who are advocating for these bills are in it for the long haul.”",https://www.theenergymix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/flooding-cars.webp,N,,2025-05-26 18:03:49.410928

The Mahindra BE 6 was released in India, where the Redditor lives, just last year. The Redditor bought one of the only 3,000 road-registered BE 6s for $33,000 and added that ""it drives incredibly well!""

There's no joy quite like making your next car an EV. Those drivers can save thousands of dollars on fuel costs while enjoying next-gen features, like fast charging and autonomous driving.

Plus, they're more affordable than ever. The average price of a new EV is quickly approaching the average price of a gas-powered car, and that's before considering available government incentives like tax credits and rebates.

Driving an EV is better for the environment, too. A gas-powered car ""emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year,"" or about 5.1 tons, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Electric vehicles, however, emit none, making them a great way of reducing your carbon footprint.

Because Hyundai just rolled out a three-row electric SUV with real range, real space, and no apologies. It’s called the 2026 IONIQ 9, and it’s not here to whisper sweet nothings about sustainability. It’s here to haul your entire family, your pets, your luggage—and your assumptions about what electric SUVs can do—across hundreds of miles of tarmac.

In a market choking on crossover clones and battery-powered compliance cars, Hyundai has gone in a refreshingly contrarian direction. They’ve built something useful.

EV Range Without the Handwringing

Let’s get the headline stat out of the way: the IONIQ 9 packs a 110.3 kWh battery, with an estimated WLTP range of 620 kilometers (about 385 miles) in its Long-Range Rear-Wheel Drive configuration. That shakes out to roughly 335 miles under the more conservative EPA estimates—putting it squarely in long-haul territory. You could drive from Portland to Seattle and back without breaking a sweat or plugging in.

And no, it’s not a sluggish eco-box. Performance AWD models hit 0–62 mph in just over five seconds, which is quick enough to startle the family dog and pass most gas-powered rivals. If you prefer range over rocket launches, the RWD variant still does the sprint in under ten seconds—plenty for suburbia.

Who’s It For—and Who Should Skip It?

This is not the EV for your minimalist friend who bikes to the farmer’s market and still refers to electricity as “the new coal.” The IONIQ 9 is for real families with real stuff and real road trips on the calendar. Think: parents who want to feel good about ditching gas, without sacrificing legroom, cargo space, or ride comfort.

If you’re looking for an electric Lotus Elise, look elsewhere. But if you’ve ever wished your SUV could double as a hotel room during soccer tournaments or a refuge on camping weekends—Hyundai has your number.

Interior That Works Like a Lounge (Minus the Bar Tab)

The IONIQ 9’s cabin is, for lack of a better word, thoughtful. Second-row seats swivel to face the third row when parked, which is perfect for board games, baby feeding, or simply arguing about directions like it’s 1996. The front and middle rows can be optioned with relaxation seats that recline fully—ideal for charging stops or momentary existential crises.

And in a stroke of marketing genius disguised as innovation, Hyundai’s optional Dynamic Body Care System gives you a massage on the go. That’s right: it’s the only three-row SUV where Dad can get a back rub and 335 miles of range in one go.

Charging Speed That Doesn’t Waste Your Time

The IONIQ 9 supports ultra-fast 350 kW charging. Translation? 10 to 80 percent in 24 minutes under ideal conditions. That’s enough time to grab coffee, answer a few emails, and contemplate how much money you’re saving by not buying petrol every week.

This matters. Range is only half the battle. Charging time is the rest—and Hyundai nails both.

Big Yet Aerodynamic. Somehow.

Despite being the longest Hyundai ever built (wheelbase: 3,130 mm), the IONIQ 9 doesn’t slice through the air like a barn. Its drag coefficient is a commendable 0.259 Cd with digital mirrors, thanks to aerodynamic trickery like dual-motion active air flaps. Even with traditional side mirrors, it stays slippery at 0.269 Cd.

In short, it’s not just a big box on wheels—it’s a smart one.

Safety and Tech: Of Course It’s Got That

Naturally, the IONIQ 9 comes loaded with the latest in alphabet soup: ADAS, OTA, NFC, you name it.

Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS): Think forward collision avoidance, blind-spot monitoring, and enough sensors to avoid a game of vehicular bumper cars.

Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates: No dealership visits just to get Apple CarPlay working.

Digital Key via NFC: Unlock your car with your phone. It’s 2025. Why not?

It’s not just tech for tech’s sake. It’s tech that makes sense.

When Can You Get It—and Where?

The IONIQ 9 launches in Korea and the U.S. in early 2025. Europe and the rest of the world will follow, assuming they don’t run out of battery cells first. Hyundai’s rolling this out deliberately, like a band that actually knows how to tour—starting with the fans who buy the tickets first.

What’s the Bigger Picture Here?

Hyundai’s aiming to launch 23 EVs by 2030. The IONIQ 9 is more than a new product—it’s a signpost. As rivals scale back EV plans, Hyundai is quietly doing the opposite. Not loudly. Not with Super Bowl ads and buzzwords. Just with smart cars that people actually want to drive.

The IONIQ 9 is a reminder that electric vehicles aren’t just about kilowatts or carbon. They’re about utility. And if that happens to come wrapped in clean lines and soft leather, all the better.

Final Verdict?

The 2026 Hyundai IONIQ 9 is the electric SUV Tesla should’ve built but didn’t. It’s practical, refined, and unpretentious—with just enough geeky engineering under the hood to keep enthusiasts entertained.

In the U.S., the differences of philosophy between the Democratic and Republican parties are perhaps starkest on the question of vehicle electrification. Joe Biden's Democratic administration promoted the shift to EVs with aggressive new measures, or extensions of ones introduced under the Obama administration.

The return of Donald Trump to the White House was seen as a threat to the incentives in place, and we’re about to see how the industry will be affected.

EV credits to be withdrawn

After months of the U.S. administration promising to eliminate the $7,500 USD credits for purchasing an electric vehicle, the Republican-controlled congress has adopted a version of President Trump's bill titled “One Big Beautiful Bill Act”. The wide-ranging piece of legislation is a repository of almost all of the president’s pet projects. Its very breadth will make getting it passed into law more complicated, but it also creates the risk that many of the provisions in it won’t be analyzed as closely as they should.

One of those provisions could potentially severely harm electric vehicle sales in the U.S.. If passed, the bill will eliminate the $7,500 USD credit, but it will also reduce subsidies for battery manufacturing.

A small consolation is that the provision calls for the credit program to end on December 31, 2026, which gives consumers some time. On the other hand, it specifies that for manufacturers who have sold more than 200,000 eligible vehicles, the program will end on December 31 of this year.

And that's not all. Hybrid and electric vehicles will, if the bill passes as is, be subject to annual fees of $100 and $250 USD, respectively. On this point, the question of EV owners' contribution is a subject of debate.

Safe to say, if all the proposed measures are applied, sales of electric models will decline significantly decline in the United States, which could potentially affect the supply in the Canadian market as well.

A Princeton University study, reported by the New York Times, predicts that if Republicans succeed in eliminating incentives, electric vehicle sales will only account for 24 percent of new vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2030, which is far from the targeted objectives.",http://picolio.auto123.com/auto123-media/articles/2025/5/72802/chrysler-pacifica-phev-2023_14fr.JPG,N,,2025-05-26 20:59:40.882904

Indonesia’s floating solar breakthrough is not just a startling feat of engineering – it is a signal to South America that good governance, sustainable innovation and cooperation can redefine what’s possible in the clean energy transition.","As the global race toward net-zero emissions accelerates, Indonesia’s landmark floating solar power plant on the Cirata Reservoir is illuminating a path forward for countries across Latin America – especially Colombia – where fractured geography, a post-conflict recovery, and social inequality pose challenges to energy access, food security, and climate resilience.

Inaugurated in late 2023 with a project cost of US$145 million, the Cirata Floating Photovoltaic (FPV) Project is Southeast Asia’s largest floating solar facility. The 192-megawatt plant – developed through a partnership between UAE-based renewable energy developer Masdar and Indonesia’s state-owned electricity utility PLN – now feeds 300,000 megawatt-hours annually into Indonesia’s national grid, enough to power 50,000 homes. Built on a 250-hectare reservoir with stunning views of the West Java mountain range, Cirata hydroelectric complex stands as a technical and political milestone in the country’s path to reach net-zero emissions by 2060.

Colombia, which has similarly pledged carbon neutrality by 2050, shares many of the environmental and developmental features that make the Indonesian model relevant: mountainous terrain, agricultural lowlands for staple food harvesting, tropical forests home to abundant biodiversity, and vast untapped water surfaces. But Colombia also faces a post-conflict reality where delivering reliable energy to remote, off-the-grid rural areas is crucial not only for economic development but also for peacebuilding and bridging income equality.

“Energy security is not just about powering households – it’s the foundation for agricultural productivity, local enterprise, and food sovereignty” claims a spokesperson from PLN. “Floating solar technology can help transform conflict-affected regions into self-sustaining zones by powering irrigation systems, refrigeration for perishable goods, and local food processing.”

In departments such as Caquetá, Guaviare, and Putumayo – where rivers meander through dense jungle and road access is limited – floating solar arrays on reservoirs or managed wetlands could provide a decentralized, climate-friendly energy supply to both homes and farms. This would reduce dependence on costly diesel generators and connect producers to markets with better storage, transport, and processing capacity.

The Cirata project with its 13 floating islands also showcases how infrastructure innovation can overcome complex geographical challenges. Engineers from PowerChina, the firm contracted to build the plant, designed a specialized anchoring system using metal shear keys and concrete counterweights to stabilize the floating panels against high winds and uneven underwater terrain.

Each solar island, measuring 10 hectares was tested through wind tunnel modeling and computational simulations and could be directly applicable to Colombia’s rugged Andean and Amazonian basins – where water bodies are often surrounded by steep or unstable slopes.

The potential for technology exchanges between Indonesia and Colombia is significant, particularly as both countries look to deepen Equatorial Belt cooperation and trade ties, ties that would positively benefit two other economic tigers in the hemisphere – Malaysia and Singapore.

As a founding member of the Pacific Alliance – a trade bloc that includes Chile, Mexico, and Peru – Colombia is exploring new linkages across the Pacific with Southeast Asian economies. Energy innovation, alongside agriculture and green infrastructure, could become a pillar of multilateral cooperation under emerging frameworks like the ASEAN-Pacific Alliance Action Plan.

“We must think of the energy transition as a shared regional agenda, not just a national one,” states Indonesia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “Technology transfer, climate finance, and trade connectivity are ways we can learn from each other and scale solutions like floating solar.”

Indonesia and South America are also exploring stronger diplomatic ties through free trade agreements, academic exchanges, and investment forums aimed at renewable energy and environmental sustainability. Both regions are vulnerable to climate-related disasters – flooding, drought, sea level rise – and both possess biodiversity hotspots that demand an integrated approach to development.

The success of Cirata proves that large-scale clean energy infrastructure can be achieved in topographically complex nations with strong public-private partnerships. The $100 million investment was made viable through collaboration between Masdar, PowerChina, and the Indonesian government – a model Colombia could emulate as it accelerates its clean energy transition.

Floating solar parks in Colombia could also complement existing hydroelectric facilities- some of which are facing reduced capacity due to changing rainfall patterns. Hybrid systems that combine hydro and solar, like in Cirata, increase energy stability and reduce evaporation from reservoirs, enhancing overall efficiency.

Crucially, the deployment of such infrastructure in rural and former conflict zones reinforces social cohesion and post-conflict reconciliation efforts. Colombia’s Truth Commission has identified inequality in access to basic services, including electricity, as a key driver of the internal conflict. Closing this gap through non-extractive energy sources can transform isolated communities into hubs of food production and ecological leadership.

Indonesia’s floating solar breakthrough is not just a startling feat of engineering – it is a signal to South America that good governance, sustainable innovation and cooperation can redefine what’s possible in the clean energy transition. For Colombia and its closest allies, embracing such solutions could illuminate the way to a more equitable, climate-resilient, and food-secure future- one powered by the sun and floating on water.

The proposed regulation is part of a broader attack by the Trump administration on the established science that greenhouse gases threaten human health and the environment.
Scientists have overwhelmingly concluded that carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases from the burning of oil, gas and coal are dangerously heating the planet.
So, it argued, even if American power plants erased all their greenhouse gases from the power sector, the risk to public health would not be “meaningfully” improved.
But in the U.S., power plants were responsible for about 25 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in 2022.","The Environmental Protection Agency has drafted a plan to eliminate all limits on greenhouse gases from coal and gas-fired power plants in the United States, according to internal agency documents reviewed by The New York Times.

In its proposed regulation, the agency argued that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from power plants that burn fossil fuels “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or to climate change because they are a small and declining share of global emissions. Eliminating those emissions would have no meaningful effect on public health and welfare, the agency said.

But in the United States, the power sector was the second biggest source of greenhouse gases, behind transportation, according to the most recent data available on the E.P.A. website. And globally, power plants account for about 30 percent of the pollution that is driving climate change.

The E.P.A. sent the draft to the White House for review on May 2. It could undergo changes before it is formally released and the public is given the opportunity to offer comments, likely in June.

The proposed regulation is part of a broader attack by the Trump administration on the established science that greenhouse gases threaten human health and the environment. Scientists have overwhelmingly concluded that carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases from the burning of oil, gas and coal are dangerously heating the planet.

“Fossil fuel power plants are the single largest industrial source of climate destabilizing carbon dioxide in the United States, and emit pollution levels that exceed the vast majority of countries in the world,” said Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, an environmental group.

She called the proposed regulation “an abuse of the E.P.A.’s responsibility under the law” and added, “It flies in the face of common sense and puts millions of people in harms way to say the single largest industrial source of carbon dioxide in the United States is not significant.”

“We are seeking to ensure that the agency follows the rule of law while providing all Americans with access to reliable and affordable energy,” Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, said in a statement.

Mr. Zeldin’s spokeswoman, Molly Vaseliou, declined to offer more information about the plan other than to say “the proposal will be published once it has completed interagency review and been signed by the administrator.”

The Trump administration is methodically uprooting policies aimed at curbing climate change, and the E.P.A. is at the epicenter of that effort. In recent weeks, Mr. Zeldin has shuttered offices responsible for regulating climate and air pollution, and has launched the repeal of more than two dozen regulations and policies.

The agency is feeling pressure from the White House to finalize its deregulations by December, according to two people briefed on internal discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to describe them. That would be an extraordinarily fast pace. Rewriting regulations can typically take more than a year.

Mr. Zeldin said deregulation would drive “a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion.”

In proposing to lift regulations on power plants, the E.P.A. points to the fact that the U.S. share of global power sector emissions represented about 3 percent of worldwide greenhouse gases in 2022, down from 5.5 percent in 2005. So, it argued, even if American power plants erased all their greenhouse gases from the power sector, the risk to public health would not be “meaningfully” improved.

But in the U.S., power plants were responsible for about 25 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in 2022. They emitted about 1.5 billion metric tons of emissions in 2023, which is more than the total greenhouse gas emissions produced by most countries.

Just a year ago, when the Biden administration announced tough new limits on pollution from existing coal-fired power plants as well as some new gas-burning plants, the E.P.A. said the restrictions would mean that by 2035 the nation would annually avoid up to 1,200 premature deaths, 870 hospital visits, 1,900 cases of asthma, 48,000 school absences and 57,000 lost work days.

Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University, noted that solving climate change means undertaking a large number of seemingly small measures, like curbing emissions from automobiles, oil and gas wells, air travel, landfills, buildings and more.

“Just because there are multiple contributors to a problem doesn’t mean we should excuse all but the top one,” Dr. Oppenheimer said. “Just because a polluter’s emissions are decreasing doesn’t mean that aren’t still far too high.”

Attorneys who represent utility companies said they agree that the sector is a small part of the global climate problem. “The argument is a solid argument,” said Jeffrey R. Holmstead, who served in the E.P.A. during both Bush administrations and now represents utility companies as a lawyer for the firm Bracewell.

But he wondered if it would hold up under a legal challenge. “I just don’t know if you’re contributing 3 percent of greenhouse gas emissions the court will say ‘that’s not significant’ when there’s hardly anybody that contributes more than that.”",https://governorswindenergycoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/favicon-wind.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 22:59:49.742694

In a groundbreaking move, these automakers are set to trial a new robotic system at Incheon International Airport in South Korea, aimed at automating the EV charging process. This development marks a pivotal step towards a more efficient and user-friendly electric vehicle ecosystem. But what does this mean for the future of EVs and the broader transportation infrastructure?

Revolutionizing EV Charging with AI

The introduction of the Electric Vehicle Automatic Charging Robot (ACR) by Hyundai and Kia is a game-changer in the realm of EV charging. This single-arm robot is designed to automatically plug a charging cable into an electric vehicle and disconnect it upon completion. The ACR employs a sophisticated 3D camera-based AI algorithm to accurately plug the charger into the port, ensuring seamless operation. This technology aims to make EV ownership more convenient, eliminating the need for manual intervention in the charging process.

To verify the efficacy of this cutting-edge technology, engineers have constructed a specialized outdoor test station at their R&D center. This station replicates various environmental conditions, allowing the ACR to be tested rigorously. The robot has achieved an impressive IP65 rating for water and dust resistance, demonstrating its capability to operate in harsh environments. With its advanced features, the ACR stands as a testament to Hyundai and Kia’s commitment to innovation in the EV sector.

Enhancing Transportation Infrastructure

In partnership with Incheon International Airport Corporation, Hyundai and Kia are deploying the ACR system in a high-security, high-traffic environment. This collaboration marks a significant step towards expanding automated EV charging infrastructure in Korea. Incheon Airport, known for its eco-friendly vehicle initiatives, serves as an ideal testing ground for this technology. The airport has already transitioned its entire business fleet to eco-friendly vehicles and is targeting 1,110 EV chargers by 2026, making it a hub for sustainable transportation.

As part of this collaboration, Hyundai and Kia will supply ACR units and customize service operation scenarios to fit the airport’s unique environment. The Robotics Lab will lead efforts to evaluate and enhance the technology under actual airport conditions, ensuring its reliability and efficiency. This initiative not only enhances the airport’s infrastructure but also sets a precedent for future deployments in other critical transportation hubs such as ports and railway stations.

A Step Towards Autonomous EV Services

The deployment of the ACR at Incheon Airport is part of a broader strategy to integrate autonomous services into the EV ecosystem. Hyundai and Kia plan to leverage the airport deployment as a model for wider application in other essential transport infrastructures. By refining the ACR technology in a real-world setting, the companies aim to create a scalable model that can be adopted globally.

Team member feedback will play a crucial role in enhancing the performance and user-friendliness of the ACR. The experience gained from previous installations at locations like ‘Factory Seongsu’ in Seoul and the ‘Jeju Savile E-pit Charging Station’ will inform future developments. This project is a testament to Hyundai and Kia’s vision of a future where EV charging is seamless, autonomous, and integrated into daily life.

Implications for the Future of EVs

The introduction of the ACR system is poised to have far-reaching implications for the future of electric vehicles. By automating the charging process, Hyundai and Kia are addressing one of the key challenges facing EV owners: the inconvenience of manual charging. This development is likely to encourage more consumers to consider switching to electric vehicles, thereby accelerating the transition to sustainable transportation.

Moreover, the success of the ACR system at Incheon Airport could pave the way for similar deployments worldwide, transforming how we think about EV infrastructure. As the technology becomes more widely available, it could lead to a more interconnected and efficient transportation network, where autonomous systems play a central role. The question remains: how will this innovation influence the global adoption of electric vehicles and the evolution of smart cities?

With headaches like these, public EV chargers are looking more and more attractive every day.","The longtime US convenience store and gas retailer Circle K has been planting new EV charging stations into its sprawling, 20-nation network, including here in the US. Saving the planet from car exhaust is not the only reason. Electrification is a bottom line benefit for retailers. It buffers the motorist-serving industry from headaches resulting from liquid fuel delivery interruptions, while reducing the risk of damage claims from the dreaded fuel “cross drop.”

Circle K & EV Charging In The US

Circle K began life as an iconic US brand of the 1950s, later to be transformed into a global presence after the Canadian firm Alimentation Couche-Tard entered the timeline in 2003. The company has been introducing public EV chargers to its roster, taking advantage of its convenience store amenities and its own Circle K charging app.

Here in the US, several years ago Circle K also nailed down a federal EV charging award from the newly established NEVI (National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure) program, funded though a carve-out from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

One highlight of Circle K’s electrification efforts occurred in 2023 when the company installed a DC fast charging station at one of its stores in Wytheville, Virginia. The installation marked the first use of domestically manufactured DC fast chargers produced by ABB E-mobility at its new factory in South Carolina.

Last year Circle K also won accolades for installing the first EV fast charging station in Kentucky to be funded through the NEVI program. “The station, conveniently located at a centralized Circle K in Richmond, will help the Bluegrass State become a leader in building out reliable EV charging infrastructure and stay on track with its ambitious goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050,” enthused the US Joint Office of Energy and Transportation in a press release marking the occasion.

Trump Or No Trump, More EV Chargers For The USA

Much has changed since last year. The malevolently incompetent Commander-in-Chief who currently occupies the White House summarily suspended the NEVI program in February, shortly after taking office. Tax credits for EVs and related technology are next on the chopping block.

Meanwhile, the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation is a shell of its former self. The first-of-its kind electrification collaboration between the Energy Department and the Transportation Department, which helped coordinate the NEVI program, was “caught in the crossfire” of the Trump-Musk chainsaw. Its website is still active as of this writing, but its full time staff of 50 reportedly evaporated by the end of April.

Despite the White House buzz saw, though, EV charging stakeholders all over the US are moving forward with new charging infrastructure, including amenity-packed, lounge-type charging facilities, cost-cutting battery-integrated chargers, new fleet charging systems, and no-hassle charging solutions for multi-household residences, too.

What Is Cooking Over At Circle K?

On its part, Circle K has not made a major announcement about its EV charging plans for the US since 2022, when issued the 200-port pledge. That’s a drop in the bucket, as Circle K currently has thousands of US locations.

Another seemingly backwards step occurred last fall, when Couche-Tard promoted its former SVP of Global Fuels, Louise Warner, to the role of EVP of North American Operations and global commercial optimization, too. Warner came to Couche-Tard in 2021 with a long background in the Chevron subsidiary CalTex Australia.

However, appearances can be deceiving. “Fuels” is a loaded word these days, especially in the context of “Global Fuels.”

“One of Warner’s priorities as SVP of fuels was helping deploy Couche-Tard’s electric vehicle charging program in the U.S., which launched four months after she joined the company,” reported the news organization C-Store Dive last fall, further taking note of Couche-Tard’s commitment to “meeting its customers’ “evolving mobility needs” in all markets.

“As SVP of fuels, Warner was on Couche-Tard’s Sustainability Steering Committee, which meets quarterly to discuss the risks and potential impacts of climate change on the business,” C-Store Dive added.

EV Chargers Only At Circle K

In contrast to the pall of quietude settling over Couche-Tard’s charging plans for its US operations, last week the company grabbed the media spotlight when it announced the official opening of a new Circle K location in Sweden. Situated along the E6 route in Gårda, near central Gothenburg, the new location sports exactly zero liquid fuel pumps.

It’s not the first EV-only Circle K location, but Couche-Tard states that it is the biggest one so far. “With ten ultra-fast chargers and a 100 m² (1,076 ft²) convenience store, Gårda is the largest EV charging-only convenience location in Circle K’s global network,” Couche-Tard explained in a press statement.

“Our new location at Gårda marks a significant step in our ambition to win the EV customer – offering easy and convenient charging with a complete retail experience,” enthused the company’s EVP of European Operations and Global eMobility, Hans-Olav Høidahl.

“It’s a safe harbor on the road, and a clear step forward in our ambition to be the preferred on-the-go charging destination across Europe,” Høidahl added.

“Its ten ultra–fast 400 kW chargers power vehicles from zero to 80 percent in about fifteen minutes, while the store – which offers fresh pizza, kebab, and award–winning sausage,” Couche-Tard emphasized for good measure.

No Tesla, No Cross-Drops, No Driver Shortages

If the emphasis on EV fast charging sounds like Circle K is challenging the Tesla Supercharger network in Europe, that’s no accident. “The company’s European network now includes more than 3,000 Circle K branded chargers and continues to grow quickly to meet rising demand,” Couche-Tard noted in its Gårda EV charging announcement, taking an oblique swipe at the falling fortunes of the Tesla brand.

As everyone knows by now, the Tesla brand has become toxic among prospective EV buyers in Europe and elsewhere around the world. Apparently Couche-Tard sees an opening for Circle K to challenge the Tesla-branded Supercharger network as well.

Couche-Tard also emphasized that Circle K will continue to offer gasmobile options among its 17,000 locations worldwide, so don’t get too excited about a couple of all-electric locations here and there. Still, the opening of the Gårda station suggests that going all-in on EV charging can resolve at least two key issues bedeviling global retail businesses like Couche-Tard.

One issue is the risk of cross drops, which is industry-speak for what happens when a fuel truck driver mistakenly pumps a load of fuel into the wrong storage tank. Such mistakes are vanishingly rare but when they do happen, both financial and reputational damage are in store. Earlier this year, for example, Circle K locations in Ohio and Arizona had to deal with the fallout from cross drops, costing drivers thousands in damage repairs when they filled up with diesel instead of gas.

A related issue involves the risk of fuel delivery interruptions. Unlike severe weather events that can interrupt access to public EV charging stations and retail fuel pumps alike, fuel truck delivery shortages are specific to the liquid fuel industry.

One broad concern here in the US is a shortage of qualified truck drivers. The problem surfaced back in 2021 on the heels of the COVID-19 lockdown, when a lack of drivers resulted in a reports of fuel pumps running dry at retail locations around the US.

Additional shortage risks can occur due to accidents or outright malfeasance. A quick search of the Intertubes reveals multiple tanker truck fuel spills resulting from crashes here in the US so far this year. In one particularly egregious incident, a driver is alleged to have deliberately dumped 2,000 gallons of jet fuel along a five-moile stretch of road in Alabama, in an effort to empty the tanker before filling up with a load of gas.

With headaches like these, public EV chargers are looking more and more attractive every day. If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread. Better yet, find your representatives in Congress and let them know what you think.

And he warned that Republicans were giving China an economic advantage, as electric vehicles become essential around the world.","There is little question that California leaders already see fossil fuels as a relic of the past.

At the Southern California headquarters of the state’s powerful clean-air regulator, the centerpiece art installation depicts in limestone a petrified gas station. Fuel nozzles lie on the ground in decay, evoking an imagined extinction of gas pumps.

For more than half a century, the federal government has allowed California to set its own stringent pollution limits, a practice that has resulted in more efficient vehicles and the nation’s most aggressive push toward electric cars. Many Democratic-led states have adopted California’s standards, prompting automakers to move their national fleets in the same direction.

With that unusual power, however, has come resentment from Republican states where the fossil fuel industry still undergirds their present and future. When Republicans in Congress last week revoked the state’s authority to set three of its mandates on electric vehicles and trucks, they saw it not just as a policy reversal but also as a statement that liberal California should be put in its place.

“We’ve created a superstate system where California has more rights than other states,” Representative Morgan Griffith, who represents rural southwestern Virginia, said in an interview. “My constituents think most folks in California are out of touch with reality. You see this stuff coming out of California and say, ‘What?’”

California has used that authority to build one of the world’s most powerful environmental agencies, the California Air Resources Board. The board now regulates the airborne emissions released by everything from perfumes to power plants. Products that repeatedly fail to comply with its standards can be barred from sale in the state.

So many consumers live in California or in states like New York and Pennsylvania that adopt the same standards that manufacturers see little to be gained by making their products in two versions, one to satisfy those states’ rules and another for the rest of the country. So California’s requirements often become de facto national standards.

The policy that has drawn the most Republican opposition has been California’s mandate to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles starting in 2035.

Republicans, whose party has strong ties to the oil industry, spoke last week about why electric vehicles would be impractical for their constituents.

Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate, said on the floor that electric vehicles’ limited range made them unsuitable for farmers, ranchers and others in his rural state who must drive long distances each day.

Though California’s rules would not bar the sale of gasoline-powered vehicles anywhere else, Mr. Barrasso and other Republicans suggested that without the California market, manufacturers would curb their production.

“Every American would lose options — whether you live in California or not,” Mr. Barrasso said. “California’s E.V. mandates ban the sale of gas-powered cars and trucks. No more in America. Can you imagine that in Oklahoma or my home state of Wyoming?”

Their arguments also ventured into the ideological realm. In floor arguments and in statements to The New York Times, Republican lawmakers spoke of what the technology — and California — represented to the wider populace.

Other Republican lawmakers condemned what they called California’s “extreme environmental agenda.” Representative Troy Nehls, Republican of Texas, said in a statement that the “radical liberal state of California” should not be governing for the “hard-working patriots in my district.”

Mr. Nehls is the House author of the Stop California from Advancing Regulatory Burden Act of 2025. It is otherwise known as the Stop C.A.R.B. Act, an indication of just how large California’s air board — known by its initials, C.A.R.B. — looms in the eyes of Republicans. That bill, which would repeal the section of the Clean Air Act that lets California get waivers to set its own regulations, is pending in the House, as is a similar measure in the Senate.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the smog in Los Angeles was so thick that the giant Hollywood sign often could not be seen from just a few miles away. .

Over the years, C.A.R.B. sharply reduced the state’s pollution problem by enacting stringent rules, many of which were eventually adopted nationwide. California’s regulatory climate encouraged technical innovations like the low-emission engine that Honda produced in the 1970s; the three-way catalytic converter with an oxygen sensor that Volvo pioneered later that decade; and Tesla’s popularization of electric vehicles.

Ann Carlson, who helped write policies for the Biden administration on tailpipe emissions and now teaches law at the University of California, Los Angeles, recalled the severe smog that made her eyes burn and her lungs ache when she was a child in Southern California in the 1960s. The bad air was a product of the postwar explosion in population across a vast area of the Los Angeles basin, high rates of car ownership and topography that tended to trap smog, she said.

Her leadership was so influential that the agency dedicated its Southern California office to her. In 2022, Ms. Nichols and other California leaders christened the new building by cutting a gasoline hose with a pair of oversized shears.

On Friday, the day after the Senate vote, Ms. Nichols sounded sanguine about the fact that California — and the work of her former agency — was being targeted by federal lawmakers.

“That’s the price you pay for success, I suppose,” Ms. Nichols, who lives in Los Angeles, said in an interview. “We’re in a period of lashing out against all kinds of progress, and that’s what C.A.R.B. represents.”

She said that the federal government over the years had sent members of the board’s staff to India, China and Russia to help other countries with their smog problems. In turn, delegates from countries around the world have visited Sacramento to learn about what the state has done to reduce its emissions, she said.

Is California trying to influence national policy?

“There’s no question about that,” Ms. Nichols said. But she added, “It’s not a crusade to make the rest of the world look like California. It’s a recognition that we’ve been privileged to be able to pioneer some very good technologies, and we’re pleased to be able to share them with the world.”

Senator Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, said that he thought Republicans were upset that so many states wanted to follow California’s lead.

“Their overarching goal was not energy independence,” Mr. Schiff said. “Their overarching goal was oil dependence, and California was making the country less dependent on oil.”

Senator Alex Padilla, Democrat of California, suggested that Republicans were acting counter to the states’ rights philosophy that had been a core principle of their party. And he warned that Republicans were giving China an economic advantage, as electric vehicles become essential around the world.

“It’s wrongheaded that they have it in for California as badly as they do,” he said.

The three bills passed by the Senate Thursday had already been approved by the House, and President Trump is expected to sign them all. To pass the bills, though, the Senate acted against a ruling by its own nonpartisan parliamentarian, who said that it was inappropriate to use the provisions of the Congressional Review Act in the way the Senate did, to revoke California’s clean air waivers and to avoid a filibuster.

What was once considered a stable and secure retirement system is now subject to significant fiscal pressures and political trade-offs.","Federal employees and retirees are facing the most significant proposed changes to their benefits in decades. A series of sweeping proposals targeting the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) and associated benefits could reshape the financial future of millions of federal workers. From pension recalibrations to healthcare voucher reforms, and even the potential elimination of core benefits for future hires, the once-stable landscape of federal retirement is facing seismic shifts.

While it’s easy to feel both frustrated, angry and overwhelmed, it’s crucial to assess the actual implications. In this article, I’ll break down the proposed changes, anticipated timeline for implementation, and most importantly, what it could mean for your financial future.

Why is this happening?

The driver behind these proposed changes is House Concurrent Resolution 14 (H.Con.Res. 14), a budgetary framework aimed at cutting $2 trillion in federal spending over the next decade. Though the figure sounds staggering, it pales in comparison to the whopping $86 trillion projected to be spent over the same time. Notably, $50 billion of the proposed cuts target federal retirement and healthcare programs specifically.

Both chambers of Congress have passed their own versions of this bill and are currently in the reconciliation phase. The House Budget Committee failed to pass the bill at first and made significant changes to soften the blow in attempts to gain favor, leading to an approval late on May 18th. This isn’t finalized yet, so some additional changes may be made, but it’s anticipated to be voted on by both chambers in the next month. If approved, it will head to President Trump’s desk.

With so many changes being made, let’s dive into what’s still active and what’s been shelved.

What’s active:

Elimination of FERS supplement

The FERS Supplement is on the chopping block. It was created to provide Social Security-like income for eligible federal employees retiring before age 62. This income was used to bridge the gap until they are eligible to file for their actual Social Security benefits.

FERS supplement computation: (Years of service / 40) * Social Security at 62

The proposed changes would discontinue FERS supplement for future retirees. There’s a potential exception for special groups like law enforcement officers, firefighters, and air traffic controllers but details are still pending.

Proposed implementation date: This has been changed from being effective on the law’s enactment to January 1, 2028, and grandfather in current FERS Supplement recipients. (5 USC 8421a)

This is a HUGE victory for those who took the deferred resignation with the understanding they would receive the supplement or those who may be impacted by the ongoing reductions in force.

At-will employment or higher FERS contribution

New hires will get a choice: Pay 9.4% FERS contribution or pay 4.4% and be made “at-will.” It’s important to note that this would be a permanent election, so you can’t choose the at-will employment and then switch to the increased FERS contributions to get job security in the later years of employment.

Proposed implementation date: The bill’s enactment date

This will make it even more difficult for federal employees to save for retirement, as it’s likely most would opt for the increased contributions over at-will employment.

Audits of participants in the FEHB program

Mandates that the Office of Personnel Management develop a process to verify family member eligibility when adding coverage, qualifying life event, or removes a family member. OPM and employing agencies would also conduct audits of FEHB-enrolled family members to ensure they are still eligible. Finally, OPM would be required to keep records of eligible family members for a specified time period and to include a fraud risk assessment.

$350 fee to file appeals with the Merit Systems Protection Board

This would be a reimbursable fee if a claim or appeal is successful. This covers the federal district court filings under Section 1914(a) of Title 28.

What’s inactive (for now):

Reduction/elimination of COLA

Now for some good news! The proposal to reduce or eliminate cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for FERS retirees was shelved, for now. This would have been the most harmful change of the entire proposal, so for now, this is a sigh of relief.

The FERS annuity, while not tied to inflation, does a great job of keeping up — something that differentiates it from other sources like private annuities.

Current policy:

Inflation (CPI Index) COLA Under 2.0% Same as CPI 2.0 – 3.0% 2.0% Above 3.0% CPI minus 1.0%

For comparison, private annuities typically charge an extra fee, known as a rider, for inflationary adjustments — something that could be a decision at retirement in the future, much like having a cost to add a survivor benefit.

Increased FERS contributions

More good news! In the latest revision on May 18th, the new provision to force current federal employees to increase their FERS contribution to 4.4% was also shelved. However, it’s still important to understand what was being proposed as this could also resurface in the future.

Current system:

Retirement System Hire Date Employee Contribution FERS Before 2013 0.8% FERS-RAE During 2013 3.1% FERS-FRAE After 2013 4.4%

Example: To illustrate the cost, here’s a simple projection assuming a $100,000 salary, 2% annual COLA for salary, and no step increases or promotions. Additionally, let’s assume we invest that additional FERS contribution and earn a modest 5% per year.

Year Salary Additional Cost (3.6%) Opportunity Cost (5% return/year) 1 $100,000 $3,600 $3,600 2 $102,000 $3,672 $7,636 3 $104,040 $3,745 $11,950 4 $106,121 $3,820 $16,559 5 $108,243 $3,897 $21,479 6 $110,408 $3,975 $26,726 7 $112,616 $4,054 $32,319 8 $114,869 $4,135 $38,277 9 $117,166 $4,218 $44,620 10 $119,509 $4,302 $51,368

Over a decade, that’s nearly $40,000 in added cost. Not to mention, if you were to invest those funds at a 5% rate of return, you’d have over $51,000.

High-3 to high-5 salary

Currently, FERS annuities are based on your “High-3” average salary. This would be the highest-paid, consecutive 36 months of basic pay during your federal career. The proposed change would shift this to be based on your “High-5” average salary. A high-5 change would affect you the most if you’ve had step increases or a promotion recently as well as during periods of time with higher salary COLAs. Law enforcement officers are expected to be exempt and remain on the high-3 pension structure.

Proposed implementation date: Originally January 1, 2027 but changed to January 1, 2028, then finally shelved on May 21st.

Example: Let’s look at the impact in an example. Assuming someone earned a $100,000 salary in 2020 and had no step increases over the past 5 years.

FEHB voucher system

This was retracted on the House Committee meeting on April 30th. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, they estimate this change would save $20 billion between 2026 and 2035.

Currently, the federal government covers approximately 72% of Federal Employee Health Benefit (FEHB) premiums. Under the previously proposed change, this system would be replaced with a voucher model, where the government provides a fixed-dollar contribution that increases only with general inflation. Since healthcare costs typically rise faster (~5% annually) compared to general inflation (~2.5% annually), this means the government’s share will shrink over time.

While the impact may not be immediate, the government’s contribution will gradually erode over time, leading to higher out-of-pocket costs in the future, especially in the years when you may need healthcare the most.

This makes a case that more federal employees should reconsider combining FEHB with Medicare Part B. This is a topic for another day but if you haven’t enrolled and you’re passed eligibility requirements, please be aware of the penalties.

There’s a 10% permanent penalty for each year you delayed Part B enrollment after when you were first eligible.

G Fund reform

The G Fund, widely known for its steady returns, may undergo a structural reform. The new proposal would change the composition of the G Fund to mirror short-term Treasury bills. This would slightly expose it to market volatility, varying returns, and while rare, the potential for a negative year.

This could change the foundation of retirement investing for many within the TSP. Additionally, one may want to reconsider the use of lifecycle funds due to the high concentration of G fund in the closer target date years such as L Income or L 2030.

What should you do now?

Monitor legislative developments: Final reconciliation votes are expected in the next few couple of months, if not sooner.

Run retirement scenarios: Evaluate early retirement options before certain rule changes may take effect.

Re-evaluate your investment strategy: With potential for less pension and higher healthcare costs, you may need to evaluate your investment risk.

Review Medicare decisions: If you’re near or above age 65, revisit your strategy for Medicare Part B and FEHB in case FEHB changes to a voucher system in the future.

Talk to a specialist: These changes are complex. Work with a federal retirement expert who can customize a plan for your situation and evaluate your options for you.

Final thoughts

The proposed reforms represent a turning point. What was once considered a stable and secure retirement system is now subject to significant fiscal pressures and political trade-offs. While the current proposal has been softened, the message is clear: Federal benefits are no longer safe.

While we may be safe for now, the inclusion of some of these items in the initial draft suggests they could resurface in future negotiations. Namely, the high-3 to high-5 salary, reduction/elimination of the COLA on FERS/CSRS annuities, increased FERS contributions, FEHB voucher system, and G Fund reform. It’s also worth noting the House Committee was supposed to cut $50 billion from federal benefits and the changes listed above would be closer to $15 billion.

With that, proactive planning is not just smart; it’s essential. Be sure to build flexibility into your retirement plan, stress-test it against multiple outcomes, and prepare not just for what is, but for what may come. The best defense against these systemic shifts is to have a plan.

Trump ordered it to stay open. - Canary Media,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/a-michigan-coal-plant-was-about-to-close-trump-ordered-it-to-stay-open,"Campbell plant, a 1,560-megawatt coal-burning power plant owned by Michigan utility Consumers Energy, must abandon its plans to shut down on May 31 and instead continue operating through at least late August.
They warned that keeping this coal plant open will worsen pollution, harm nearby communities, and increase costs for utility customers.
The DOE’s claims that the coal plant is necessary to ensure regional grid reliability do not hold up, he said.
​“Summer is now an emergency to the Trump administration.” Who will pay for keeping an unnecessary coal plant open?
That, in turn, makes it very probable that the coal plant will be losing money.","The Trump administration has followed through on a threat to use emergency wartime powers to force expensive and polluting coal-fired power plants to stay open — even if the utilities that own them, the states in which they operate, and the grid operators responsible for maintaining reliability all agree it’s safe to shut them down.

On Friday, the U.S. Department of Energy issued an order demanding that the J.H. Campbell plant, a 1,560-megawatt coal-burning power plant owned by Michigan utility Consumers Energy, must abandon its plans to shut down on May 31 and instead continue operating through at least late August.

The order from Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former gas industry executive and a vocal denier of the climate change crisis, states that ​“an emergency exists in portions of the Midwest region of the United States due to a shortage of electric energy.” It cites this rationale to invoke the DOE’s emergency authority under the 1935 Federal Power Act to unilaterally order any power plant in the country to keep running.

“This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families,” Wright said in a Friday press release. President Donald Trump issued a slew of executive orders in April aimed at ​“bringing back” the U.S.coal industry, including an order authorizing the DOE to cite grid reliability as justification for keeping coal plants open.

“A manufactured emergency”

Environmental and consumer watchdogs decried Friday’s announcement as an unlawful abuse of power that serves the administration’s pro-coal agenda. They warned that keeping this coal plant open will worsen pollution, harm nearby communities, and increase costs for utility customers.

“Donald Trump invoking the Federal Power Act is an illegal abuse of his presidential authority. Coal is expensive, outdated, and deadly,” Greg Wannier, senior attorney with the Sierra Club Environmental Law Program, said in a Friday statement. “[A]ll of the relevant parties, including MISO, the grid operator ultimately responsible for keeping the lights on in Michigan, concluded years ago that J.H. Campbell could retire without causing any grid reliability problems.”

Tyson Slocum, director of the energy program at nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen, accused the DOE of ​“making up a manufactured emergency to accomplish a crass political outcome — Trump being able to say, ​‘I saved a coal-fired power plant.’”

Wright’s order comes just eight days before J.H. Campbell’s scheduled May 31 retirement under a plan that has been in the works since 2021. The planned shutdown is part of a broader agreement between Consumers Energy and state regulators to end coal use by 2025 and put the utility on a path to meeting the state’s mandate of 100% carbon-free power by 2040. Consumers Energy has estimated that the switch from costlier coal to cheap gas, solar, and energy storage will save customers $600 million through 2040.

Consumers Energy has bought a 1,200-MW gas-fired power plant to make up for the energy and grid support that the J.H. Campbell plant provided, and has continued to build and contract for utility-scale solar power and battery storage. The DOE’s order ignores this preparation for keeping Michigan’s grid reliable, Wannier said.

The DOE’s claims that the coal plant is necessary to ensure regional grid reliability do not hold up, he said. Michigan regulators, Consumers Energy, and the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), the entity that manages grid reliability across Michigan and 14 other Midwest states, have had years to plan for losing the coal plant’s energy and capacity services, and have found no reason to delay its closure, he said.

MISO has the power to order power plants to stay open if it determines their closure could threaten grid reliability. MISO used that authority most recently during the Biden administration to order Missouri utility Ameren to keep its Rush Island coal plant open. To do so, it filed a ​“reliability must run” request that was approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission — the standard practice for such emergency stay-open orders.

The DOE’s emergency powers, by contrast, have historically only been used in rare cases to protect utilities, states, or regional grid operators from being penalized for violating air-quality regulations, contractual obligations, or other such barriers to keeping the plants running during emergencies, he said. The DOE’s order provided no evidence that either MISO or Consumers Energy had made such a request for J.H. Campbell.

MISO spokesperson Brandon Morris told Canary Media in a Monday email that MISO did not request that DOE issue the emergency order. ​“MISO will coordinate with Consumers Energy to support compliance with the federal order as we prepare to maintain grid reliability throughout the summer season,” he said.

The DOE justified its emergency order by citing a December 2024 report from North American Electric Reliability Corporation, a nonprofit regulatory authority that includes utilities and grid operators in the U.S. and Canada. In that report, MISO was the only grid region in North America to rank as​“high risk” for future grid reliability challenges. Like many other parts of the country, MISO is struggling to add new generation resources to the grid fast enough to keep up with demand. The vast majority of projects waiting to connect are solar, wind, and batteries, which could help replace the aging and money-losing coal plants being shut down.

Wannier emphasized that such broad findings about potential future reliability don’t justify emergency stay-open orders. ​“DOE’s citation to NERC is definitely overbroad,” he said. NERC’s risk assessment for MISO ​“does not create an ​‘emergency’ sufficient to take an action as drastic as DOE has taken here.”

The DOE also cites statements MISO issued after its April capacity auction, which secures resources to keep the grid running during times of peak power demand. MISO said at that time that summer months present the ​“highest risk and a tighter supply-demand balance.”

But Wannier pointed out that MISO’s auction in fact ​“ensured that each zone within MISO has sufficient resources to meet its resource adequacy objectives for the summer, as it does every year.”

The DOE’s order appeared to acknowledge this fact, noting that MISO also stated that it had ​“demonstrated sufficient capacity” for all its regions.

Slocum said these gaps in the DOE’s explanation for taking this drastic step are evidence that the agency is ​“looking for an emergency, and looking for a chance to deploy it.”

“There’s no methodology here. There’s no fact-based assessment,” he said. ​“Summer is now an emergency to the Trump administration.”

Who will pay for keeping an unnecessary coal plant open?

The DOE’s order also fails to make clear how Consumers Energy, MISO, and state and federal regulators should determine the cost of forcing this coal plant to keep running over the summer, and who will end up paying for it, Wannier said.

Power plants operating in MISO rely on the grid operator’s energy market prices and dispatch signals to decide whether they should start up and run or stay idle from one hour to the next. The costs of running coal plants often exceeds the payments they can realize from selling electricity into these markets.

But many utilities operating in MISO territory, including in Michigan, are already pushing billions of dollars of unnecessary costs onto their customers by running coal plants at times when other power sources would be cheaper, according to studies of data conducted over the past half decade.

The DOE’s order directed MISO to take ​“every step to employ economic dispatch of the Campbell Plant to minimize cost to ratepayers.” But the order also instructs MISO to ​“effectuate the dispatch and operation of the units for the reasons specified herein.”

The problem, Wannier explained, is that it’s highly unlikely that the prices being offered to generators on MISO’s energy market will be high enough to recoup the costs of running the aging coal plant. This lack of profitability is the main reason why so many coal plants are being shut down.

That means that the safest way for Consumers Energy and MISO to attempt to meet the DOE’s order that the coal plant be up and running through the summer is to allow it to ​“self-schedule,” or run ​“no matter what and accept whatever the clearing energy prices are,” Wannier said. That, in turn, makes it very probable that the coal plant will be losing money.

“DOE is saying Consumers and MISO need to work out how much Consumers has to get paid for operating the plant, and if they can’t work it out, DOE will impose something,” he said. ​“But none of this makes clear who DOE thinks should end up holding the bag if they can’t agree. And it’s bad news for whoever has to pay because there’s no way Campbell gets enough reimbursement from MISO energy markets to financially justify its continued existence.”

Slocum highlighted that utilities and grid operators have a legal obligation to operate power plants and markets in ways that do not unjustly or arbitrarily force costs onto utility customers. That’s the issue on which Public Citizen intends to launch its first challenge to the order — not against the DOE, but in the proceeding that the order requires Consumers Energy to launch before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/5282775793_cc38f2f84d_z.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=78ede8687f4e35abc029ed2b5016e7b1,N,,2025-05-26 16:04:40.507460

""The Public Ministry of the State of Pará has sought to take the lead in measures not only for COP30 but also for the consequences of COP30.","On this Monday (26), the Vice Governor of Pará, Hana Ghassan, participated in the 1st Congress on Climate Justice and Sustainability: Preparatory Dialogues for COP 30, promoted by the Public Ministry of the State of Pará (MPPA).

The meeting aims to discuss the central themes of the United Nations Climate Conference (COP 30), focusing on the importance of the Amazon and Brazil's watersheds in the balance of the global climate and the impacts of climate change, among other themes. The Vice Governor highlighted the state administration's preparation to host the event.

“The State Government has been preparing for two years to host what will be the largest global event on the environment on the planet. We are very happy to host this great event, to participate in this first congress that talks about sustainability, and we can talk a little about the actions of the State Government, not only for COP but the actions of the State Government in the area of preservation and production in the environment, since from the beginning of our administration, this has been a priority, a pillar of our administration,” said Hana Ghassan.

During the presentation, the Vice Governor spoke about the significance of COP 30 for the State and the positive impacts for the population. In addition to the legacy of infrastructure, COP30 influences job generation, training, and professional qualification, with the Capacita COP30 program. The State's actions for COP30 have an impact before, during, and after the conference.

Open to the public, the event brought together entrepreneurs, municipal managers, and students, such as law student Lucas Viana, who saw an opportunity to gain more knowledge on the subject.

""I saw, in this event, a great opportunity for both personal and professional development, and that was one of the main reasons I registered here today. I am sure it will contribute a lot to me, as we will discuss sustainability, given that COP30 will be held here in Belém. The more we talk about it, the better the development, not only for me but for society.""

Throughout the day, the meeting will discuss, dialogue, promote reflections, and build joint paths in the face of today's environmental challenges.

The Attorney General of Justice (PGJ) of MPPA, Alexandre Tourinho, highlighted the importance of the debate with society. ""The Public Ministry of the State of Pará has sought to take the lead in measures not only for COP30 but also for the consequences of COP30. We know that COP30, as an international event, is temporary, and afterwards we will continue here and will have consequences, most of them very positive, but opportunities are only useful if they are taken advantage of.

Designed for extreme conditions to meet the demands of aviation and defense applications, the new SiCore cell maintains reliable performance across wide temperature ranges and mission-critical environments. It meets the demands of high- and medium-altitude platform stations as well as unmanned aerial vehicles. By providing longer range and greater payloads without increasing weight, this cell helps reduce total system cost. Operators can fly longer missions with fewer compromises, minimizing the need for additional batteries, fuel or equipment.

“What makes this SiCore cell different and noteworthy is that it brings that level of extreme performance into a cell chemistry and format that are ready to scale with the existing lithium-ion battery manufacturing processes and equipment in the industry,” said Dr. Kang Sun, CEO of Amprius Technologies.",,N,,2025-05-26 16:04:37.313673

Currently, hydrogen production from fossil sources like gas dominates German production, with green hydrogen generated through electrolysis accounting for a mere 0.5 percent in 2023.
The new government is set to continue with the country's landmark energy transition, but is unlikely to increase the level of ambition compared to the outgoing one.
""A close partnership in hydrogen policy can give decisive impetus to the European debate,"" said the statement that included signatures by BDEW, chemical industry association VCI, car industry association VDA, local utility association VKU, and lobby group Hydrogen Europe.
Yet, in spite of an impressive set of goals to broaden industry cooperation, Franco-German efforts to revive European industry are being held back by unresolved energy policy differences.","Lagging buildout of electrolysers for green hydrogen production, as well as large uncertainties over the fuel’s price in the future, regulation and available infrastructure represent a “significant investment hurdle” for hydrogen projects, said the Energy Transition Progress Monitor 2025 by consultancy EY and the energy industry association BDEW.

The volume of hydrogen made using renewable electricity is stagnating in Germany, and falling production from fossil gas puts an additional risk on the country’s plan to build up a sizeable hydrogen market. Falling conventional production is primarily due to the ailing basic industries that consume or produce hydrogen, including refineries, ammonia production, methanol production and chlorine production, the report said.

Currently, hydrogen production from fossil sources like gas dominates German production, with green hydrogen generated through electrolysis accounting for a mere 0.5 percent in 2023. Of the 10 gigawatts (GW) of electrolyser capacity for hydrogen production planned to be in place by 2030, only 1.6 GW have been secured so far, the industry group added.

While the energy transition had made important progress in 2024 especially on renewables expansion and emissions reduction, the journey to climate neutrality remained “a mammoth task” and there was a lot of pressure on the new government to be successful, said BDEW. Key tasks were speeding up planning and permit procedures for renewables and expanding these in line with grid development, and coming up with a new power market design which incentivises flexible demand and production.

Germany is nearly on track to achieve its 2030 emission reduction targets, with rapid progress in the expansion of renewables making up for the lagging transport and heating sectors. The new government is set to continue with the country's landmark energy transition, but is unlikely to increase the level of ambition compared to the outgoing one.

In a joint press release, BDEW and more than a dozen other industry associations said that the “restart” of Franco-German relations also on energy represented an opportunity for a European hydrogen alliance. “Seventy-five years after the Schuman Declaration establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, it is now time to rethink our key industries and energy supply,” they said.

The rules for green and low-carbon hydrogen production required an overhaul, the cross-border hydrogen grid had to be built out faster, and the EU needed uniform certification standards for the origin and quality of hydrogen. ""A close partnership in hydrogen policy can give decisive impetus to the European debate,"" said the statement that included signatures by BDEW, chemical industry association VCI, car industry association VDA, local utility association VKU, and lobby group Hydrogen Europe.

The European Union’s two largest economic and industrial leaders, Germany and France, have spearheaded efforts to put the EU ahead in the global scramble for green industry leadership and decarbonisation technologies. Despite differences in how they produce energy, Berlin and Paris have closed ranks in response to competition from the US and China.

As originally written, SB 607 would revise how lead agencies determine whether a proposed project has significant environmental impacts.
SB 607 raises the threshold, requiring an EIR only if the agency determines—based on substantial evidence—that a project is more likely than not to have such effects.
“Under the previous version of SB 607, we would face even more pollution.
“CEQA is critical to ensuring sustainable development.” Even some organizations open to CEQA reform believe SB 607, in its initial form, went too far.","SACRAMENTO – SB 607, a major proposal to reform the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), has ignited an intense debate between state leaders pushing for streamlined development and environmental justice advocates warning of deep rollbacks to community and ecological protections.

Authored by Senator Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) and backed by Senate President pro Tempore Mike McGuire (D-North Coast), the bill passed out of the Senate Appropriations Committee and now heads to the Senate floor for further negotiations.

“California’s housing shortage and cost of living crisis have driven too many out of the communities they love, into long commutes, or out of California entirely,” Senators McGuire and Wiener said in a joint statement after the committee vote. “Permitting challenges have also made it more and more challenging to build critical public infrastructure, to expand the production of clean energy, and to advance our state’s economic development goals.”

They stressed that SB 607 would provide California “the right tools to deliver not only more housing, but more clean energy jobs, economic development, and transportation projects for hardworking Californians.” The legislation is expected to be integrated into the broader state budget package over the coming weeks.

As originally written, SB 607 would revise how lead agencies determine whether a proposed project has significant environmental impacts. Under current CEQA rules, agencies must prepare an environmental impact report (EIR) if there is substantial evidence that a project may cause a significant effect on the environment. SB 607 raises the threshold, requiring an EIR only if the agency determines—based on substantial evidence—that a project is more likely than not to have such effects.

The bill also redefines key terms such as “negative declaration” and “mitigated negative declaration,” and alters what documentation must be included in the administrative record during litigation. For example, internal communications such as emails or staff notes not presented to the final decision-making body would be excluded from the record—unless the project involves a distribution center or oil and gas infrastructure.

In an effort to support infill development, the bill directs the Office of Planning and Research to map eligible urban infill sites statewide and establish alternative compliance pathways for qualifying projects. Projects that meet all but one condition for a CEQA exemption would be subject only to environmental review of the disqualifying condition, not the full range of CEQA requirements. However, distribution centers, oil and gas projects, and developments on protected lands are excluded from these streamlined provisions.

Despite amendments and reassurances from Senate leadership, the bill’s original language triggered strong opposition from a broad coalition of environmental justice organizations, conservation groups, and labor unions. They argue that the bill, as introduced, would have gutted CEQA safeguards for most public and private development—including freeways, railyards, mining operations, and large-scale industrial projects—under the guise of housing reform.

“Environmental justice communities have long been disproportionately burdened by development that prioritizes profit over community health,” said Aleja Maria Cretcher of Communities for a Better Environment in a statement. “Under the previous version of SB 607, we would face even more pollution. We know developers can reduce the harmful impacts of their projects—and CEQA is the only mechanism that ensures frontline communities have a meaningful voice when advocating for those protections.”

Raquel Mason of California Environmental Justice Alliance Action praised Senate leadership for stepping back from the original bill. “Thank you to Pro Tem McGuire and Chair Caballero for recognizing that the language of SB 607 would have created significant unintended consequences on communities and new legal uncertainties,” she said, adding that CEJA Action looks forward to continued negotiations to ensure the final bill protects public health and environmental justice.

Labor leaders also expressed concern that weakening CEQA could backfire economically. “Degradation of the environment and public health can, and has, caused construction moratoriums and other restrictions on growth that, in turn, reduce future employment opportunities for construction workers,” said Chris Hannan, President of the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California, AFL-CIO. “CEQA is critical to ensuring sustainable development.”

Even some organizations open to CEQA reform believe SB 607, in its initial form, went too far. “The changes to review standards that 607 would impose will cause tremendous legal confusion, more litigation, and further uncertainty for developers,” said Matthew Baker, Policy Director of the Planning and Conservation League. “As originally drafted, SB 607 would not have sped things up—it would only slow things down.”

The bill’s attempt to narrow CEQA’s scope by excluding staff notes and internal agency communications from the legal record also alarmed some legal observers. These documents, they argue, are often critical for community groups seeking to challenge flawed environmental assessments.

With federal environmental laws under ongoing attack—particularly under the Trump administration’s second term—critics also argue that weakening CEQA now sends the wrong signal. “Our state’s robust environmental laws protect all Californians,” said Frances Tinney of the Center for Biological Diversity. “This is the wrong time to roll back environmental and public health protections that we all depend upon.”

Esther Portillo of the Natural Resources Defense Council echoed that view, stating, “We are living in unprecedented times where our environment and public health are under threat. Our state leaders must ensure that California continues to economically thrive without irreparably harming environmental protections.”

In response to the sustained pushback, the bill was significantly amended in the Appropriations Committee to remove its original content and replace it with placeholder language signaling continued negotiations. Chair of the committee, Senator Anna Caballero, indicated that conversations would continue with the Governor’s office and the Assembly as part of the ongoing budget process.

While that change has softened immediate opposition, it has not resolved the underlying tensions. For supporters like Wiener and McGuire, CEQA reform remains essential to removing bureaucratic barriers to housing and climate action. For opponents, any reform must be done with precision and care, preserving the law’s role as a safeguard for health, equity, and ecological integrity.

This would be the first utility-scale solar project in Clark County.
Future of Sloopy, other potential solar projects in Clark County After the passage of Senate Bill 52, Ohio counties have the power to pass resolutions banning wind and solar projects in unincorporated areas and any of its townships.
Clark County commissioners denied interview requests from WYSO.","A new solar project could be coming to Clark County.

It’s called Sloopy Solar, and it's planned for development in Harmony Township. It’s expected to generate enough power for over 33,000 homes annually.

Its developer is Chicago-based company Invenergy. The company has several other projects across the state either in operation or planned for construction.

It hasn’t yet submitted an application to the agency that permits energy generating projects, the Ohio Power Siting Board.

That’s because prior to its application submission, the developer must hold two public information sessions in the community, which it’s planning to do within the next few months.

Door knocking, public meetings

Invenergy staff are door knocking around the township to gain input in advance of these sessions to ensure they are as generative as possible, said Ryan Van Portfliet, director of renewable development for Invenergy.

“It is just noting that this is going to be slightly different from what has been done there for generations. But then also explaining to them what the process looks like, what the project is, and probably more importantly, what the project isn't,” Van Portfliet said.

Matthew Butler, spokesman for the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, which oversees the OPSB, said they’ve already spoken with Invenergy staff.

“I believe it was back in March when the company reached out to us to set up what we call a pre-application meeting,” Butler said. “And that meeting then took place in April between the company and our staff here, where we learned a bit more about the project, but again, it's still very early.”

The project area is expected to span 1,600 acres. This would be the first utility-scale solar project in Clark County.

Invenergy has met some other markers needed for development: it’s already leased land from seven area landowners, and has established an interconnection agreement with Ohio’s regional grid operator, PJM, to supply energy to the network.

Van Portfliet said they want to reduce any negative environmental impact from the project.

“We've already committed to some wildlife corridors, wildlife fencing to allow for the ability for wildlife to traverse through and around the project. And really focusing on proper establishment of vegetation that aligns with the vegetation of the area,” he said.

Harmony Township trustees skeptical

Harmony Township trustee Jay Flax said it's been a few years since the developers have come to any trustee meetings.

There are 3,500 residents in Harmony Township, and it’s a largely agricultural community.

Flax said residents have come to trustee meetings very upset at the idea of the project, leading the trustees to oppose it.

“We feel like it'll (depreciate) value on people's properties around it and also we're concerned with the possibility of heavy metal content in the soil in the future,” he said.

Studies on solar farms’ impacts on property values often show minimal or nonexistent impacts. Solar panels in operation can leach metals into surrounding soil or water, but only if they’re improperly managed during their lifespan.

In lieu of property taxes, the developer wants to get approval for incentive payments to the county. Van Portfliet says they expect it to be millions of dollars annually but doesnt have a specific estimate yet.

The project will also bring hundreds of green jobs to the community, he said.

It’s still cause for hesitation for Flax.

“I don't know enough about that yet to know what that'll generate. This is all so new to us. We've never encountered all this. And we have very little control on what's happening with this,” Flax said.

Future of Sloopy, other potential solar projects in Clark County

After the passage of Senate Bill 52, Ohio counties have the power to pass resolutions banning wind and solar projects in unincorporated areas and any of its townships.

Clark County currently doesn’t have restrictions on these projects, but Flax says townships have been requesting that the county reconsider legislation to ban them.

When Senate Bill 52 happened, Flax said six of the ten townships requested to be restricted for both large solar and wind projects.

“The commissioners (wanted to) vote on them on a case by case basis. Well, since all of this has happened, many of the townships are sending resolutions again, asking to be restricted,” he said.

Since this project is already under agreement with PJM, it would not be subject to this ban.

Clark County commissioners denied interview requests from WYSO. But they did share a fact sheet containing commonly asked questions about Sloopy Solar.

Van Potrfliet said the company plans to submit its application for the project later this year. Once the application is filed, OPSB’s decision is typically processed within a year, said Butler with PUCO.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cc01ab8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2Fab%2Faa6d176d42ddb0cf7d53b9c76c82%2Finvenergy-solar.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 15:05:55.377532

According to the EPA's Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions website, power plants were responsible for roughly 25 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2022, making them the second-largest source of heat-trapping gases behind transportation.
Agency officials contended that even if American power plants eliminated all their greenhouse gas emissions, global public health risks would not be ""meaningfully"" improved.
According to the United Nations Climate Action website, fossil fuels account for more than 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 percent of carbon dioxide emissions.
The Trump administration has already moved to terminate 20 billion U.S. dollars in grants for climate and clean-energy projects.","SACRAMENTO, United States, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration is advancing plans to eliminate all federal limits on greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants across the United States, according to internal U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) documents reviewed by The New York Times on Saturday.

The moves mark the most significant rollback of climate change regulations in decades.

The EPA drafted a proposed regulation arguing that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuel power plants ""do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution"" or climate change, the report said, citing the EPA's documents sent to the White House for review on May 2.

The proposal directly contradicted established climate science and the agency's own data. According to the EPA's Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions website, power plants were responsible for roughly 25 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2022, making them the second-largest source of heat-trapping gases behind transportation.

Moreover, these facilities emitted approximately 1.36 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2023, exceeding the total emissions of most countries worldwide.

""Fossil fuel power plants are the single largest industrial source of climate destabilizing carbon dioxide in the United States,"" said Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, to The New York Times.

She called the proposed regulation ""an abuse of the EPA's responsibility under the law,"" adding that it ""flies in the face of common sense and puts millions of people in harm's way.""

The EPA's justification centered on the argument that U.S. power sector emissions represented only about 3 percent of worldwide greenhouse gases in 2022, down from 5.5 percent in 2005, according to the draft regulation.

Agency officials contended that even if American power plants eliminated all their greenhouse gas emissions, global public health risks would not be ""meaningfully"" improved.

However, climate scientists overwhelmingly reject this reasoning. According to the United Nations Climate Action website, fossil fuels account for more than 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 percent of carbon dioxide emissions.

The power plant deregulation represents the latest phase in the Donald Trump administration's comprehensive assault on climate policies. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced on March 12 what he called ""the most consequential day of deregulation in American history,"" targeting more than 30 environmental measures established during the Joe Biden administration.

The Trump administration has already moved to terminate 20 billion U.S. dollars in grants for climate and clean-energy projects. However, a federal judge temporarily blocked this action, noting the EPA had failed to provide adequate legal justification.

Trump's budget plan, announced on May 2, would slash EPA funding by nearly 55 percent compared to 2025 levels and eliminate 15 billion in carbon capture and renewable energy funding from the bipartisan infrastructure law.

The proposed regulation would overturn Biden-era rules that required existing coal-fired units and some new gas-burning plants to cut or capture 90 percent of their climate pollution by 2032. ■",,N,,2025-05-26 14:07:24.581962

In 2025, electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers face distinct market pressures and manufacturing challenges that set them apart from traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) automakers. While both types of manufacturers share common issues like global supply chain volatility and regulatory pressures, EV makers deal with unique hurdles tied to the nature of their technology and rapidly evolving market dynamics. Increasingly, EV makers are turning to AI and automation for help.

EV Market and Manufacturing Challenges

EV manufacturers must contend with a number of market and manufacturing issues, which require great efficiency and flexibility to successfully overcome.

On the market front, they face great price competition from traditional automakers that have entered the EV market, as well as pure EV startups. Additionally, there are great regulatory uncertainties, with many manufacturers finding that EV subsidies are being reduced or eliminated, impacting demand.

Additionally, consumers expect an EV to have a comparable or better price than an ICE equivalent. They also expect EVs to incorporate the latest innovations in auto safety, comfort, entertainment, and more.

On the manufacturing front, many EV platforms are still evolving, making it hard to lock in efficient, repeatable manufacturing processes. Manufacturers must also manage the integration of thermal management systems, high-voltage safety features, and more that are not found in ICE manufacturing.

Also, EV makers are increasingly moving toward the in-house development of motors, inverters, battery management systems, and software. That approach is unlike ICE production, where outsourcing is more common. It adds complexity and strains engineering teams.

The Need for AI and Automation

Given such market pressures and manufacturing challenges, EV manufacturers are turning to newer technologies. That might include making use of robotics and automation for repetitive tasks, using AI-driven quality control and process optimization, and employing digital twins to simulate and manage production in real time.

Simply put, EV manufacturers are increasingly leveraging automation and AI to optimize production operations across nearly every stage of the manufacturing lifecycle. Some of the specific actions being taken and technologies used include:

Smart Factory Automation

EV factories are adopting Industry 4.0 principles to automate and connect production lines. This includes:

Robotic assembly for precise and repetitive tasks like welding, painting, and battery pack assembly.

Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) to transport materials and parts within the factory.

Digital twins to simulate and optimize production environments in real time.

AI for Predictive Maintenance

AI analyzes sensor data from machines to predict failures before they happen. This:

Reduces unplanned downtime.

Extends the lifespan of equipment.

Improves overall equipment effectiveness (OEE).

Quality Control with Computer Vision

Machine learning and computer vision systems inspect parts and assemblies for defects far more accurately than humans. They’re used for:

Surface inspection of vehicle bodies.

Verifying weld quality.

Ensuring battery cell alignment and integrity.

Process Optimization with AI Analytics

Manufacturers use AI to analyze production data and:

Identify bottlenecks.

Adjust workflows in real time.

Reduce energy consumption, which is especially important in battery manufacturing.

Battery Production Enhancements

Battery production is a key differentiator in EVs. AI helps:

Optimize chemical mixing and cell formation processes.

Monitor thermal behavior during assembly.

Detect potential safety issues early.

In addition to these areas, EV makers are using AI models to forecast demand, manage inventory levels, and optimize logistics. This is critical for EV manufacturing due to the complexity of battery and semiconductor supply chains.

They are also using AI to provide help with customization and flexibility. AI enables mass customization by dynamically adjusting production parameters based on customer specifications—supporting personalized EV features without major disruptions to workflow.

Some notable examples of putting these new technologies into practice include:

Tesla uses a highly automated “Gigafactory” model, where AI and robotics handle everything from chassis assembly to battery module construction.

Volkswagen has implemented AI-driven visual inspection systems and digital twins to boost factory efficiency.

BMW uses AI in its EV plants to improve logistics and robot training, speeding up production while maintaining quality.

A Final Word

All automakers are using emerging technologies to speed the time from concept to production, improve operational efficiencies, and better meet changing customer demands.

The orders, which were signed on May 23 with industry leaders present, mark the Trump administration’s most aggressive push yet to redefine nuclear power as central to America’s energy, technological and defense future.

“We’re also talking about the big plants — the very, very big, the biggest,” Trump said during the signing ceremony at the Oval Office. “We’re going to be doing them also, but I think our focus today is the smaller module.”

Oklo (NYSE:OKLO) and NuScale (NYSE:SMR), both of which are small modular reactor (SMR) developers, soared by 23 and 19 percent, respectively.

US uranium-focused firms Uranium Energy (NYSEAMERICAN:UEC), Energy Fuels (TSX:EFR,NYSEAMERICAN:UUUU) and Centrus Energy (NYSEAMERICAN:LEU) saw gains ranging from 19.6 to 24.2 percent.

The Global X Uranium ETF (ARCA:URA), which tracks uranium-related equities, jumped more than 11.6 percent.

Reviving fuel supply chains and recycling

The administration is also attempting to reboot the US nuclear fuel cycle.

The DOE has been directed to release 20 metric tons of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) into a commercial fuel bank for private sector use. This move marks a significant policy shift in that it directs the DOE to identify usable plutonium and uranium in its inventory for potential recycling into nuclear fuel — a move that bucks decades of US reluctance toward commercial reprocessing due to proliferation risks.

There are currently no commercial nuclear fuel recycling facilities in the US, and the order’s provisions could encourage the creation of a domestic market for recycled fuel. This work could become especially important as international competitors like China and Russia continue to develop similar capabilities.

To address common challenges such as climate change and ecological destruction, joint endeavors of all countries are important.
That explains why China has proposed the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative.","The House of Representatives of the United States passed a bill last week, which advanced a sweeping spending package that would roll back Biden-era tax credits for renewable energy projects. They include an early phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles, moving up the timeline to end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants as well as requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028.

At the same time, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced on Saturday that it is working on a proposal to remove all existing restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from coal- and gas-fired power plants in the country.

The EPA was reported as arguing in its proposed regulation that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from power plants that burn fossil fuels ""do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution"" or to climate change because they are a small and declining share of global emissions.

It should be no surprise for the world what the Donald Trump administration will do on climate change since he signed an executive order for the US' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on his first day in the White House on Jan 20, as he did during his first term.

""It is the policy of my administration to put the interests of the United States and the American people first in the development and negotiation of any international agreements with the potential to damage or stifle the American economy,"" said Trump's day-one executive order on global environmental deals.

As part of Trump's first day orders, the US also halted all financial contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, leaving the UN climate body with a 22 percent shortfall in its core budget. In 2024, US contributions totaled $13.3 million.

Washington has not only turned a blind eye to the international obligations it has because of the huge amount of CO2 it has contributed during its industrial development, it has now also started to encourage the use of coal and gas in generating electricity by scrapping the limits on gas emissions from such plants.

Furthermore, it is trying to make things hard for renewable energy power plants, and even starts to add annual federal registration fees for EV and hybrid car owners. The fee will be $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids.

As one of the largest contributors of green house gas emissions and definitely the largest on a per capita basis, the US' withdrawal of its financial aid to emissions cutting projects will greatly compromise global climate actions. What the US government has done to roll back clean energy projects and encourage the use of fossil fuel in power generation represents a huge disservice to what the world has achieved in its fight against climate change.

""Interest of the US and American people first"" has become a pretext for the Trump administration to shirk its due international responsibility as the world's sole superpower. With ""make America great again"" as the guide for its policymaking, Trump's US has become an irresponsible superpower without a smattering of vision about the future of humanity.

Without making its due contribution to the global fight against climate change and to global endeavors to address other common challenges facing humanity, how can the Trump administration put the interests of the US and American people first?

The extreme climate conditions caused by climate change such as droughts and flooding will not exempt American people from their devastation, nor will environmental pollution.

To address common challenges such as climate change and ecological destruction, joint endeavors of all countries are important. This is common sense.

That explains why China has proposed the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative. China has also proposed the building of a community with a shared future for humanity, which is meant to mobilize global resources for addressing common challenges in order to make human development sustainable.

Nelson, www.latimes.com, seema-mehta, laura-j-nelson",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-05-26/oil-villaraigosa-fossil-fuel-governors-race,"Villaraigosa said Democrats are letting the perfect be the enemy of the good in their approach to fighting climate change.
Villaraigosa’s vocal support for the oil industry has upset some environmental groups that saw him as a longtime ally.
Miller said Villaraigosa signed a pledge during his unsuccessful run for governor in 2018 not to accept campaign contributions from oil companies and “named executives” at fossil-fuel entities.
“This is bear-hugging the oil industry,” she said.
Other gubernatorial candidates have also accepted fossil-fuel contributions, although in smaller numbers than Villaraigosa, state and federal filings show.","As California positions itself as a leader on climate change, former Los Angeles mayor and gubernatorial candidate Antonio Villaraigosa is pivoting away from his own track record as an environmental champion to defend the state’s struggling oil industry.

Villaraigosa’s work to expand mass transit, plant trees and reduce carbon emissions made him a favorite of the environmental movement, but the former state Assembly speaker also accepted more than $1 million in campaign contributions and other financial support from oil companies and other donors tied to the industry over more than three decades in public life, according to city and state fundraising disclosures reviewed by The Times.

Since entering the race last year to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom, Villaraigosa has accepted more than $176,000 from donors with ties to the oil industry, including from a company that operates oil fields in the San Joaquin Valley and in Los Angeles County, the disclosures show.

The clash between Villaraigosa’s environmentalist credentials and oil-industry ties surfaced in the governor’s race after Valero announced in late April that its Bay Area refinery would close next year, not long after Phillips 66 said its Wilmington refinery would close in 2025.

Villaraigosa is now warning that California drivers could see gas prices soar, blasting as “absurd” policies that he said could have led to the refinery closures.

“I’m not fighting for refineries,” Villaraigosa said in an interview. “I’m fighting for the people who pay for gas in this state.”

The refineries are a sore spot for Newsom and for California Democrats, pitting their environmental goals against concerns about the rising cost of living and two of the state’s most powerful interest groups — organized labor and environmentalists — against each other.

Villaraigosa said Democrats are letting the perfect be the enemy of the good in their approach to fighting climate change.

He said he hoped no more refineries would close until the state hits more electrification milestones, including building more transmission lines, green-energy storage systems and charging stations for electric cars. The only way for the state to reach “net zero” emissions, he said, is an “all-of-the-above” approach that includes solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, nuclear power and oil and gas.

“The notion that we’re not going to do that is poppycock,” Villaraigosa said.

Villaraigosa’s vocal support for the oil industry has upset some environmental groups that saw him as a longtime ally.

“I’m honestly shocked at just how bad it is,” said RL Miller, the president of Climate Hawks Vote and the chair of the California Democratic Party’s environmental caucus, of the contributions Villaraigosa has accepted since entering the race in July.

Miller said Villaraigosa signed a pledge during his unsuccessful run for governor in 2018 not to accept campaign contributions from oil companies and “named executives” at fossil-fuel entities. She said he took the pledge shortly after accepting the maximum allowable contributions from several oil donors in 2017.

Miller said that more than $100,000 in donations that Villaraigosa has accepted in this gubernatorial cycle were clear violations of the pledge.

That included contributions from the state’s largest oil and gas producer, California Resources Corp. and its subsidiaries, as well as the founder of Rocky Mountain Resources, a leader of the oil company Berry Corp., and Excalibur Well Services.

“This is bear-hugging the oil industry,” she said.

Environmental activists view the pledge as binding for future campaigns. Villaraigosa said he has not signed it for this campaign.

The economy is dramatically different than it was in 2018, Villaraigosa said, and working-class Americans are being hammered, which he said was a major factor in recent Democratic losses.

“We’re losing working people, particularly working people who don’t have a college education,” he said. “Why are we losing them? The cost of living, the cost of gas, the cost of utilities, the cost of groceries.”

Thad Kousser, a political science professor at UC San Diego, said such statements are consistent with Villaraigosa’s messaging in recent years.

“Villaraigosa is squarely in the moderate lane in the governor’s race. That doomed him in 2018, when voters wanted to counterbalance President Trump and Villaraigosa was outflanked by Newsom,” Kousser said. “But today, even some Democrats may want to counterbalance the direction that they see Sacramento taking, especially when it comes to cost-of-living issues and the price of gas.”

He added that the fossil-fuel donations may not be the basis for Villaraigosa’s apparent embrace of oil and gas priorities.

“When a politician takes campaign contributions from an industry and also takes positions that favor it, that raises the possibility of corruption, of money influencing votes,” Kousser said. “But it is also possible that it was the politician’s own approach to an issue that attracted the contributions, that their votes attracted money but were not in any way corrupted by it. That may be the case here, where Villaraigosa has held fairly consistent positions on this issue and consistently attracted support from an industry because of those positions.”

Other Democrats in the 2026 governor’s race, including Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, former state Controller Betty Yee and Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, have signed the pledge not to accept contributions from oil industry interests, Miller said.

Former California Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins, former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and businessman Stephen Cloobeck have not. (Cloobeck has never run for office before and has not been asked to sign.)

Other gubernatorial candidates have also accepted fossil-fuel contributions, although in smaller numbers than Villaraigosa, state and federal filings show.

Becerra accepted contributions from Chevron and California Resources Corp., formerly Occidental Petroleum, while running for attorney general. Atkins took donations from Chevron, Occidental and a trade group for oil companies while running for state Assembly and state Senate. And while running for lieutenant governor, Kounalakis took contributions from executives at oil and mining companies.

Campaign representatives for the two main Republican candidates in the race, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and conservative commentator Steve Hilton, said they welcomed oil-industry donations.

Villaraigosa is a fierce defender of his environmental record dating back to his first years as an elected official in the California Assembly.

As mayor of Los Angeles from 2005 to 2013, Villaraigosa set new goals to reduce emissions at the Port of Los Angeles, end the use of coal-burning power plants and shift the city’s energy generation toward solar, wind and geothermal sources.

The child of a woman who relied on Metro buses, he also branded himself the “transportation mayor.” Villaraigosa was a vocal champion for the 2008 sales tax increase that provided the first funding for the extension of the Wilshire Boulevard subway to the Westside.

But, he said, Democrats in 2025 have to be realistic that the refinery closures and their goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions could disproportionately affect low-income residents who are already struggling to make ends meet.

Villaraigosa’s comments underscore a broader divide among Democrats about how to fight climate change without making California even more expensive, or driving out more high-paying jobs that don’t require a college education.

Lorena Gonzalez, a former state lawmaker who became the leader of the California Labor Federation in 2022, said that while climate change is a real threat, so is shutting down refineries.

“That’s a threat to those workers’ jobs and lives, and it’s also a threat to the price of gas,” Gonzalez said.

California is not currently positioned to end its reliance on fossil fuels, she said. If the state reduces its refining capacity, she said, it will have to rely on exports from nations that have less environmental and labor safeguards.

“Anyone running for governor has to acknowledge that,” Gonzalez said.

Villaraigosa said that while the loss of union jobs at Valero’s Bay Area refinery worried him, his primary concern was over the cost of gasoline and household budgets.

His comments come as California prepares to square off yet again against the Trump administration over its environmental policies.

The U.S. Senate on Thursday voted to revoke a federal waiver that allowed California to set its own vehicle emission standards, including a rule that would have ultimately banned the sale of new gas-fueled cars in 2035. Villaraigosa denounced the vote, but said that efforts to fight climate change can’t come at the expense of working-class Americans.

President Trump has also declared a national energy emergency, calling for increased fossil-fuel production, eliminating environmental reviews and the fast-tracking of projects in potentially sensitive ecosystems and habitats. The Trump administration is also targeting California’s environmental standards.

Villaraigosa, an Eastside native, started his career as a labor organizer and rose to speaker of the state Assembly before becoming the mayor of Los Angeles. Now 72, Villaraigosa has not held elected office for more than a decade; he finished a distant third in the 2018 gubernatorial primary.

Over the years, donors affiliated with the fossil-fuel industry have contributed more than $1 million to Villaraigosa’s political campaigns and his nonprofit causes, including an after-school program, the city’s sports and entertainment commission and an effort to reduce violence by providing programming at city parks during summer nights, according to city and state disclosures.

More than half of the contributions and support for Villaraigosa’s pet causes, over $582,000, came during his years at Los Angeles City Hall as a council member and mayor.

In 2008, billionaire oil and gas magnate T. Boone Pickens donated $150,000 to a city proposition backed by Villaraigosa that levied a new tax on phone and internet use.

Pickens made the donation as his company was vying for business at the port of Los Angeles, which is overseen by mayoral appointees and was seeking to reduce emissions by replacing diesel-powered trucks with vehicles fueled by liquid natural gas.

The rest of the contributions and other financial support flowed to Villaraigosa’s campaign accounts and affiliated committees while he served in the Assembly and during his two gubernatorial runs. These figures do not include donations to independent expenditure committees, since candidates cannot legally be involved in those efforts.

Villaraigosa said that while such voters don’t subscribe to Republicans’ “drill, baby, drill” ethos, he slammed the Democratic Party’s focus on such matters and Trump instead of kitchen-table issues.

“The cost of everything we’re doing is on the backs of the people who work the hardest and who make the least, and that’s why so many of them — even when we were saying Trump is a threat to democracy — they were saying, yeah, but what about my gas prices, grocery prices, the cost of eggs?” he said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/df30575/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x2671+0+360/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb0%2F11%2Fcc2697194f6f8c51a88455df31d9%2Fcalifornia-governor-villaraigosa-00029.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 13:14:51.037006

The proposed rule, which the agency said would be published once it has completed interagency review, would undo decades of progress on limiting US climate pollution and could drive up energy prices if expensive coal plants remain on the grid longer as a result.

At a minimum, it is a sharp reversal from the Biden administration’s policies to lower pollution from power plants and make the air around them healthier to breathe. The Biden EPA finalized new rules last year that would have compelled coal and new natural gas power plants to either cut or capture 90% of their climate pollution by 2032.

In a statement, an EPA spokesperson referenced a 2022 Supreme Court decision striking down the Obama-era Clean Power Plan and said there were “concerns” that the Biden administration’s “replacement for that rule is similarly overreaching and an attempt to shut down affordable and reliable electricity generation in the United States.”

“As part of this reconsideration, EPA is developing a proposed rule,” the spokesperson added. “The proposal will be published once it has completed interagency review and been signed by the (EPA) Administrator.”

The documents the New York Times acquired argue the US share of global power plant pollution has fallen, and that even if US power plants cut all of their emissions and pollution, it would not “meaningfully” improve public health in the US — a claim likely to be fiercely challenged by public health researchers and organizations.

Power plants are the second-biggest emitters of planet-warming pollution in the US, making up around a quarter of the country’s climate pollution. US power plants contribute 3% of total global climate pollution.

The proposed rule follows a March announcement from the EPA that it would overturn more than a dozen Biden-era air pollution and climate rules. Trump’s EPA announced in March it was preparing to reconsider and strike down a consequential scientific finding on the dangers of climate pollution that has served as the basis behind federal regulations to curb them. Dismissing the precedent would strip the EPA’s authority to manage the pollution that causes global warming.

Policy shift under Trump: The move aligns with broader efforts to dismantle green-energy subsidies and climate protections instituted under the Biden administration.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is preparing a sweeping regulatory rollback that would eliminate all federal greenhouse gas (GHG) limits on coal and gas-fired power plants, according to a draft proposal first reported by The New York Times. The document is currently under interagency review and expected to be published in the coming weeks.

In its draft, the EPA argues that emissions from these plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or climate change because they represent a “small and declining share” of global emissions. The agency further asserts that eliminating such emissions would have “no meaningful effect on public health and welfare.”

These claims sharply diverge from global scientific consensus. The United Nations has stated unequivocally that fossil fuels account for more than 75% of global GHG emissions and nearly 90% of carbon dioxide emissions, making them the primary driver of climate change.

An EPA spokesperson confirmed the draft rule in a statement:

“Many have voiced concerns that the last administration’s replacement for that rule is similarly overreaching and an attempt to shut down affordable and reliable electricity generation in the United States, raising prices for American families, and increasing the country’s reliance on foreign forms of energy.

This regulatory retreat aligns with a broader policy agenda under President Donald Trump. His administration has moved to unwind nearly all federal climate action efforts, including key components of President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

Bush presided over a golden age of environmental enforcement.
The answer is that what really matters is whether firms comply with regulations, and EPA enforcement actions are only one reason for compliance.
EPA may have become much more efficient in focusing its enforcement efforts on the most significant violations, getting more bang for the enforcement buck.
That includes all environmental regulations — especially air pollution regulations, given Trump’s desire to maximize production and use of fossil fuels.
We may have the opportunity to see how polluters respond to near-zero levels of federal enforcement.","Enforcement efforts peaked long ago and have been in long-term decline. Trump will accelerate that.

According to a recent report by the Environmental Integrity Project, “During the first Trump Administration, EPA inspections, penalties, and the enforcement of environmental laws fell significantly, worsening a long-term decline in enforcement activity that began approximately twenty years ago. The numbers bear out this conclusion but raise three questions: What’s behind the long-term trend? Why has pollution generally continued to decline despite weaker enforcement? And how bad will things be under Trump II?

The Long-Term Decline in Federal Enforcement

In retrospect, George W. Bush presided over a golden age of environmental enforcement. Before the financial crisis, there were about 3200 staff in EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance. Under Trump I, the number declined to 2400, but it rebounded only modestly under Biden, to about 2700. Declining staff levels efforts were reflected in

EPA sent markedly fewer cases to DOJ for civil actions in court. That number peaked at 327 in the first year of the Obama Administration declined precipitously during most of his Administration and was down to 81 when he left office. There was a bit of a bump under Biden, but by the time he left office, the number was down to an all-time low of 60.

The story for criminal enforcement is similar. There were 372 criminal enforcement actions in 2005. The number declined to 176 when Bush left office, bounced around under Obama but ended up at 183, hit a low of 108 under Trump I, and recovered only slightly under Biden. When Biden left office, there were 121 criminal actions, about a third of the peak under Bush.

EPA’s inspection actions have also gone down, but the pattern has been a little different. In 2013, there were 11,000 inspections under Obama, which fell to around 9500 in his final year. Prior to the pandemic, inspections were at about 8200 under Trump 1. The two worst pandemic years saw much lower inspection rates, but the number slowly recovered under Biden to 8500 in 2024. But that was till a lot lower than the level a decade earlier.

Why Has Air Pollution Declined Anyway Despite Low Enforcment Rates?

Some reasons for the decline in pollution could have been due to unrelated factors like the movement of manufacturing to China and the rise of fracking, which led to closures of many coal generation plants. Nevertheless, the empirical evidence is that federal air pollution laws have been a significant factor. But how can pollution laws have driven air pollution declines even though enforcement has gone down? The answer is that what really matters is whether firms comply with regulations, and EPA enforcement actions are only one reason for compliance.

To begin with, the numbers may exaggerate the significance of the enforcement decline. EPA may have become much more efficient in focusing its enforcement efforts on the most significant violations, getting more bang for the enforcement buck. The disconnect between trends in inspections and enforcement suggest that many inspections may result in informal resolutions that correct violations but are not included in the numbers. In addition, under Obama, there was an effort toward “Next Gen” compliance, based on the idea that regulations should be written in ways that will drive compliance, and this effort may well have born some fruit.

Moreover, EPA is not the only enforcer of federal pollution regulations. State governments also have enforcement authority. States vary in how much they care about the environment. Some, like Texas, may be fairly law, but others take pollution seriously and vigorously enforce regulations. Particularly under Democratic administrations EPA may be successful in pressuring laggard states to increase their efforts. In addition, federal law authorizes citizen suits to enforce pollution requirements, and organizations like Sierra Club have been active in this litigation.

Finally, the threat of enforcement is not the only reason that firms comply with regulations. Firms are required to report their emissions, which are publicly available, and it is not hard for environmental groups and ordinary citizens to determine whether a firm is complying. That information is of interest to the firm’s employees (who are themselves exposed to the pollution), local communities, and media. Consistent violations may draw the attention of consumers, investors, and lenders.

And What About Trump II?

Trump has been much more aggressive pursuing his goals in his second term, and we can expect that to hold true in terms of environmental enforcement. Trump plans huge cuts at EPA, touting efforts to cut EPA’s budget by 60%. I doubt that he will succeed in such draconian cuts, but he’s like to get some significant cuts, which could fall especially heavily on enforcement staff. He has already taken steps to hobble the Justice Department division that enforces environmental regulation.

One of Trump’s executive orders tells agencies not to enforce regulations running contrary to his policy goals. That includes all environmental regulations — especially air pollution regulations, given Trump’s desire to maximize production and use of fossil fuels. Indications so far are that enforcement is lower than ever under this Administration.

In short, don’t be surprised to see record low enforcement levels decline further under Trump. We may have the opportunity to see how polluters respond to near-zero levels of federal enforcement. The larger puzzle is the long-term decline in federal enforcement",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Environmental_Protection_Agency_building_15011151177-e1573849622267.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 12:18:57.907271

The court sentenced two of the former executives to prison for several years, while the remaining two received suspended sentences. The ruling concludes a major trial that spanned nearly four years.

The scandal known as Dieselgate first came to light in September 2015, when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency discovered that many diesel vehicles produced by German carmaker Volkswagen were equipped with illegal so-called defeat devices.

These devices detected when a car was undergoing emissions testing and altered performance to meet environmental standards — while in real-world driving conditions, the cars emitted pollutants far above legal limits.

In 2017, Volkswagen admitted to manipulating emissions data in the United States, sparking global backlash and triggering one of the biggest corporate scandals in automotive history. The fallout plunged the Wolfsburg-based carmaker into a deep crisis.

In 2019, German prosecutors charged then-CEO Herbert Diess, Chair Hans Dieter Pötsch and former CEO Martin Winterkorn — who resigned shortly after the scandal broke in 2015 — with market manipulation related to the emissions deception.

In 2020, a German court ended legal proceedings against Diess and Pötsch as VW coughed up a €9 million fine over the scandal.

Winterkorn was originally set to be part of this trial, but was removed for health reasons before it kicked off in September 2021. In his capacity as a witness and defendant, Winterkorn has continued to deny responsibility for the scandal.

Since the scandal erupted, Volkswagen has faced a barrage of lawsuits and legal proceedings.

The first form of an EV was a “crude electric carriage” developed almost 200 years ago in 1832, by a Scotsman - Robert Anderson.
Recently, BYD revealed its Super E-platform charging facility that can charge an EV battery in five minutes to achieve a 470-km range.
CATL alone holds about 38%, of the global EV battery market share, while BYD holds another 17%.
The late entrant Maruti Suzuki unveiled e-Vitara and Hyundai released Creta Electric, its e-version of the popular SUV Creta.","They are not just in the zeitgeist, but, increasingly, in our everyday lives too, as we find them whizzing past on the roads with green registration plates, making the familiar low-pitched humming sound. These are electric vehicles – cars, bikes, scooters, hauling three-wheelers, and even garbage collection carts.

But you might be surprised to know that this is not the first time electric vehicles (EVs) have gained in popularity. They were quite the rage more than 100 years ago in the early 1900s, with EVs constituting over a third of all vehicles sold in the United States. A timeline by the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) dates back the prototypes of the EVs to developments in the 1820s with the invention of the electric motor by the Hungarian engineer Ányos István Jedlik and other technological breakthroughs in the U.S., Netherlands, and Hungary. The first form of an EV was a “crude electric carriage” developed almost 200 years ago in 1832, by a Scotsman - Robert Anderson.

However renewed interest in EVs had to wait until the widespread adoption of electricity across cities in the U.S. and Western Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. EVs began sprouting across the Atlantic during this time. While William Morrison, an American chemist created what was a “little more than an electric wagon” in the 1890s, Ferdinand Porsche, who went on to form the iconic German sports car company by the same name, developed an electric car called the Egger-Lohner C.2 Phaeton in 1898. “The vehicle was powered by an octagonal electric motor, and with three to five PS it reached a top speed of 25 km/h,” states an article on the company’s website. Incidentally, Porche also designed the world’s first petrol-electric hybrid in 1900. The production-ready version of the vehicle was called the Mixte.

There are similarities in the reasons for the rise of EVs between now and then — the initial internal combustion engines (ICE) were noisy and polluting. They were difficult to drive, requiring the operation of a manual crank to power them on. Changing gears was not as smooth as they are today. This is why the early EVs became especially popular with women. A January 20, 1911, a New York Times article states, “Ever since the small electric runabouts were introduced, about ten years ago, they have always been popular with women. In the early days of motoring, the little electrics were about the only kind of motor car a woman could handle easily, as the early gasoline cars required more strength to crank than most women possess.” The Times went on to say that “the designers of the electric passenger carrying vehicles have made great advances in the past few years, and these machines have retained all their early popularity and are steadily growing in favour with both men and women.”

But three years before this article was published, Henry Ford had introduced the mass-produced Model T. By 1912, the petrol Model T car cost $650, while an electric sold for almost three times the price at $1,750. This and the electric starter, which did away with the hand crank, and the discovery of crude oil in Texas in the 1920s, leading to petrol refill stations coming up across rural Europe and America, pretty much put paid to the early EVs by 1935.

Cleaner choice

Some similarities between the rise of early EVs and those on the roads now remain. EVs continue to be easier to drive, and they do not pollute, while even the cleanest of ICE vehicles emit particulate matter. Moreover, the correlation between vehicle emissions that contribute to the formation of greenhouse gases, which in turn leads to global warming, drove technological advancements in EVs., mainly to address what limited their uptake in the early days – the inability to attain higher speeds and the modest range of the battery motor, allowing only for short trips within urban settings.

According to the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), the transport sector accounted for almost a quarter (23%) of global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, making this sector the third biggest contributor to climate change after energy and industries. Of this, 75% of emissions were from road transport, and passenger cars alone accounted for almost half, that is 45% of total transport emissions in 2023. While aviation emissions were the next big chunk, they were way behind road transport at 11%, shipping was at another 10% and rail constituted the lowest at just 4%.

“Transport emissions grew at an annual average rate of 1.7% from 1990 to 2022, faster than any other end-use sector except for industry (which also grew at around 1.7%). To get on track with the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) by 2050 scenario, CO2 emissions from the transport sector must fall by more than 3% per year to 2030,” wagered the IEA in its Tracking Transport 2024 report. The IEA also highlighted the soaring uptake of ICE SUVs as an impediment to achieving the NZE goal, accounting for 46% of global sales and almost a third (31.4%) of total car emissions in 2022, compared with just 8.5% in 2010.

Aside from the now well-documented detrimental health-related consequences from vehicular pollution, many other reasons have propelled the resurgence in the popularity of EVs. Governments have introduced policies in the past decade that have supported the growth of the EV sector. In India, the government introduced the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles, or FAME, in April 2015, with an outlay of ₹895 crore for five years. This allocation was increased more than ten times to ₹10,000 crore in the policy’s second iteration, FAME 2, between 2019 and 2024. While the policy intended to provide capital support to encourage the creation of a manufacturing ecosystem for EVs, a substantial subsidy to the buyer of an EV ended up being widely popular, leading to greater EV uptake, with calls for a third iteration of the scheme.

Technological disruption

It was a similar EV adoption scheme that led to Tesla receiving a $460 million loan from the U.S. DoE in 2010, that helped the then EV start-up build its manufacturing facility in California. And it was Telsa’s 2006 unveiling of a luxury electric sports car – the Roadster, with a range between 320 km and 390 km on a single battery charge that led to a resurgence in EVs’ popularity. The Roadster addressed what had come to be called “range anxiety” in common parlance. That is, the anxiety that one faces when they fear becoming immobile as the battery drains out without the facility to recharge on the go. The Roadster also had better pick-up than any of its ICE rivals with a range of 0-95 km in under four seconds.

The COVID-19-induced crippling of supply chains was another factor that helped propel EVs’ popularity, with all forms of transport coming to a grinding halt and global oil giants forced to stop pumping out crude. Countries like India, which imports more than 80% of its oil requirements took advantage of the rock-bottom crude prices - $20 a barrel in April 2020 - and stocked up its Strategic Petroleum Reserves and expanded domestic storage capacities. But the realisation that this disruption was a potential threat to energy security was not lost on any nation and led to a spurt in EV technology-related innovations globally.

The past 10 years have seen advancements in battery technology at break-neck speed. These advancements have significantly addressed most of the limitations to EV adoption, such as the distance one could travel on a single battery charge known as energy density; the life cycle of a battery; its charging speed, thermal stability, and most importantly, cost. The technology that has emerged as the mainstay now is Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP), as it is cheaper, safer and more thermally stable than the others in the market.

While Telsa had a head start with the use of Japanese electronics giant Panasonic-manufactured lithium-ion cells for the Roadster in 2006, the company has largely switched to LFP batteries in the past five years, made by the Chinese behemoth CATL. Lithium-ion batteries power our everyday gadgets such as phones, laptops and earphones. They are mass-produced, cost-effective, compact and durable, and largely offer thermal stability, meaning the heat radiated while charging or being used can be controlled. But LFP’s energy density, and propulsion speed, which are valuable features in an EV, have far outstripped Lithium-ion’s use case.

Other battery technologies include a combination of Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese (NCM), or Nickel-Cobalt-Aluminium (NCA) that have double the energy density of LFPs. However, they have a shorter lifecycle and are more prone to overheating than LFPs. While NCMs can charge faster, they are also twice as expensive as LFPs as the resources required to make them are not as abundant. But NCM/NCA batteries are being mass-produced by group companies of the South Korean electronics giants Samsung and LG.

Aside from these battery technologies that are widely in use, there is ongoing research on what are called solid-state batteries that hold great promise on several parameters and could potentially upend the EV market, but it is still at the pilot stage. Panasonic and Japanese automobile giant Toyota are leading the research on these.

Chinese dominance

The two leading companies that make proprietary LFP batteries worldwide are both Chinese. Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd (CATL), and BYD – the EV behemoth that outnumbered Tesla in global sales in the past year. Both these firms have emerged not just as battery powerhouses, but energy technology giants, leading research and innovation in material, grid-scale energy storage systems, battery swapping, recycling and second-life applications, and have heavily invested in lithium mining and refining.

Recently, BYD revealed its Super E-platform charging facility that can charge an EV battery in five minutes to achieve a 470-km range. This pits EVs in direct competition with gasoline vehicles and could aid in widening BYD’s market share lead against Tesla. Auto trend trackers report Tesla sold 1.78 million units worldwide giving it a 10.3% market share in 2024, while BYD had more than double that at 22.2%, with 3.84 million units sold in the same period.

These innovations have led China to become an EV battery manufacturing powerhouse. In a research paper published in early March, the IEA states that “over 70% of all EV batteries ever manufactured were produced in China, creating extensive manufacturing know-how.” China has not only captured the overwhelming chunk of the EV battery market share, but its vertically integrated manufacturing ecosystem means that it also controls 70-90% of the value chain of EV batteries, which include mining and refining.

The high levels of investments in refining and mining in the past five years have led to an overcapacity of critical minerals. The global supply of cobalt, nickel and lithium exceeded demand by 6.5%, 8% and 10% respectively in 2023. This also led to a steep decline in battery prices. In 2024, the EV’s most expensive component, the battery, roughly cost $100/kWh compared with $1200/kWh in 2010. This has begun making EVs cheaper than ICE vehicles across China, and this cost arbitrage is being passed on globally, as EV makers worldwide adapt Chinese-made LFP batteries. CATL alone holds about 38%, of the global EV battery market share, while BYD holds another 17%.

It would be no exaggeration to state that China has been singularly responsible for ushering in an EV revolution in the automobile industry in the past five years, leading to global penetration of electric cars rising from 4% in 2020 to 18% in 2023, with sales crossing about 17 million in 2024 - a 25% rise from 14 million sold in the previous year. Of the 17 million, China alone accounted for the sale of 10.1 million electric cars, followed by Europe with 3.4 million, the U.S. with 1.7 million, and the rest of the world accounting for the remainder.

While Norway leads EV deployment with electric car sales reaching 93% in 2023, the China Passenger Car Association noted that EVs and hybrids crossed 50% of all vehicle sales for the first time in July 2024. Electric cars in India, on the other hand, accounted for only 2% of total sales, despite hatchback and sedan versions of EVs offered by Tata Motors and MG being priced competitively compared with ICE variations. This is largely influenced by range anxiety and the consumer’s desire to see charging infrastructure expansion on the ground.

India’s position

However, electric two-and-three-wheelers (e2w and e3w) have witnessed significant growth in India, with 1.2 million e2w sold in 2024, accounting for 60% total EV sales and representing a 30% year-on-year (YoY) growth from 2023. E3Ws which largely encompass commercial vehicles have witnessed even more impressive growth with the Society for Indian Automobile Manufacturers reporting an 18% YoY from 2023, to reach a market share that has crossed the half-way mark at 54.3% in 2024.

India’s EV policy emphasises the electrification of public transport and mobility, as passenger car sales do not yet constitute the per capita volumes witnessed in industrialised countries including China.

At the Bharat Mobility Global Expo held in Delhi in January this year, almost a third of more than 90 models unveiled were EVs, ranging from luxury e-SUVs to e-trucks, and even electric ambulances. Not surprisingly, e-SUVs were showstoppers, led by Chinese brands BYD’s Sealion 7 and its rival MG Motor’s Cyberster.

There was a frenzy of legacy automakers wanting to rush in with their EV offerings. The late entrant Maruti Suzuki unveiled e-Vitara and Hyundai released Creta Electric, its e-version of the popular SUV Creta. Speaking to reporters, MSIL’s MD and CEO Hisachi Takeuchi emphasised, the ‘newness’ of the e-Vitara. He said, “This is not just changing the ICE with a battery and a motor, from the ground up, this (e-Vitara) is all new.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who inaugurated the Bharat Expo, wagered EV numbers in India would increase eight-fold by 2030. He emphasised the government’s intent to procure about 14,000 e-buses by the end of fiscal 2026 through an EV support scheme called PM E-DRIVE. The scheme is the third iteration of FAME, but with an expanded scope to support the entire gamut of transport electrification – ranging from e-rickshaws to e-trucks; and enhancing charging infrastructure.

At least five Indian States have made budgetary allocations to add e-buses to their transport fleets. The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation has inducted 1,027 buses with plans to scale e-buses in Bengaluru alone to 9,000 by the end of the next fiscal. Telangana’s State Road Transport Corporation operates 254 e-buses in Hyderabad with plans to double it by mid this year.

Based on current policies and trends, the IEA estimates that the EV revolution will offset about 6 million barrels of oil a day by 2030, which is just a fraction of the 103 million barrels produced per day as of March 2025, but enough to signal the beginning of the end of the oil era.

Changing landscape

Make no mistake, this is not just a technological shift toward decarbonising transport, but a social, cultural, economic, environmental and geopolitical transformation of the global transport landscape as we know it. It is arguably akin to the transformation that was witnessed across industrialised nations after the Second World War, only this time, it appears, this revolution would be led by Asian countries.

The signs are already visible. On March 12, Europe’s largest battery maker, the Sweden-based Northvolt filed for bankruptcy, as it struggled to compete against cheaper batteries from China. Batteries in China were cheaper than those produced in Europe and North America by over 30% and 20% respectively. This marks a setback for Europe to develop its own battery technology. More crucially, this means, Europe and the U.S. would likely not lead in global standard setting on EV battery technology. With European companies failing, and the EU’s general wariness towards China, Korean and Japanese makers, who have traditionally been the largest manufacturers of NCM batteries in Europe, are investing in making LFP batteries as well to compete against their Chinese counterparts. The IEA states that Korean firms lead overseas manufacturing capacity with nearly 400 GWh of the 3 terawatt-hour (TWh) global capacity in 2024, followed by a distant Japan at 60 GWh and China with another 30 GWh. Korean and Japanese firms also lead research and innovation on solid-state batteries.

Europe’s celebrated automobile industry is on the edge of a precipice, as demand for its cars in its largest market, China, has fallen precipitously. The overall market share of foreign auto brands in China fell to a record low of 37% just in the first eight months of 2024 from 64% in 2020, signalling a drastic shift in customer preferences. Global sales of German brands of the BMW and Volkswagen Groups, long viewed, not only as technological marvels but as a status symbol, fell by 13.4% and 11% respectively in 2024. Mercedes-Benz saw a 7% decline, while the luxury car Bentley lost 37% in its operating profit mainly on account of declining demand in China.

A direct correlation could be made with the rise of local brands from BYD, Geely and State-owned SAIC, and a shift to EVs as they become cheaper than ICE vehicles in China. Nearly 60% of all vehicular registrations in China were EVs in 2023. But this decline is not only in China. European ICE carmakers lost ground to Chinese EVs even in their home markets. Europe accounted for 25% of electric car sales in 2023. This led to the EU slapping import tariffs in early October last year. The tariffs could go up to 35.3% over and above a flat 10% customs duty for China-made EVs entering the 27-member nation block. The EU termed these duties as “anti-subsidy” tariffs, claiming China’s state support for its EV sector has defied the competitive logic of the industry globally.

The response from China speaks volumes about who today leads the global auto technology race. China initiated a similar anti-subsidy investigation into imports of European brandy, dairy and pork products, President Xi Jinping declined an invitation to attend a summit in Brussels to mark the 50th anniversary of EU-China relations and has formally complained to the World Trade Organisation, alleging the EU’s tariffs violate the global trade body’s rules and constitute protectionism. It does feel a bit like deja vu, doesn’t it? Well, that is because in the 1980s and 90s, industrialised nations railed against what they alleged were protectionist measures across poorer countries, which they claimed, denied those citizens access to superior technology from the developed world. It was a cloak to expand beyond their saturated home markets. The most apparent change on the ground following the lifting of import barriers and local manufacturing rules was the flood of American and European consumer durables and automobiles that upended domestic companies across the developing world.

Taking the hit

There have been planned plant closures across Europe’s auto sector, something that was unthinkable even about a decade ago. Stellantis, the amalgamated Dutch-headquartered company that owns iconic brands like Vauxhall, Opel and Peugeot, has planned closures that will cut jobs in Italy and France amid a 70% decline in profits in 2024.

Volkswagen had three weeks of labour unrest across nine plants in Germany in December last year, following proposed wage cuts and factory closure threats – the first in the firm’s 87-year history. It was resolved on December 20, 2024, with workers agreeing to modifications in staff bonuses, capacity reductions at five factories by 7,34,000 units annually and a planned 35,000 decrease in jobs by 2030 through retirements and voluntary redundancies.

One of the major economic disruptions that is expected with the rise of EVs is the significant reduction in jobs across the automotive sector, as the EV powertrain requires only 20 moving parts compared with 2,000 for ICE vehicles. A World Resources Institute, India, report estimates that this would mean a reduction in the share of the component suppliers in the value chain ranging between 15-20%. While the auto cluster suppliers, The Hindu spoke to, view this with some trepidation, they also wager that in the long term, the hit may not be as bad, as the transition, at least in India, would mean a growth of both the EV and ICE sectors as per capita vehicle ownership will continue to rise for some time to come.

The Europeans, however, have made a more sobering assessment. A study by the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA) forecasts that the shift to EVs could result in a net loss of approximately 2,75,000 jobs by 2040 within the EU automotive sector. This projection accounts for the elimination of roles related to ICE powertrains, partially offset by new positions in EV manufacturing. While the U.S.-based United Auto Workers union has expressed concern about job losses due to the rapid adoption of EVs.

A few more characteristics of the EV powertrain are the high degree of vertical integration, automation and digitisation by automakers. This has also led to a skill gap between those that are required on the EV powertrain, and its ICE counterpart. These roles include coders, EV software managers and cloud engineers – positions that typically require higher education degrees, which have fewer requirements on ICE powertrains.

Environmental impact

Several other shifts have been understudied, as EV advocates have placed greater emphasis on the transition to electrification to meet global climate goals while side-stepping its environmental and social impact. While EVs aid reduction of carbon emissions during operation, the mineral extraction process for their batteries has shown to be severely detrimental. Chile’s Atacama Desert – the vast water-scarce and sparsely populated fragile ecosystem, is being mined for lithium through the evaporation of brines found beneath the salt flats. Chile is the second largest producer of lithium, the key component of the LFP batteries. “Miners pump salty lithium-containing water, called brine, into massive ponds, where it can take years for the evaporation process to separate the lithium. The technique drains already scarce water resources, damages wetlands, and harms communities,” reports the Natural Resources Defence Council. This has led communities that live in the Atacama to lose their access to potable water and instead rely on tankers to deliver it.

While in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where more than 50% of the world’s cobalt reserves are found, child labour is rampant. The U.S. Department of Labour (DoL) reports, “Children routinely work in these mines, often under hazardous conditions. While mining is on the DRC’s list of hazardous activities for which children’s work is forbidden, the majority of cobalt mining in the DRC is done informally, where monitoring and enforcement are poor.” The DoL goes on to state that 5,346 children were registered in a Child Labour Monitoring and Remediation System database that has now been handed over to the DRC’s Ministry of Mines. Aside from rampant child labour, cobalt mining has also polluted local water resources, affecting the communities that depend on them.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Netherlands has reported that Indonesia’s nickel boom, where the world’s largest reserve of the metal is found, has led to deforestation, pollution, and loss of livelihoods for local communities, particularly in the islands of Sulawesi and the Moluccas.

In the end, we can safely say that no transition to a new technology has been without its detrimental impacts. But as we increasingly realise the finite nature of the world’s resources to support humanity, some transitions could be done so, with greater deliberations on ensuring the least all round damage, especially when it is being done on the premise of saving life on Earth from the disastrous impact of climate change. It is also safe to say, that this time, the electrification of transport is here to stay.",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/et7ini/article69622283.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-05-08T095654Z_1862157918_RC22RAA2RXMH_RTRMADP_3_AUTOS-BYD-GLOBAL-SALES.JPG,N,,2025-05-26 12:18:21.866749

Could That Happen Again? - The New York Times,"Ivan Penn, www.nytimes.com, ivan-penn",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/business/electric-vehicles-history.html,"More than a century before Tesla rolled out its first cars, the Baker Electric Coupe and the Riker Electric Roadster rumbled down American streets.
In both eras, electric cars struggled to gain acceptance in the marketplace and were undermined by politics.
“Electric cars are good if you have a towing company,” President Trump said at a campaign rally in Iowa in October 2023.
Now, the decades-long tug of war between combustion engine and electric cars is intensifying again, and electric cars may be in trouble, at least in the United States.
While the Republican changes probably wouldn’t kill electric vehicles, they could set the industry back years.","More than a century before Tesla rolled out its first cars, the Baker Electric Coupe and the Riker Electric Roadster rumbled down American streets. Battery-powered cars were so popular that, for a time, about a third of New York’s taxis were electric.

But those early electric vehicles began to lose ground to a new class of cars, like the Ford Model T, that were cheaper and could more easily be refueled by new oil-based fuels that were becoming available around the country. Bolstered by federal tax incentives in the 1920s, the oil industry boomed — and so did gasoline-powered cars.

That history has largely been forgotten, and almost all of the early electric cars have disappeared so completely that most people alive today have never seen one — and many have no idea that they even existed. A few specimens are in museums and private collections, including a fully restored Baker Electric that Jay Leno keeps in his sprawling California garage.

Mr. Leno’s ancient electric car has a wooden frame and 36-inch rubber wheels. It looks like a stagecoach, but it is propelled by electric motors and batteries just like a current-day Tesla Model Y or Cadillac Lyriq. It elicited smiles and amazement from people on the streets of Burbank, Calif., when Mr. Leno drove it around town recently.

The car may be a novelty, but it is newly relevant because the United States may be poised to repeat history.

The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are working to undercut the growth of electric vehicles, impose a new tax on them and swing federal policy sharply in favor of oil and gasoline.

Scholars who have studied the earlier age of electric vehicles see parallels in their demise in the early decades of the 1900s and the attacks they are facing now. In both eras, electric cars struggled to gain acceptance in the marketplace and were undermined by politics. A big knock against them was they had to be charged and ultimately were considered less convenient than vehicles with internal combustion engines.

“Electric cars are good if you have a towing company,” President Trump said at a campaign rally in Iowa in October 2023. At another appearance the next month, he said, “You can’t get out of New Hampshire in an electric car.”

Republican leaders say that electric vehicles do not deserve subsidies in the tax code and that their tax bill levels the playing field that Democrats had tilted in favor of one technology.

A hundred years ago, lawmakers also put their thumbs on the scale — and came down on the side of oil.

The oil industry has enjoyed numerous tax breaks. One was enacted in 1926 when Congress allowed oil companies to deduct their taxable income by 27.5 percent of their sales. The sponsor of the legislation later admitted that the incentive was excessive.

“We grabbed 27.5 percent because we were not only hogs but the odd figure made it appear as though it was scientifically arrived at,” Senator Tom Connally, the Texas Democrat who sponsored the break, was quoted as saying in a biography of Lyndon B. Johnson, “Sam Johnson’s Boy: A Close-Up of the President From Texas.”

That tax break lasted for decades. It was eliminated for large oil producers and reduced for smaller companies in 1975.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, crude oil became dominant. The Energy Department noted on a timeline on its website that electric cars “all but disappeared by 1935.”

The triumph of internal combustion made long-distance travel accessible to the masses and helped power the U.S. economy. It also led to deadly urban air pollution and has been a major cause of climate change.

Now, the decades-long tug of war between combustion engine and electric cars is intensifying again, and electric cars may be in trouble, at least in the United States.

Sales of electric cars are growing quickly in most of the rest of world, increasing 35 percent in China in the first four months of the year and 25 percent in Europe, according to Rho Motion, a research firm. But in the United States, sales were up a more modest 11 percent in the first three months of 2025, according to Kelley Blue Book.

Republican leaders are pushing legislation that would eliminate many Biden administration programs intended to promote electric vehicle sales, including a $7,500 federal tax credit. They also want to impose a new annual $250 fee on electric vehicle owners to finance highway construction and maintenance.

While the Republican changes probably wouldn’t kill electric vehicles, they could set the industry back years. “E.V. momentum in the U.S. has slowed, with policy uncertainty mounting,” analysts at Bernstein said in a note this month.

But electric cars have not just been hampered by politics. They also had to overcome gender stereotypes. Their benefits like quiet, smooth operation were considered by some men to be too feminine, and, in the late 1800s and early 1900s, many models like the Baker Electric were explicitly marketed only to women.

Advertisements for the early electrics hang on the walls of Mr. Leno’s Burbank garage. “Make This the Happiest Christmas — Give Your Wife an Electric,” proclaims one. On another, a young woman pleads, “Daddy Get Me a Baker.”

Men, by contrast, have long been pitched on the masculine virtues of gasoline vehicles that roar and thunder.

In the fall of 2022, Representative Majorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia who is closely allied with Mr. Trump, pushed the notion that gasoline cars are more macho at a rally. “There’s nothing more American than the roar of a V-8 engine under the hood of a Ford Mustang or Chevy Camaro, an incredible feel of all that horsepower.” But Democrats, she said, “want to emasculate the way we drive.”

Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive who has been working with the Trump administration, has tried to broaden the appeal of electric vehicles. His company’s newest model is the Cybertruck, a massive pickup truck with lots of sharp angles.

“Musk has done everything he could to try to make a Tesla a manly vehicle,” said Virginia Scharff, an emeritus distinguished professor of history at the University of New Mexico and author of numerous books, including “Taking the Wheel: Women and the Coming of the Motor Age.”

But, Ms. Scharff added, Mr. Musk may have gone too far. His alignment with Mr. Trump’s conservative politics has alienated some of the most reliable buyers of electric cars — liberals and environmentalists who hope to move the world away from fossil fuels.

“Here’s like the gender flip: Tesla is so associated with a kind of toxic masculinity now as opposed to the electric car being associated with femininity in the early part of the 20th century,” Ms. Scharff said.

Mr. Leno, the former “Tonight Show” host, who now has an online show focused on cars, “Jay Leno’s Garage,” has a restored 1909 Baker Electric in his collection. It has a top speed of 25 miles per hour and can travel 80 miles on a full charge.

With a high-top cab decorated in Victorian flair, it has two fabric-cushioned bench seats facing each other and roller shades on the windows. The car was meant to accommodate fanciful women’s hats, which at the turn of the century were often big and bold. As an added touch, the car’s designers mounted a makeup case inside the car.

“What do men like?” Mr. Leno said. “Something that rolls, explodes and makes noise. That’s why men like the gasoline car, because it frightened children, you know, that type of thing.”

Mr. Leno said he loves the Baker, which he drives around Burbank at least once a year, to see holiday lights and decorations with his wife.

He said such vehicles had many merits, convenience among them. They are low maintenance, they’re fast and you can fuel them at home, particularly at night when electricity is generally much more affordable than during the day.

The concept of home charging isn’t new. Home car chargers also made their debut a century ago, only bulkier and a bit more frightful.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/27/multimedia/00biz-ev-history-tbgc/00biz-ev-history-tbgc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 13:14:27.282722

“The research shows us how materials science can be applied to simplify the manufacturing process,” Xiao continued.
Nickel-rich lithium cathode material tends to form as agglomerations known as “polycrystals.” Boundaries between the crystals become weaker as the battery discharges and charges.
“The movement can create cracks, which weakens the battery.” “Single-crystal cathodes don’t have the vulnerabilities that arise from polycrystal structures,” Xiao said.
However, Xiao noted that Li2O is easily produced by processing other lithium salts, such as lithium hydroxide (LiOH).","Scientists at the US Department of Energy‘s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have recently discovered that the sublimation of lithium oxide, when mixed with nickel-rich cathode precursors, creates a single-crystal structure that could be used in longer-lasting batteries.

In a new finding published in Nature Energy, the PNNL-led team showed that vapor from lithium oxide (Li2O) sublimation—the process whereby a solid turns directly into a vapor—accelerates a chemical reaction that forms single crystals when mixed with nickel-rich precursors. The sublimation happens at just one atmosphere of pressure, the everyday pressure felt at sea level. Single-crystal battery materials are thought to help batteries last longer and could help decrease the cost of battery manufacturing.

“The discovery offers a potentially faster, more efficient, and cheaper way to scale up the manufacturing of nickel-rich lithium-ion batteries,” said Jie Xiao, co-author on the paper and a Battelle Fellow who holds a joint appointment with PNNL and the University of Washington. At UW, Xiao is the university’s Boeing Martin Professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department. “The research shows us how materials science can be applied to simplify the manufacturing process,” Xiao continued.

Nickel-rich lithium cathode material tends to form as agglomerations known as “polycrystals.” Boundaries between the crystals become weaker as the battery discharges and charges. Over time, these weaknesses lead to cracking, which degrades the battery and shortens its lifetime.

“You can imagine all those tiny particles are agglomerated together, and they get pushed and pulled as the battery charges and discharges,” Xiao said. “The movement can create cracks, which weakens the battery.”

“Single-crystal cathodes don’t have the vulnerabilities that arise from polycrystal structures,” Xiao said. “So, we hope single crystals will mitigate and eventually eliminate all the big challenges in nickel-rich cathode materials.”

However, the team has more work to do before any batteries can be produced, Xiao said. Because Li2O is not broadly used for materials synthesis, the cost to use it commercially is currently too high. However, Xiao noted that Li2O is easily produced by processing other lithium salts, such as lithium hydroxide (LiOH).

Xiao and her team are now working with industry partners to scale up the process while maintaining lower manufacturing costs and aim to provide single crystals to their strategic partners in 2026.",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/LiO2-sublimation-copy.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 12:18:24.986353

This legislative amendment effectively opens the door to restarting nuclear power plants in the country.","Taiwan will hold in August a referendum on whether the just-shuttered last nuclear reactor should be restarted once safety checks are completed, in a major reversal of the country’s policy amid energy security concerns.

Taiwan, which is being threatened by China with Beijing claiming it is a “sacred and inseparable part of China's territory”, has decided to phase out its nuclear reactors by this year.

Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party elected in January 2016, and re-elected in 2020, has a policy of phasing out nuclear power by the end of 2025.

Taiwan shut its last nuclear reactor, Maanshan, earlier this month.

Since 2018, Taiwan has shut down four other nuclear reactors and cancelled construction of two others following a referendum in 2021.

However, pro-nuclear opposition parties have submitted a motion for a referendum to restart the Maanshan nuclear reactor if thorough inspections find that it is safe to do so.

Taiwan’s Central Election Commission has approved the proposal for the referendum which will be held on August 23.

“This referendum proposal is about energy policy, and it is about whether the third nuclear power plant, which stopped operating on 17 May 2025, should be put to a referendum to decide whether to continue operating,” the commission said.

Earlier this month, Taiwan’s Parliament amended the country’s nuclear power act to allow plant operators to apply for a 20-year license renewal beyond the existing 40-year limit. This legislative amendment effectively opens the door to restarting nuclear power plants in the country.

Still, even if the referendum to reverse the phase-out is successful, safety checks will take at least three years—therefore, the Maanshan reactor will not be reactivated soon.

Taiwan is looking to bolster its energy security – and to reduce its trade surplus with the United States – by pledging to buy more U.S. oil and gas.

Earlier this year, Taiwan’s state-held oil and gas company CPC Corporation signed a letter of intent to invest in the $44-billion Alaska LNG export project in the U.S. and buy LNG from it. But as Taiwan saw firsthand, commitments and contracts to buy more U.S. energy will not necessarily spare any buyer from tariffs.

The IRA was a huge boon to Republican districts: In just two years, it added nearly 200,000 clean energy jobs and more than $286 billion in clean energy investments to congressional districts represented by Republican House members.","President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) bill was a landmark move for the economy. One year after it was signed into law, it had already created more than 170,600 clean energy jobs and spurred private companies to announce at least 210 major new clean energy and clean vehicle projects across 39 states, representing more than $86 billion in investments.

Now the House Republicans’ reconciliation bill is poised to also have a drastic impact on the economy and clean energy landscape, but by gutting the IRA’s gains. Instead of fostering jobs and clean energy development, the bill—which passed the House this week and has now moved to the Senate—could erase those monumental investments and lead to fewer jobs, reduced clean energy capacity, and a drop in the national GDP.

The GOP’s “big, beautiful bill” will increase some things, experts say, like Americans’ household expenses; it will also give tax benefits to billionaires. “House Republicans just voted to jack up prices, kill jobs, and rip away basic lifelines from working families by taking a sledgehammer to programs and investments that make life more affordable,” Lena Moffitt, executive director of the nonprofit Evergreen Action, said in a statement. “If passed into law, Americans will wake up to find the GOP quietly reached into their wallets and handed their hard-earned cash to corporate polluters and billionaires like Elon Musk and Donald Trump.”

Here’s a look at the impact of the Republican reconciliation bill by the numbers, specifically around jobs, clean energy, and household costs.

The GOP’s reconciliation bill could cost the U.S. more than 830,000 jobs in 2030, according to an analysis from Energy Innovation. (That includes both direct job cuts from less EV production and clean energy manufacturing, as well as indirect losses from higher fuel costs and other economic impacts.)

It would also lead to less new electricity generation, especially at a time when electricity demand is growing. Over the next four years, the bill would decrease additions to new electricity capacity by 302 gigawatts. That’s the same power capacity that the entire U.S. coal fleet had a decade ago. For context, 1 gigawatt can power 100 million LED light bulbs.

With less new electricity being generated, wholesale power prices will increase about 50% by 2035, particularly because solar and wind are cheaper energy sources than fossil fuels. Across all American households, consumer energy costs will increase by more than $16 billion in 2030, and by more than $33 billion by 2035. “This increase happens even if oil and gas production rise and help reduce fossil fuel prices, as envisioned by the bill,” Energy Innovation notes. Between 2026 and 2034, the bill would cumulatively reduce the national GDP by nearly $1.1 trillion.

For individual households, that could mean a $110 increase to electricity costs per year, beginning in 2026, which could then rise to $290 more in annual energy costs per household by 2035.

The GOP bill will drive up household costs for Americans in other ways, too. The price of gasoline will increase between 25 and 37 cents per gallon, which, on the higher end, would mean more than $200 per year for the average gas vehicle. Without the IRA’s EV tax credits, Americans will also essentially see the cost of electric vehicles go up by at least $7,500 (and for used EVs, $4,000).

The Republican bill also eliminates a tax credit for energy-efficient home improvements like heat pumps and water heaters. That credit has so far allowed households to save up to $990 each year on their utility bills, but Americans will now miss out on those savings.

The bill has broader impacts on emissions and how climate change will worsen. Without tax credits to spur investments in clean energy and efficient appliances, the bill could increase greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 130 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent in 2030—like adding 30 million gas-powered cars to the road for one year. By 2035, that could grow to nearly 260 million metric tons, equivalent to the annual energy use of nearly 35 million homes—or the entire annual CO2 emissions from Spain.

With more emissions and air pollution come more deaths. According to Energy Innovation, that could mean nearly 350 additional premature deaths annually by 2030, and nearly 670 more every year by 2035.

Many of these impacts will be concentrated in Republican states. The IRA was a huge boon to Republican districts: In just two years, it added nearly 200,000 clean energy jobs and more than $286 billion in clean energy investments to congressional districts represented by Republican House members. Now those districts will likely see job losses and less economic investment because of their Republican representatives’ votes. “In their crusade to rig the system for their fossil fuel backers,” Moffitt said prior to the House bill passing, “it’s people living in Trump states—their own voters—who will pay the steepest price: lost jobs, higher energy costs, and missed economic opportunities.”",,N,,2025-05-26 15:05:59.569520

These solar projects are located in Texas and Kansas cities in the United States.

AES’ Presence in the Solar Market

AES is actively scaling up its solar power initiatives to reap the benefits of the rising demand trend of the U.S. solar market, backed by significantly expanding investments, especially from large corporate clients. Notably, in the first quarter of 2025, the company completed the construction of 643 MW of solar and energy storage projects.

With solar accounting for 66% of all new electricity-generating capacity added to the U.S. grid in 2024 (per the Solar Industries Association’s report) amid rapidly growing energy demand from renewable sources across the nation, AES is more aggressively bolstering its renewable energy generation capacity, with solar at the center of focus. As of March 31, 2025, the company signed 7.7 gigawatts (GW) of long-term PPAs to build renewable capacity that supports the energy needs of data centers.

Meanwhile, the company’s AES Indiana subsidiary received final regulatory approval for the 170 MW Crossvine solar-plus-storage project during the first quarter, which is expected to come online in 2027. It is also making progress on the 295 MW Petersburg Energy Center, a solar-plus-storage facility expected to go live by the end of 2025. Looking ahead, AES Indiana aims to bring up to 1,300 MW of new wind, solar, and storage capacity online by 2027.

Rising Solar Prospects and Utilities

The solar market provides significant growth opportunities, primarily driven by favorable government policies, declining prices of solar panels and the rising adoption of clean power sources.

Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, solar power is expected to drive the largest increase in electricity generation, with output projected to grow 34% in 2025 and 18% in 2026. This offers a significant profit incentive to utilities like AES to significantly enhance their solar generation capacity.

Other utilities expanding their solar generation capacity include the following:

CMS Energy Corporation CMS: It plans to add 9 GW of solar generation to its portfolio during the 2025-2045 period. The company also collaborated with the Muskegon County Resource Recovery Center to develop consumers’ first large-scale, self-developed solar project, a 250 MW solar energy center, expected to be fully operational by 2026.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CMS’ 2025 earnings per share is pinned at $3.59, indicating year-over-year growth of 7.5%. The consensus estimate for 2025 sales is pinned at $8.11 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 8%.

Ameren Corporation AEE: Its Cass County, Huck Finn and Boomtown solar projects were placed in service during the fourth quarter of 2024. These projects are expected to collectively generate 500 MW of clean energy.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AEE’s 2025 earnings per share is pinned at $4.93, indicating year-over-year growth of 6.5%. The consensus estimate for 2025 sales is pinned at $8.41 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 10.4%.

PPL Corporation PPL: Its subsidiaries, Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company, requested the Kentucky Public Service Commission for approval of nearly 1 GW of solar generation by 2028 as part of the companies' generation replacement strategy.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PPL’s 2025 earnings per share is pinned at $1.82, indicating year-over-year growth of 7.7%. The consensus estimate for 2025 sales is pinned at $8.85 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 4.6%.

According to the EPA's Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions website, power plants were responsible for roughly 25 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2022, making them the second-largest source of heat-trapping gases behind transportation.
Agency officials contended that even if American power plants eliminated all their greenhouse gas emissions, global public health risks would not be ""meaningfully"" improved.
According to the United Nations Climate Action website, fossil fuels account for more than 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 percent of carbon dioxide emissions.
The Trump administration has already moved to terminate 20 billion U.S. dollars in grants for climate and clean-energy projects.","SACRAMENTO, United States, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration is advancing plans to eliminate all federal limits on greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants across the United States, according to internal U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) documents reviewed by The New York Times on Saturday.

The moves mark the most significant rollback of climate change regulations in decades.

The EPA drafted a proposed regulation arguing that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuel power plants ""do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution"" or climate change, the report said, citing the EPA's documents sent to the White House for review on May 2.

The proposal directly contradicted established climate science and the agency's own data. According to the EPA's Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions website, power plants were responsible for roughly 25 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2022, making them the second-largest source of heat-trapping gases behind transportation.

Moreover, these facilities emitted approximately 1.36 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2023, exceeding the total emissions of most countries worldwide.

""Fossil fuel power plants are the single largest industrial source of climate destabilizing carbon dioxide in the United States,"" said Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, to The New York Times.

She called the proposed regulation ""an abuse of the EPA's responsibility under the law,"" adding that it ""flies in the face of common sense and puts millions of people in harm's way.""

The EPA's justification centered on the argument that U.S. power sector emissions represented only about 3 percent of worldwide greenhouse gases in 2022, down from 5.5 percent in 2005, according to the draft regulation.

Agency officials contended that even if American power plants eliminated all their greenhouse gas emissions, global public health risks would not be ""meaningfully"" improved.

However, climate scientists overwhelmingly reject this reasoning. According to the United Nations Climate Action website, fossil fuels account for more than 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 percent of carbon dioxide emissions.

The power plant deregulation represents the latest phase in the Donald Trump administration's comprehensive assault on climate policies. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced on March 12 what he called ""the most consequential day of deregulation in American history,"" targeting more than 30 environmental measures established during the Joe Biden administration.

The Trump administration has already moved to terminate 20 billion U.S. dollars in grants for climate and clean-energy projects. However, a federal judge temporarily blocked this action, noting the EPA had failed to provide adequate legal justification.

Trump's budget plan, announced on May 2, would slash EPA funding by nearly 55 percent compared to 2025 levels and eliminate 15 billion in carbon capture and renewable energy funding from the bipartisan infrastructure law.

The proposed regulation would overturn Biden-era rules that required existing coal-fired units and some new gas-burning plants to cut or capture 90 percent of their climate pollution by 2032. ■",,N,,2025-05-26 12:19:31.058498

The decision by House Republicans to pass a tax bill that would do away with many of the incentives contained in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act threatens to upend investment strategies premised on the clean energy-transition.
The bill agreed by House Republicans is even “worse than feared” for investors committed to energy transition strategies, according to equity analysts at Jefferies.
The “sledgehammer” that House Republicans have taken to the IRA “is just one more example of the new volatility and uncertainty in US policy,” Christie said.
Wind, solar, battery and electric vehicle sectors are now pinning hopes on the more deliberative Senate, where improvements could come.","Inside one of Europe’s biggest asset managers, there’s growing concern that Republican efforts to gut legislation supporting key industries such as clean energy may result in the US losing its status as a destination for investor capital.

“For investors, the message is clear: The US may no longer offer the reliable investment runway it did just months ago,” said Alex Bibani, a London-based senior portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors, which oversees some $650 billion in assets.

The decision by House Republicans to pass a tax bill that would do away with many of the incentives contained in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act threatens to upend investment strategies premised on the clean energy-transition. Even if the Senate votes to block some of the House proposals, European asset managers still have to contend with a new level of uncertainty and volatility that may ultimately force them to turn elsewhere, Bibani said.

“Project economics, supply-chain commitments, and capital flows may now pivot toward more stable jurisdictions like Canada or the EU, unless clarity is quickly restored,” he said.

It’s the latest wedge dividing Europe, where emissions reductions are anchored in law, and the US, where the Trump administration has mounted a full-throated attack on net zero policies. The bill agreed by House Republicans is even “worse than feared” for investors committed to energy transition strategies, according to equity analysts at Jefferies.

A repeal of the IRA “would mark a sharp reversal in US clean-tech policy,” Bibani said. That would inject “significant regulatory and political risk into the market, undermining the policy certainty and financial predictability that made the US the world’s leading destination for clean tech capital post-IRA.”

Key Republican senators have already signaled opposition to the House bill. But if passed without revision, it would be the biggest blow to clean power yet from the Trump administration.

The S&P 500 Index fell last week, while the yield on 30-year US Treasuries rose as high as 5.1% as markets digested news of the Republican bill, amid estimates it will add trillions of dollars to the deficit. President Donald Trump then ended the week by injecting further uncertainty into markets as he escalated the tariff war with the European Union, even declaring he’s “not looking for a deal.” The dollar fell.

US hostility toward energy-transition policies has already sent a chill through European investing circles, where such strategies are a major driver of flows. Amundi SA, Europe’s largest asset manager, said last month it was seeing evidence that clients had “massively repositioned” to avoid the US market, amid concerns over everything from a lack of stewardship to a degradation of key climate policies. UBS Group AG also said it was aware of sizeable flows out of US equity exchange-traded funds.

Tyler Christie, who previously invested in climate and the energy transition at BlackRock Inc. as part of its Decarbonization Partners venture with Temasek Holdings Pte, said the concern now is that “extreme volatility in US policy is creating uncertainty that’s rippling through the financial system.” At the same time, “European policy is arguably more aligned and predictable than ever” as it tackles “existential challenges around energy, security and resources.”

The upshot is that asset managers, both in Europe and the US, “are starting to direct more capital into European projects where they can see policy is more consistent and reinforced by fundamental demand,” he said.

The “sledgehammer” that House Republicans have taken to the IRA “is just one more example of the new volatility and uncertainty in US policy,” Christie said.

What BloombergNEF Says:

The final version of the tax and spending bill passed by House Republicans early Thursday represents the nightmare scenario for US clean energy advocates and defenders of the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Wind, solar, battery and electric vehicle sectors are now pinning hopes on the more deliberative Senate, where improvements could come.

The shift—which has international ripple effects on everything from climate change to geopolitics—highlights China’s growing dominance in renewable energy technologies and the critical mineral and metal supply chains that support them.

Historically, China’s state-backed Belt and Road Initiative and its predecessor program had been dominated by coal power plants. But from 2022 to 2023, 68 percent of China’s investments in overseas power went to solar and wind projects, according to a new analysis from Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center.

Only 13 percent of China’s overseas power investments went to solar and wind from 2000 to 2021.

China’s state-backed overseas investment program has poured hundreds of billions of dollars into infrastructure and energy projects in Latin America, Africa, Southeast Asia and elsewhere. Its overseas wind and solar investments have largely been in countries in Asia and the Americas, with only 4 percent flowing to African countries, according to Diego Morro, a co-author of the analysis and data scientist at Boston University.

The analysis says China has stuck to its 2021 pledge not to finance new overseas coal power plants, though there is no indication that coal power investments in the works as of 2021 will be jettisoned. Those investments “are still coming online and will emit carbon dioxide for decades going forward,” the researchers said.

If those planned coal power plants are completed, they will emit roughly the same amount of carbon emissions annually as the country of Austria, according to the analysis.

The swing toward financing renewable power in China’s overseas portfolio is also tempered by the fact that overall Chinese foreign direct investment is down from its peak in 2016.

“This shift does not represent a significant ramp-up in renewables, as the scale of financing remains relatively small,” the researchers said. Only 3 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity were funded between 2022 and 2023. By comparison, China’s annual overseas power investments from 2013 to 2019 averaged a capacity of 16 gigawatts.

While coal power dominated those earlier investments, hydropower and gas projects came in second and third.

The analysis drew on the Global Development Policy Center’s database that tracks Chinese state funding through its development finance institutions and other government-directed channels into global power plants outside of China. It does not account for private Chinese overseas investment or for so-called captive coal projects, which aren’t connected to the electric grid because they are built specifically to power industrial projects like mines or steel mills.

Domestically, China continues to lead the world with new coal plant development. Last year, construction started on 94 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity in China, compared to 7.4 gigawatts in the rest of the world combined, according to Global Energy Monitor.

Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013. The program is a continuation of China’s “going out” policy from the early 2000s, and has more recently been called China’s Global Development Initiative.

While the programs have given Beijing unprecedented geopolitical sway over more than 150 countries around the world, they have drawn fierce criticism for environmental and human rights harms linked to the ports, mines, railways, highways and other projects financed and built by Chinese firms.

Environmentalists have also criticized China, the world’s current largest emitter of greenhouse gases at home, for funding dozens of coal power plants in developing countries—effectively locking those countries into carbon-intensive forms of power for decades to come. In 2023, Chinese-funded power plants overseas spewed about as much carbon pollution as the country of Malaysia, according to the Boston University analysis.

Beijing and its allies have argued that these investments have brought energy access and economic growth to some of the world’s poorest populations, people who have contributed very little to global warming.

Still, the criticisms prompted Xi to pledge in 2021 that China would stop financing and building new coal power plants overseas. The new Boston University analysis says Beijing has so far stuck to that promise in the context of state-funded projects.

China’s shift toward low-carbon overseas investments is strategic, some analysts say. With a slowing domestic economy and a surplus of solar and wind technology, Beijing is seeking new markets abroad to absorb its renewable energy exports.

“They need to export, they don’t have any choice,” said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief economist for the Asia Pacific at the investment bank Natixis. “It is basically an economic argument.”

Morro attributes Beijing’s overall decrease in spending on investments abroad, compared to earlier Belt and Road Initiative levels, to the country’s faltering domestic economy. Following shocks from the COVID-19 pandemic, China has been grappling with a real estate crisis, widespread youth unemployment and high local government debt.

Even so, there are signs that Beijing may increase its overseas wind and solar investments, according to Morro. He pointed to China’s $51 billion commitment, made in 2024 during a China-Africa forum, to support African development and build 30 low-carbon energy projects over the next three years.

And while Chinese state finance agencies have reduced overseas spending in recent years, data released by the Chinese government shows that private companies and other state-owned corporations have picked up the slack, with record levels of new investments and construction contracts last year. That spending has also begun to trend more toward renewable energy and appears to have largely hewed to Xi’s no-coal mandate, too.

China has sought to position itself as a global leader on climate change, with Xi recently telling other world leaders at a United Nations conference that China has built “the world’s largest and fastest-growing renewable energy system as well as the largest and most complete new energy industrial chain.” He urged other governments to support the free flow of “quality green technologies and products,” especially for developing countries.

U.S. President Donald Trump has taken a starkly different approach to both climate change and foreign relations. Since returning to office in 2025, Trump has ordered the U.S. government to pull out of the Paris Agreement, has emphasized new fossil fuel production and has sharply slashed U.S. foreign aid.

The Trump administration has, however, pursued U.S. investments in critical minerals and infrastructure abroad through the International Development Finance Corp., an agency launched in 2019 under the first Trump administration. The agency was created with bipartisan support by combining portions of the U.S. Agency for International Development and other governmental offices and is largely seen as the U.S. government’s response to the Belt and Road Initiative.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2157975118-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 16:04:52.462210

Internal agency documents show EPA will soon seek to erase emissions limits on power plants

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has drafted a proposal to eliminate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants, arguing U.S. emissions are too minor to impact global climate change. The administration seeks to repeal public health regulations by dismantling past EPA research, including a 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health. That determination underpins most federal climate regulations, and repealing it would erase the agency’s legal authority to regulate pollution from power plants, vehicles, oil and gas infrastructure, and other sources. Companies and investors can closely monitor these developments and stay ahead of regulatory shifts using ESG tools.

New IEA report reveals critical mineral vulnerabilities over the next decade

The IEA’s 2025 Global Critical Minerals Outlook warns that despite stable prices and increased supply, rising concentration of mineral production threatens global energy security. Critical minerals like copper, lithium, and rare earths are increasingly subject to export controls, particularly in China and Indonesia, while investment and exploration momentum has slowed. Investment momentum in critical minerals has weakened, as spending grew by just 5% in 2024, down from an increase of 14% in 2023. Copper faces especially severe supply risks, with a projected 30% deficit by 2035. The report emphasizes the urgent need for diversified, resilient supply chains to support energy transition technologies.

States and environmental groups sue the Trump Administration over EV funding freeze

Sixteen states, the District of Columbia, and more than half a dozen environmental groups are suing the Trump Administration for freezing $2.7 billion in congressionally approved funds meant to build a national EV charging network. The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program (NEVI) program, created by the 2021 infrastructure law, was designed to build a network of EV charging stations along designated Alternative Fuel Corridors. Defunding U.S. EV infrastructure plans widens infrastructure disparities, worsening pollution in the most underserved communities, and greatly slowing climate progress.

What’s Next: Eyes on Hydrogen Startups If you’re working in or following hydrogen technologies, this is a development worth watching.","Hyundai Motor Group is stepping up its game in future mobility and clean energy with the launch of its newest startup accelerator, ZER01NE Fund III. Announced on May 26, 2025, the fund comes with a hefty KRW 125 billion (roughly USD 93 million) backing—aimed at supporting cutting-edge startups that are shaking things up in AI, robotics, cybersecurity, and especially hydrogen energy technologies.

Doubling Down on Hydrogen Innovation

This latest move makes it crystal clear: Hyundai isn’t just dabbling in hydrogen—it’s going all in. The focus includes everything from advanced hydrogen fuel cells to smart solutions for hydrogen production and storage. With the global push for cleaner energy gaining serious momentum, Hyundai’s timing couldn’t be better. It’s answering the call for industrial decarbonization and sustainable infrastructure with serious action, not just talk.

Building on the solid results from its previous funds—ZER01NE Fund I (2018) and Fund II (2022)—this new version is bigger and bolder. The funding has shot up by 150% compared to Fund II, and the number of participating affiliates has grown from seven to ten. Heavy hitters like Hyundai Motor Company, Kia Corporation, Hyundai MOBIS, and Hyundai Rotem are all on board, giving this initiative some serious muscle.

What Technologies Are in the Spotlight?

There’s a lot of exciting stuff in the mix. Hyundai’s got its eye on hydrogen fuel cells and electrolysis-driven hydrogen production paired with renewable energy. But that’s not all—the fund is also targeting startups that are pushing boundaries in AI-powered robotics, especially those combining large language models with simulation-based learning to train intelligent machines.

Rather than just tweaking what’s already out there, Hyundai’s aiming for the big leaps forward—the kind that can transform entire industries and kickstart the future of zero-emission energy and transportation. They see the sweet spot where automation, AI, and hydrogen infrastructure all come together—and they’re betting big on it.

Connected to South Korea’s Bigger Picture

This initiative isn’t happening in a vacuum. It aligns perfectly with South Korea’s national drive toward clean energy leadership, especially under the Digital New Deal. The country’s shooting to grab a 20% share of the global clean energy tech market by 2030, and with Seoul ranking among the top five most innovative cities worldwide and pouring $70 billion a year into R&D, Hyundai’s move feels right on cue.

Past Successes Fuel Confidence

Let’s not forget—Hyundai’s not new to this game. The first two ZER01NE funds pumped around $66 million into over 100 startups, leading to more than 200 joint projects and five IPOs. That’s the kind of track record that builds real confidence. With several Hyundai affiliates getting involved again, these startups aren’t just getting funding—they’re tapping into deep industry knowledge and hands-on experience, which is priceless when you’re trying to bring bold ideas to life.

Big Goals: Jobs, Innovation, and a Greener Future

It’s not just about tech. Hyundai sees serious economic and environmental upside, too. They estimate that initiatives funded by ZER01NE Fund III could generate more than 50,000 new high-tech jobs by 2030. On top of that, there’s a clear focus on circular economy models—like EV battery recycling with POEN and carbon reuse initiatives with LD Carbon—core pillars of South Korea’s transition to a low-carbon economy.

What’s Next: Eyes on Hydrogen Startups

If you’re working in or following hydrogen technologies, this is a development worth watching. By putting both money and mentorship behind some of the most forward-looking startups out there, Hyundai is helping shape what tomorrow’s energy and mobility landscape will look like. The companies backed by Fund III could very well be the ones turning point-of-concept innovations into scaled-up, real-world solutions in the very near future.

Expect ripple effects—especially where hydrogen fuel cells, electrolysis, and sustainable manufacturing practices are concerned. This could represent a major turning point not just for Hyundai, but for the entire energy and transport sectors.

This move, expected to be published after an interagency review, comes amidst concerns that previous regulations were overreaching and could lead to increased energy prices and reliance on foreign energy sources.

An EPA spokesperson said: “As part of this reconsideration, EPA is developing a proposed rule.”

The draft plan, initially reported by the New York Times, suggests that the EPA does not view emissions from power plants as significantly contributing to pollution or climate change due to their small and declining share of global emissions.

The proposed regulation also argues that eradicating these emissions would not meaningfully impact public health and welfare.

Shanghai Nio Automobile Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Nio Holding Co., Ltd., updated on Monday its business registration to include battery production, battery sales, and the manufacturing of battery components.

According to corporate data provider Tianyancha, the entity was founded in May 2015 and lists Nio co-founder and President Qin Lihong as its legal representative.

Nio was founded by Qin Lihong and William Li in November 2014.

The move follows reports in early April that Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL), Nio’s key supplier, was “in talks to acquire a controlling stake” in Nio’s battery services arm, Nio Power — Reuters reported.

“Nio and CATL will deepen collaboration on capital and business and further consolidate the strategic partnership to jointly build the largest battery swapping network globally,” the EV maker said in a statement to Reuters on April 7.

Three weeks earlier, Nio said CATL had committed to invest up to 2.5 billion yuan ($347 million) in Nio Power to co-develop battery swap infrastructure across China, further cementing the alliance.

Decades later, Vistra bought its Illinois coal plants betting they could still profit from selling their electricity.
Executives at Southern and the TVA are already backing off plans to retire coal plants or extending previously announced closure dates.
It is unclear whether the Illinois coal plant owners will follow suit.
During Trump's first term in office, 79 coal plants closed and 13,000 industry workers lost their jobs.","For nearly four decades, owners of the Baldwin power plant in southern Illinois managed to avoid the most stringent requirements of the federal Clean Air Act.

The gargantuan coal burner, built during the early to mid-1970s, became the nation's largest source of sulfur dioxide, which creates acid rain and lung-damaging soot. It was also among the top emitters of climate-changing carbon dioxide, smog-forming nitrogen oxide and brain-damaging mercury.

After Baldwin's owners kept the Randolph County plant running for years while skipping the installation of modern pollution controls, a 2005 legal settlement with the U.S. Justice Department forced them to begin reducing noxious emissions that contribute to dirty air in Chicago, and other downwind cities as far away as New York.

Yet the coal plant remains one of the biggest polluters in the Midwest.

By 2020, competition from cleaner, less-expensive energy sources prompted the current owner, Houston-based Vistra Corp., to announce it would close Baldwin this year, and retire the rest of its Illinois coal fleet by 2027.

Now Vistra is hedging its decisions.

In November, the company said it would keep Baldwin running until 2027. Then last month, in an attempt to revive the nation's dwindling coal industry, President Donald Trump threw a lifeline to Vistra and a few dozen other energy companies, encouraging them to apply for exemptions from the latest federal limits on soot, mercury and other toxic air pollution.

Vistra took Trump up on his offer, getting at least a two-year break from tougher regulations at Baldwin and six of its other coal plants: Kincaid south of Springfield, Newton in Jasper County, three in Texas and one in Ohio.

Howard Learner, president and CEO of the nonprofit Environmental Law and Policy Center, noted that regulators during the 1970s exempted dozens of coal plants like Baldwin from the toughest provisions of the Clean Air Act after utilities said they wouldn't be running much longer. Decades later, Vistra bought its Illinois coal plants betting they could still profit from selling their electricity.

""Like others before them, they're kicking the can down the road to keep running Baldwin and these other plants as long as they can,"" Learner said. ""People in Illinois and other Great Lakes states shouldn't have to suffer the pollution consequences just because President Trump gave them a 'get-out-of-jail-free' card.""

Others benefiting from Trump's exemptions include NRG's Powerton coal plant near Pekin in Tazewell County, scheduled to close in 2028, and several owned by Southern Company and the Tennessee Valley Authority, two of the biggest energy companies in the Southeast.

Executives at Southern and the TVA are already backing off plans to retire coal plants or extending previously announced closure dates. They have told shareholders they are motivated by opportunities to cash in on a projected need for more electricity to power data centers.

It is unclear whether the Illinois coal plant owners will follow suit. Vistra and NRG told the Chicago Tribune they plan to adhere to previously announced retirement dates.

""But they have an escape hatch that goes all the way up to the president,"" said John Walke, a senior clean air attorney at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council. ""In our view, President Trump is breaking the law by abusing his authority, which appears to be designed to bide time while his administration attempts to roll back the regulations altogether.""

All told, the 69 coal plants Trump exempted from the Mercury and Air Toxics Rule emitted 2,650 pounds of mercury into the atmosphere in 2023, the last year for which federal records are available. The plants accounted for about 10% of all industrial mercury emissions during the period.

Just a teaspoon of the toxic metal can contaminate a 20-acre lake. If certain types of fish are a large part of a mother's diet, studies have found, mercury passed to her baby in the womb can irreversibly damage the developing brain.

The exempted coal plants also are responsible for nearly half of sulfur dioxide emissions and about a third of nitrogen oxide pollution from the nation's electricity generators, according to federal records.

Under regulations from former President Joe Biden's administration, now targeted by Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress, the power plants are required to improve the performance of mercury-reducing equipment, and in some cases upgrade filters that screen soot from billowing out of smokestacks. The more stringent standards effectively limit emissions of other toxins, including benzene, lead and arsenic.

For the first time, coal plant owners must install equipment to constantly measure mercury emissions, similar to what they already do for carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated last year the regulations will provide up to $3 billion in health benefits by 2037, while costing industry up to $330 million.

Republican attempts to roll back the mercury rule and dozens of other environmental regulations come as lower prices for natural gas have prompted many investor-owned companies to abandon coal. Prices for renewable energy have dropped so dramatically that it now costs 45% less to build a new wind farm than operating a coal plant with the same capacity, according to the investment firm Lazard.

During Trump's first term in office, 79 coal plants closed and 13,000 industry workers lost their jobs. Last year coal plants generated just 15% of the nation's electricity, the Energy Information Administration reported, down from nearly half in 2011.

Despite economic realities, Trump touts coal as a linchpin of his second-term policies.

""We're bringing back an industry that was abandoned despite the fact that it was the best, certainly the best in terms of power, real power,"" Trump said last month while flanked by coal miners and corporate executives wearing hard hats at the White House.

Though he has said it should be up to states to protect the environment, Trump ordered the Justice Department to target clean energy laws enacted by Illinois and several other states.

""American energy dominance is threatened when state and local governments seek to regulate energy beyond their constitutional or statutory authorities,"" Trump said in his missive.

If the Illinois Climate and Equitable Jobs Act survives Trump's promised legal challenge, the coal plants owned by Vistra and NRG would need to shut down by 2030 at the latest.

Pritzker, a prominent Trump critic, has vowed the president's actions won't survive court challenges.

Asked for comment, a Pritzker spokesman directed the Tribune to the governor's interview last month with David Roberts, a clean-energy podcaster.

""We're continuing to make progress even now, even with the headwinds that the federal government is putting in our way,"" Pritzker told Roberts. ""And let's face it, all of what they're doing is irrational. It truly makes no sense. We're creating jobs, we're growing our economy, in part, based on our focus on climate.""

With the Trump Clean Air Act exemptions, Vistra and NRG would still be able to sell electricity from their coal burners for a few more years without spending more money on pollution controls or improving those already in place. It is also possible they could lobby the Illinois General Assembly to extend the 2030 deadline, a common tactic in Springfield.

The result would be more toxic emissions and climate-changing pollution endangering everyone on the planet.

​​ForeFront Power complete 1 MW solar carport at Fullerton College

Fullerton College in California has installed a new 1 MWdc solar canopy system on the campus. Developed in partnership with ForeFront Power, the solar parking canopy array, located in Student Parking Lot 5 adjacent to Sherbeck Field, is projected to save the college nearly $6 million in energy costs over the next 20 years. The solar carport system will generate 1.8 million kWh of renewable energy. This energy output will offset roughly 19% of the College’s electrical consumption.

“After over a century of being in operation, Fullerton College is moving into the future by implementing clean energy solutions that will allow us to reliably produce clean energy, reduce harmful emissions, and reinvest energy savings into student success,” said Dr. Cynthia Olivo, president of Fullerton College. “What better time than during Earth Week to reaffirm our responsibility to the planet and future generations.”

Cool factor: This is a pilot solar project for North Orange County Community College District to help demonstrate how solar can benefit other campuses in the district. The project is the culmination of an initial Solar Feasibility Study completed in 2021, which helped the College identify the project site, as well as implement the College’s 2023-2026 Campus Sustainability Plan, which approved the development of the project through a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with ForeFront Power.

The PPA with ForeFront Power enabled Fullerton College to develop its project at no upfront cost and without using bond funds. Under the terms of the PPA, ForeFront Power develops, owns, and maintains the solar energy portfolio and charges the College a fixed, lower rate than the utility for electricity, locked in for the 20-year duration of the agreement. ForeFront Power will continue to operate and maintain the system at no cost to the college.

A kind of hybrid, e-Power comes equipped with both an electric motor and gasoline engine, much like the Toyota Motor Corp. Prius. It’s different from a Prius in that it doesn’t switch back and forth between the motor and engine during the drive.

That means the car always is running on its EV battery, ensuring a quiet, smooth ride.

“Nissan has a proud history of pioneering innovative technology that set us apart,” Chief Technology Officer Eiichi Akashi told reporters on the sidelines of a test drive at its Grandrive course outside Tokyo.

The advantage of e-Power vehicles is that they never need to be charged like EVs do. The owner just fuels up at a gas station and the car never runs out of a charge.

Nissan Motor Corp., which racked up a $4.5 billion loss for the fiscal year through March, sorely needs a hot-seller, especially in the lucrative North American market. But the U.S. market is proving a big headache for all the Japanese automakers because of President Donald Trump’s tariff policies.

To achieve a turnaround, Nissan is working on reducing costs, strengthening business partnerships and redefining its lineup. That's where e-Power fits in, according to Akashi.

Yokohama-based Nissan announced earlier this month that it’s slashing about 15% of its global work force, or about 20,000 employees, and reducing the number of its auto plants to 10 from 17, under an ambitious recovery plan led by its new Chief Executive Ivan Espinosa.

Nissan officials did not give a price for the upcoming e-Power models. The only other automaker offers a similar technology is “kei,” or tiny car manufacturer Suzuki Motor Corp.

E-Power is already offered on the Nissan Qashqai and X-Trail model in Europe, and the Note in Japan. The upgraded version will be offered in the new Rogue in the U.S.

Nissan, a pioneer in EVs with its Leaf, which went on sale in 2010, is also preparing beefed up EV models. It's also working on a solid-state battery which is expected to replace the lithium-ion batteries now widely used in hybrids, EVs and e-Power models.

Analysts say Nissan is in danger of running out of cash and needs a partner. Speculation is rife its Yokohama headquarters building will get sold, or one of its Japan plants will be turned into a casino.

Nissan started talks last year with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co. for a business integration but announced in February that it was dropping the talks.

On Friday, President Trump signed a sweeping set of executive orders aimed at accelerating the deployment of nuclear energy as AI data centers demand massive energy loads.

Trump signed four executive orders targeting the nuclear industry, including one directive for “total and complete reform” of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

Under the new mandate, the NRC must issue reactor license decisions within 18 months.

Nuclear industry executives joined Trump in the Oval Office for the signing, including Constellation Energy CEO Joe Dominguez.

Constellation Energy operates the largest fleet of nuclear power plants in the U.S. and recently inked a 20-year deal with Microsoft to restart Three Mile Island.

“We're wasting too much time on permitting and we're answering silly questions — not the important ones,” Dominguez said.

The revival of Three Mile Island is especially symbolic. It’s the site of America’s worst nuclear accident in 1979. It also became a turning point in regulatory overreach, many in the industry argue.

On Friday, U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgman didn’t hold back.

“This is a huge day for the nuclear industry. Mark this day on your calendar,” he said. “This is going to turn the clock back 50 years on over-regulation of this industry.”

Trump himself called nuclear “a hot industry, a brilliant industry” but emphasized that “you have to do it right.” He described modern nuclear tech as safe, clean, and essential to American leadership.

“This will make us the real power in this industry, which is a big industry,” he said.

After the news broke, Nano Nuclear Energy (NNE) soared 30.07%. Oklo (OKLO), which went public earlier this year via a SPAC linked to OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman, jumped 23.04%. NuScale Power Corp. rallied 19.43%.

Shares of Constellation (CEG) gained just over 2% because it’s a more mature company that has less direct leverage to new SMR projects.

This is not just about SMRs

The Trump administration’s nuclear push is largely a response to Silicon Valley’s pursuit of cheap energy.

With artificial intelligence development exploding across the board, tech companies are hunting for power sources that are clean, stable, and cost-efficient.

Former Oklo board member Chris Wright, now serving as U.S. Secretary of Energy, has called the AI race “the next Manhattan Project,” invoking the top-secret effort that gave the world its first atomic bomb.

“We led post-World War II in all things nuclear, but then we’ve been stagnated,” Burgman said. “We choked it with overregulation.”

Even Trump, who once voiced concerns on the Joe Rogan Experience about nuclear being “too big and too complex and too expensive,” now appears to be all in.

“There’s a little danger to nuclear... we had some really bad nuclear,” he said back in October.

But on Friday, he changed his tone entirely.

While most headlines focused on small modular reactors (SMRs), Trump made clear that the administration is also embracing legacy nuclear projects.

“We’re also talking about the big plants, the very, very big, the biggest,” he said. “We’re going to be doing them also.”

With the NRC’s licensing process now under a political microscope, and bipartisan support growing for grid-scale energy reform, the U.S. nuclear revival might finally be more than just a talking point.

And for SMR developers, legacy plant operators, and power-hungry tech giants alike, the opportunity is enormous.",https://media.investorsobserver.com/images/750w/2025/02/nuclear-energy.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 14:09:56.154286

The Government Accountability Office (GAO), a nonpartisan, independent agency, issued a non-binding legal decision on Thursday stating that the Department of Transportation (DOT) violated the Impoundment Control Act (ICA) by pausing new obligations to the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) grant program.

READ: Democratic Data: Diverse Voters Key To Harris 2024 Loss, Trump Captures “Obama Coalition”

Vought took to X, to denounce the GAO, stating, “Just so we are all clear over the next several months. The Government Accountability Office or GAO is a quasi-independent arm of the legislative branch that played a partisan role in the first-term impeachment hoax. They are going to call everything an impoundment because they want to grind our work to manage taxpayer dollars effectively to a halt.”

The dispute centers on the Trump DOT’s announcement in February to halt new funding for the $5 billion NEVI program. The program, established under President Biden’s 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, was intended to foster the nationwide deployment of EV charging infrastructure. The Trump administration justified the pause by citing a need to review the program’s “inefficient guidance and failed performance.”

Current Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy had previously highlighted implementation issues, alleging in February that states like California had spent a minuscule portion – just 1% – of their allocated funds. The program’s slow rollout under former Biden Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has been a point of criticism, with a majority of funding remaining unobligated.

In its ruling, the GAO concluded that the administration’s actions constituted an illegal impoundment. “DOT is not authorized to withhold these funds from expenditure and DOT must continue to carry out the statutory requirements of the program,” the GAO wrote. The agency suggested that if the DOT wished to alter the program, it “could propose funds for rescission or otherwise propose legislation to make changes to the NEVI Formula Program for consideration by Congress.”

The GAO, led by Obama appointee Gene Dodaro, has reportedly initiated numerous investigations into the Trump administration’s handling of congressionally appropriated funds. Dodaro informed senators in April that at least 39 such investigations are currently underway.

Vought, however, downplayed the significance of the GAO’s findings. “These are non-events with no consequence,” he stated. “Rearview mirror stuff.”

This is not the first instance of the GAO finding fault with a Trump administration’s fiscal actions. In 2020, the GAO determined that the administration illegally withheld military aid to Ukraine, a finding that featured in President Trump’s first impeachment proceedings.

The GAO itself has recently faced criticism from Republicans.

Last week, Senate Majority Leader John Thune accused the watchdog of “improperly intervening to protect Biden-era rules” after it determined that Biden administration waivers allowing California to ban new gas-powered car sales by 2035 were not eligible for review under the Congressional Review Act.

A GAO spokesperson defended the agency’s work in a statement, asserting, “GAO’s Impoundment Control Act (ICA) decision does not take a position on the policy goals of electric vehicle charging infrastructure program. Our legal decisions only examine the procedural issues and compliance with the law.” The spokesperson emphasized the GAO’s mission “to provide non-partisan, fact-based information to Congress… We stand behind the quality of our work.”

A Breakthrough in Battery Chemistry

The battery, developed under the guidance of Prof. Premkumar Senguttuvan and Ph.D. scholar Biplab Patra, leverages a NASICON-type structure and a uniquely engineered anode:

Na₁.₀V₀.₂₅Al₀.₂₅Nb₁.₅(PO₄)₃

Key innovations include:

Nanosizing particles to reduce ion travel distance

Carbon coating for enhanced conductivity

Aluminium substitution for improved electrochemical stability

These refinements allow the battery to charge up to 80% in just six minutes and deliver over 3,000 charge-discharge cycles—with over 80% capacity retention.

Why It Matters for India

India largely depends on imported lithium for battery manufacturing, making the country vulnerable to geopolitical risks and supply chain volatility. Sodium, on the other hand, is abundantly available in India, making this discovery crucial to the Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) initiative.

This sodium-based battery technology offers a cheaper, safer, and scalable alternative to lithium-ion batteries—especially suited for:

EVs and electric 2-wheelers

Solar grid energy storage

Emergency backup systems

Rural clean energy projects

High-temperature environments (thanks to its thermal stability)

Rigorously Tested and Ready for Scaling

The prototype has already undergone electrochemical validation and quantum-level simulations, showing strong promise for safety, efficiency, and longevity. Although commercial deployment will take time, the innovation has already captured attention in scientific and policy circles.

As the global lithium market remains uncertain—with China, Chile, and Australia dominating the supply—India’s sodium-ion alternative positions the country to become a technology leader in next-gen battery innovation.

Looking Ahead

Housed under the Department of Science and Technology (DST), the JNCASR’s advancement not only boosts indigenous R&D but also strengthens India’s role in the global clean tech movement. If commercialized at scale, this battery could power India’s journey towards a sustainable, electrified, and self-reliant future—free from critical mineral dependency.",https://trak.in/stories/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-26-at-8.05.09 AM.png,N,,2025-05-26 10:11:14.390483

At this critical juncture of global energy transition, the solar industry, as a cornerstone of renewable energy, serves as a pivotal solution to combat climate change and achieve carbon neutrality goals. Amid rapid industry growth, leading enterprises have jointly launched this initiative to address social and environmental challenges and advance sustainable development. Committed to delivering clean energy globally, the Initiative aims to strengthen sustainability across the entire value chain — promoting green mineral sourcing from the source, protecting ecosystems and biodiversity, building an equitable society for common good, and driving inclusive growth.

Aligned with the UNGC Ten Principles and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Initiative outlines 9 actionable pathways across three pillars, advancing ESG progress across the solar value chain and promoting its positive impact on the international market.

The GSSA initiative has garnered strong endorsement from the UNGC. Meng Liu, UNGC China Representative, stated: ""We commend the global solar industry, particularly Chinese photovoltaic enterprises, for their contributions to advancing the global energy transition, and we welcome the launch of this initiative. Closely aligned with the principles of the United Nations Global Compact, the Initiative underscores corporate responsibilities in environmental protection, human rights safeguards, and sound governance. We look forward to the solar industry setting an exemplary model for global sustainable development through collective action.""

Jing Li, Vice President of Branding and Sustainability Officer of JA Solar, officially launched this GSSA Initiative at the event, and introduced JA Solar's newly constructed responsible supply chain strategy with the theme of ""Together Towards Tomorrow"", which aims to promote the multi-stakeholders along the industry's value chain to evolve towards a sustainable future.

UNGC encourages more solar companies and supply chain partners to join this initiative and jointly advance the sustainable development of the industry. To truly fulfill the summit's vision of 'Better Business, Better World: Accelerating the SDGs', the first co-signatories pledge to collaboratively develop a concrete action roadmap with stakeholder engagement, to ensure effective implementation of the Initiative.

Appendix : Global Solar Sustainable Alliance (GSSA)

As the backbone of renewable energy, the global solar sector provides consumers, industries, and society with affordable and reliable clean energy. It has made remarkable contributions to advancing global energy transition and promoting sustainable development, with immense potential yet to be realized.

On the other hand, after decades of growth, the social and environmental footprints of the solar industry, particularly the associated risks across its supply chain—have increasingly emerged. These challenges pose significant obstacles to unleashing the industry's full potential and achieving its own sustainable development.

In light of this, we, as the undersigned photovoltaic enterprises and supply chain participants, guided by the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), hereby launch the Global Solar Sustainable Alliance (GSSA). We call on all companies in the industry and its supply chains to adopt sustainability principles and strategies, and actively undertake the following actions:

I. Just Transition: Safeguarding the green ecosystems and environment

a) Reduce pollution, conserve resources, improve environmental management, implement clean production, and promote a circular economy.

b) Cut energy consumption and carbon emissions, adapt to climate change, establish science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets, and achieve net-zero emissions as soon as possible.

c) Protect biodiversity and ecosystems, promoting green mining from origins of materials, ensuring zero deforestation and no net loss of biodiversity.

II. People-Centric Development: Building an Equitable Society for Common Good

a) Respect and protect workers' fundamental rights, create gender-responsive, diverse, inclusive, safe, and healthy workplaces, and enhance employees' skills and development potential.

b) Advance responsible procurement and marketing practices, implement human rights due diligence in supply chains, improve value chain transparency, traceability, and collaborative mechanisms, and strengthen supply chain resilience.

c) Plan PV projects in alignment with local conditions, respect the rights of communities and residents, and leverage industry expertise to support community and social development.

III. Governance Enhancement: Driving Inclusive Growth

a) Optimize corporate governance structures, enhance professionalism and diversity in governance mechanisms, improve investor relations management, and protect the rights of minority shareholders.

b) Operate with integrity and compliance, oppose all forms of unfair competition practices, proactively uphold a sound market order, and foster the healthy development of the industry.

c) Strengthen internal and external oversight systems, conduct standardized information disclosure and regular tracking of progress and targets, and establish multi-channel stakeholder engagement and dialogue mechanisms.

Building on the above consensus, we will pool wisdom and resources, engage in full collaboration, and establish a concrete action roadmap with the participation and support of multi-stakeholders to ensure the effective implementation of the GSSA Initiative.

Cleantech manufacturing is booming worldwide, with significant expansions in capacity and investment in recent years.","Investments in cleantech manufacturing have soared worldwide, with these technologies set to play a pivotal role in the world’s global push toward decarbonization, energy security, and economic development. Manufacturing capacities of key energy transition technologies are also expanding rapidly. The manufacturing capacity of solar PV alone has risen more than tenfold in the past decade to five gigawatts in 2024. With China currently dominating the market by far, other regions are now trying to bridge the gap and boost their domestic capacities.

Investments in cleantech manufacturing

In 2024, global investment in cleantech factories totaled 112 billion U.S. dollars. Although this was a year-on-year decline of 14 percent, global annual investments in factory facilities for clean technologies, including solar, batteries, wind turbines, and hydrogen electrolyzers, have risen roughly tenfold since 2018. In 2024, three-quarters of this investment went toward manufacturing facilities in mainland China, a slight drop from the country’s record investment share of almost 90 percent the previous year.

China dominates clean tech manufacturing

A combination of governmental action, increased investment , and a focus on research and development has seen China rise to become the undisputed leader in cleantech manufacturing. As of 2024, “the world’s factory” dominated the supply chains of the main energy transition minerals, such as gallium, graphite, and silicon, as well as the production capacity of most key clean technologies and their components. This was particularly the case within the solar power segment, with China accounting for more than 90 percent of the global PV wafer and polysilicon manufacturing capacity that year and around 80 percent of PV cells and module capacity. The manufacturing powerhouse also controls the majority of the world’s production capacity for lithium-ion battery cells, a key technology for electric vehicles. A big contributor to China’s dominance in the cleantech sector is its low production costs. For example, it is roughly 30 percent cheaper to manufacture electrolyzers in China when compared to the U.S. and 41 percent cheaper to manufacture batteries.

The cleantech race

With China currently dominating manufacturing capacities, the United States and Europe are now playing catch up in the cleantech race. To become more competitive in the global market and less dependent on China, the U.S. has implemented a range of policies and measures in recent years to scale up domestic manufacturing. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), for example, has spurred a boom in cleantech manufacturing facility announcements since it was passed into law in August 2022. Meanwhile, the European Union has set the target for the manufacturing capacity of strategic net-zero technologies to meet at least 40 percent of the region’s annual deployment needs by 2030 under the Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA) and increase its share of global production to 15 percent by 2040. Nevertheless, China is poised to remain the dominant force in cleantech manufacturing over the coming years, and to continue attracting the most investment for cleantech factories.

Under the waiver given to California, states are allowed to choose whether they will follow the federal standards for emissions, or California’s.
Known as Advanced Clean Cars II and Advanced Clean Trucks, these rules within DEM would have phased out gas-powered cars in Rhode Island by 2035.
It’s not the first time a multistate strategy for tackling vehicle emissions has failed in recent years.
That loss of funding is almost certainly felt in Rhode Island today, especially as the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, the state’s only transit network, faces a $32 million deficit.","PROVIDENCE — Rhode Island’s electric vehicle transition may have been given a near death blow last week, after the U.S. Senate voted, 51-44, to rescind a waiver that allows states to have more control over their emissions standards.

Specifically, Congress has voted to rescind the waiver given to the state of California under the Clean Air Act that banned the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, as well as two additional mandates on zero-emission trucks, and stricter emissions standards for new diesel trucks in the Golden State.

Why does a waiver in California impact what happens in Rhode Island? Under the waiver given to California, states are allowed to choose whether they will follow the federal standards for emissions, or California’s. Rescinding the waiver given to California means the states aren’t allowed to push for greater zero-emission vehicles in their own jurisdictions.

State policymakers in recent years have passed a number of agency rules within the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management that had the state following the California standards. Known as Advanced Clean Cars II and Advanced Clean Trucks, these rules within DEM would have phased out gas-powered cars in Rhode Island by 2035.

Buying a gas-powered car on the used car market would have still been allowed, but no new models of such cars would be for sale within the Ocean State.

In a statement emailed to ecoRI News, a DEM spokesperson said the department had been following the issue for weeks and is “deeply disappointed that Congress took this action.”

“In accordance with the RI Act on Climate, we remain committed to developing our Climate Action Strategy, which is due at the end of this year,” said Kim Keough, DEM’s chief of public affairs. “Since transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to a clean electric vehicle fleet remains a critical component of our strategy for that sector.”

The move by Congress potentially leaves Rhode Island without a clear, holistic strategy for tackling transportation emissions. That sector, made up of cars, trucks, buses and other large motor vehicles, accounts for 36.6% of all emissions produced by the Ocean State, the single biggest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions statewide, followed by the buildings and then the electricity sectors.

It’s not the first time a multistate strategy for tackling vehicle emissions has failed in recent years. In 2021, Massachusetts and Connecticut dropped their support for the Transportation & Climate Initiative in the face of soaring gas prices and overall inflation, leaving Rhode Island alone at the altar. The program as proposed required fuel operators to buy carbon allowances for emissions produced by their products, and was expected to raise $3 billion over the next decade for its participating governments.

If implemented in Rhode Island, the program was expected to raise $20 million annually for cleaner transit projects, with at least 35% set aside for communities hit hardest by transportation-related pollution. That loss of funding is almost certainly felt in Rhode Island today, especially as the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, the state’s only transit network, faces a $32 million deficit.

In the meantime, on Friday the U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan climate action coalition made up of 24 governors around the country, announced the launch of a new initiative in the face of Congress rescinding California’s waiver.

Called the Affordable Clean Cars Coalition, 11 of the participating states, including Rhode Island, as well as Massachusetts, New York, and California, have committed to collaborating on how to reduce vehicle emissions, and defend state powers under the federal Clean Air Act.

In a statement to the press, the 11 governors said the federal government had chosen to put polluters over people, and reaffirmed their commitment to reducing emissions.

“We will continue collaborating as states and leveraging our longstanding authority under the Clean Air Act, including through state programs that keep communities safe from pollution, create good-paying jobs, increase consumer choice, and help Americans access cleaner and more affordable cars,” according to the coalition. “As we consider next steps for our clean vehicle programs, our states will engage stakeholders and industry to provide the regulatory certainty needed while redoubling our efforts to build a cleaner and healthier future.”

Congress’ actions have come at a time when electric vehicles were slowly on the rise. According to industry data, there are 5.7 million EVs on roads around the country today, and EV sales account for just under 10% of all vehicles sold in the United States.",http://ecori.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/electric-vehicle.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 11:07:25.229914

The Paris Agreement Crediting Mechanism (PACM) was established under Article 6.4 of the 2015 Paris Agreement to enable countries and organisations to collaborate on emissions reductions through high-integrity carbon credits. The mechanism allows countries to raise climate ambition and implement national action plans more affordably by identifying and encouraging opportunities for verifiable emission reductions, attracting funding to implement them, and enabling cooperation among countries and other groups to conduct and benefit from these activities.

Unlike existing carbon markets, the PACM aims to provide a UN-supervised framework that directly supports national climate commitments and raises global ambition. The mechanism is designed to generate and trade high-integrity carbon credits in support of global climate goals, offering countries and other actors a structured way to work together on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The development comes after years of criticism over the integrity of carbon credit systems, with concerns that many projects have overstated their environmental benefits or failed to deliver genuine emissions reductions. The UN-backed standards are hoped to help boost the integrity of the new market and combat fears over 'greenwashing'.

The new standards represent a decade-long effort to create a robust, internationally recognised carbon trading mechanism that can support global climate goals while avoiding the pitfalls of previous schemes. The establishment of the PACM has been ""a decade in the making"" according to reports, designed to address integrity concerns that have plagued existing carbon credit systems.

The PACM Supervisory Body agreed two key standards that will govern how carbon credit projects measure their actual emissions reduction impact. The rules aim to ensure credits issued under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement are, ""ambitious, real, additional and verifiable.""

The first standard establishes new requirements for measuring baseline emissions, what would have happened without the project. It includes an initial downward adjustment, such as setting baselines 10% below business-as-usual emissions, plus a minimum 1% annual reduction across all approaches. These measures are designed to prevent over-crediting and drive continuous improvement.

The second standard addresses ""leakage"", unintended emissions increase elsewhere due to project activities. It clarifies that forest protection projects must align with host countries' national strategies to qualify for credits.

Martin Hession, Chair of the Supervisory Body, said the agreement ensures ""crediting levels are set consistently with a pathway to net neutrality."" The body also agreed measures for equitable benefit-sharing with host countries and enhanced capacity building support.

However, fewer projects than expected are transitioning from the previous Clean Development Mechanism, creating a short-term funding gap until new PACM projects begin in 2026. The first methodologies are expected for approval by year-end.",https://www.energyconnects.com/media/x3gcbjha/energy-and-climate-policy.jpg?mode=pad&rnd=133440407058470000,N,,2025-05-26 11:07:12.875412

The congress will convene the world’s foremost utility and energy leaders under the theme Innovating for a New Age of Utilities.

The strategic conference at this year’s World Utilities Congress will serve as a key platform for high-level dialogue and international cooperation, addressing the rise in global energy demand and the need for more diversified utility systems.

With electricity demand expected to grow by 3.4% annually until 2026, and the rising importance of the energy-water nexus, utility leaders are being called upon to design systems that are smarter, cleaner, more resilient, and equitable.

With a strong emphasis on transformation, the event is designed to fast-track the shift to a digitally enabled and collaborative global utilities ecosystem.

More than 130 international speakers will participate in over 30 sessions alongside ministers, policymakers, CEOs, and senior decision-makers to define the path toward a low-carbon, tech-driven, and water-secure future.

2025 programe

This edition will spotlight digital transformation, artificial intelligence, smart grid flexibility, and sustainable financing. Global energy leaders will examine critical issues, from deploying AI while managing its energy consumption to unlocking the US$1.5 trillion needed annually for renewable energy via new investment models and enhancing flexibility in an increasingly solar and wind-powered world.

Christopher Hudson, president of dmg events, said, “As utilities evolve to meet rising demand and climate objectives, the World Utilities Congress offers a focused environment for global leaders to assess priorities, share insights, and align on the actions needed to deliver tangible progress. This year’s strategic conference brings a stronger emphasis on practical outcomes, with ministers, CEOs, and technology pioneers gathering to strengthen partnerships and help shape a more connected, efficient, and sustainable future.”

Looking ahead to her global leadership panel on transforming water scarcity into opportunities, Hebah Abbas, chairwoman of the sustainability committee at the Kuwait Water Association, said, “The World Utilities Congress is a unifying force for collaboration, ushering in a new era of regenerative practices and systems innovation. This event gathers visionary leaders and forward-thinkers, where digital, circular, and decentralised solutions converge to redefine energy, water, and utilities. To tackle the systemic challenges in water management, we must forge effective multi-stakeholder partnerships that drive meaningful progress.

“By designing water infrastructure beyond traditional pipes and pumps, we create climate-resilient, inclusive systems that adapt to future shocks. This holistic approach is essential for turning obstacles into opportunities and securing a sustainable future in water management and utilities.”

The 2025 programme will also reexamine water’s crucial role in climate adaptation, the promise of AI in operational optimisation, and how capital reallocation and financial innovation can accelerate investment in grid and clean water infrastructure.

Through these themes, the strategic conference continues to guide the global utilities sector through uncertainty toward a future that is sustainable, inclusive, and interconnected.

While congress is not moving towards a full repeal of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act which Democrats herald as one of the Biden presidency’s signature achievements, the version of the reconciliation bill passed by the House last Wednesday - the One Big Beautiful Bill Act - places some of the heaviest subsidies for intermittent wind and solar generation and electric vehicles clearly in congress’s sights, with a new focus on nuclear power gaining favor.

While that bill severely limits the ability of wind and solar developers to access the investment tax credit for new projects, it simultaneously expands the credit for the builders of new nuclear power facilities. That alone signals a major shift in policy priorities: Taken together with the four executive orders designed to boost nuclear generation signed by President Donald Trump on Friday, the shift becomes a rising sea change.

Out is the Biden era’s focus on conforming U.S. energy and climate policies to the strictures of international agreements ostensibly designed to fight climate change. In is the Trump focus on creating a new era of American dominance in not just energy but also AI technology advancements and leveraging both to facilitate the energy and commerce-base foreign policy doctrine the President laid out in his speech in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia two weeks ago.

What Trump’s Nuclear Executive Orders Do

Energy Secretary Chris Wright signaled the intent of the Trump executive orders in testimony before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development last Wednesday. During an exchange with Tennessee Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, Wright said nuclear is “the critical technology that could scale wildly beyond where it is today, which is just electricity production into huge scale…I am all in with you on advancing nuclear…Nuclear is the [energy source]

that could burst through.”

Trump’s decision in one of Friday’s executive orders to invoke the Defense Production Act declaring a national emergency over America’s heavy reliance on imports of uranium – much of it from Russia – is an extension of his Day 1 declaration of a national energy emergency related to what he views as a dangerously low level of national energy security.

“When President Trump declared a national emergency on his first day in office it was, in large part, because of what we're facing with our electrical grid and making sure that we’ve got enough power to be able to win the AI arms race with China,” Burgum said last week, as first reported by RealClearPolitics. “That is absolutely critical.”

That second of four orders signed by Trump aims to boost domestic production and processing of uranium by prioritizing domestic supply chains and using presidential emergency powers to help streamline the permitting process for qualifying projects. The third order authorizes the secretaries of Defense, Energy, and interior to utilize federally owned lands and laboratories to accelerate research and testing, and to serve as sites for rapid development of both nuclear generation facilities and AI datacenters.

Since its first day in office, the Trump administration has made a top priority of searching for ways the Administration could streamline permitting processes for energy projects without the need for congressional legislation. The leveraging of federal facilities and lands will serve to avoid many of the common factors that tend to delay permitting for energy projects of all kinds.

Examples include fights over landowner rights, rights of way, multi-jurisdictional traffic and noise restrictions, and even some endangered species and archaeological considerations. It is a truly ingenious approach which could have national application given federal ownership of large tracts of land in almost every state.

The fourth Trump order sets an ambitious goal of quadrupling U.S. nuclear capacity from approximately 100 gigawatts to 400 gigawatts by 2050, a target some experts deem unlikely given historical construction timelines and costs. For context, the addition of 300 gigawatts of generating capacity would equate to adding three Texas power grids in just 25 years. This order would promote both traditional large-scale plants and the new generation of modular reactor technology currently being developed, with a goal of incentivizing such development by U.S. companies performed in the U.S.

All of those orders tie in with the first order signed by Trump on Friday. That order seeks to reform the immensely bureaucratic and outdated processes of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a regulatory body established in 1974 and designed to deal with 1970s-era technologies and issues. No domestic revolution in nuclear power can take place without a full modernization of the NRC and its processes, which have made it near-impossible to obtain the permits needed to build new facilities.

To help speed the permitting process, this Trump order requires the NRC approve new reactor licenses within 18 months and existing reactor operations within 12 months. It also mandates the NRC to propose a comprehensive revision in its regulatory structure within 18 months, a very ambitious timeline.

The Bottom Line: A Nuclear Future

From charging electric vehicles to bitcoin mining to AI and its related datacenters popping up all over the nation, the major new power demands on the U.S. grid will be impossible to meet in a regulatory environment in which permitting of new generating facilities under current rules and procedures can take as long as 15 years. The need for those datacenters to have 99.999% uptime means that the preferred rent-seeking client industries of the Biden era – wind and solar – cannot fill the bill.

In April 2025, TVS Motor overtook Ola Electric as the market leader in the electric two-wheeler segment, according to data from the government-run Vahan portal.
So, what brings Ola Electric back to the fundraising table so soon after its massive IPO raise?
Ola Electric may be at risk from this.
Considering Ola Electric’s focus on owning the entire EV stack, this is without a doubt one of the company’s largest obstacles.","With great excitement, Ola Electric Datalabs went public on the stock exchanges in August 2024, raising over INR 5,500 Cr to fund future expansion and the development of its entire electric vehicle stack. A few days later, Bhavish Aggarwal presented Ola Electric’s ambitious intentions, laced with some dubious allegations. This is significant because of what we shall see subsequently.

However, Ola Electric is now thinking about raising additional money not even a year after that IPO in an attempt to get back on track following months of sluggish growth, growing regulatory scrutiny over sales claims, and a significant decline in the stock price. Additionally, the company run by Bhavish Aggarwal has lost its leading position in the EV market.

In April 2025, TVS Motor overtook Ola Electric as the market leader in the electric two-wheeler segment, according to data from the government-run Vahan portal. With a market share of 21.46%, the Bengaluru-based business registered 19,709 automobiles last month, a 42% decrease from the previous year.

The second rise in ten months for Ola Electric

The present plans to raise INR 1,700 Cr in one or more tranches through non-convertible debentures (NCDs) and other acceptable debt securities have been authorised by Ola Electric’s board. Other specifics, such as the intended use of the profits, were not disclosed, though.

So, what brings Ola Electric back to the fundraising table so soon after its massive IPO raise?

It’s unclear what the answer is. According to ratings agency ICRA, Ola Electric has not even used all of the money from their initial public offering (IPO) as of March 2025.

For one, the company earned around INR 54 Cr in interest income in ten months, with over half of the INR 5,500 Cr obtained in the IPO remaining in bank accounts and fixed deposits.

Specifically, INR 1,200 Cr of the amount raised was to be used to increase Ola Electric’s battery cell production plant’s capacity from the 1.4GWh test capacity to 5GWh by February 2025. By April 2025, the company promised to further expand capacity to 6.4GWh.

The start of commercial production is delayed, according to ICRA. “Risks of timely execution of subsequent expansion phases, demand/offtake, supply chain, and technology obsolescence” still affect the project.

Ola Electric may be at risk from this. By the end of 2026, the company must raise its operational capacity to 20GWh under the production-linked incentive system for cell manufacturing. It might forfeit its portion of the INR 18,000 Cr PLI scheme if this doesn’t happen.

In addition, Bhavish Aggarwal made lofty statements in August of last year, just after the IPO, including the goal of constructing the largest 100 GWh gigafactory in the world in India. The business has had difficulty approaching even 5% of this figure thus far. Considering Ola Electric’s focus on owning the entire EV stack, this is without a doubt one of the company’s largest obstacles.

Since Ola Electric’s plans to boost its profit per unit sold depend on its in-house cells and batteries, scaling up cell and battery manufacturing is essential.

In light of all of this, ICRA reduced Ola Electric’s credit rating for short-term loans and bank guarantees from A (NEGATIVE) to BBB+ (NEGATIVE), which does raise investor risk, even for NCDs.",https://www.evmechanica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ola-Electric-Initiates-Another-Round-of-Fundraising.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 10:11:20.700038

The extreme climate conditions caused by climate change such as droughts and flooding will not exempt American people from their devastation, nor will environmental pollution.
To address common challenges such as climate change and ecological destruction, joint endeavors of all countries are important.
That explains why China has proposed the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative.","The House of Representatives of the United States passed a bill last week, which advanced a sweeping spending package that would roll back Biden-era tax credits for renewable energy projects. They include an early phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles, moving up the timeline to end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants as well as requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028.

At the same time, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced on Saturday that it is working on a proposal to remove all existing restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from coal- and gas-fired power plants in the country.

The EPA was reported as arguing in its proposed regulation that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from power plants that burn fossil fuels ""do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution"" or to climate change because they are a small and declining share of global emissions.

It should be no surprise for the world what the Donald Trump administration will do on climate change since he signed an executive order for the US' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on his first day in the White House on Jan 20, as he did during his first term.

""It is the policy of my administration to put the interests of the United States and the American people first in the development and negotiation of any international agreements with the potential to damage or stifle the American economy,"" said Trump's day-one executive order on global environmental deals.

As part of Trump's first day orders, the US also halted all financial contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, leaving the UN climate body with a 22 percent shortfall in its core budget. In 2024, US contributions totaled $13.3 million.

Washington has not only turned a blind eye to the international obligations it has because of the huge amount of CO2 it has contributed during its industrial development, it has now also started to encourage the use of coal and gas in generating electricity by scrapping the limits on gas emissions from such plants.

Furthermore, it is trying to make things hard for renewable energy power plants, and even starts to add annual federal registration fees for EV and hybrid car owners. The fee will be $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids.

As one of the largest contributors of green house gas emissions and definitely the largest on a per capita basis, the US' withdrawal of its financial aid to emissions cutting projects will greatly compromise global climate actions. What the US government has done to roll back clean energy projects and encourage the use of fossil fuel in power generation represents a huge disservice to what the world has achieved in its fight against climate change.

""Interest of the US and American people first"" has become a pretext for the Trump administration to shirk its due international responsibility as the world's sole superpower. With ""make America great again"" as the guide for its policymaking, Trump's US has become an irresponsible superpower without a smattering of vision about the future of humanity.

Without making its due contribution to the global fight against climate change and to global endeavors to address other common challenges facing humanity, how can the Trump administration put the interests of the US and American people first?

The extreme climate conditions caused by climate change such as droughts and flooding will not exempt American people from their devastation, nor will environmental pollution.

To address common challenges such as climate change and ecological destruction, joint endeavors of all countries are important. This is common sense.

That explains why China has proposed the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative. China has also proposed the building of a community with a shared future for humanity, which is meant to mobilize global resources for addressing common challenges in order to make human development sustainable.

""Without sufficient home and public EV charging, we risk straining the grid and stalling progress.""","To meet rising EV adoption and future energy demands, the City of Frisco is calling for a rapid expansion of EV charging infrastructure. These initiatives aim to future-proof Frisco's transportation network, support clean energy goals, and ensure reliable charging access for all residents--positioning the city as a regional leader in smart energy infrastructure.

As electric vehicle (EV) ownership surges and North Texas faces increasingly extreme weather conditions, the City of Frisco is officially calling for a city-wide energy infrastructure expansion. City leaders are urging public and private stakeholders to accelerate the deployment of home EV charging systems and backup power solutions, such as Generac generators, to protect homes, businesses, and critical services.

This initiative comes amid warnings that Frisco's current grid infrastructure is not prepared to handle projected energy demand, fueled by explosive population growth, rising EV adoption, and weather-related blackouts.

EV Charging: A Rapidly Growing Need

Frisco is experiencing one of the highest EV adoption rates in the state. However, the city lacks a coordinated plan to ensure every resident has convenient access to home and public charging infrastructure. With over 15,000 EVs now registered in Collin County and that number expected to triple by 2030, city officials say proactive planning is critical.

""Our residents want to embrace clean transportation, but they need the infrastructure to do it,"" said a Frisco Energy Task Force representative. ""Without sufficient home and public EV charging, we risk straining the grid and stalling progress.""

The city is encouraging:

Residential Installation of Level 2 EV Chargers

As EV adoption accelerates in Frisco, access to Level 2 residential chargers is becoming essential for daily convenience and grid efficiency. Level 2 chargers (240V) offer significantly faster charging than standard outlets, providing 25-40 miles of range per hour and enabling overnight full charges.

The City of Frisco encourages:

New construction mandates requiring EV charger-ready wiring in all single-family and multi-family developments

HOA policy revisions that prevent unreasonable restrictions on EV charger installation in townhomes and condos

Public-private partnerships with local electricians, such as ABR Electric, to offer installation packages that include permitting, code compliance, and homeowner training

Low-income support programs to help make residential EV charging more accessible to all residents

Incentives and Rebates for Homeowners and Developers

To promote faster adoption, the city is proposing a localized EV Charging Incentive Program to complement federal tax credits and utility rebates.

Proposed elements include:

Rebate vouchers of up to $1,000 for homeowners who install a Level 2 charger with a licensed contractor

Permit fee waivers for EV charger installations within city limits

Green building certification incentives for developers that pre-wire garages and parking spaces for future EV charging

Partnerships with local dealerships to bundle charger installations into EV purchases

Coordination with CoServ and Oncor to align residential incentives with regional grid needs and peak-load planning

Strategic Placement of Public Charging Stations

Public charging availability plays a key role in both equity and convenience, especially for apartment residents, renters, or commuters without private garages.

Frisco's proposed charging expansion plan recommends:

Installation of Level 2 and DC Fast Chargers at high-traffic public locations including:

City parks and recreation centers

Public libraries and civic buildings

Downtown parking areas and entertainment districts

School campuses, universities, and park-and-ride locations

Partnering with major retailers, malls, and grocery chains for semi-public charger hubs

Integrating chargers into future zoning and transportation planning for mixed-use developments

Deploying solar-powered charging stations in city parks to align with clean energy goals

Permitting Reform to Accelerate Charger Deployment

One of the primary bottlenecks in EV infrastructure development is the time and complexity of securing permits. The City of Frisco is actively exploring reforms to streamline this process for both homeowners and contractors.

Key initiatives under consideration include:

A ""Fast Track"" permit process for residential Level 2 EV charger installations under 80 amps

Pre-approved installation guidelines for electricians to speed up approval times

Same-day virtual inspections for simple installations to reduce wait times

An online portal allowing homeowners and contractors to apply, pay fees, and schedule inspections in one place

Backup Power: A Lifeline During Texas Weather Extremes

With Texas increasingly prone to extreme weather--like ice storms, tornadoes, and summer grid overloads--Frisco leaders are emphasizing the importance of automatic standby generators for residential and commercial properties.

""Backup power is no longer optional in Texas,"" said a spokesperson from ABR Electric, a Frisco-based licensed electrical contractor. ""We're seeing rising demand for Generac generator installations from homeowners who want peace of mind during outages.""

Key Facts:

Winter Storm Uri (2021) left millions without power for days

The 2024 heat wave triggered rolling blackouts across North Texas

Frisco's grid is already operating near capacity during peak months

ABR Electric and other local contractors are calling on the city to:

Streamline permitting for generator installations

Educate residents on backup power solutions

Incentivize energy resiliency upgrades in new construction

Powering Frisco's Future: Citywide Energy Action Plan Underway

In partnership with local experts, the City of Frisco is drafting a 2025 Energy Resiliency Plan, focusing on:

EV Infrastructure Expansion

Home & Business Generator Accessibility

Public-Private Energy Grid Modernization Task Force

Educational Campaigns for Energy-Savvy Living

""This is about future-proofing our community,"" said a city council member. ""We want Frisco to be a model city--powered, prepared, and progressive.""

Elliott, www.nytimes.com, rebecca-f-elliott",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/business/energy-environment/trump-tariffs-tax-batteries.html,"Tristan Doherty, chief product officer for LG Energy Solution’s U.S. energy storage unit, Vertech, compared tariffs to a drug that can be deadly at high concentrations.
They love oil, gas and critical minerals but have dim views of electric vehicles and wind and solar energy.
Around that time, the company now known as LG Energy Solution, one of the world’s biggest battery manufacturers, began making cells for cars in Holland.
Another company, AESC, also started making LFP batteries for storage systems this spring, in Tennessee.
During the recent tour of the LG factory, operators were adjusting a machine designed to wind giant sheets of aluminum foil, like thread around a bobbin.","The robots were doing practice runs.

It was the day before production was set to begin, and every few seconds, machines folded a stack of paper-thin battery cells into a metallic sheath. Then they sealed the pouch around the edges.

This tightly choreographed assembly line is the result of yearslong American efforts to match China’s industrial policy in areas like battery manufacturing. Ultimately, the batteries produced at this Michigan factory by LG Energy Solution, a South Korean company, will help balance the supply and demand for power on U.S. electric grids.

The silver-colored pouches — roughly the size of two computer keyboards set end to end — will be placed into large battery containers that can be more than 20 feet wide. In the last few years, electric utilities and other energy companies have begun spending billions of dollars to install scores of such big batteries around the country in parking lots, at old industrial sites and on what used to be farmland.

The batteries play an increasingly central role in the electricity business, especially in states like California and Texas, which have lots of solar and wind farms that produce energy at relatively low cost but only some of the time. The batteries serve as a sponge, soaking up energy when a lot of it is available and dispensing it when homes and businesses need it most.

But President Trump’s tariffs on China may knock this fledgling industry off course. Another threat is brewing in Congress, where House Republicans, with Mr. Trump’s blessing, have passed a budget bill that analysts say would drastically restrict access to subsidies for making and using rechargeable batteries.

Tristan Doherty, chief product officer for LG Energy Solution’s U.S. energy storage unit, Vertech, compared tariffs to a drug that can be deadly at high concentrations.

“The dose makes the poison, right?” Mr. Doherty said during a recent visit to the LG factory in Holland, Mich. “A little bit of tariff metered out on the right time scale, at the right level, can get us to a much better place. But too much too fast can kill us.”

What happens to the companies that make batteries and install them on American grids will affect how quickly the country is able to meet rising power demand and how much that energy will cost.

Without such batteries, utilities would have to invest a lot more in expensive power plants and transmission lines to be prepared for scorching summer afternoons or frigid winter mornings when power use soars. Such spending would drive up electricity prices significantly, energy experts say.

If the Republican budget bill took effect in its current form, it would be “something of a kill switch” for the tax credits available for making batteries, said Antoine Vagneur-Jones, an analyst at BloombergNEF. It also would quickly end tax credits for installing them on the grid.

Businesses are worried. Tesla, which sells energy storage systems in addition to cars, warned in April that the levies would have an “outsized” effect on its energy business, which relies on Chinese batteries. That was before Mr. Trump partly rolled back tariffs on China for 90 days.

This month, Fluence Energy, a company in Arlington, Va., that buys, packages and installs energy storage batteries, lowered its annual revenue forecast by around 20 percent, saying it was delaying projects and putting off new contracts because of unpredictable U.S. trade policy.

“It’s not the absolute price that’s so much the issue as it’s the uncertainty around where the price will be,” said John Zahurancik, the company’s president of the Americas.

Mr. Trump and his aides have expressed strong opinions about the energy sector. They love oil, gas and critical minerals but have dim views of electric vehicles and wind and solar energy. Batteries appear to occupy something of a middle ground.

Chris Wright, the energy secretary, seemed ambivalent about them in a March interview with The New York Times. “Batteries have a role. Solar is growing rapidly,” he said. “These are things of interest. I think we’re just a little bit more sober about it.”

Asked for comment for this article, the Trump administration did not directly address batteries but criticized wind and solar energy.

“The wind and solar industries in the United States have lived on more than three decades of subsidies,” an administration spokesman said. “Despite those subsidies, those energy sources still don’t come close to the affordability, reliability and security found in other sources of energy such as nuclear, coal and natural gas.”

The science behind LFP batteries was developed in the 1990s by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin. But it was China that recognized the technology’s commercial promise. Most manufacturers in the United States make batteries with nickel and cobalt.

“For a long time, we were not paying too much attention here in the U.S.,” said Arumugam Manthiram, a University of Texas engineering professor whose research helped pave the way for LFP batteries.

One company, A123 Systems, briefly produced LFP batteries in the United States, only to file for bankruptcy protection in 2012. A Chinese automotive supplier eventually bought most of the company’s assets.

Around that time, the company now known as LG Energy Solution, one of the world’s biggest battery manufacturers, began making cells for cars in Holland. Its light gray factory is less than 10 miles from Lake Michigan.

LG had planned to expand the factory to supply Toyota’s vehicles. But electric vehicles are not taking off as quickly in the United States as many companies anticipated. Electricity demand, on the other hand, is rising rapidly. As a result, the company changed its expansion plan and outfitted a new wing of the factory for LFP production, a $1.4 billion undertaking.

When the new assembly lines are running at full tilt, they will make enough cells to satisfy more than a quarter of current U.S. demand for LFP batteries, according to data from LG and Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a research firm. The investment decision predated Mr. Trump’s trade policy announcements, Mr. Doherty said.

“There was already an understanding that the cost of importing cells from China was going to be going up,” he said, citing Biden-era tax and trade policy aimed at encouraging companies to buy U.S.-made batteries.

Another company, AESC, also started making LFP batteries for storage systems this spring, in Tennessee.

During the recent tour of the LG factory, operators were adjusting a machine designed to wind giant sheets of aluminum foil, like thread around a bobbin. The foil was coated on both sides in a thin layer of dark gray material containing iron and phosphate, the cathode. Machines would later press and slice that coated foil into strips to be paired with their other half, the anode.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/22/multimedia/22biz-tariffs-batteries-vbmj/22biz-tariffs-batteries-vbmj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 09:14:21.922556

Why it matters: The move to remove California's authority to set vehicle-emissions rules will deprive the state of a major tool in its pollution-reduction toolbox. It also shows how far Republicans are willing to go to defy congressional norms in the name of overturning Democrats' climate policies.

What would the rules have done? The first of the three rules would have required automakers to sell increasing percentages of zero-emission vehicles through 2035, when all new-car sales would have to be zero-emission. The other two would impose zero-emission sales targets for heavy-duty trucks and require them to reduce their nitrogen oxide emissions. Ten other states are signed on to follow California's car rules.

Partisan breakdown: The Senate's vote Thursday came after weeks of Republican deliberations over whether to flout the opinion of the Senate parliamentarian, who had said that federal approval of California's standards shouldn't be subject to the Congressional Review Act. In previous Republican administrations, the U.S. EPA had tried to revoke the rules administratively. One Democratic senator — Elissa Slotkin of Michigan — joined Republicans in the vote against the car standards, compared with dozens of Democrats in the House.

What's next? Trump is expected to sign the bills in the coming weeks. California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta said last week they'll sue once he does.

As the country seeks to meet its growing energy needs, it must also confront the challenges posed by climate change and the imperative for environmental sustainability.

The recently announced plans by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development to resume operations at the historic Kilembe Mines in western Uganda present a unique opportunity.

Kilembe Mines, once the backbone of Uganda’s copper and cobalt industry, has been dormant for over four decades. Its revival is now driven by the surging global demand for critical transition minerals like copper and cobalt, essential inputs for renewable technologies such as solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicle batteries.

If responsibly harnessed, these minerals can support Uganda not only in global decarbonisation efforts but also in local energy security and resilience. However, despite these opportunities, the resumption of mining raises serious environmental and social concerns. Since the mine’s closure in 1982, many displaced individuals, including those affected by insurgencies and the expansion of Mount Rwenzori National Park resettled on the mine land.

These communities have lived there for over 40 years. According to Uganda’s Land Act (1998) and Constitution (1995), many qualify as bona fide occupants, entitled to secure tenure and protection from forced eviction.

Failure to recognise and compensate these residents through a transparent, participatory, free, prior, and informed consent could pose serious risks, triggering legal disputes.Furthermore, mining operations, if poorly managed, could exacerbate environmental degradation.

For instance, River Nyamwamba, already prone to destructive flooding, faces increased risks from potential disruption from the mining activity, which could also accelerate soil erosion, pollution, jeopardise biodiversity, and endanger the livelihoods of thousands. It is, therefore, very critical for the government and the mining company to take all necessary precautions and comprehensively assess the social, environmental, and economic impacts of resuming operations at Kilembe Mines.

This process must go beyond box-ticking exercises. A thorough, participatory Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) should be conducted as a genuine mechanism to safeguard public interest. Secondly, it is important to obtain Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) from the surrounding communities.

This must be done through transparent, inclusive, and culturally appropriate consultations, free from coercion, intimidation, or undue pressure. Communities must be meaningfully engaged, empowered with accurate information, and given the opportunity to accept or reject the project based on a clear understanding of its potential risks and benefits.

Third, the government and mining company must ensure robust mechanisms for transparency, accountability, and equitable benefit-sharing, while prioritising local value addition over the export of raw materials in crude form.

The extraction of critical minerals like copper and cobalt should not follow the historical pattern of exporting unprocessed ores, which deprives Uganda of job opportunities and industrial growth. It is through such a comprehensive and inclusive approach that reopening of Kilembe Mines catalyse broad-based development while advancing Uganda’s clean energy transition in a just and sustainable manner.

The sight of empty electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) in Philippine shopping malls and commercial buildings is now a thing of the past. When once upon a time nobody took much notice of these seemingly innocuous small public setups, EV owners today line up from early morning at free charging stations as the Philippine EV industry finally sees long-awaited record growth.

From sales of only 214 units in 2019, 378 units in 2020 and 843 units in 2021, EV sales surged to 3,091 units in 2022, 10,602 units in 2023 and 18,690 units in 2024 – which is about time, given that a Philippine Congress study in 2024 found that Metro Manila has the worst traffic congestion among metro areas in the world.

Out of 387 cities across 55 countries, the congested capital also registered the longest average travel time for a 10-kilometre route at just over 25 minutes.

Addressing challenges

The current transportation model in the Philippines heavily relies on fossil fuel-based combustion engines. The transportation sector is the largest source of air pollution and energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 34% of the total, with road transport contributing to 80%. Some 74% of air pollutants come from cars, motorcycles, trucks and buses.

Aside from pollution, the price volatility of oil products and heavy dependence on imported fuel pose a challenge to energy security and independence.

To address these challenges and push for sustainability in the transport sector, Republic Act No.11697 – or the Electric Vehicle Industry Development Act (EVIDA) – was passed into law in 2022, followed by an executive order that modified rates of import duty on electric vehicles, parts and components. In 2024, the government expanded this executive order to eliminate tariffs on EVs and their components for five years.

The Comprehensive Roadmap for Electric Vehicle Industry (CREVI) has since set targets and strategies for high-level government action plans to develop the EV industry.

The CREVI has four components: (1) EV and EVCS; (2) manufacturing; (3) human resource development; and (4) research and development.

The Department of Energy (DOE) has issued EVCS policy guidelines to promote adoption of EVs by developing a robust charging infrastructure. The CREVI has attracted investments in EV assembly, including strategic parts and components such as charging stations, automotive electronics, battery manufacturing and mineral processing.

Looking ahead

The CREVI has set targets for the year 2040 intro three sections: short-term, medium-term and long-term. By 2040, on a business-as-usual basis, the government hopes for at least 2.5 million EVs and 20,400 EVCS.

As of April 2025, the government has recognised and accredited 687 battery electric vehicles, 55 plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, 88 hybrid electric vehicles, and 80 light electric vehicles.

Among suppliers, China’s BYD brand has so far captured a remarkable 69% market share in the battery EV segment, and 82% of the new energy vehicle market. With its comparatively low prices, BYD is the leading player.

Government initiatives to promote EVs such as the public utility vehicle modernisation programme and the DOE electric tricycle project have meanwhile been successful in increasing the number of electric jeepneys and tricycles on the road.

Collaboration between government agencies, Manila Electric Company and city governments for the “e-Sakay” route and a trial of electric jeepneys in Iloilo City are also positive developments.

Private companies such as DHL Express Philippines and Mober are also re-fleeting with EVs. DHL Express has expanded its EV fleet with13 e-UVs and five e-MCs, which can travel up to 250km and 140km, respectively, on one charge. Meanwhile Mober, Ikea’s delivery partner in the Philippines, has introduced 10 electric vans and two electric trucks, setting the pace for other companies to set their own green goals in transportation.

Takeaway

As the EV industry continues to surge, the government must improve the infrastructure required – including more charging stations nationwide – and expand local EV manufacturing and assembly capabilities to accelerate adoption.

To drive momentum, fiscal incentives and other support mechanisms must also be enhanced.

These efforts will hopefully contribute to creating more jobs, generating export revenues and transitioning to sustainable, clean transportation – perhaps making the Philippines a hub for green technology in mobility.

Investing in Michigan's energy future To continue meeting growing energy demand, we must invest in all forms of energy.
By enhancing the reliability of the energy infrastructure and continuing to help deliver reliable, affordable energy, we are helping to drive Michigan’s economy forward.","As Enbridge President and CEO Greg Ebel is fond of saying, “You can’t run a full-time economy on part-time power.”

In today’s rapidly evolving world, energy demand is growing at an unprecedented rate. This is driven by advances in artificial intelligence, the continued expansion of data centers, and the resurgence of manufacturing across industries. Keeping pace with these demands—and doing so with an energy mix that is reliable, secure, and affordable—requires a comprehensive approach that encompasses both traditional and renewable energy sources. The solution isn’t one-dimensional; it’s multifaceted.

The bottom line? There’s no single energy solution

The reality of energy demand is staggering. Data center energy requirements are set to surpass 1,000 TWh by next year. This is a load growth that has tripled in the past decade, with projections to double or even triple again in just the next three years. Semiconductor factories now consume as much energy as an entire town, and global manufacturing capital expenditures are expected to increase by more than 5%.

Meanwhile, emerging economies are continuing to grow, and they’re contributing to about 85% of the additional global energy demand.

“It’s our long-held view that growing energy demand fundamentals mean that all forms of energy are going to be needed for decades to come,” says Ebel. “Enbridge’s diversified business mix is ideally positioned to meet this growing demand in oil and natural gas, lower-carbon opportunities, and renewable power.”

Enbridge’s role in Michigan’s energy future

Every day, Michiganders depend on secure, reliable energy to heat their homes, fuel businesses, and power industries. Enbridge proudly helps deliver 55% of the propane used in Michigan. We remain committed to modernizing our energy infrastructure and further protecting the Straits of Mackinac crossing.

With this tunnel, we’re further safeguarding one of the most critical energy infrastructure projects in the state, while continuing to support Michigan’s growing economy.

A balanced energy mix for a secure future

Combined, oil and natural gas are expected to make up nearly 50% of the global energy mix over the next 25 years. In the U.S., demand for natural gas alone is expected to rise by double digits through 2040. This growth is driven by natural gas’s critical role in electricity generation, industrial use, and its ability to provide affordable heating for homes and businesses.

Natural gas is a safe, reliable, and affordable energy source that helps meet the needs of industries from manufacturing to chemicals, steel, and cement. North America’s abundant natural gas supply not only supports local energy needs but also helps replace higher-emission coal, improving air quality and contributing to our climate goals.

Furthermore, natural gas is also a vital enabler of electrification, the process of transitioning from fossil fuel-powered technologies to electricity-driven alternatives. It’s the second-largest source of electricity generation globally, contributing to 20% of global electricity. And it complements renewable power generation, providing stability and reliability when solar and wind resources are unavailable, ensuring energy security even during times of low renewables output.

Investing in Michigan's energy future

How do energy and policy work together to support economic development in Michigan?
DAMOOSE: Frankly, you can’t attract economic development to Michigan if you don’t have enough power to run factories and corporations.
About the authors Charles Marshall, President, ITC Michigan Charles Marshall is Vice President, ITC Holdings Corp., and President, ITC Michigan.
About ITC ITC Michigan is composed of two operating companies: ITCTransmission and Michigan Electric Transmission Company (METC).","Michigan’s economic stability demands a reliable energy infrastructure, and industry leaders and policymakers are working together to unlock a more resilient energy future. Crain’s Content Studio recently spoke with Charles Marshall, president of ITC Michigan, and Senator John Damoose (R-Harbor Springs) about their shared vision to fuel Michigan’s economic prosperity.

What are the biggest energy challenges facing Michigan?

MARSHALL: The electricity generation market is rapidly changing as legacy dispatchable resources are nearing the end of their useful life and retiring. With these retirements, we need access to new generation to fill the vacancies created. Wind and solar play a critical role and may become the most economic solution, but our state also needs access to dispatchable generation more than ever.

We're seeing increased demand on our system with changes like electrification and data centers needing large amounts of power. Also, we're experiencing challenges with severe weather, such as the northern Michigan ice storm earlier this spring that caused significant damage to our power grid. However, the portions of our grid that we upgraded and invested in, withstood the storm.

In support of these changes and challenges, ITC is currently developing electric transmission solutions that will provide Michigan greater access to generation resources across our state and the Midwest to keep our lights on.

SEN. DAMOOSE: A lot of people are concerned with the clean energy legislation package that passed in 2023. We all want clean energy, but the pace of these policies needs to be reconsidered.

We’d all love to see more renewable energy, but frankly, solar doesn’t work well in Northern Michigan in the winter, which is a concern. I don’t want to see farmland plowed up for solar fields when we aren’t sure how productive they are. While the goals of these regulations may be honorable, it was way too far, way too fast.

Chuck mentioned the ice storm and my constituents were at the epicenter of the damage. Continued investment in our power grid is critical to sustain our way of life.

What policies, or lack thereof, are threatening Michigan’s energy security?

DAMOOSE: A problem we’ve seen across every industry, not just the energy industry, is that Michigan has very little consistency in how we formulate policy. ITC gave a presentation to our energy committee about the massive effort, expense and time that go into building our power grid. They’re looking 10 to 15 years out, and they need the assurance that we’re going to stick with a policy to make long-term plans and investments.

By working together collaboratively, we’re keeping power flowing to provide the residents, businesses and industries in Michigan with the most cost-effective and reliable electric transmission services and access to the lowest-cost energy.”

- Charles Marshall, President, ITC Michigan

MARSHALL: As we develop future plans for our transmission grid, we need a stable vision of our future. If the policy creates instability that makes it very difficult for us to develop rightsized system solutions. The biggest threat is shortsighted solutions and delays in implementation. Policy barriers in developing and building this critical infrastructure threaten the reliability of our grid. In many instances the construction takes 12 to 18 months while the remaining 80 percent of project development is the pre-construction work, such as securing real estate and permitting. Michigan has an opportunity to take a step forward by removing barriers that slow down the development of critical infrastructure.

What steps are you taking to stabilize the state’s energy grid?

MARSHALL: ITC has been diligently investing in Michigan’s transmission system over the last 22 years. We’ve invested in our grid, and now it’s performing among the best in the country; but with our rapidly changing energy landscape we’re still not where we need to be. ITC has partnered with the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) to develop a Long Range Transmission Plan (LRTP). The first stage, Tranche 1, is focused on shoring up the existing system and was approved in July 2022 to deploy $10 billion of transmission infrastructure across the Midwest including $850 million of Michigan investment. Tranche 1 reinforced our current grid and paved the way for the needed regional backbone infrastructure that would become Tranche 2.1. Approved in December 2024, Tranche 2.1 introduces a new voltage of 765 kV to eastern Michigan, dramatically increases our access to generation resources across the Midwest and develops transmission infrastructure to support our energy future.

DAMOOSE: From a policy standpoint, we need to commit long-term, be willing to spend the money, streamline the permitting process, and commit to providing adequate power for our people and corporations.

I’m working across the aisle with Senator Mallory McMorrow to develop a framework for a long-term economic development strategy for the state. Energy is going to be a big part of it. If we are going to bring in big industries, we need to be able to provide significantly more power than we do right now.

How do energy and policy work together to support economic development in Michigan?

DAMOOSE: Frankly, you can’t attract economic development to Michigan if you don’t have enough power to run factories and corporations. If we want to have a viable economy, we need to be willing to invest in our energy infrastructure.

MARSHALL: If you’re an outside industry looking to make Michigan your home, you want to know how quickly you can get your facility online, and whether you have reliable infrastructure—not just the electric transmission system, but roads, gas, rail, etc. That’s why these LRTP projects are so important, because the value stream associated with these investments is going to live on for decades and attract economic growth.

What else do Michiganders need to know about the current state of the energy grid?

MARSHALL: As mentioned, we are prudently investing in Michigan’s transmission system. By working together collaboratively, we’re keeping power flowing to provide the residents, businesses and industries in Michigan with the most cost-effective and reliable transmission services and access to the lowest-cost energy.

DAMOOSE: We need to be practical. It’s expensive and time-consuming to do anything in this industry, so we have to be willing to make the investment. Remember, we’re not doing it for ourselves; we’re doing it for our children and our children’s children to keep Michigan economically viable.

Toyota is finally playing catch-up in the EV world

After lagging other car manufacturers in bringing EVs to market, Toyota recently announced a completely overhauled version of its original crossover EV, the bZ4X, called the bZ.

Plus, the Japanese juggernaut also announced production of a smaller, sportier crossover, the CH-R, due to go on sale next year. The company says the vehicle will feature 338 horsepower, all-wheel drive, and a solid 290-mile range.

Tesla is in legal turmoil over its 'Robotaxis'

The legal battle to trademark terms is heating up fast in the world of self-driving taxis — and Tesla is on the losing end.

The company's attempt to trademark the term ""Robotaxi"" was recently rejected for being too generic, while its applications for the term ""Cybercab"" were stalled after other companies applied for similar trademarks. The company's ""Robobus"" trademark application is still being considered, though.

The end of the EV tax credit could cause a boom in sales

That $7,500 credit you get when you buy a new EV is about to be history, if the newly proposed federal budget gets approved.

According to Car and Driver, ""The budget would completely kill the tax credit after 2026. However, models from automakers such as GM and Tesla, which have sold more than 200,000 EVs, won't be eligible for the credit after December 31, 2025.""

The proposed bill would also do away with tax credits for used EVs, which are currently as much as $4,000. If the cuts are approved, it will likely cause a rush by consumers to buy or rent before the tax benefits go away — the boom before the bust.

Research shows that Americans still want to buy EVs

According to the J.D. Power Electric Vehicle Consideration Study recently released, 24% of U.S. buyers are ""very likely"" to buy an EV, while 35% are ""somewhat likely"" — both figures remaining basically the same as last year, despite the fluctuating news about electric alternatives.

Why in News?

A recent study reveals that while electric vehicles (EVs) reduce greenhouse gas emissions, their heavier weight leads to increased tyre wear, releasing more microplastic pollution—challenging the notion that EVs are fully eco-friendly.

What are the Environmental Concerns Regarding EVs?

Tyre Microplastic Pollution: EVs are typically 15–20% heavier than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles due to battery packs weighing 300–900 kg, leading to increased tyre stress and wear.

Primary fragmentation, caused by sudden braking or road impacts, releases micro-sized particles, while sequential fragmentation from routine wear produces larger particles.

Smaller fragments (1–10 μm) remain airborne, contributing to air pollution, while larger ones (>100 μm) settle on roads, affecting soil and water.

Rapid acceleration in EVs further increases friction and heat, intensifying microplastic emissions.

While EVs cut tailpipe emissions, they increase non-exhaust pollution, presenting a complex environmental trade-off.

Lithium-Ion Battery Hazards: Manufacturing a single EV releases 16–19 tonnes of CO₂, almost double that of an ICE vehicle (7–10 tonnes).

Producing 1 tonne of lithium requires approximately 1.89 million liters of freshwater affecting groundwater and ecosystems.

Recycling and Waste Management Deficit: Often EV batteries end up in landfills after damage or end-of-life. Proper recycling infrastructure is inadequate.

Cobalt and lithium residues can take centuries to break down and pose lasting risks to human and environmental health.

Grid Dependency & Fossil Fuels: EVs are only as green as the grid that powers them. India’s grid is still coal-dominated. Coal-fired power plants emit 800–850g of CO₂/kWh, which powers most EVs in India.

Many public charging stations run on diesel generators, ironically increasing emissions.

What are Gaps in EV Regulation in India?

Inconsistent and Fragmented Policy Implementation: Existing air pollution standards focus on particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and PM10, but tyre particles are often smaller and unregulated. No current standards adequately address non-exhaust emissions such as tyre and brake wear.

India is currently woefully underprepared to manage the massive volume of EV battery waste expected over the coming decade.

Critically, India lacks robust legislation to prevent the illegal dumping of spent lithium-ion batteries. The existing legal framework including the E-waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2011, E-waste (Management) Rules, 2016, and the 2018 amendment has evolved in terms of the range of materials covered. However, it fails to provide a cohesive, dedicated framework for the safe disposal and recycling of EV batteries.

This regulatory gap risks turning India into a dumping ground for domestic and imported battery waste.

EV schemes like FAME-I and II have had limited impact due to inconsistent implementation. While states like Gujarat and Delhi have strong policies, many lack even a basic EV roadmap.

The absence of uniform standards across states hinders nationwide scalability and integration.

Limited Scope of Government Incentives: The EV efforts focus mostly on 3-wheelers and buses in select urban areas, leaving out rural and semi-urban adoption potential.

EV efforts are mainly limited to intra-city transport, and long-distance inter-city electrification lacks a viable roadmap.

Charging Infrastructure Gaps: The current charging infrastructure is insufficient and underdeveloped, especially outside metro cities.

There is no national standardisation of charging equipment and battery technologies, resulting in compatibility issues across EV brands and stations.

High cost (investment ranging around Rs 1 crore or more) for setting up a charging station is a major deterrent, especially without guaranteed demand or utilization.

Lack of Dedicated Regulatory Authority: There is currently no single agency or department dedicated to EV regulation and coordination across ministries (Transport, Power, Renewable Energy, Environment, etc.).

The absence of a unified institutional mechanism hampers efficient decision-making, monitoring, and rapid response to industry needs.

Inadequate Focus on Supply Chain Security: India lacks a secure and diversified supply of critical raw materials like lithium (India imported 70% of its lithium-ion cells in 2023 ), cobalt, and rare earth elements needed for EV batteries.

There is no comprehensive national strategy to build domestic reserves, create international partnerships, or incentivize local alternatives (e.g., sodium-ion batteries).

Limited Consumer Awareness and Adoption Support: Consumer adoption remains low due to limited awareness of EV benefits, range anxiety and battery concerns, and poor promotion of home or decentralized charging options.

How can India Balance EV Growth with Environmental Sustainability?

Promote Green Manufacturing: Encourage EV and battery manufacturing powered by renewable energy. Under schemes like the PLI for Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) batteries, manufacturing should be tied to low-carbon practices.

Integrate solar and wind energy with public and private EV charging stations. Initiatives like PM-KUSUM and PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana can support decentralised, clean electricity for charging.

Encourage Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technologies, which can help balance intermittent renewable sources.

Circular Economy Framework: Implement a robust battery recycling and reuse ecosystem. India's Battery Waste Management Rules, 2022, make Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) mandatory for battery manufacturers to ensure environmentally sound management.

The EU’s “Battery Passport” model, which tracks the carbon footprint and lifecycle of batteries, could be replicated in India to enhance transparency.

Standardisation and Green Supply Chains: Establish a National EV Regulatory Authority to coordinate across ministries (Transport, Power, Environment, Industry).

Incentivize Green Supply Chains and encourage localisation of critical components and green logistics in PLI schemes.

India must develop strategic partnerships like Lithium-Deal with Argentina for ethical sourcing of lithium, cobalt, and nickel with traceability.

Consumer Awareness and Demand-Side Management: Launch national campaigns on financial and environmental benefits of EVs (similar to Ujala LED campaign success).

Promote home-based charging solutions and smart charging incentives to manage grid load.

Urban Planning and Sustainable Mobility Integration: Integrate EV planning with NEMMP and Smart Cities Mission.

Encourage mixed-use development, NMT (non-motorized transport) integration, and EV-first zones in city planning.

For example Oslo’s low-emission zones and city-wide EV parking privileges reduce urban air pollution effectively.

Carbon Accounting and Environmental Monitoring: Establish a dedicated environmental impact agency for EVs to track carbon emissions, life-cycle impact, and battery disposal.

Incorporate EVs into India’s carbon market framework, allowing tradable emission reductions. Align EV policies with India’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.

Conclusion

To balance EV growth with environmental sustainability, India must move beyond just electrification to green electrification. The focus must shift toward sustainable battery supply chains, clean power, recycling, and integrated urban planning. By learning from global leaders and tailoring policies to India’s unique challenges, the country can ensure that its EV revolution not only reduces emissions but also creates a cleaner, circular, and climate-resilient future.

● 12:00 PM ET – Crude Oil Inventories Weekly update on U.S. oil stockpiles, a vital gauge for energy markets.","Buried within the 1,100-page bill recently passed by the House of Representatives—the ""One Big, Beautiful Bill"" that reflects President Trump's priorities—are several provisions that, if enacted into law, could return the U.S. energy sector to a more capitalistic model.

President Joe Biden, with strong backing from environmental lobbyists and a last-minute defection from West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, pushed through the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Bill. These measures allocated billions of dollars in federal credits and loan guarantees to favored industries, all under the banner of environmental protection.

What followed was a Soviet-style industrial strategy in which a handful of Washington bureaucrats determined the winners and losers of America's energy future.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) 2022 contained ""Climate and energy investments"" of approximately $369 billion over 10 years. These included $270 billion for clean energy tax credits to support wind, solar, geothermal, and other renewables; clean hydrogen production; and carbon capture and storage technologies. Buyers of electric vehicles would get up to a $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and up to a $4,000 tax credit for used EVs (with income and manufacturing origin restrictions). Tax credits and funding for domestic manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and critical minerals exceeded $60 billion. Rebates for energy-efficient appliance upgrades, heat pumps, insulation, and home weatherization exceeded $60 billion under the Green Jobs and Environmental Justice banner.

With so much federal money up for grabs, greedy entrepreneurs flocked to risky green energy ventures, largely funded by grants and low-interest loans—funding they likely wouldn't have secured through private markets. We all remember the Obama-era Solyndra disaster, but Biden's approach was Solyndra-style investment on steroids.

What was worse, Biden used the vast levers of federal power to kneecap perfectly functioning industries. His administration was especially punitive toward the oil and gas sector: it suspended leases on federal land, blocked vast swaths of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf coasts from new drilling, canceled major pipelines, and imposed regulatory hurdles that made it increasingly difficult for the fossil fuel industry to attract investment capital. As oil prices steadily rose, Biden's energy strategy relied on tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and urging Saudi Arabia to increase production—an ironic move given his simultaneous efforts to restrict Russian oil exports during the Ukraine war.

President Trump, who campaigned once again on the ""drill, baby, drill"" message, has consistently opposed such government interference in the energy markets. He has long supported removing regulatory red tape and streamlining the permitting process to allow for increased oil production—lowering domestic prices and boosting exports. In December 2019, under Trump's administration, the U.S. Energy Information Administration announced that America had become a net exporter of oil for the first time in nearly 60 years.

Biden's green agenda had another critical flaw: financing. Much of it depended on borrowing from China—ironically benefiting Chinese companies dominating the very industries Biden sought to boost. Since the launch of China's ""Made in China 2025"" initiative, Chinese firms—heavily subsidized by their government—have taken over more than 85% of the global rooftop solar panel market. Battery components for solar installations have even higher Chinese market dominance. In effect, Biden borrowed money from China to finance the growth of Chinese companies that sold solar products to U.S. installers.

The new House bill aims to dismantle this entire framework in one stroke. It eliminates the trading of green credits between corporations, revokes low-interest green loans, and entirely phases out subsidies for renewable energy initiatives.

To those who claim this approach is irresponsible, we pose a simple question: How many more decades should the green energy sector rely on government aid to stay afloat? Sustainable energy and transition projects are essential, but they must prove their viability in the open market—just like oil and gas companies do every day. This is classic Adam Smith-style capitalism: let competition and innovation—not government favoritism—determine success.

Trump also supports nuclear power, one of the cleanest and most efficient methods of generating electricity. Critics on the Left often call nuclear energy dangerous, but even the most liberal nations—France, Germany, and Japan—have long depended on it. The only significant U.S. nuclear accident, Three Mile Island in the 1980s, did not result in any deaths. Despite Japan's vulnerability to natural disasters, it maintained a strong safety record until Fukushima. The U.S., by contrast, is less prone to earthquakes or tsunamis, yet Congress and successive administrations have consistently stymied progress on nuclear energy.

This week, Trump signed an executive order that could clear the way for small-scale nuclear plants to begin operations within the next 18 months. These modern reactors, based on cutting-edge American technology, are far safer than their predecessors and are designed to power small cities or neighborhoods rather than entire states. Every aspect of nuclear energy today—from fuel storage to waste disposal—is light-years ahead of where it was decades ago. It's a national disgrace that despite having world-class nuclear capabilities—including naval reactors and the world's second-largest nuclear arsenal—our federal policies have hampered the civilian nuclear industry.

By issuing appropriate permitting waivers, Trump aims to unlock this potential, even if a modest federal investment is necessary to overcome ideological resistance from the Left. Energy independence and security should have been the hallmarks of the Obama and Biden administrations. Instead, they catered to the demands of environmental activists and weakened America's energy position.

We are glad to say that the Green New Deal is dead.

Exide Industries, through its subsidiary Exide Energy Solutions Ltd (EESL), is setting up a gigafactory in Bengaluru to manufacture lithium-ion cells.
Exide has secured the rights to use and commercialize SVOLT’s technology and know-how for lithium-ion cell manufacturing.
The Gigafactory is expected to initially start commercial production of NMC cells for two-wheelers by the end of 2026.
The company is also looking at a 4-6 GWh initial capacity for LFP cell manufacturing capacity.","Battery major Exide Industries, which is setting up a gigafactory to manufacture lithium-ion cells, is in advanced stage talks with two leading two-wheeler OEMs and three-wheeler players to form partnerships for cell supply.

“We have been in advanced discussion with two of the leading OEMs for 2-wheelers on the cylindrical side. Similarly, on the 3-wheeler side, we are talking to some people on the LFP side at a very advanced stage,” Managing Director and CEO Avik Roy told investors recently.

Exide Industries, through its subsidiary Exide Energy Solutions Ltd (EESL), is setting up a gigafactory in Bengaluru to manufacture lithium-ion cells. The facility will have a capacity of 6 GWh in its first phase, which will eventually be ramped up to 12 GWh.

The company expects to start commercial operations in the current financial year. Roy noted that the trial production will start in this calendar year and then start serial production within 4-5 months after the homologation process.

Exide has invested nearly Rs 1,000 crore for the lithium-ion cell manufacturing project in the financial year 2025, followed by an additional Rs 300 crore in April. With this, the total equity investment by Exide in EESL to date is around Rs 3,602 crore.

Though Li-ion cells based on NMC and LFP are popular in the electric vehicle industry, LFP cells are preferred globally, considering their thermal stability, longer life cycle and lower costs. The concerns of comparatively lower density with LFP batteries are being addressed through new technologies and innovations.

“When we started this project, we tried to mitigate the risk through multiple chemistries and multiple format methods. So we have two lines of cylindrical and two lines of prismatic, which means two lines of NMC and two lines of LFP as well. So we see traction on both sides from different end markets,” Roy noted.

While the capacity in the first phase is likely to be equally shared between NMC and LFP chemistry-based cells, Exide Industries will start with the cylindrical NMC line for two-wheeler applications

“We will start with the cylindrical NMC line, which is meant for 2-wheelers, for which we are in advanced discussion with many of the clients. So that will be our first priority. And then take it one by one. Then the next one will be one line of electric prismatic, targeting 3- 3-wheelers and 4-wheelers. So this is how we are planning,” Roy said.

The Li-ion cells manufactured from the factory will cater to both mobility and stationary applications with some of the cells manufactured being common for both applications.

Exide has a partnership with China-based SVOLT Energy Technology, which develops and manufactures lithium-ion batteries and storage solutions for multiple applications. Exide has secured the rights to use and commercialize SVOLT’s technology and know-how for lithium-ion cell manufacturing.

Recently, South Korean automakers Hyundai Motor Co and Kia Corp tied up with Exide to equip future electric vehicles in the Indian market with locally produced lithium-ion batteries based on lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry.

Exide’s management noted that the product development under the MoU with Hyundai has started, and the company is putting up all the resources to get ready.

“There are three types of engagements we are having with customers right now. Good to see that at least the largest 2-wheeler OEMs, 3-wheeler OEMs, and some 4-wheeler OEMs are engaging with us because they see a value in sourcing local cells,” Roy said.

Exide Industries already has a Li-ion battery pack and module assembly facility in Gujarat with an initial 1.5 GwH capacity. The pack manufacturing is happening through outsourced cells and the company plans to switch to its own cells once the cell manufacturing starts. It is currently making battery packs for some well-known two-wheeler and three-wheeler manufacturers as well as for telecom applications.

Meanwhile, Exide’s competitor Amara Raja is also setting up a Li-ion cell manufacturing plant in Telangana, which is likely to start operations this year with a 2 GWh capacity planned in the first phase. The Gigafactory is expected to initially start commercial production of NMC cells for two-wheelers by the end of 2026. The company is also looking at a 4-6 GWh initial capacity for LFP cell manufacturing capacity.

Amara Raja has a tie-up with a Chinese company to jointly develop an NMC-based 2170 cylindrical cell, while it has partnered with Gotion-InoBat-Batteries for LFP cells. The company has also recently tied up with automakers including Ather Energy and Piaggio India to supply Li-ion batteries.",https://img.autocarpro.in/autocarpro/ae6ecba3-c9bc-42a7-8ba6-8d12f3b03f85_b548f47ca6ba483aa50628c00ef44805exide.avif,N,,2025-05-26 09:15:02.558571

UNDP is scaling up its energy work to support Syria in achieving a just transition, and in advancing recovery, while tackling climate change.","Damascus – The Minister of International Development of Norway, Mr Åsmund Aukrust, and the United Nations Development Programme Resident Representative, Mr Sudipto Mukerjee signed a framework agreement to develop the renewable energy master plan for Syria.

“The political situation is fragile, which is precisely why it is important to start reconstruction efforts without delay and provide support to ensure that people have access to basic services. This study will be an important roadmap for how to build back better in the energy sector. The story of Syria is being written now, and Norway is seeking to play a constructive role,” said Minister of International Development Åsmund Aukrust.

Against the backdrop of Syria’s energy crisis, the plan will outline Syria’s future energy demand and determine the share renewable sources can meet. It will also include key measures such as reviewing existing regulations to align with international best practices and establishing a robust legal framework. Furthermore, the Plan will also define the priorities and human resources and capacities needed to ensure the regular updating of the plan by the different stakeholders.

Given the critical role of energy in Syria’s recovery, we have to rapidly address energy poverty and progressively accelerate the access to renewable energy. UNDP launched the Electricity Master Plan earlier this week. Norway’s contribution will support us in sustaining the momentum towards the properly planned and managed transition to clean and affordable energy for all”, said Sudipto Mukerjee, UNDP Resident Representative.

The Renewable Energy Master Plan, which will be developed over a 12-month period, identifies the following priority areas:

Increasing energy reliability and access for communities across Syria.

Reducing dependence on energy imports and enhancing energy security.

Promoting the sustainable and efficient long-term use of resources.

Minimising the risk of stranded assets while leveraging new technologies to foster emerging industries.

Minimising the risk of stranded assets, by avoiding unnecessary investments in outdated infrastructure that may no longer be viable in the transition to renewable energy and strategically leveraging new technologies.

Promoting positive economic impacts through job creation and local enterprise development.

Improving environmental sustainability and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Advancing more sustainable energy use across all sectors, promoting energy-efficient practices, and integrating renewable energy on both the supply and demand sides.

Clarifying the limitations of sustainable energy for the provision of some types of large-scale public service delivery.

Providing requirements and recommendations for integrating the current transmission and distribution network with the proposed renewable power interventions.

Establishing benchmarks and indicators to track progress towards renewable energy goals and creating a feedback model that promotes investment in renewable energy.

Identifying additional capacity needs of relevant authorities to formulate long- term energy plans and policies.

UNDP is scaling up its energy work to support Syria in achieving a just transition, and in advancing recovery, while tackling climate change.

It is worth noting that the plan will be integrated with the National Electricity Master Plan to ensure a cohesive and sustainable energy strategy that will 1) assess policies to enhance energy security and efficiency; 2) identify financial requirements and investment alternatives to meet demand forecasts; 3) assess renewable energy potential to identify and evaluate the renewable energy resources available in including solar, wind, and biomass; 4) develop a strategic framework; 5) promote stakeholder engagement; 6) provide a list of key priority programmes; 7) facilitate technical capacity building in renewable energy technologies and project management; and 8) establish partnerships with the academia to create a skilled workforce in the renewable energy sector.

But will procuring those supplies harm the environment and human rights?

Across the world, from Africa and Asia to Latin America, a growing number of mining projects has been associated with nature destruction, pollution, labour abuses and conflict, while local communities often shoulder much of the cost and share little of the benefit.

As the scramble for minerals for the energy transition rises to the top of the political agenda, there are mounting calls for international cooperation to ensure production of these resources is sustainable and equitable, alongside a flurry of proposed initiatives for global standards and stronger governance.

Explainer: Why the world is racing to mine critical minerals

Colombia is drumming up support for a legally binding minerals agreement based on the model of global negotiations for a plastic treaty. An alliance of NGOs wants to get the issue onto the agenda of this year’s COP30 climate talks, and experts are calling for a new materials data hub.

The United Nations, which oversees the most advanced efforts to create a global framework for energy transition minerals, insists it remains the best-placed broker for thrashing out global norms, despite a funding crisis.

This month, the International Energy Agency (IEA) joined a chorus of voices calling for more cooperation on the issue. In its latest Critical Minerals Outlook report, it warned of growing risks of disruption to mineral supply chains as the market becomes increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few, with China controlling around 70% of the refining of 19 out of 20 strategic minerals analysed by the agency.

Rising copper demand fuels concern over pollution and rights abuses

Meanwhile, since returning to the White House, US President Donald Trump has taken a new approach to resource diplomacy, negotiating access to Ukraine’s mineral resources as a condition for American support and eyeing mineral-rich Greenland and Canada.

“It’s climate change, security, development and geopolitical elements intersecting – which I think is why there’s so much appetite and urgency around improving multilateralism to address this really complex issue,” Erica Westenberg, director of governance programmes at the Natural Resource Governance Institute, told Climate Home News.

Plan for an international minerals treaty

Colombia’s proposal for a global minerals treaty is motivated by the aim of rooting out extensive illegal gold mining, a source of environmental destruction and pollution that is threatening people’s health in the Amazon nation.

“[Existing] norms and standards are optional, and this isn’t good enough,” Mauricio Cabrera Leal, Colombia’s vice minister for environmental policy, told a conference at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris earlier this month.

“We need to have a mandatory agreement to assess the whole value chain with transparency and traceability at the international level,” he added.

Colombia plans to put forward a resolution for countries to begin negotiations on a binding minerals treaty at the UN Environment Assembly in December. If approved, countries would then need to decide on the scope of the agreement, Cabrera Leal told Climate Home – an approach that has proved highly contentious and so far unsuccessful in talks for a plastic treaty.

But the idea has received a “good response” from some African and European nations, he added. And others agree with the principle.

A high-level council of former ministers and leaders of international institutions convened by the Paris Peace Forum to reflect on mineral supply chain challenges has also called for an international agreement on resource management and the creation of a separate repository for mineral data.

Justin Vaïsse, director general of the Paris Peace Forum, told the OECD conference it was “now time to think seriously” about these proposals.

Observers in the mining sector caution that any agreement must build on hard-learned lessons and existing best practices, including the need to ensure that affected communities and Indigenous people are at the negotiating table.

An international materials agency?

The co-chairs of the International Resource Panel (IRP), a body of policy experts established by the UN Environment Programme, meanwhile are advocating for the creation of an international materials agency.

This data hub would cover all the materials needed to deliver on global climate and development goals, including critical minerals. It would help make supply chains more transparent and track their environmental implications.

Janez Potočnik, the IRP’s co-chair, told Climate Home the proposed agency would “complement” the IEA’s growing work on the security of mineral supplies by considering the impacts of mineral production and consumption models with a mandate that could evolve over time to include international negotiations on materials.

Potočnik said the proposal is backed by the International Chamber of Commerce and the World Economic Forum – demonstrating the private sector’s interest in more transparent data.

UN push for better standards

Last year, UN boss António Guterres convened a panel of governments, international organisations and experts which defined seven principles to underpin the responsible, fair and sustainable extraction of energy transition minerals.

The UN is now expected to release a plan to implement those principles and appoint an advisory group to draft a global framework to make mineral supply chains more transparent, traceable and accountable.

Efforts to define responsible mining are not new. But there are currently around 200 voluntary mining standards and “a lot of them are not the best standards”, said Sascha Raabe, who heads the UN Industrial Development Organization’s (UNIDO) Global Alliance for Responsible and Green Minerals. It aims to bring together governments, the private sector, NGOs and communities to help countries develop sustainability policies that can add value to their resources.

Europe’s lithium rush leaves mineral-rich communities in the dark

UNIDO’s alliance will also work alongside other UN agencies to define a set of concrete environmental, social and governance criteria – such as a living wage – for assessing existing voluntary mining standards, Raabe explained.

“It’s important that the UN set up these criteria to give direction to the private sector and consumers and create a global level playing field,” said Raabe, adding that “the UN is the best forum to bring these global goals together”.

One of the largest efforts to harmonise voluntary mining standards is the Consolidated Mining Standard Initiative, which is being developed by four mining industry groups covering 100 companies. But campaign groups have criticised the industry’s efforts to self-regulate as “weak” and at “risk of creating a race to the bottom”.

Instead, they back the The Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance’s standard, which is overseen by a collaborative process including industry, civil society, labour groups and community representatives.

Putting minerals on the COP30 agenda

Campaigners are also pushing for stronger links between the challenges of obtaining minerals for the clean energy transition and the UN’s climate and nature policy processes.

At UN biodiversity talks in Colombia last year, governments agreed to “avoid or, if not possible, minimise, the negative impacts of climate actions on biodiversity”, without singling out transition minerals.

Now a coalition of NGOs is urging the Brazilian COP30 presidency to put ways to tackle the environmental and social risks associated with these minerals on the agenda of the UN climate summit in Belém in November.

‘The state doesn’t want to know’: Doctors raise alarm on children’s health crisis in Chile’s copper heartland

Campaigners want governments at COP30 to recognise the risks posed by unmanaged extraction to global climate and biodiversity goals, endorse the work of the UN’s advisory group on responsible sourcing and designate “no-go” mining zones in climate-critical ecosystems and Indigenous territories.

“This is a once-in-a-generation chance for Brazil to lead on climate justice and ensure that the clean energy transition doesn’t come at the expense of frontline communities, the planet’s last intact forests, and other critical ecosystems that should be marked as no-go zones,” said Emily Iona Stewart, head of policy for Global Witness’s transition minerals campaign.

Solar systems support farms, clinics and schools

Its success has attracted further investment. A $ 3.5 billion renewable energy deal with the Integrated Clean Energy Power Company (CiEG), a Chinese enterprise, aims to generate 2400 megawatts of power in the coming years.

Off-grid solutions are also expanding. Pay-as-you-go solar systems have brought electricity to many households, while mini-grids now supply power to rural schools, clinics and entire villages. For Mary Zulu, a farmer in Southern Province, the impact has been tangible. “With the solar water pump, I’ve doubled my harvest. Now I can feed my family and sell the surplus. It’s a lifeline for us,” she says.

In the health sector, solar-powered refrigerators allow clinics to store vaccines safely, reducing preventable deaths. Beatrice Mumba, a nurse in Eastern Province, recalls: “Previously, we had to turn away patients because the vaccines went bad without refrigeration. Now, lives are being saved every day.”

Education is also benefiting. In communities with solar-powered lanterns and school mini-grids, children can study after dark, contributing to improved academic outcomes.

Cost barriers and long-term potential

Despite these advances, solar adoption still faces barriers. Basic household solar systems usually cost between ZMW 3500 and 5000 ($ 123 and $ 175) depending on the size – well beyond the reach of most rural families, whose average monthly income is under ZMW 1500 ($ 52).

The government’s Eighth National Development Plan (8NDP) sets a target to raise the share of renewables in the national grid – excluding large hydroelectricity generation – to 10 % by 2026. Reaching this goal will require increased subsidies, simplified regulations and stronger local manufacturing to reduce costs.

International support is also crucial. The World Bank-led Scaling Solar initiative has helped to fund key projects such as Bangweulu. Technical training programmes could further build local capacity to maintain and expand installations, ensuring long-term viability.

Solar energy also brings wider environmental and social benefits. Replacing firewood and charcoal with clean energy helps to reduce deforestation and lowers the incidence of respiratory illnesses caused by indoor air pollution. And in agriculture, solar-powered irrigation can improve resilience to climate change. Women, who often spend hours collecting firewood, gain time for education and economic activities when solar appliances are available.

With the right policies and sustained investment, Zambia has the potential to expand energy access, alleviate poverty and support climate adaptation. In this context, solar power is not just an alternative – it is a necessity.",https://www.dandc.eu/sites/default/files/article/2025-05/stepmap-karte-zambia-mit-lusaka.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 04:00:38.288781

Today, the European Commission has taken further steps to support the EU’s transition to a low-carbon economy. Four new pieces of secondary legislation and a communication relating to the Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA) will help the EU’s industry to become more resilient, competitive and reduce their carbon footprint. These rules clarify which manufacturing projects can benefit from specific provisions in the Act, such as on permitting, strategic project status and on non-price criteria. They will help scale up the manufacturing of net-zero technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and leverage the competitive advantage of the EU’s clean tech industry.

The Commission has today adopted the following acts:

Components primarily used for net-zero technologies under the NZIA

The NZIA strengthens EU manufacturing of net-zero technologies including their key components. Today’s act clarifies the scope of NZIA through listing specific components for which the NZIA requirements will apply.

Rules on non-price criteria in renewable energy auctions

The Commission adopted rules for the inclusion of certain non-price criteria in Member State auctions for renewable energy deployment. These criteria include responsible business conduct, cybersecurity, and sustainability and resilience contribution. Starting on 30 December 2025, the new rules must be applied to 30% of auction volumes (or 6 GW per year per EU country). The act provides more detailed parameters to help harmonise how Member States apply these rules to ensure better visibility for businesses, while allowing some flexibility. Well-designed, objective and transparent criteria that reward higher value-added products can better support a sustainable, innovative and resilient manufacturing industry.

Main specific components relevant for the NZIA access to markets chapter

The Commission adopted an act listing net-zero technology final products and their main specific components. This list helps identify which products may trigger the mandatory application of the non-price criterion of “resilience.” This means that, in certain public procedures, contracting authorities must consider supply chain resilience alongside price when selecting technologies or suppliers, i.e. contracting authorities in these cases should not simply select the cheapest option. This criterion must be applied in public procurement, renewable energy auctions, and other forms of public intervention, when there is excessive dependency on a single source of supply for one of these products.

Communication on shares of Union supply

The Commission adopted a Communication providing information on where the EU’s supply of net-zero technologies comes from, highlighting third country dependencies for specific technologies. This information enables the application of the ‘resilience’ non-price criterion in public procurement, renewable energy auctions, and other public interventions in order to diversify the technology sources. Additionally, it helps Member States in evaluating net-zero technology manufacturing projects eligible for strategic project status.

Common criteria on strategic project selection

The NZIA allows net-zero technology manufacturing projects to apply for “strategic project” status. Strategic projects benefit from ‘priority status’ at national level, which ensures rapid administrative treatment and financial advice. The act adopted today ensures a consistent selection process across Member States, through guidance on the applicable criteria for that project selection. The Commission encourages Member States to use the application process on the Commission website to reduce administrative burden. This website provides specific guidance on certain selection criteria such as those centered around “first-of-a-kind”, “best available technology”, and “significant” manufacturing capacity”.

Background

The adopted texts took into account the input received via the call for feedback on four of the acts earlier in the year. It also follows discussion among Member States in the relevant experts’ groups and comitology committees.

The reversal follows intense negotiations between New York Governor Kathy Hochul and President Trump’s administration after the Department of the Interior paused the project for further environmental review. Governor Hochul hailed the decision as a win for the state’s clean energy future and labor market, stating:

“I fought to save clean energy jobs in New York — and we got it done.”

The $5 billion project, which already secured over $3 billion in financing, is expected to create 1,500 union jobs and support local economies. Equinor CEO Anders Opedal welcomed the green light, reiterating the company’s commitment to delivering sustainable energy solutions while fostering regional growth.

However, the decision also appears to be part of a broader political compromise. U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum indicated the reversal was linked to Governor Hochul’s willingness to consider new natural gas pipeline development to enhance energy affordability in the Northeast.

The Empire Wind project’s reinstatement marks a significant moment for ESG investment, demonstrating the ongoing push for renewable infrastructure and carbon neutrality, even amid political shifts. It reflects how green energy can align with both economic and strategic energy goals in the evolving U.S. landscape.

Or, as Trump and the “vibe shift” sees a dramatic rollback in global commitments and focus on ESG, will Chinese financial institutions and companies beat a similar retreat?

Working out answers to these questions is now central to understanding the new world of climate politics.

Aidala",,,,,https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/climate-change/1628412/congress-and-the-feds-the-impact-of-nonperformance,"Members of Congress, or employees of federal agencies?
Let's examine the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) employees versus those responsible for legislating environmental laws.
Congress has not been able to reauthorize environmental statutes for years, with some (most) needing significant attention.
To address action demanded by state and federal legislative members the bureaucracy has to rely on fitting the law they implement to often unforeseen problems that they now confront.
At the same time, one of the relatively few committees in Congress is specifically focused on Agriculture.","Ponder the following existential question: Who does their job less effectively? Members of Congress, or employees of federal agencies? Let's examine the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) employees versus those responsible for legislating environmental laws.

Congress has not been able to reauthorize environmental statutes for years, with some (most) needing significant attention. EPA relies on 1990 Clean Air Act amendments to sort out air pollution issues and address climate change when in 1990 the debate focused especially on acid rain and emissions from autos with the latest in 1980s technology. Water pollution? Let's continue to rely on foundational approaches based on the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899!

Even trying to avoid snarky arrogance and intellectual ridicule from a former federal employee, the basic point remains — many of the ""problems"" often cited by critics of Agency behavior can be traced back to the fact that demands to fix current problems are being made of a program that does not quite fit the text of the authorizing statute. To address action demanded by state and federal legislative members the bureaucracy has to rely on fitting the law they implement to often unforeseen problems that they now confront.

Many observers fear the fallout of the demise of the Chevron doctrine — concern that, without deference to Agency interpretations, important problems may remain unaddressed (or worse, for some, resolution may fall to federal judges). But consistent with the court opinion, interpretations of legislative textisthe domain of judges or, heaven forfend, the responsibility of Congress to define or refine clearly the extent and intent of the legislation.

The current lamentable (to some) result to fill effectively the legislative effort can be called ""rubber-suiting"" — stretching the colorable authority already granted to address a new problem not originally anticipated by the legislative authors. An example in the environmental space is the EPA authority to regulate biotechnology products: the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) can reach (stretch) to cover most of the waterfront about regulatory issues identified needing regulation.

Over the past decades, Congress and different administrations have made intermittent attempts to craft a new, broad, and modern statute to coordinate and regulate government review and approval of biotechnology products. The current government allocation of responsibilities across agencies, reliant on authority legislated mostly long before biotechnology products were developed, is governed by policies first crafted during the Reagan and H.W. Bush Administrations.

Jurisdiction remains fragmented, relying on statutes drafted before modern methods of biotech engineering were even developed, and holes in the rubber-suit remain. Example of a hole? An earnest high school student can purchase an ""at-home Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) device"" and experiment with doctoring DNA in their own home, out of sight or knowledge of regulatory officials. For $129.00 on Amazon.com, you can buy a ""DIY Bacterial Genome Engineering CRISPR Kit."" We hope the result is not a literal version of ""Audrey II"" from Little Shop of Horrors.

In addition to the jurisdictional difficulties and holes, especially acute in the last decade or three, is the bitter partisanship besetting congressional deliberation. There are continued calls for ""regular order,"" but apparently little appetite for the same. ""Regular order"" would see legislation introduced, deliberated by the assigned subcommittee(s) and committee(s), moving to floor consideration in each chamber, and differences between House and Senate resolved by a conference committee. Such a schematic is about as currently relevant as having new members watch Jimmy Stewart's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington as part of orientation. (That is the last film reference used today.)

An important book that has become required reading in introductory political science coursework is in its fifth edition: Politics, Position, and Power: The Dynamics of Federal Organization, by Harold Seidman. Its main message? To reorganize the federal government, you need to reorganize the Congress. A famous example of the problem, cited by many: A cheese pizza is subject to regulations developed by one agency (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)), while a pepperoni pizza is subject to regulations from an entirely different agency (the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)). Explanations of this curiosity include jurisdictional rivalries among congressional committees and federal agencies. Calls for a single food-safety agency have seen legislation introduced for years and have been the subject of many General Accountability Office (GAO) reports.

More Americans have lived in urban areas than rural areas since the 1910 Census, and according to USDA, agriculture represents roughly2.6 millionAmericans who were directly employed on farms, equaling about 1.2 percent of total U.S. employment. At the same time, one of the relatively few committees in Congress is specifically focused on Agriculture. Indeed, the country's food production is important, and if you count all jobs related to food, the percentage jumps to be over 10 percent. Congress might benefit from a reorganization itself, since the urban population has outnumbered rural residents for over 100 years, but rural states would likely take offense at any attempt to de-emphasize the critical importance of the agricultural sector in our modern economy.

Our April 2, 2025, blog post discussed how the call to reorganize EPA has been a long-standing idea to ""reform"" the agency to better achieve its mission. Likewise, the point here is to suggest that Congress might benefit from a version of ""doctor, heal thyself"" should any serious attempt be made to make government work better, be more efficient, and give more meaning to the phrase ""your tax dollars at work.""

The European Biogas Association (EBA) has made the path forward clear with a proposal to set up a binding target of 100 billion cubic meters (bcm) of biogases by 2040. Encompassing both biogas and biomethane, biogases are more than renewable energy sources. They are the engine of a secure, affordable, circular and resilient energy future for Europe.

This call comes just days after the release of the REPowerEU Roadmap, which rightly recognised the strategic role of biogases in Europe’s energy mix. Published on 13 May, the EBA’s Roadmap to 2040 outlines how this sector, already providing 19 bcm of renewable gas (EU-27 production), equivalent to 7% of EU natural gas demand, can grow more than fourfold by 2040. The technologies, sustainable feedstocks and investment appetite are in place. What’s missing is decisive political leadership.

A sector ready to deliver

Europe’s biogas and biomethane value chain is one of the continent’s underleveraged climate and energy assets. Over €27 billion in private capital has already been committed to expand biomethane capacity by 2030. Yet without firm legislative backing, this momentum risks stalling. With the right framework, this sector can deliver at least 101 bcm by 2040 and 151 bcm by 2050, according to sustainable feedstock estimates. The 2040 target for biogases could:

Power more than 90 million European households;

Avoid over 483 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions annually;

Provide 13.8 million tonnes of organic fertilisers, reducing dependence on imports and revitalising European soils;

In other words, biogases don’t just reduce emissions by replacing a significant share of fossil gas in industry, transport, and heating. They reduce dependency: on fossil fuels, on imported fertilisers, and on fossil-derived industrial CO₂. They create local jobs, support farmers, and ensure that economic value stays in Europe.

Three interconnected circular pathways

At the heart of the EBA’s vision are three circular economy pathways, all enabled by the production and use of biogases. Firstly, renewable energy generation: Biogases offer a uniquely flexible form of renewable energy. Biogas is storable and dispatchable, enhancing grid stability and supporting the integration of intermittent renewables. Crucially, biomethane can flow through existing gas infrastructure, minimising investment needs and accelerating the fossil gas phase-out.

Secondly, organic fertiliser production: Digestate, the by-product of anaerobic digestion, is a potent organic fertiliser. It helps restore soil health, displaces carbon-intensive synthetic fertilisers, and supports the EU’s Farm to Fork and Soil Strategies. With 40% of Europe’s nitrogen fertiliser needs currently imported, this shift is not only environmental, it’s strategic.

Thirdly, biogenic CO₂ utilisation: Biogas upgrading technologies already separate over 6.4 Mt of CO₂ annually. This biogenic CO₂ can be captured and reused by industries currently reliant on fossil-derived CO₂, decarbonising critical supply chains in food, beverages, cement, and synthetic fuels. With industrial demand for CO₂ projected to reach 260–320 Mt per year by 2050, this is a major opportunity for clean growth.

Time for binding action

Despite the sector’s established contributions, biogases are not yet fully reflected in current EU climate and energy legislation. Introducing a binding target of 100 bcm by 2040 would help align policy frameworks with the sector’s potential and support more coordinated development across Member States. Such a target would:

Align with the REPowerEU Plan’s objective to replace fossil gas with renewables;

Provide the long-term policy clarity investors need;

Anchor biogases in the EU’s 2040 Climate Targets and net-zero trajectory;

Create the market scale and confidence needed to unlock full deployment across all Member States.

This target must be accompanied by a bold policy framework in the form of a European Biogases Charter. The Charter would coordinate efforts across Member States and define the enabling conditions needed to meet the 100 bcm target. These include:

National pledges for biogases: Member States would commit to concrete action plans reflecting their specific potentials.

Accelerated permitting: Digital, harmonised, and streamlined regulatory procedures to reduce delays and encourage investment.

Market design reform: Stable support schemes that reward environmental and circular economy benefits.

Infrastructure development: Investment in grid access, upgrading facilities, and storage capacity to scale production.

Recognition of circular contributions: Acknowledging biogases' roles in renewable energy, organic fertilisers, and CO₂ capture in EU taxonomy and policy frameworks.

Strategic cooperation: Structured dialogue between the EU, national governments, and industry to ensure coherence and impact.

Biogases coordinators: Appointed in each Member State (to guide implementation and align cross-sectoral policies. Biogases coordinators: Appointed in each Member State to guide implementation and align cross-sectoral policies.

More than energy: a path to resilient, local prosperity

One of biogases’ greatest strengths lies in its decentralised nature. Biogas plants are inherently local, transforming waste into energy and fertiliser within communities. This creates local jobs, empowers rural economies, and enables citizens to directly participate in the green transition.

At a time when energy costs and geopolitical tensions have shown the fragility of external dependencies, biogases offer something rare: resilient, homegrown, and circular energy.

The technologies exist. The feedstock is available. The industry is mobilised. All that’s missing is the political signal to scale. Europe has a clear choice: continue to underutilise one of its most strategic climate solutions or seize the opportunity to lead the world in renewable, circular energy. The biogases value chain is ready.

Implementation by Countries

Dubai’s clean energy transition has recently taken a major step forward. The Emirate’s main utility, the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), revised the target capacity of its flagship solar project, the Mohammed Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum (MBR) Solar Park, by 45%.

Initially aiming for 5,000 MW by 2030, DEWA increased its target to 7,260 MW. Achieving this target would require an investment of AED50 billion (~$13.6 billion).

With an installed capacity of 3,660 MW, the MBR Solar Park is claimed to be the world’s largest single-site solar facility developed under the independent power producer model. To reach its new target, DEWA has invited international developers to submit expressions of interest for the solar park’s seventh phase, adding another 1,600 MW to the grid.

According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, public-private partnerships have been key to GCC countries’ ability to meet rising power demand while reducing emissions. Governments across the region now routinely leverage private capital and expertise to build large-scale infrastructure as part of a broader shift from state-led energy monopolies.

DEWA’s use of the IPP model has attracted more than AED43.6 billion (~$11.87 billion) in investment over the past decade in Dubai alone. This investment is part of a broader public-private partnership strategy designed to expand capacity and reduce public spending. One of the MBR Solar Park’s earlier phases attracted bids of $0.0299/kWh, then the lowest solar tariff globally.

Elsewhere in the region, Saudi Arabia has embraced the IPP model as part of its Vision 2030 agenda. The Rabigh 2 Solar IPP project, developed by AlJomaih Energy and Water and TotalEnergies, secured a competitive tariff of $1.78kWh for its 300 MW capacity. In June 2024, it was reported that a consortium including ACWA Power, Badeel, and Saudi Aramco’s power division signed agreements worth $3.28 billion to develop three more solar IPPs with a cumulative capacity of 5.5 GW.

In Oman, Petroleum Development Oman awarded contracts for three major renewable projects: the 100 MW North Solar IPP and two 100 MW wind farms, Riyah-1 and Riyah-2. These are a part of Oman’s Vision 2040 strategy, which aims for net-zero emissions by 2050.

In Kuwait, the Al-Zour North gas-fired power project was the country’s first IPP under its public-private partnership program.

Reasons for Growth

The growing preference for the IPP model is not without reason. According to the World Bank, IPPs help reduce execution timelines and ensure commercial discipline, as developers are incentivized to complete projects on time and within budget. This mode contrasts sharply with traditional government-led projects, which are often plagued by delays and cost overruns.

At a strategic level, IPPs are a response to rising energy demand across the region. As countries invest heavily in infrastructure, transportation, and desalination, their energy needs have soared. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), electricity demand in the Middle East grew by nearly 4% in 2024, among the fastest growth rates worldwide.

At the same time, volatile oil revenues have made it harder for governments to finance projects upfront. The IPP model spreads financial risk, attracts foreign direct investment, and enables capital-intensive infrastructure development without burdening state budgets. A World Economic Forum briefing highlighted that this model is particularly well-suited for emerging markets experiencing high growth potential while facing limited fiscal flexibility.

The IPP model typically works as follows: governments sign long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs), ranging from 15 to 25 years, with private developers. These agreements guarantee a fixed price for electricity, giving investors the certainty needed to commit capital. According to IRENA, PPAs have played a critical role in accelerating clean energy deployment worldwide, particularly in markets undergoing liberalization.

However, this model has challenges. According to BloombergNEF, the move toward spot electricity markets and fuel price deregulation could introduce price volatility and undermine investor confidence. State-owned utilities in countries like Saudi Arabia face rising debt burdens, which may constrain their ability to honor long-term offtake guarantees.

By bringing in global best practices and operational efficiencies, IPPs are helping to future-proof infrastructure while also stimulating local economies. The International Finance Corporation has indicated that well-structured IPPs contribute to job creation, capacity building, and industrial diversification.

The IPP model is also being extended beyond electricity. For instance, DEWA’s Hassyan desalination plant, with a capacity of 180 million gallons per day and powered entirely by solar energy, is set to become the world’s largest solar-powered desalination facility.

The region is also beginning to embrace green hydrogen as a critical pillar of its decarbonization agenda. IRENA points out that countries such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia are leveraging their natural gas-based power infrastructure as a launchpad for blue hydrogen production, integrating carbon capture and storage technologies to curb emissions.

Across the GCC, governments are shifting from sole energy infrastructure providers to enablers of private-sector innovation. However, this shift from operator to orchestrator can only succeed if investors feel confident to commit capital—and that confidence, the World Bank warns, depends on clear rules and transparent processes.

Policy Requirements

Attracting private investment at this scale requires more than a robust pipeline of projects. The World Bank notes that investor confidence hinges on clear legal frameworks, good governance, and transparent procurement practices.

The GCC has taken decisive steps in this direction. According to PwC Middle East, recent reforms to commercial laws, such as allowing 100% foreign ownership in strategic sectors, have helped position Dubai as the leading global destination for foreign direct investment in clean energy.

Implementation by Countries

Dubai’s clean energy transition has recently taken a major step forward. The Emirate’s main utility, the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), revised the target capacity of its flagship solar project, the Mohammed Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum (MBR) Solar Park, by 45%.

Initially aiming for 5,000 MW by 2030, DEWA increased its target to 7,260 MW. Achieving this target would require an investment of AED50 billion (~$13.6 billion).

With an installed capacity of 3,660 MW, the MBR Solar Park is claimed to be the world’s largest single-site solar facility developed under the independent power producer model. To reach its new target, DEWA has invited international developers to submit expressions of interest for the solar park’s seventh phase, adding another 1,600 MW to the grid.

According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, public-private partnerships have been key to GCC countries’ ability to meet rising power demand while reducing emissions. Governments across the region now routinely leverage private capital and expertise to build large-scale infrastructure as part of a broader shift from state-led energy monopolies.

DEWA’s use of the IPP model has attracted more than AED43.6 billion (~$11.87 billion) in investment over the past decade in Dubai alone. This investment is part of a broader public-private partnership strategy designed to expand capacity and reduce public spending. One of the MBR Solar Park’s earlier phases attracted bids of $0.0299/kWh, then the lowest solar tariff globally.

Elsewhere in the region, Saudi Arabia has embraced the IPP model as part of its Vision 2030 agenda. The Rabigh 2 Solar IPP project, developed by AlJomaih Energy and Water and TotalEnergies, secured a competitive tariff of $1.78kWh for its 300 MW capacity. In June 2024, it was reported that a consortium including ACWA Power, Badeel, and Saudi Aramco’s power division signed agreements worth $3.28 billion to develop three more solar IPPs with a cumulative capacity of 5.5 GW.

In Oman, Petroleum Development Oman awarded contracts for three major renewable projects: the 100 MW North Solar IPP and two 100 MW wind farms, Riyah-1 and Riyah-2. These are a part of Oman’s Vision 2040 strategy, which aims for net-zero emissions by 2050.

In Kuwait, the Al-Zour North gas-fired power project was the country’s first IPP under its public-private partnership program.

Reasons for Growth

The growing preference for the IPP model is not without reason. According to the World Bank, IPPs help reduce execution timelines and ensure commercial discipline, as developers are incentivized to complete projects on time and within budget. This mode contrasts sharply with traditional government-led projects, which are often plagued by delays and cost overruns.

At a strategic level, IPPs are a response to rising energy demand across the region. As countries invest heavily in infrastructure, transportation, and desalination, their energy needs have soared. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), electricity demand in the Middle East grew by nearly 4% in 2024, among the fastest growth rates worldwide.

At the same time, volatile oil revenues have made it harder for governments to finance projects upfront. The IPP model spreads financial risk, attracts foreign direct investment, and enables capital-intensive infrastructure development without burdening state budgets. A World Economic Forum briefing highlighted that this model is particularly well-suited for emerging markets experiencing high growth potential while facing limited fiscal flexibility.

The IPP model typically works as follows: governments sign long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs), ranging from 15 to 25 years, with private developers. These agreements guarantee a fixed price for electricity, giving investors the certainty needed to commit capital. According to IRENA, PPAs have played a critical role in accelerating clean energy deployment worldwide, particularly in markets undergoing liberalization.

However, this model has challenges. According to BloombergNEF, the move toward spot electricity markets and fuel price deregulation could introduce price volatility and undermine investor confidence. State-owned utilities in countries like Saudi Arabia face rising debt burdens, which may constrain their ability to honor long-term offtake guarantees.

By bringing in global best practices and operational efficiencies, IPPs are helping to future-proof infrastructure while also stimulating local economies. The International Finance Corporation has indicated that well-structured IPPs contribute to job creation, capacity building, and industrial diversification.

The IPP model is also being extended beyond electricity. For instance, DEWA’s Hassyan desalination plant, with a capacity of 180 million gallons per day and powered entirely by solar energy, is set to become the world’s largest solar-powered desalination facility.

The region is also beginning to embrace green hydrogen as a critical pillar of its decarbonization agenda. IRENA points out that countries such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia are leveraging their natural gas-based power infrastructure as a launchpad for blue hydrogen production, integrating carbon capture and storage technologies to curb emissions.

Across the GCC, governments are shifting from sole energy infrastructure providers to enablers of private-sector innovation. However, this shift from operator to orchestrator can only succeed if investors feel confident to commit capital—and that confidence, the World Bank warns, depends on clear rules and transparent processes.

Policy Requirements

Attracting private investment at this scale requires more than a robust pipeline of projects. The World Bank notes that investor confidence hinges on clear legal frameworks, good governance, and transparent procurement practices.

The GCC has taken decisive steps in this direction. According to PwC Middle East, recent reforms to commercial laws, such as allowing 100% foreign ownership in strategic sectors, have helped position Dubai as the leading global destination for foreign direct investment in clean energy.

Governments are also building institutional capacity to support these projects. DEWA tasked its Clean Energy and Water Planning Department with overseeing IPP implementation, managing long-term contracts, and ensuring sound regulatory and risk frameworks are in place.

The legislation consists of 11 separate House committee prints that collectively fulfill the budget resolution’s 10-year spending and savings instructions.
The tax portion of the reconciliation bill also features many short-term tax provisions set to expire after four years.
But since the budget reconciliation process bypasses the filibuster, Republican leaders are hopeful the package will make it to the president’s desk.
“There are certain things the Senate wants to have its imprint on.” House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, cautioned against drastic bill reforms.","Republicans’ mammoth budget reconciliation bill includes major changes to Medicaid, food stamps, student loans and more. It also permanently extends President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts — at a cost of at least $3.3 trillion.

Passing the House Thursday by a razor-thin margin, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act funds large swaths of Trump’s policy agenda while authorizing a $4 trillion debt ceiling hike. The legislation consists of 11 separate House committee prints that collectively fulfill the budget resolution’s 10-year spending and savings instructions.

The bill includes more than $1.5 trillion in savings found by congressional committees. But budget watchdogs say the package, if passed by the Senate without major alterations, will still add anywhere from $3.3 to $5.2 trillion to the national debt and at least $3.2 trillion to the primary deficit by 2035.

Most of the cost stems from the Ways and Means committee’s portion, which deals with codifying most of the sunsetting 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law.

That includes the higher standard deduction for nearly all tax filers, the $2,000 child tax credit – both parents will need a Social Security number to claim it – and the 20% Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction.

American manufacturers would particularly benefit from the legislation, which would allow them to deduct 100% of facility improvement or construction costs. The bill would deal a blow to large universities by increasing endowment taxes, as well as hiking taxes on many private foundations.

Republicans clashed over how high to raise the state and local tax, or SALT, deduction cap, eventually settling on $40,000 for taxpayers earning less than $500,000 annually, via a last-minute Rules Committee amendment.

The tax portion of the reconciliation bill also features many short-term tax provisions set to expire after four years. Those include boosting the maximum standard deduction from $15,000 to $16,000 for single filers and from $30,000 to $32,000 for joint filers. The maximum child tax credit will see a $500 increase and the QBI deduction will rise to 23%.

Other temporary changes lasting until fiscal year 2028 include nixing taxes on tips and overtime, making the adoption tax credit partially refundable, ending interest on loans for American cars, and increasing tax deductions for eligible seniors by $4,000.

While lawmakers on the Ways and Means committee contributed most to the cost of the reconciliation package, the Energy and Commerce committee found the most savings — over $988 billion — primarily via scaling back the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and Medicaid spending.

Energy and Commerce’s addition claws back unobligated funds from the IRA and repeals or phases out more than a dozen IRA renewable energy-related subsidies.

Four tax credits related to alternative fuel vehicles, three credits related to home energy efficiency or “clean” energy sourcing, and the clean hydrogen production credit will end by 2026. After facing pressure from fiscal hawks, the Rules Committee pushed forward the 2032 phaseout deadline for the IRA’s clean electricity production and investment credits to 2028.

Medicaid reforms in the bill include changing program eligibility requirements back to pre-COVID-19 standards, imposing work requirements on most able-bodied adults without dependents, and closing loopholes exploited by states.

The plan also axes federal funding to Planned Parenthood and other reproductive clinics, as well as prevents Medicaid and CHIP funding from going to gender transition procedures on children.

According to the Congressional Budget Office, the changes will save hundreds of billions of dollars and make at least 7.7 million current Medicaid recipients — including 1.4 million people without verified citizenship status — ineligible for Medicaid coverage by 2034. But given the Biden-era 20% spending increase on Medicaid, total program spending will still grow by at least 3% a year for the next decade.

Another last-minute addition by the Rules committee doubled down on Medicaid reforms, accelerating the work requirement deadline to take effect in 2026 and preventing states from implementing new taxes on providers.

House Democrats, none of whom voted for the bill, repeatedly called the Medicaid changes “cruel.” They similarly blasted the Agriculture Committee’s section of the bill, which saves $230 billion by reforming the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

SNAP reforms include requiring states to cover 5% of their SNAP benefit cost share by fiscal year 2028, with their contribution increasing the higher the state’s payment error rate. States have an average payment error rate of 11.68%, as of 2023.

The bill also closes state “waiver gimmicks” that have exempted 84% of able-bodied adult beneficiaries without dependents from SNAP work requirements, plus bans all noncitizens aside from legal permanent residents from receiving benefits.

Trump’s border security and defense priorities received hundreds of billions of additional dollars collectively from the Homeland Security, Judiciary, and Armed Services committees’ portions of the megabill.

The Homeland Security committee authorized approximately $47 billion for the construction of the “Border Barrier System,” a technologically enhanced southern border wall. Roughly $5 billion will go toward building new U.S. Customs and Border Patrol facilities and checkpoints and $6 billion toward border agent workforce and hiring.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement receives a $45 billion funding boost meant for building new detention centers from the Judiciary Committee’s print.

Notably, the bill also imposes new fees on immigrants, implementing a $1,000 minimum fee on migrants seeking asylum and a $500 fee on individuals requesting Temporary Protected Status, which is currently free. Sponsors of unaccompanied migrant children will face a $3,500 charge, while many work permit applications will carry a $550 fee that renews every six months.

The Armed Services committee portion contributes $5 billion to border security efforts, but most of the $150 billion in spending is slated for shipbuilding, restocking munitions, increasing weapon production capacity and nuclear deterrence, and financing the Golden Dome for America project.

While the Transportation and Infrastructure committee gives $22 billion to the Coast Guard and $15 billion to the Federal Aviation Administration for infrastructure modernization, it imposes new fees on electric vehicle owners.

Under the bill, EV owners will have to pay $250 annually as a contribution to the dwindling Highway Trust Fund. Owners of combustion engine vehicles contribute to the HTF every time they fill up their gas tank.

The Natural Resources committee checks the box for Trump’s energy agenda by expanding onshore oil and gas leasing on federal lands, reducing drilling royalty rates to 12.5%, and permanently reinstating coal leasing suspended by Biden.

A final blow to the Biden administration in Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” comes from the Education and Workforce committee’s addition. It axes the 2023 SAVE loan repayment program, which amounted to potentially billions in complete loan forgiveness for thousands of student borrowers.

The legislation also simplifies and shrinks student loan repayment options and penalizes higher education institutions that allow students to take out unaffordable levels of debt. Additionally, it restricts Pell Grant eligibility to students taking more than six credit hours and low-income students in short-term programs.

Under normal Senate filibuster rules, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would have no chance of passing. But since the budget reconciliation process bypasses the filibuster, Republican leaders are hopeful the package will make it to the president’s desk. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is aiming for that to happen by Independence Day.

Senate Republicans are eyeing potentially derailing changes, however, with some senators opposing the IRA and Medicaid cuts – key compromises Johnson made with House hardliners – with others wanting even more spending reductions.

“I think you can improve the product,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said in an interview about the bill with Punchbowl News. “There are certain things the Senate wants to have its imprint on.”

House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, cautioned against drastic bill reforms.

“I’m urging my Senate colleagues to take up our balanced reconciliation package – and only consider changes that further strengthens our fiscal reforms – so we can quickly advance this One Big Beautiful Bill to the President’s desk and deliver for the American people,” he said.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.theintelligencer.net/images/2025/05/26003636/AP25144455278568-750x500.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 02:02:13.179651

More than half the industrial pollution in Lake County comes from Gary Works, which is owned by U.S Steel.
Gary, Indiana, is no exception.
Since 2020, U. S. Steel Gary Works and its employees have donated over $1.3 million dollars to community organizations and efforts.
In the time since the study, technological advances and pollution prevention strategies have led to a further decline in industrial emissions.","Doctors, environmental groups and residents are trying to figure out if there is a causal connection between pollutants from the steel industry and rates of cancer in Gary, Indiana.

Pollutants you can see, and tiny particulates you can't, come from different types of industry in the Gary region. But according to Environmental Protection Agency records, steel production plants release the most toxins of all the industries in the region.

Beryl Fitzpatrick is one of the residents affected. You can hear the cancer as she speaks.

""I was having trouble swallowing,"" she recalled.

Fitzpatrick was diagnosed with Stage 3 tongue cancer. She didn't know if she would ever speak again after doctors removed part of her tongue while removing a cancerous tumor, but she fought to keep her voice.

""I had to learn phonics. I had to learn, I had to learn words and sounds,"" she said. ""It was humbling.""

And she knows the very air in her own backyard could be playing a role in her disease.

""It's almost certain that her place of residence, with the high pollution and other industrial output contributed to her cancer,"" said Dr. Kerstin Stenson, lead of the head and neck cancer program at Rush University Medical Center who's been treating Fitzpatrick.

The City of Gary was built by the steel industry, but when families like Fitzpatrick's moved to the region in droves from the South during the Great Migration for jobs and opportunities, they didn't know as much as we do now about the health risks linked to industrial production.

""A lot of the teachers would talk about students that had asthma,"" Fitzpatrick said.

Seven major coal-powered steel production plants operate in the United States. Three plants are clustered in the Gary region: Burns Harbor, Gary Works and Indiana Harbor.

CBS News Chicago Investigators dug into state and federal data from the Environmental Protection Agency to see how these facilities impact the community.

Our investigation found that in 2023, the latest data available, the three mills emitted 25 million pounds of toxins, more industrial pollution than the combined toxic release of the four similar mills in other states.

""We do not need to sacrifice health and communities to make steel,"" said Hilary Lewis, a director of Industrial Labs.

Industrial Labs, a nonprofit environmental organization, released a report in October 2024 detailing its findings on the steel industry's impact on the community.

""The people in Northwest Indiana are bearing the brunt of the coal-based steel industry today,"" she said.

The study found people living near one steel production facility have a 12% to 26% higher risk of getting cancer. People in Gary live near three.

And cancer isn't the only health risk associated with this kind of industrial exposure.

Industrial Labs' study found people living in Gary are in the top 10% of the nation at risk for developing asthma. Even Gary Mayor Eddie Melton grew up with asthma, and the irony of the steel industry that built the city now being the thing making people sick is not lost on him.

""I mean, that's a stark reality that a lot of folks have to deal with,"" Melton said.

The mayor wants this dealt with, in part, by toughening toxic emissions standards. But that may not happen; in March, the federal EPA announced it's considering lowering some standards polluters must meet.

""What we're seeing from a federal and state government concerns me, in terms of rolling back the regulations on industries such as the steel industry, and other industries,"" Mayor Melton said.

Gary already fails to meet federal air quality standards. Lake County, Indiana has more toxic releases than 99% of all other counties across the country, and the state ranks second in the nation for the most industrial pollution released per square mile.

So what is the EPA doing for the people of Gary?

""They're responsible for protecting clean air,"" Lewis said. ""And right now, they're not doing that.""

CBS News Chicago Investigatiors dug into EPA records dating back to 1977 and found that since then the EPA took 152 formal actions against the steel production facilities. Nearly half of those actions were for violating the Clean Air Act. For those air pollution violations, regulators issued more than $23 million in penalties paid by the parent companies.

""If you're a multi-billion-dollar corporation, fees and fines probably are just a drop in the bucket for you,"" Melton said.

Both the state and federal EPA declined interviews but sent statements saying they act when facilities are out of compliance, and those actions have reduced air emissions.

Fitzpatrick lives about 43 blocks from the largest steel mill in the nation, and we found they released more pollutants than any other steel or iron mill tracked by the EPA across the country.

More than half the industrial pollution in Lake County comes from Gary Works, which is owned by U.S Steel.

U.S. Steel declined an interview, but responded to questions by email, saying the EPA's data includes byproducts ""legally emitted,"" and said they have systems in place to comply with environmental regulations.

In regards to the Industrial Labs report, U.S. Steel said it was ""designed to create media attention rather than reach any scientific conclusions.""

Fitzpatrick has lived in Gary for 60 of her 71 years, never fully knowing what she was exposed to.

""I didn't think I was living a lifestyle that was polluting my body,"" she said.

She wasn't. Dr. Stenson said Fitzpatrick doesn't have the typical risk factors for her cancer. And she's not alone.

""There are many patients that have come from that industrial area that would present with head and neck cancer without risk factors,"" Stenson said.

Gary has been notorious for its pollution for decades.

Dr. Mihir Bhayani, also at Rush University Medical Center, is getting closer to directly linking air pollution and some cancers. The new research he is working on could force change.

""What we are working on currently is, again, a direct causal link between air pollution and head and neck cancer,"" he said.

He believes steel mills are making people sick in Gary, and he wants to see emissions standards toughened.

""So that individuals who are living in those areas, they're exposed to the same clean air that individuals who are living in more affluent areas are,"" he said.

""The types of communities that this industry is impacting are disproportionately people of color and low-income communities,"" said Lewis.

More than 76% of Gary's population is Black, and the average income is less than $23,000 a year.

About four hours away from Gary by car is the steel plant in Middletown, Ohio. It's getting a major portion of a $500 million federal grant to change the steel-making process and cut hazardous pollution in that city, which has an average income of $30,000 a year and is 73% white.

Fitzpatrick believes more would be done to keep the air clean and her community healthy if Gary's demographics were different.

""I am worthy. No matter what you think about my Black skin, my dark skin, I'm worthy. I'm worthy for this community to be cleaned up and I am a person worthy of a good life,"" she said.

Gary and other communities found to be disproportionately impacted by pollution were getting extra help from the federal EPA's Environmental Justice office, but in April it was labeled a DEI program and shut down.

If nothing is done, Bhayani said, there will be long-term effects on people living in communities like Gary.

""They are going to have higher rates of cancer. They're going to have higher rates of cardiac disease. They're going to have high rates of lung disease,"" Bhayani said.

That's why Fitzgerald, who fought for her voice while still battling the disease that nearly took it, said she'll do whatever it takes to make change here so that it can be different for someone else.

""As long as I have breath and I can breathe and I have strength to get up, I'm going to join other people, like-minded people. We're going to fight. We're going to fight,"" she said.

Cleveland Cliffs, which owns two of the plants in Northwest Indiana, did not return messages from CBS News Chicago Investigators. U.S. Steel maintains its work is essential to the health of the American economy.

But Fitzgerald and others who live there worry about their own health, and they're asking lawmakers to step up and join their fight for cleaner air.

The CBS News Race & Culture Unit and CBS News Data team contributed to this report.

FULL STATEMENTS

U.S. Steel

On whether they have studied the impact of releases from Gary Works and the health effects, including cancer and asthma, in the community:

""In 2020, the EPA deemed that there was an ample margin of safety around iron and steel emissions to protect public health and prevent adverse environmental effects.""

It is important to note that there are many industrial facilities in Northwest Indiana. Focusing solely on Gary Works as a source of pollution is both incorrect and irresponsible.

On the study released by Industrial Labs:

""It is clear that these conclusions were pre-determined by a group that describes itself as 'scaling campaigns and building a movement to clean up heavy industry', which is to say that this document is designed to create media attention rather than reach any scientific conclusions. There are certain interests campaigning to eliminate U.S.-based blast furnaces, which are essential to national security and the health of America's economy because they are the only facilities capable of making certain types and qualities of steels required for critical applications.""

On residents believing toxic releases would not be allowed at the same level in more affluent communities with different demographics:

""Federal and state emissions laws and regulations apply equally to any municipality in the same jurisdiction. Gary, Indiana, is no exception. We care deeply about the communities where we live and work, as evidenced by the contributions by the Company and our employees. Since 2020, U. S. Steel Gary Works and its employees have donated over $1.3 million dollars to community organizations and efforts. In addition, our dedicated employees volunteer countless hours of their time to organizations and schools across the area. Our more than 3,400 Gary Works employees put safety and environmental compliance first. We are proud of their work and the Northwest Indiana community we call home.""

""In addition to our spend on environmental compliance and community investment and engagement, we were the only U.S. Metals, Minerals and Mining company recognized as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies for 2025- the fourth consecutive year we received this designation. It is a testament to our commitment to ethical conduct and compliance.""

""Gary Works was built in 1908, and the city was built around it. Any notion that we select certain areas to operate because of their demographics is wholly incorrect.""

On state and federal EPA fines, violations and consent decrees:

""U. S. Steel spends more than $80 million annually on environmental controls in Indiana as part of its commitment to environmental excellence. The EPA's Toxic Release Inventory, from which this data is drawn, includes manufacturing byproducts that are legally emitted under the EPA's stringent regulations and those which are legally disposed of in permitted landfills. As the nation's largest integrated steelmaking facility, it is common sense that U. S. Steel's Gary Works will have more legally allowed releases than smaller iron or steel mills in the country.""

Additional comment on emissions controls and other projects:

""U. S. Steel has robust systems and emissions control equipment at all levels of the steelmaking process to adhere to environmental regulations.

At Gary Works, our processes and environmental controls are monitored extensively by our teams. Third parties are also used for sampling water and for opacity observation to ensure compliance with regulations.

Our partnership with CarbonFree is one of the ways we're working to reduce emissions. This carbon capture and utilization project will help us reduce greenhouse gas emissions by converting emissions to calcium carbonate, which is used in a variety of products for consumers and industry. Gary Works also produces Pig Iron, an important feedstock for U. S. Steel's electric arc furnaces. The Company is on track to meet its goal of 20% greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 2030 goal and has a goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.""

The U.S. EPA does require states to submit a state implementation plan (SIP) for areas in nonattainment within its borders. You can find more information on the SIPs for Lake and Porter counties here: https://www.in.gov/idem/sips/

In 2013, IDEM conducted an assessment of air toxics in the industrialized area of Lake and Porter County. The complete Lakeshore Air Toxics Study is available here: https://www.in.gov/idem/toxic/studies/lakeshore-air-toxics-study. The study found air toxics concentrations and risk within the lakeshore area to be similar to comparable communities, and the most significant risk is attributable to mobile sources (motor vehicles). In the time since the study, technological advances and pollution prevention strategies have led to a further decline in industrial emissions.

We recognize that air quality is a deeply important issue for Northwest Indiana residents and remain committed to our responsibilities under the Clean Air Act and other applicable laws. For more specific responses to questions involving federal enforcement actions, health data, or proposed changes to emission standards, we encourage you to follow up directly with the U.S. EPA.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

EPA is fulfilling its mission to protect human health and the environment. The agency works with our state partners to ensure industrial facilities comply with all environmental laws and regulations.

EPA performs on-site and off-site inspections to ensure compliance. If noncompliance is found, EPA takes action. EPA has issued three recent Clean Air Act enforcement settlements, which have significantly reduced air emissions. In Burns Harbor, Cleveland Cliffs BOF steel making shop and Phoenix Global slag processing companies and in Gary, the U.S. Steel Gary Works' blast furnace have all decreased particulate matter and metal hazardous air pollutants to the atmosphere. Our state partner, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, also conducts inspections and enforcement actions.

Previous compliance and enforcement work, including inspections and enforcement activity, can be found in EPA's ECHO system. You can search by location or by facility. Keep in mind that the integrated iron and steel mills that you reference may have contractors on site that have separate permits and emissions reporting.

The northern portions of Lake and Porter Counties are part of a larger Chicago area that was found to be out of compliance with the ground-level ozone (or ""smog"") standard. Ozone high in the atmosphere protects people from harmful ultraviolet rays but at ground-level it can trigger a variety of health problems, such as lung irritation.

The Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) yesterday urged President William Lai (賴清德) to include energy security in the national security briefing.

Taiwan became a “nuclear-free” nation, after the No. 2 reactor of the Ma-anshan Nuclear Power Plant in Pingtung County’s Hengchun Township (恆春) was decommissioned on May 17.

However, state-run Taiwan Power Co (Taipower) has used two coal-fired generators at the Hsinta Power Plant and is thought to have activated the Talin Power Plant, both decommissioned and in Kaohsiung, prompting concerns over the nation’s power supply.

Lai in his inauguration anniversary speech last week said he would instruct his team to initiate a national security briefing for the heads of the opposition parties, expressing hope that it helps facilitate communications and cooperation between the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and opposition parties.

To truly engage in meaningful communications with the opposition, Lai should include the energy issue in the national security briefing, the KMT said.

The president ignores the issue by focusing on stabilizing electricity prices and supply instead of considering going back to nuclear energy to enhance energy resilience, it said.

Nvidia founder and chief executive officer Jensen Huang (黃仁勳) has also suggested that Taiwan invest in nuclear energy, it said.

Huang on Wednesday last week at a forum on artificial intelligence (AI) said that energy from all sources, including nuclear power, is needed.

“Taiwan should absolutely invest in nuclear, and it shouldn’t be a stigma to have energy,” he said.

AI development requires the government to prioritize diverse energy sources, including nuclear power, the KMT quoted Huang as saying.

An American Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan survey showed that 82 percent of respondents said they were concerned about Taiwan’s energy supply, while local media reported that fossil fuel power generation accounted for up to 92 percent of it, and the nation’s energy security coefficient reached a dangerous high of 0.99, it said.

It also cited American Institute in Taiwan Director Raymond Greene as saying that Taiwan should consider nuclear energy and that Washington would be willing to provide technical support for nuclear development in Taiwan.

Lai is putting Taiwan in jeopardy by driving the nation into a nuclear-free era through the increased use of fossil fuels and the heavy reliance on imported energy at 97 percent, the KMT said.

If there is a regional conflict or disruption in the supply chain, Taiwan would lack the energy resilience it needs to defend itself, the party added.

While great powers such as the US are restarting nuclear reactors to cement their energy security and resilience, Lai chose to go against the trend, not only acting “irresponsibly” and risking domestic economic development, but also risking national security, it said.

The US has 96 active nuclear reactors, and 22 of them are expected to run for 80 years, while Japan has restarted 14 nuclear reactors, with the lifetime of eight of them extended to 60 years, it said.

The UK extended the lifetime of its four oldest nuclear power plants for at least 10 years to ensure energy supply, it said.

Finland has extended the lifetime of the Loviisa Nuclear Power Plant by 20 years until 2047, and Canada has revamped its Bruce Nuclear Generating Station, which is planned to run operations until 2064, it added.

Given that the annual growth rate of AI-related power demand is projected to be 25 percent to 30 percent, Lai is choking the future of Taiwan, the KMT said.

To follow the global trend and respond to people’s needs, the KMT has proposed amendments to the Nuclear Reactor Facilities Regulation Act (核子反應器設施管制法) to facilitate a return to nuclear energy, it said.

Separately, Taiwan People’s Party Chairman Huang Kuo-chang (黃國昌) yesterday said the alleged secret operation of decommissioned fossil fuel power plants rang an alarm bell about the DPP’s energy policy.

Many industrial leaders such as Pegatron Corp chairman Tung Tzu-hsien (童子賢) have urged the government to invest in energy, because stable power supply is crucial to industrial developments, and electricity use in households and small businesses, Huang added.

Since the mid-1950s, South Dakota has generated significant energy from its four hydroelectric power plants on the Missouri River.
At the end of 2024, South Dakota was home to 1,417 turbines able to generate about 3,600 MW of energy.

A recent check of NextEra’s website revealed 396 job openings, with 185 related specifically to wind energy.","MITCHELL — Matthew Pearson found a successful career in the wind energy industry purely by chance.

After graduating from high school in Vermillion, Pearson knew he didn’t want to pursue a four-year degree and instead scrolled through the list of majors offered at Mitchell Tech, one of the state’s four technical colleges.

“When I came to the wind energy program, I thought, ‘Well, that sounds kind of cool,’” Pearson, 28, recalled during a recent interview at Mitchell Tech, the only South Dakota college with a designated wind energy major.

He didn’t know it at the time, but Pearson had stumbled into one of the fastest-growing, highest-paying trade fields in the state and nation.

While workforce shortages plague many industries and employers in the Rushmore State, great opportunities abound for skilled workers to build, operate and maintain renewable energy facilities, including at wind farms. Meanwhile, strong partnerships between technical colleges, employers and the Build Dakota Scholarship program have forged a ready pathway to quickly and effectively fill the need for energy workers.

Pearson obtained a Build Dakota Scholarship that paid all tuition for a two-year wind technology degree, then spent about $15,000 to complete another two-year major in electrical construction.

After graduation, he quickly landed a job wiring wind towers at locations around the country. He was initially paid about $80,000 a year, and after six years was making $127,000 plus a daily living fee of $140.

But now, with a fiancee and two children, Pearson is completing a circle by leaving field work and returning to Mitchell Tech to become its only wind energy program instructor.

Pearson said that in addition to teaching the skills needed to thrive in the renewable energy field, he’ll also share the good news about their job prospects.

“There’s been a steady uptick in the need for workforce,” he said. “When I would get to a jobsite, there would be three or four companies there, and they’d always come over and ask, ‘Hey, you want to come work for us instead?’”

77% of state’s power from renewable energy

South Dakota is among the top three states nationally in percentage of energy generated from renewable sources, leaving it well positioned to provide both jobs in the field and trainers like Pearson who will help meet demand for workers.

About 77% of the power used in the state comes from non-fossil fuel sources, largely from water and wind, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The state has three solar farms but no plans filed for more.

Since the mid-1950s, South Dakota has generated significant energy from its four hydroelectric power plants on the Missouri River.

And over roughly the past 15 years, the state has seen a tenfold increase in wind energy production, according to the state Public Utilities Commission. That growth has created a healthy number of construction and maintenance jobs.

In 2009, the state had 190 turbines capable of producing about 350 megawatts of electricity. At the end of 2024, South Dakota was home to 1,417 turbines able to generate about 3,600 MW of energy. The PUC also approved a 68-turbine project with a capacity of 260 MW and a $621 million price tag near Clear Lake in March.

“We’ve had just a tremendous expansion of wind energy in South Dakota,” said Chris Nelson, a PUC commissioner. “Today, though, we’re in a little bit of a lull.”

The expected slowdown is due to a lack of transmission lines capable of carrying more power, most of which heads east out of the state, Nelson said.

Despite the infrastructure challenges, renewable energy still has a bright future, he said. Two nonprofit energy consortiums that manage the power grid in the upper Midwest plan to spend a combined $37 billion to expand transmission capacity, including in South Dakota, over roughly the next decade.

Two majors, 100% job placement

At Lake Area Technical College in Watertown, students are offered two energy-related degree tracks, said president Tiffany Sanderson.

The energy technology major provides training in development and maintenance of energy systems, and the energy operations degree is aimed at managing an energy facility.

“In our energy programs, those are students interested in working with their hands and solving engineering or process-oriented problems,” she said. “They’re very mechanically minded and can figure out how to make sure power is produced reliably so people don’t have delays in service.”

During a recent tour of the technology labs, students used 3D printers, developed and analyzed system efficiency and worked on unique projects like a solar-powered ice fishing shanty.

The two programs have about two dozen students combined, Sanderson said. In the 2023 graduating class, 100% of all graduates were employed within six months, with average salaries of $65,000 a year in the technology major and $69,000 a year in operations.

“That is for their first jobs in the industry, so those are tremendous opportunities for a brand new graduate with two years of college education,” she said.

‘Crazy’ number of jobs available

In May, Nathaniel Bekaert will become one of those new graduates from Lake Area Tech.

Bekaert, 28, grew up on a farm and came to the college after six years in the U.S. Army, which paid for almost all of his tuition, fees and equipment costs.

After touring the Gavins Point Dam hydroelectric plant in Yankton on the Nebraska border and interning at the Big Stone Power Plant near the Minnesota border, Bekaert was sold on the idea of working as a mechanic in the energy field.

“The more you learn, the more you want to dive into it,” he said.

“The amount of energy companies coming in looking for workers is crazy, and you can’t really grasp how many companies are looking for energy students,” he said. “There are a dozen or more companies within 45 minutes from here that are actively looking for technicians and operators or people with some type of energy degree.”

As a native of the Watertown area, Bekaert has accepted a job close to home as a wind technician at the Crowned Ridge wind farm northeast of the city, where he will make $29 an hour plus a $5,000 signing bonus and a $200 annual stipend for work boots.

Crowned Ridge is operated by NextEra Energy, a Florida-based company that runs wind farms across the country. A recent check of NextEra’s website revealed 396 job openings, with 185 related specifically to wind energy.

“No matter what happens with fossil fuels, we can keep going (with renewable energy) and live off that, and it will benefit everybody in the world. And we won’t have to rely on another country,” Bekaert said of his career choice.

A systematic approach to workforce development

The South Dakota technical school system, which also includes campuses in Sioux Falls and Rapid City, has developed a close working relationship with the energy industry to ensure students learn the right skills and employers can tap into a pipeline of well-trained workers.

Lake Area Tech officials go into local public schools to promote energy and other trade jobs starting in elementary grades, Sanderson said.

At Mitchell Tech, vice president for enrollment services Clayton Deuter said the college now offers a one-year wind energy degree instead of a two-year program, a change made after energy companies said some skills taught in the longer program could be obtained on the job instead.

Deuter said the energy programs at Mitchell Tech are an easy sell to students and their parents due to the low cost compared to a four-year college and the availability of Build Dakota scholarships in which students get tuition paid if they work in South Dakota for three years after graduation.

Mitchell Tech also offers a dual-enrollment program to high school students so they can have a wind energy degree from the college in hand by the time they graduate.

“You think about return on investment, and here you can take one year in the wind turbine program and you can graduate and make $80,000 to $100,000 a year,” Deuter said. “With student loan debt being so crazy, you don’t have to bankrupt yourself financially and be tethered to a student loan payment when you’re trying to buy a house and start a family.”

One of the state’s biggest renewable energy employers is Marmen Energy in Brandon. The Canadian-owned company has 285 employees who build wind towers up to 300-feet tall that are shipped to wind farms nationwide.

Aimee Miritello, human resources manager, said the company’s relationships with high schools and technical colleges form a pillar of its worker recruitment strategy to overcome a nagging lack of workers in the trade fields.

“Historically for us that has been one of our best ways of getting qualified employees,” she said.

Marmen has expanded its South Dakota plant to accommodate what Miritello said has been a steady increase in demand for wind towers across the country.

Marmen workers, who include welders, painters and other construction tradespeople, make a good wage, are offered one of the best benefit packages in the region and have strong opportunities for internal advancement, she said.

“Plus, they’re a part of making huge wind towers, so their pride in that is pretty big,” she said.",https://aberdeen-insider-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/23085603/2025-4-8-Mitchell-Tech-instructor-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 00:03:33.167586

In a recent interview with Mark, Executive Editor of Caijing Magazine, Li Zhenguo, founder and president of LONGi addressed market concerns regarding the company’s market structure, technological roadmap selection, and the competitive landscape of the photovoltaic (PV) industry.

Below are key excerpts:

1. Market Structure

Q: Industry Fundamentals Remain Unchanged: Why Is LONGi Confident About Growth?

Li Zhenguo: In 2024, LONGi implemented three major adjustments. First, we achieved breakthroughs in second-generation BC (Back Contact) cell technology. By the second half of 2025, we'll achieve 50GW proprietary BC cell capacity plus about 10GW through partnerships, totaling 60GW—making this the world’s most advanced mass-produced PV product. Second, we optimized organizational efficiency by eliminating redundancies and enhancing team capabilities. Third, the company clarified its strategic positioning beyond module manufacturing. It will continue to expand scenario-based applications, including solar energy storage solutions and development of hydrogen-ammonia-methanol projects.

2. Technology Roadmap Selection

Q: Why is LONGi confident about BC cells despite market doubts?

Li Zhenguo: The physics principle is straightforward: front-side grid lines obstruct sunlight. By relocating electrodes to the backside, BC cells eliminate shading losses, boosting efficiency. However, technical complexity and high costs previously deterred industry adoption. LONGi spent 7-8 years innovating to overcome these challenges. BC technology represents a milestone in PV history, surpassing monocrystalline silicon in technical difficulty.

Q: Are BC cell costs and yields resolved?

Li Zhenguo: Fully resolved. Our second-gen BC products now achieve yields exceeding 98%, comparable or superior to TOPCon. The BC’s cost metrics will become evident in Q3/Q4 financial reports. Notably, BC’s co-planar electrode design enables easier bypass configurations, unexpectedly enhancing module safety—an advantage we initially overlooked. We project BC cells will capture over 30% market share by 2028 and exceed 50% by 2030.

Q: Contingency plans if BC underperforms?

Li Zhenguo: There is no scenario where “BC technology might fail” because we will pursue superior solutions and newer technological breakthroughs. Over the past seven to eight years, while first-generation BC products met all projected technical benchmarks, TOPCon advanced at a faster pace, making BC appear less competitive initially. However, through continuous exploration and research, our second-generation BC products have now matured and outperformed TOPCon. Future iterations will deliver even higher efficiency. Although first-gen BC lacked mass production competitiveness, it established critical technological foundations for the BC platform, enabling the smooth launch of second-gen products.

LONGi adheres to a principle we call “broad research, focused implementation.” This means maintaining parallel exploration of multiple technological pathways during R&D. Therefore, there is no “dead end” for BC technology—we are simultaneously developing alternative solutions as well.

Q: What’s next after BC technology?

Li Zhenguo: Monocrystalline silicon cells approach their theoretical 29.4% efficiency limit, with labs nearing 28% and mass production at ~27%. Tandem cells emerge as the next frontier for cost reduction. However, perovskite tandem technology remains immature, with engineering feasibility still unproven.

3. Competitive Advantages of China's PV Industry

Q: How has China's PV industry achieved such a leading global position?

Li Zhenguo: This achievement stems from the relentless dedication of China's PV professionals and reflects our nation's industrious spirit. Additionally, PV technology has largely remained open-source over the past decade. Innovations quickly become industry-wide common knowledge, with new technologies disseminated throughout the entire sector via equipment and raw material suppliers.

Music Therapy is an evidence-based healthcare profession that can help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, ease pain, and improve communication and social skills.
By establishing a license for music therapy, Pennsylvania could regain approximately $7 million by retaining graduates and $135.4 million by enabling music therapists to bill appropriately, according to the Pennsylvania Music Therapy Task Force.
Of Pennsylvania's 67 counties, at least 60 are blocked from reimbursed music therapy services with BH-MCOs.","May 25--WILKES-BARRE -- U.S. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pittsburgh, this week joined 26 of his colleagues to introduce the Strengthening Medicare and Reducing Taxpayer (SMART) Prices Act.

The bill, led by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Sen. Peter Welch (D-VT), would expand Medicare's ability to negotiate lower drug prices for consumers, reduce federal spending, and give the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) stronger tools to negotiate lower drug costs in Medicare Part B and Part D.

Pennsylvania seniors fill more than 100 million prescriptions every year -- this bill means they'll finally get a fair shake at the pharmacy counter. In addition, taxpayers will see serious savings.

According to preliminary estimates from West Health and Verdant Research, if the SMART Prices Act were to be enacted in 2026, it would save 33% more by 2030 than current law. It would also allow Medicare to begin negotiations earlier and bring down the price of more expensive drugs.

""No one should have to choose between medicine and groceries. Multi-billion-dollar drug corporations are making obscene profits off of seniors and working families struggling just to get by,"" Fetterman said. ""The SMART Prices Act is not complicated: it will boost Medicare's ability to negotiate fair deals with pharmaceutical companies and bring drug prices down. Big Pharma lobbyists might hate it, but regular people sure as hell won't.""

This legislation builds on provision included in the Inflation Reduction Act that empowered Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices for the first time, unleashing the power of 53 million seniors enrolled in Medicare Part D Drug Coverage.

The SMART Prices Act would extend this progress by more than doubling the number of prescription drugs Medicare must negotiate to a minimum of 50 per year, allowing the costliest prescription drugs and biologics to have negotiated prices five years after approval by the Food and Drug Administration, and by increasing the discount that Medicare is allowed to negotiate.

DCED invests more than $22.6M to help schools

Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED) Secretary Rick Siger this week announced an investment of more than $22.6 million in 74 schools across Pennsylvania through the Solar for Schools Grant Program -- which is administered by DCED and funded through the Commonwealth Financing Authority (CFA).

Program grants will help schools to cover the purchase and installation of equipment, permit fees, energy storage, and utility interconnection.

""Energy is one of the top expenses for schools, which is why investments in solar energy can help to maintain long-term financial stability and improve the quality of education they offer students,"" Siger said. ""Those savings can then be channeled into more resources for our teachers and students, and also create good-paying clean-energy jobs and job training opportunities.""

School districts, intermediate units, area career and technical schools, charter schools, cyber charter schools, chartered schools for the education of the deaf or blind, community colleges, The Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology, and The Pennsylvania College of Technology were eligible to apply for the grants.

""Schools across Pennsylvania face tight budgets, and energy costs are one additional expense among a myriad of others,"" said Acting Secretary of Education Dr. Carrie Rowe.

Luzerne County: $400,000 to the Hanover Area School District to install solar panels to the district's high school. The district estimates the solar project will reduce its energy costs by 78%, reduce carbon emissions by approximately 100 metric tons annually, and serve as an educational tool for over 2,300 students to learn about renewable energy and its benefits.

Legislation introduced to license music therapists

Music therapists in Pennsylvania could be professionally licensed by the Commonwealth, bringing significant economic and therapeutic benefits to families and communities under new legislation introduced by state Sen. Elder Vogel, Jr., R-47, and Sen. Carolyn Comitta, D-19.

The bipartisan legislation -- Senate Bill 579 -- would establish a board certification exam, continuing education requirements, and a code of ethics for trained music therapists to receive professional licensure under the State Board of Social Workers, Marriage and Family Therapists, and Professional Counselors.

""For years, I have been pushing for Pennsylvania to establish state licensure for music therapists to provide another avenue for those in need of therapy services,"" Vogel said. ""Due to not having state licensure, most patients are denied insurance coverage for this therapy and music therapists then are limited in job opportunities here in the Commonwealth and seek employment elsewhere. Patients are losing out on a beneficial health care option and Pennsylvania is losing out on family-sustaining jobs and generating economic revenue. I am happy to introduce this legislation again and continue to fight for this important treatment option for those who can truly benefit from it.""

""Music therapy can be a powerful tool to promote healing, well-being, and recovery. And licensing our highly trained music therapists will not only reduce public health costs and improve access to care, but it will also boost our economy, increase tax revenue, and help create jobs,"" said Comitta, who serves on the Senate Education Committee.

""I'm proud to partner with Sen. Vogel on this legislation. I also want to recognize state Rep. Eddie Day Pashinski, D-Wilkes-Barre, who championed this issue in the House. I appreciate their efforts and the work of all our music therapists and advocates in communities across the Commonwealth.""

Music Therapy is an evidence-based healthcare profession that can help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, ease pain, and improve communication and social skills.

Pennsylvania is home to the largest number of higher education programs in the country for music therapy, yet professional licensure for music therapists is not currently offered in the Commonwealth.

By establishing a license for music therapy, Pennsylvania could regain approximately $7 million by retaining graduates and $135.4 million by enabling music therapists to bill appropriately, according to the Pennsylvania Music Therapy Task Force.

In addition, most insurance companies and Behavioral Health Managed Care Organizations (BH-MCOs) deny coverage to music therapists because they lack state licensure, even when they are nationally board-certified. Of Pennsylvania's 67 counties, at least 60 are blocked from reimbursed music therapy services with BH-MCOs. As a result, employers lose approximately $128,752 per music therapist, adding up to more than $93 million in lost revenue annually for Pennsylvania businesses, healthcare facilities, and therapy practices, according to the task force.

Senate Bill 579 represents a significant opportunity to retain professional talent, expand health care access, and capture substantial economic value currently forfeited to neighboring states with more developed regulatory frameworks.

Pennsylvania is currently home to more than 600 music therapists serving 49,000 residents each year. They assist clients with a variety of clinical needs, including Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorders, cerebrovascular accidents (strokes), dementia, depression, developmental and intellectual differences, Parkinson's disease, post-traumatic stress disorders, terminal illnesses, traumatic brain injuries, visual impairments, and more.

Senate Bill 579 is before the Senate Consumer Affairs and Professional Licensure Committee. It is co-sponsored by 14 senators from both sides of the aisle.

There is companion legislation in the House, House Bill 563, sponsored by Pashinski.

Carbon capture is set to play a key role in decarbonising the cement and concrete industry, says Jan Theulen, Group Lead Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) at Heidelberg Materials, one of the world's largest cement makers.

The company’s strategy combines the use of biogenic waste as fuel with CO₂ capture to pave the way for climate-neutral concrete. But to scale carbon capture and storage (CCS), technical innovation alone won’t be enough — a coordinated approach to CO₂ transport and storage infrastructure is also crucial, Theulen told Clean Energy Wire.

Clean Energy Wire: Many experts say that carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies should mainly be used for hard-to-abate sectors, where it is difficult to lower carbon intensity. What role does CCS play in the cement industry?

Jan Theulen: First of all, the cement industry is a large emitter. We have substantial emissions because there is a lot of concrete being used in society, and its production comes with emissions that are unavoidable: There is a large portion of process-related CO2 that is coming from the raw materials. We are using calcium carbonate which is then transformed to calcium oxide. This process releases CO2. The calcium oxide is part of clinker. From grinding the clinker, you get cement – the “glue” in concrete.

We try to use as little clinker as possible in cement. We take a lot of measures to substitute clinker with other cementitious materials like fly ash, blast-furnace slag or other pozzolans. And we are making good progress in continuously reducing our carbon footprint.

Another source of emissions are the fuels used in the furnaces. We will further reduce our carbon footprint by replacing fossil fuels with alternative fuels coming from non-recyclable waste with biogenic content. But there will be a remaining fraction of CO2 emissions which we cannot avoid. For that fraction CCUS is the only solution to reach net zero.

Would you say that it is even possible to produce cement in a climate neutral way?

Yes, definitely. There are already binders on the market which are carbon neutral. You can make a carbon neutral binder from waste ashes. You do not call it cement because there is no clinker in it. It works in a somewhat similar way – but it does not come with the same strength properties as normal cement. Also, the materials needed for carbon neutral binders are scarce.

Therefore, we have to come up with other solutions to decarbonize large volumes of cement and concrete. In that sense, CCS is the only possibility to produce net-zero cement and concrete. First, you avoid emissions as I explained. Then you capture the remaining CO2. Our project in Brevik will be the first to deliver net-zero cement and concrete to the market in large volumes. CCS can be scaled up to large volumes. That is the big difference to other concepts on the market.

From a technological point of perspective, it is impossible to have a 100 percent capture rate of CO2. Are you offsetting the fraction of emissions that you cannot capture to live up to the claim of carbon neutrality?

No, we are not using offsetting. The biogenic fraction of the waste that we co-process in our cement kilns is quite considerable. This leads to biogenic CO2 molecules in the flue gas which are already ‘neutral.’ Nevertheless, we catch them.

If you catch 95 percent of the CO2 in flue gas, but that flue gas already contains ten percent ‘neutral’ CO2 from biogenic content, then you stand at minus five percent at the end. You could even produce a slightly carbon negative clinker. That is not offsetting. Offsetting is for example planting trees. We do not think that this can be a solution for our industry. We need to solve our own issue with our own installations.

There is a demand for biomass from many sectors. With the huge cement industry that we have today, is there enough biogenic material?

We are not using pure, virgin biomass in general. Pure biomass like wood chips or pure byproducts from the agricultural sector are not our feedstock. Instead, in our plants we use waste-derived fuels, such as municipal waste: The recyclable part has already been recycled. But a fraction remains that is not economically possible to recycle. That is a mix of some plastics, some textiles, some organic waste, some small wood pieces, maybe a little bit of paper. The mixture usually has 40-50 percent biogenic content. Our kilns can operate with this mixture since we are using it for thermal purposes. Other sectors have different needs, so our feedstock needs are not in conflict with other demands.

Do any active carbon capture projects in the cement production exist today?

Until today, mainly pilot projects have been realised on different scales. There is no carbon capture project with storage connected to it in the cement industry yet. In that sense the project in Brevik will be the first in the world. There are projects where some CO2 is captured either for demonstration purposes or for utilisation. We are also working on such a project in Germany to capture CO2 and to make food-grade CO2 for the market. But these are the smaller volumes.

It is not like turning the knob and up it will go. We still have a lot of work to do to run it in an optimised way.

Jan Theulen, group lead CCUS at Heidelberg Materials

Heidelberg Materials is a huge company in the cement business and at the forefront of today's implementation of CCS. Where do you stand regarding the maturity of the carbon capture technology?

We feel very confident about the technology because we started testing it already ten years ago at our Brevik plant in Norway. We have learnt a lot, we have built this unit, we have seen other facilities of the same technology at other power stations. We feel very confident.

But it is not like turning the knob and up it will go. We still have a lot of work to do to run it in an optimised way. It is a journey. We will learn a lot and we will learn from any challenges along the way.

Isn't that a rather big bet on technologies that are not yet mature if you plan with CCS to become climate neutral in your production, or maybe even across all operations of your company?

I would not put it like this. It is a new technology for us in the cement business. We need to master implementation in our sector, but the amine capture technology has been successfully applied on multiple installations around the world for many years. We are now testing our own cement-based oxyfuel technology. In terms of technology, we are not jumping to the Mars. It is really manageable. We have to make a business case out of it and get it done in an affordable way. That is the next stage we are working on.

What are technological challenges you are still facing?

A carbon capture unit requires substantial energy. That obviously comes with costs and resource needs. We are working to optimise this.

At Brevik we have done it by using a lot of waste heat from the plant. We will only capture 50 percent of the CO2 because this capture rate is in balance with the available waste heat from our own clinker production process. That means we do not need to burn natural gas to operate the desorber of the amine capture system. We are looking now for further methodologies to scale it up. The next projects will treat 100 percent of the flue gas and then capture around 95 percent. We try to limit the energy demand and that is where the big learnings come from.

The second most important learning is about the purity of the CO2 that you capture. You must meet certain specifications so that the pipeline does not run into troubles with erosion or corrosion.

You also plan a carbon capture project in Germany. Here, you want to sell the captured carbon for use. Does that mean you also sell the responsibility for the emissions?

No. In our project in Lengfurt with Linde we will capture CO2 and purify it to a food grade quality. Linde then sells it to their customers. The typical customer from Linde will not store the CO2, they use it for cooling, for sparkling water or similar purposes. Of course, once it is used, it is released again, meaning CO2 is emitted. For that we still have to submit allowances in the EU Emissions Trading System. We are responsible and we pay. Only when you store the CO2 permanently you are released from that obligation.

Aside from the technological part, you also spoke about the economic challenges. What does Heidelberg Materials need to ramp up the CCS technology?

A couple of things. We are working hard to bring the capture cost down with a more efficient capture technology. That is where we as engineers work on.

An important part in the value chain is the transport and storage of CO2. Particularly for the transport of CO2 it is important that a pipeline infrastructure will be developed in Europe. It is not always possible to transport the CO2 by ship as it is done in Brevik which is located at the coast. For many cement plants and other industrial emitters, it is way more efficient to create a CO2 pipeline infrastructure. This is something that must be initiated and promoted by governments because the infrastructure is created for multiple users and not only for us.

In addition, governments should incentivise buying sustainable products. We are selling the world’s first carbon captured net-zero cement, evoZero. This product makes net-zero construction possible.

Then we need a higher ETS price as a driver of the CCS ramp-up. Last but not least, our industry increasingly pays for ETS allowances, as free allowances are phased out from 2026 onward. The revenues from CO2 pricing should be re-injected to support the industry to decarbonise.",https://www.reccessary.com/data/news/cover/1747994272264851857.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 03:04:54.411938

In a 51-44 party-line vote, the Republican-controlled Senate voted on Thursday to revoke federal waivers that permit California to establish vehicle emission standards stricter than federal rules. The measure, which has passed the House of Representatives, now awaits President Donald Trump's signature.

The congressional action represents the first time in more than six decades that lawmakers have moved to block California's vehicle emission standards, marking a dramatic escalation in the ongoing national debate over electric vehicle policy and state regulatory authority.

California Governor Gavin Newsom immediately condemned the Senate vote, declaring that ""zero-emission vehicles are here to stay"". California's Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that the state would file a lawsuit against the Trump administration, calling the congressional action unlawful.

The revoked waivers, granted by the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, under the Joe Biden administration, include an electric vehicle mandate and two rules targeting diesel truck emissions. Under California's mandate, 35 percent of new vehicles sold in the state must be of zero emissions by 2026, with the rate escalating to 68 percent by 2030 and reaching 100 percent by 2035.

The authority for California's emission standards traces back to the 1970 Clean Air Act, which granted the state special regulatory powers due to its unique air quality challenges. However, implementation requires EPA approval for standards exceeding federal requirements.

The Clean Air Act also allows other states to adopt California's emission standards. Eleven other states have adopted California's electric vehicle mandate, while a growing number embrace the state's more stringent regulations.

Republican lawmakers and industry supporters said the mandates are costly and impractical and prevent consumers and businesses from making their own choices. ""US carmakers and auto dealers argued that keeping in place the waiver … could cripple the industry by forcing sales of cars the public doesn't want in mass numbers,"" said the Senate's report.

The American Petroleum Institute, representing oil industry interests, has repeatedly challenged California's stricter rules through lawsuits, saying that electric vehicle mandates reduce consumer options while increasing vehicle costs.

Opposition voiced

Environmental and public health organizations strongly opposed the Senate action, warning of severe consequences for air quality and climate objectives. More than 100 environmental and public health groups said in an April letter to Congress that blocking California's standards would result in over 1.5 million metric tons of nitrogen oxides, 17,700 metric tons of fine particles, and 1.6 billion metric tons of climate-harming emissions being released into the atmosphere.

""More pollution means more children suffering asthma attacks and missing school, more grandparents dying prematurely, and more death and destruction from extreme weather,"" the groups warned.

The Union of Concerned Scientists described the congressional move as ""illegitimate"", while the Zero Emission Transportation Association, representing electric automakers, called the waiver repeal ""an extraordinary action that sets a dangerous precedent"".

Trump, a Republican, had repeatedly pledged to revoke the waivers granted to California before he assumed office in January. During his first term, Trump revoked California's waiver in 2019, a move that was later reversed by the administration of Biden, a Democrat, in 2022.

The use of the Congressional Review Act to revoke California's waivers is new, as last time Congress was not involved. Both the Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian, serving as neutral arbiters of procedural rules, have determined that California's waivers cannot be legally repealed through this mechanism.

While describing the congressional action as ""totally norm-busting"", Ann Carlson, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, told CalMatters, a nonprofit news organization, that Congress is ""willing to use a statute that doesn't apply, which is highly unusual"".

Patrick Drupp, director of climate policy at the Sierra Club, told The Washington Post the move is “reprehensible” and designed to “curry favor and earn some brownie points with the fossil-fuel industry.”

The rule comes after a 2022 Supreme Court decision that said the EPA can’t force utilities to shut down coal plants and switch to renewable energy sources.

The Trump administration’s new rule will also overturn rules introduced in President Joe Biden’s final year in office, which sought to limit U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.

“Many have voiced concerns that the last administration’s replacement for that rule is similarly overreaching and an attempt to shut down affordable and reliable electricity generation in the United States, raising prices for American families, and increasing the country’s reliance on foreign forms of energy,” an EPA spokesperson said in a statement to The Independent.

The proposal will be published after an interagency review and approval from EPA chief Lee Zeldin, the spokesperson said.

“In reconsidering the Biden-Harris rule that ran afoul of Supreme Court case law, we are seeking to ensure that the agency follows the rule of law while providing all Americans with access to reliable and affordable energy,” Zeldin said in a statement.

The rule will likely face legal challenges once it’s official, but some say it could open the door for further deregulation.

The Environmental Protection Agency is drafting a plan to end all limits on greenhouse gases emitted by coal and gas-fired power plants, The New York Times reports.

The agency argues that the greenhouse gases emitted by these plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution,” according to a draft plan reviewed by the newspaper.

However, fossil fuels are the “single largest industrial source of climate destabilizing carbon dioxide in the U.S.,” according to Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund. The United States is one of the world’s top greenhouse gas producers —second only to China.

The new rule is “an abuse of the E.P.A.’s responsibility under the law,” Patton said.

The agency sent the draft to the White House on May 2, and it’s expected to be released in June, according to The Times.

Climate scientists say the potential move is “deeply concerning.”

“If true, this is a deeply concerning move from the Trump EPA,” according to Dr. Gretchen Goldman, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Among the measures included are a reorganisation and cuts to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and an order for licence decisions on the construction and operation of new reactors to be taken within a maximum 18 months.

The president was joined in the Oval Office on Friday afternoon for the announcements by representatives from the US nuclear industry and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, who is Chairman of the National Energy Dominance Council, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.

A White House statement summarising the impact of the orders, said: “Today’s executive orders allow for reactor design testing at DOE labs, clear the way for construction on federal lands to protect national and economic security, and remove regulatory barriers by requiring the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to issue timely licensing decisions.”

‘Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base’

The executive order Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base‘s purpose is described as: “The United States originally pioneered nuclear energy technology during a time of great peril. We now face a new set of challenges, including a global race to dominate in artificial intelligence, a growing need for energy independence, and access to uninterruptible power supplies for national security … as American deployment of advanced reactor designs has waned, 87 percent of nuclear reactors installed worldwide since 2017 are based on designs from two foreign countries. At the same time, the Nation’s nuclear fuel cycle infrastructure has severely atrophied, leaving the United States heavily dependent on foreign sources of uranium as well as uranium enrichment and conversion services. These trends cannot continue.

“Swift and decisive action is required to jumpstart America’s nuclear energy industrial base and ensure our national and economic security by increasing fuel availability and production, securing civil nuclear supply chains, improving the efficiency with which advanced nuclear reactors are licensed, and preparing our workforce to establish America’s energy dominance and accelerate our path towards a more secure and independent energy future.”

It aims to strengthen the domestic fuel cycle with a report required within 240 days to “recommended national policy to support the management of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste and the development and deployment of advanced fuel cycle capabilities to establish a safe, secure, and sustainable long-term fuel cycle”. This includes “recommendations for the efficient use of the uranium, plutonium, and other products recovered through recycling and reprocessing; recommendations for the efficient disposal of the wastes generated by recycling or reprocessing through a permanent disposal pathway; a recommended process for evaluating, prior to disposal, nuclear waste materials for isotopes of value to national security, or medical, industrial, and scientific sectors”.

It also calls for a programme “to develop methods and technologies to transport, domestically and overseas, used and unused advanced nuclear fuels and advanced nuclear reactors containing such fuels in a safe, secure, and environmentally sound manner, including any legislation required to support this initiative” and within 120 days the Energy Secretary “shall develop a plan to expand domestic uranium conversion capacity and expand enrichment capabilities sufficient to meet projected civilian and defense reactor needs for low enriched uranium (LEU), high enriched uranium (HEU) and high assay, low enriched uranium (HALEU), subject to retention of such stockpiles as are necessary for tritium production, naval propulsion, and nuclear weapons”.

There will also be an end to the general “surplus plutonium dilute and dispose” programme and instead a programme will be established to dispose of surplus plutonium by processing and making it available to industry in a form that can be utilised for the fabrication of fuel for advanced nuclear technologies, the order says.

There will also be energy-defence department work to “assess the feasibility of restarting or repurposing closed nuclear power plants as energy hubs for military microgrid support, consistent with applicable law, focusing initially on installations with insufficient power resilience or grid fragility”.

There is also a section on expanding the nuclear energy workforce, saying that “within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Education shall seek to increase participation in nuclear energy-related Registered Apprenticeships and Career and Technical Education programs”.

Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy

The Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy executive order says “commercial deployment of new nuclear technologies has all but stopped. The Idaho National Laboratory has principal responsibility for constructing and testing new reactor designs; it concluded construction of new reactors in the 1970s. Our proud history of innovation has succumbed to overregulated complacency”.

It adds “the United States needs a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive development of advanced technologies, manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain modern life and national security. Nuclear energy both is vital to this effort and has never held so much promise … advanced reactors – including microreactors, small modular reactors, and Generation IV and Generation III+ reactors – have revolutionary potential. They will open a range of new applications to support data centers, microchip manufacturing, petrochemical production, healthcare, desalination, hydrogen production, and other industries”.

It says that “within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall take appropriate action to revise the regulations, guidance, and procedures and practices of the Department, the National Laboratories, and any other entity under the Department’s jurisdiction to significantly expedite the review, approval, and deployment of advanced reactors under the Department’s jurisdiction. The Secretary shall ensure that the Department’s expedited procedures enable qualified test reactors to be safely operational at Department-owned or Department-controlled facilities within 2 years following the submission of a substantially complete application”.

There will also be a pilot programme established for reactor construction and operation outside of the National Laboratories, with the goal of three reactors reaching criticality by 4 July 2026.

There will also be action taken “consistent with applicable law” to “use all available authorities to eliminate or expedite the Department’s environmental reviews for authorizations, permits, approvals, leases, and any other activity requested by an applicant or potential applicant”.

Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission

The executive order Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission says that between 1954 and 1978 the US “authorised the construction of 133 since-completed civilian nuclear reactors at 81 plants. Since 1978, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has authorized only a fraction of that number; of these, only two reactors have entered into commercial operation”.

The order says that “instead of efficiently promoting safe, abundant nuclear energy, the NRC has instead tried to insulate Americans from the most remote risks without appropriate regard for the severe domestic and geopolitical costs of such risk aversion”.

It proposes that the NRC working with the Department of Government Efficiency “reorganize the NRC to promote the expeditious processing of license applications and the adoption of innovative technology. The NRC shall undertake reductions in force in conjunction with this reorganization”. It proposes fixed deadlines for its evaluation and approval of licences, including “a deadline of no more than 18 months for final decision on an application to construct and operate a new reactor of any type, commencing with the first required step in the regulatory process, and a deadline of no more than 1 year for final decision on an application to continue operating an existing reactor of any type, commencing with the first required step in the regulatory process”.

Answering questions from reporters after signing the orders. President Trump said that nuclear was “safe and clean” and said the country aimed to build small modular reactors but “we’ll build the big ones too … I think we’re going to be second to none because we are starting very strong. But it’s time for nuclear and we’re going to do it very big”.

Among those attending the Oval Office event was Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) President and CEO Maria Korsnick who thanked the president for “leaning in” to support and bring attention to commercial nuclear energy.

And in a statement after the signings event, an NEI spokesperson said: “We appreciate the Administration’s ongoing actions to preserve existing nuclear plants and usher in the deployment of next generation nuclear. Policies to strengthen nuclear are essential to bolstering our national security and meeting our energy goals. We look forward to working with the Administration and other stakeholders to ensure the implementation of the orders will help us build a reliable, affordable, and increasingly clean energy system.”",https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/a-181.jpeg,N,,2025-05-25 23:02:53.255144

NEW DELHI, May 26, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- RMI has released a new report, Empowering India: The Clean Energy Growth Opportunity, which shows how India is meeting its rapidly increasing electricity demand with affordable, clean and efficient renewable energy.

Energy demand in India could triple by 2050, especially given the need for space cooling in a warming world. This new collection of research by RMI highlights how India is moving away from fossil fuels and import dependence to meet growing energy demand with clean technologies—all while reducing costs, increasing jobs, scaling domestic manufacturing, and increasing competitiveness. Through policy and innovation, India has made progress toward a clean energy system at remarkable speed, scale, and savings.

Read the report here: https://rmi.org/insight/empowering-india/

Key findings include:

India is set to grow and build more than any other region — including nearly half the world's growth in annual steel production. With 3x as much vehicle travel and 9x as many air conditioners, India's electricity demand could triple by 2050.

This growth is an unparalleled opportunity to build right the first time. Unlike in the United States or Europe, nearly all of India's midcentury building stock has yet to be built. Growing efficiently and cleanly builds resiliency and creates a competitive advantage.

Fossil fuels are expensive to import — costing 5% of the nation's GDP. But renewable energy is readily available, and India is already reaching self-sufficiency in the manufacturing of solar modules, wind generators, and battery cells. India's largest renewable energy project under construction is nearly 4 times the size of the biggest project in the United States or Europe.

In recent months, electricity from new solar + storage has become cheaper than new coal, and new solar on its own has become cheaper than existing coal power plants.

Despite the incredible opportunity, India receives only 4% of global clean energy investment. If the finance catches up, India's transition could save more emissions by midcentury than Europe and North America combined — while charting the way for emerging economies around the world.

Nearly $80 million went toward indirect costs, which NIH capped at 15% of grant funding for all new and current awards in February.
“I think in areas of renewable energy and energy transition, my hunch is, yes, federal funding will be extremely rare and unlikely,” Lackner said.
Even without funding, however, the people at the Energy Transition Institute remain.
The relationships built through ELEVATE, Lackner said, will continue to endure regardless of the program’s future.","AMHERST — University of Massachusetts doctoral candidate Shannon Callaham had initially planned to spend time earlier this month analyzing interview data between Holyoke community members and energy industry professionals as part of a grant-funded project that centered around environmental justice in Holyoke’s transition to renewable energy.

Those plans quickly changed, however, when funding for her position was cut by the Trump administration, forcing Callaham to instead begin searching for a new source of funding to ensure that she has income and health care over the summer and the following semesters.

She and 17 other research fellows who are part of the Elevating Equity Values in the Transition of the Energy System (ELEVATE) program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst lost critical federal funding. The ELEVATE program had been guaranteed two years of funding, but that money disappeared overnight when the National Science Foundation terminated a $6 million grant.

“It means figuring out where we will be able to find that money,” Callaham said. “It also means lost time because we have to apply for grants or teach a course instead of just focusing on research.”

ELEVATE is part of UMass’ Energy Transition Institute, an interdisciplinary initiative studying the most efficient and equitable ways to develop and implement the transition to renewable energy. The program started five years ago when the university received the NSF grant to build a research network that investigated every aspect of the energy systems, from computer science and engineering to public health and anthropology.

“Energy is so fundamental to society, it’s not just the electrical grid or wind and solar generation,” said Matthew Lackner, principal investigator of ELEVATE. “We brought together 38 students across the different departments, all touching on energy transition, and we built a really amazing community of students and faculty.”

One of these multidisciplinary projects, called “Community-Engaged Co-Design for a Just and Sustainable Energy Transition,” connects scientists with Holyoke community members to discuss residents’ challenges with energy systems and the most productive ways of solving them.

“In terms of the impact of the project already, it’s been building relationships, it’s been building knowledge of energy and it’s been building agency,” Callaham said, who also works on the project in addition to her Ph.D. research. “People see the values in their perspectives.”

Termination notice

Just before the team earlier this month to review its progress over the past year, Callaham said she received a termination notice for $1.1 million in grant funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s STAR program. The grant paid for the time, participation and expertise of Holyoke community members, as well as meals and child care during weekday night activities. The money also compensated graduate students for their work.

“This is something that has never happened before,” said Krista Harper, a principal investigator of the Holyoke Community Energy project. “Federal funding is supposed to be as good as it gets. It’s supposed to be secure and not bobbing around a lot.”

While Harper said the Energy Transition Institute is working with UMass to secure Research Continuity Emergency (ResCoE) funding to pay the graduate students, doctoral and postdoctoral candidates over the summer, mass grant terminations from the NSF and National Institutes of Health have increased competition for these funds, and additional research funds.

“Being on campus [last] week, it was as if an asteroid hit,” Harper said. “There were so many different grants that are being terminated all at the same time. NSF and NIH being radically cut will be something that will have a huge impact on this region and the state.”

Grant terminations and cuts to NIH funding for indirect research costs are major hits to the region’s revenues. A lawsuit filed by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel on behalf of 22 states reports that in fiscal year 2024, the five UMass campuses received 501 grants from NIH worth $248 million. Nearly $80 million went toward indirect costs, which NIH capped at 15% of grant funding for all new and current awards in February.

An interactive map developed by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania estimates that Hampshire County could lose $15 million from the NIH’s grant cuts to indirect costs alone. UMass, specifically, could lose up to $10 million.

“I think in areas of renewable energy and energy transition, my hunch is, yes, federal funding will be extremely rare and unlikely,” Lackner said. “Given that grants will be canceled in this area, it’s hard to imagine new grants being made.”

Community connection lost

Lackner credited federal funding as the main thread connecting the ELEVATE students and community, and the loss of this thread will force a restructuring, and possibly shrinking, of the program.

Already, the seven fellows accepted into ELEVATE for the fall semester no longer have funding, and Lackner is unclear whether they will join the program.

“Students become the pioneers and scientists who work at natural labs and research institutes,” he said. “If that pipeline gets turned off, it hurts the economy and society as a whole.”

Harper and Lackner hope that states will step up to fill the void in research funding, and the Energy Transition Institute will continue to apply for grants as they appear, Lackner said.

Even without funding, however, the people at the Energy Transition Institute remain.

Callaham and Harper assert that the Holyoke Community Energy project and the people involved “are not disappearing,” and the group will continue to invest their energy and time into the Holyoke community.

Callaham plans to continue her research on Massachusetts’ Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness 2.0 program, but she might take a couple of teaching assistant jobs to fund her work.

The relationships built through ELEVATE, Lackner said, will continue to endure regardless of the program’s future.

“We have these really wonderfully smart and energetic and optimistic and collaborative and creative students that do really cool research that’s trying to help lead the energy system to one that’s more sustainable, more affordable and benefits everybody,” Lackner said. “Those students will still have amazing careers and impact the world positively, and I feel for them, how disruptive this is for them.”

First announced in 2022, the project will be executed in two primary phases, initially focusing on domestic hydrogen supply to decarbonise the mining and heavy transport sectors.
The project also benefits from a competitively priced, behind-the-meter renewable power supply, high plant utilisation and a high comparative market price.
“Xodus has played a central role in the technical and commercial development of the project, overseeing feasibility, concept design, approvals and the integration of renewable energy sources.
Warradarge Energy chief executive Stephen Archer said: “Scalable, high-quality renewable energy projects like ours are needed to bridge the gap between today’s demonstration sized facilities and the gigawatt-scale hydrogen developments of the future.","Global energy consultancy Xodus has been allocated land in the Mid-West region of Western Australia to underpin the development of a commercial-scale green hydrogen and ammonia project.

Located in the Oakajee Strategic Industrial Area (SIA), this allocation from the Government of Western Australia paves the way for Xodus and its partners to progress the project, formerly known as Project MercurHy, under the Warradarge Energy banner.

First announced in 2022, the project will be executed in two primary phases, initially focusing on domestic hydrogen supply to decarbonise the mining and heavy transport sectors.

There is an ambition to scale the development further into an ammonia export project located at the Oakajee SIA.

The initial phase is well advanced, with over 16,000 hectares of land secured at Warradarge, power supply agreements with an existing wind farm under negotiation and offtake partners onboard.

The project also benefits from a competitively priced, behind-the-meter renewable power supply, high plant utilisation and a high comparative market price.

Simon Allison (pictured), vice president of Asia Pacific at Xodus and strategic advisory board member at Warradarge Energy, said: “This is a major step forward, not just for Warradarge Energy, but also in Australia’s quest to be one of the world’s dominant clean hydrogen players.

Climate and Energy Minister Penny Sharpe said the Illawarra was a natural choice for the state’s first urban REZ, citing the region’s zeal for renewables.
“The roundtable is an opportunity for community, industry and energy leaders to map out the next steps for unlocking clean, reliable and affordable energy for the Illawarra Renewable Energy Zone.” The zone, which could deliver projects by 2030, is part of NSW’s wider Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap — a 20-year plan to replace retiring coal-fired power stations with renewable generation.
Planning Minister and Wollongong MP Paul Scully said the region was uniquely positioned to show how renewable energy production and consumption could be woven into the fabric of an industrial city.
If successful, the Illawarra REZ could become a national model for urban renewable integration — one that not only powers homes and factories, but potentially reboots the region’s reputation as a hub for clean energy jobs and investment.","The Illawarra is poised to become the heart of NSW’s clean energy transformation, with the State Government unveiling plans to establish its first urban Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) in the region.

In a move that could reshape the local economy and redefine how power is generated and stored in urban areas, the Minns Government is hosting a high-level roundtable in Wollongong with energy experts, industry leaders and community groups to chart a course for the Illawarra REZ.

The zone — backed by a new partnership between government agency EnergyCo and electricity distributor Endeavour Energy — aims to integrate rooftop solar, community batteries and spare government and commercial space to generate and store renewable power while minimising the impact on the surrounding communities and environment by repurposing existing infrastructure where possible.

Climate and Energy Minister Penny Sharpe said the Illawarra was a natural choice for the state’s first urban REZ, citing the region’s zeal for renewables.

“This is a chance to leverage the community’s enthusiasm for solar, batteries and EVs to benefit the entire region, as well as pursue longer-term opportunities to support green manufacturing,” she said.

“The urban Renewal Energy Zone is about how we harness every rooftop and commercial facility and leverage the land in this area to build a stable, reliable power grid that uses wind and, in particular the sun, to drive not just households and the economy but the businesses here into the future.

“The roundtable is an opportunity for community, industry and energy leaders to map out the next steps for unlocking clean, reliable and affordable energy for the Illawarra Renewable Energy Zone.”

The zone, which could deliver projects by 2030, is part of NSW’s wider Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap — a 20-year plan to replace retiring coal-fired power stations with renewable generation.

Officials say grouping solar and wind farms into dedicated zones helps drive down power prices and boost reliability by making transmission and storage more efficient.

Today’s announcement coincides with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between EnergyCo and Endeavour Energy to explore innovative grid and battery solutions specific to the Illawarra’s urban setting.

Minister for the Illawarra and the South Coast and Member for Keira Ryan Park pointed out that the Illawarra region contained unique features that made it an ideal location for a REZ.

“The Illawarra already hosts major energy, port and transport infrastructure, we have skilled workers ready to go, and strong demand for projects which capitalise on the region’s ability to innovate,” he said.

Planning Minister and Wollongong MP Paul Scully said the region was uniquely positioned to show how renewable energy production and consumption could be woven into the fabric of an industrial city.

“We want to harness where we’ve got good household solar and batteries, a great deal of government property and community batteries that we can all integrate together in an area that’s ready to lead the charge when it comes to setting a new approach to renewable energy generation, storage and transmission,” he said.

“The Illawarra has all the components we need to trial this and get it ready to be rolled out to other parts of the state. We’ve got a skilled workforce, a port and a research-led university that does some brilliant work in energy.

“We’ve also got the cutting edge companies that we need to be out there thinking about how we do it, like Green Gravity with their gravity energy storage systems, Hysata who are setting a new agenda in hydrogen production and Sicona Battery who only this week have signed a huge licensing agreement internationally.

“This roundtable brings together industry pacesetters and innovators in a crucial step towards delivering clean green energy that can meet the needs of both residents and local industry.”

Rewiring Australia CEO Francis Vierboom said the organisation strongly supported any action towards integrating energy made by households into the grid.

“Allowing neighbours to share energy with their community and getting the most out of the region’s renewables and the grid makes sense, and saves money,” he said.

“The plans discussed today will help move energy more efficiently throughout the Illawarra, harnessing the power of rooftop solar, and then storing it so it can be used where it’s needed throughout the day.

Trump has repeatedly promoted coal as power source for data centers.
In the short-term, the industry’s power needs may inadvertently be extending the life of existing coal plants.
Coal is being displaced by renewables, natural gas and existing nuclear as coal plants face increasingly difficult economics, Sahlstrom said.
Utilities have already postponed the retirement of coal plants totaling about 39 gigawatts of power, according to data from the National Mining Association.","President Donald Trump wants to revive the struggling coal industry in the U.S. by deploying plants to power the data centers that the Big Tech companies are building to train artificial intelligence.

Trump issued an executive order in April that directed his Cabinet to find areas of the U.S. where coal-powered infrastructure is available to support AI data centers and determine whether the infrastructure can be expanded to meet the growing electricity demand from the nation’s tech sector.

Trump has repeatedly promoted coal as power source for data centers. The president told the World Economic Forum in January that he would approve power plants for AI through emergency declaration, calling on the tech companies to use coal as a backup power source.

“They can fuel it with anything they want, and they may have coal as a backup — good, clean coal,” the president said.

Trump’s push to deploy coal runs afoul of the tech companies’ environmental goals. In the short-term, the industry’s power needs may inadvertently be extending the life of existing coal plants.

Coal produces more carbon dioxide emissions per kilowatt hour of power than any other energy source in the U.S. with the exception of oil, according to the Energy Information Administration. The tech industry has invested billions of dollars to expand renewable energy and is increasingly turning to nuclear power as a way to meet its growing electricity demand while trying to reduce carbon dioxide emissions that fuel climate change.

For coal miners, Trump’s push is a potential lifeline. The industry has been in decline as coal plants are being retired in the U.S. About 16% of U.S. electricity generation came from burning coal in 2023, down from 51% in 2001, according to EIA data.

Peabody Energy

CEO James Grech, who attended Trump’s executive order ceremony at the White House, said “coal plants can shoulder a heavier load of meeting U.S. generation demands, including multiple years of data center growth.” Peabody is one of the largest coal producers in the U.S.

Grech said coal plants should ramp up how much power they dispatch. The nation’s coal fleet is dispatching about 42% of its maximum capacity right now, compared to a historical average of 72%, the CEO told analysts on the company’s May 6 earnings call.

“We believe that all coal-powered generators need to defer U.S. coal plant retirements as the situation on the ground has clearly changed,” Grech said. “We believe generators should un-retire coal plants that have recently been mothballed.”

Tech sector reaction

There is a growing acknowledgment within the tech industry that fossil fuel generation will be needed to help meet the electricity demand from AI. But the focus is on natural gas, which emits less half the CO2 of coal per kilowatt hour of power, according the the EIA.

“To have the energy we need for the grid, it’s going to take an all of the above approach for a period of time,” Kevin Miller, Amazon’s vice president of global data centers, said during a panel discussion at conference of tech and oil and gas executives in Oklahoma City last month.

“We’re not surprised by the fact that we’re going to need to add some thermal generation to meet the needs in the short term,” Miller said.

Thermal generation is a code word for gas, said Nat Sahlstrom, chief energy officer at Tract, a Denver-based company that secures land, infrastructure and power resources for data centers. Sahlstrom previously led Amazon’s energy, water and sustainability teams.

Executives at Amazon, Nvidia and Anthropic would not commit to using coal, mostly dodging the question when asked during the panel at the Oklahoma City conference.

“It’s never a simple answer,” Amazon’s Miller said. “It is a combination of where’s the energy available, what are other alternatives.”

Nvidia is able to be agnostic about what type of power is used because of the position the chipmaker occupies on the AI value chain, said Josh Parker, the company’s senior director of corporate sustainability. “Thankfully, we leave most of those decisions up to our customers.”

Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark said there are a broader set of options available than just coal. “We would certainly consider it but I don’t know if I’d say it’s at the top of our list.”

Sahlstrom said Trump’s executive order seems like a “dog whistle” to coal mining constituents. There is a big difference between looking at existing infrastructure and “actually building new power plants that are cost competitive and are going to be existing 30 to 40 years from now,” the Tract executive said.

Coal is being displaced by renewables, natural gas and existing nuclear as coal plants face increasingly difficult economics, Sahlstrom said. “Coal has kind of found itself without a job,” he said.

“I do not see the hyperscale community going out and signing long term commitments for new coal plants,” the former Amazon executive said. (The tech companies ramping up AI are frequently referred to as “hyperscalers.”)

“I would be shocked if I saw something like that happen,” Sahlstrom said.

Coal retirements strain grid

But coal plant retirements are creating a real challenge for the grid as electricity demand is increasing due to data centers, re-industrialization and the broader electrification of the economy.

The largest grid in the nation, the PJM Interconnection, has forecast electricity demand could surge 40% by 2039. PJM warned in 2023 that 40 gigawatts of existing power generation, mostly coal, is at risk of retirement by 2030, which represents about 21% of PJM’s installed capacity.

Data centers will temporarily prolong coal demand as utilities scramble to maintain grid reliability, delaying their decarbonization goals, according to a Moody’s report from last October. Utilities have already postponed the retirement of coal plants totaling about 39 gigawatts of power, according to data from the National Mining Association.

“If we want to grow America’s electricity production meaningfully over the next five or ten years, we [have] got to stop closing coal plants,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright told CNBC’s “Money Movers” last month.

But natural gas and renewables are the future, Sahlstrom said. Some 60% of the power sector’s emissions reductions over the past 20 years are due to gas displacing coal, with the remainder coming from renewables, Sahlstrom said.",,N,,2025-05-25 19:04:06.318433

I spoke with someone at Edmunds earlier this week who was basically saying that Tesla owners are still shopping for Tesla.","AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

Some good and bad news for Tesla Cybertruck owners. For a year after its launch, Tesla discouraged owners from reselling their trucks by threatening lawsuits and blacklists, and Tesla wasn't accepting trade-ins. So, the good news - you're finally able to trade in your Cybertruck for another Tesla. The bad news - Tesla seems no more eager than other buyers to pay premiums for what was one of the most ballyhooed new models in recent memory. And in fact, the Cybertruck depreciates at a much higher rate than other passenger vehicles. Ana Altchek is a trending business and tech reporter at Business Insider, and she joins us now. Welcome to the program.

ANA ALTCHEK: Thanks for having me.

RASCOE: You found that a Cybertruck depreciates 37- to 38% in value after just a year. Now, how does that compare to other cars?

ALTCHEK: In the realm of cars in general, Kelley Blue Book estimates that new cars depreciate at about 30% on average over the first two years, and they lose an added 8% to 12% each year after that. EVs, on average, tend to depreciate at a higher rate. So one study recently found that EVs depreciate at around 58.8% on average within a five-year period. Kelley Blue Book estimated that Rivian's R1T depreciated at about 29% the last two years. So there does seem to be a steeper rate with the Cybertruck compared to other similar models.

RASCOE: OK. The Cybertruck - it's unconventional looking. I mean, my kids, when we're out, they'll be, like, hey, what's this? It's a Cybertruck. And obviously, the CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, has become a very polarizing social and political figure. Is this more about Elon Musk, or is this more about the actual Cybertruck?

ALTCHEK: I think that the Cybertruck has definitely become the most controversial vehicle, and like you said, kids still really love it. A lot of owners I speak to still really love their car. They love how it drives. They love the way it looks. But in general, it's been the target of a lot of the harassment that has been coming for Tesla the last few months. In terms of the truck itself, some people have said that they think it was overpriced at the beginning. It was a bit of a status symbol, and so we're seeing now that it's not as much of that. It's had eight recalls since it's been released. The range is less than Elon Musk promised. The question really is, was it worth that original price tag? And now it's also embroiled in politics, so I think that just adds to the storyline.

RASCOE: BYD - this is the Chinese EV maker - they saw more vehicle registrations in Europe than Tesla for the first time last month. You know, Americans can't buy those Chinese electric vehicles. So is there another brand that is competing with Tesla sales here in the U.S?

ALTCHEK: The EV segment is growing in the U.S. Tesla is still the most popular EV brand. Earlier this week, you know, an executive at Cadillac was basically saying that more Tesla owners are switching to Cadillac, which was interesting. But otherwise, it's hard to tell, you know, if Tesla owners are going to different brands. I spoke with someone at Edmunds earlier this week who was basically saying that Tesla owners are still shopping for Tesla. That's what the data shows. There's not an indication that there's another competitor that's really stealing its customers.

RASCOE: So last week, Republicans in Congress voted to roll back EV incentives and to block California's electric vehicle mandate. We don't know if those moves will stick, but are they indicative of a general move away from EVs, in the U.S. at least?

ALTCHEK: I don't know that people are moving away from EVs. I think that there definitely has been a slowdown in buying EVs, and certainly, if the regulatory environment changes, that could impact it further. I think that the used EV market, because it's thriving so much and because you can really get a good deal, that has been a place for buyers to go to. So I think it depends. I mean, as long as there are more models coming out, I think there will be more opportunity for people in the U.S. to switch over. The issue is that the price has been a bit higher and the availability hasn't always been the same as buying a gas-powered vehicle.

RASCOE: That's Ana Altchek of Business Insider. Thank you so much for joining us.

With prices for rare earth minerals climbing, EV manufacturers are exploring innovative solutions to reduce their reliance on these essential materials. A recent study by researchers at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Scania Group reveals a promising opportunity for the EV industry to significantly reduce its dependence on rare earth elements by embracing circular design practices. This approach could not only secure critical resources but also lead to considerable cost savings and environmental benefits.

How Would They Save Money?

The researchers in Sweden have developed a groundbreaking decision-making tool designed to optimize the design of EV engine parts for reuse, remanufacturing, or recycling. This tool aims to promote product designs that enable remanufacturing and recycling, ultimately reducing production costs over the product’s full life cycle. According to the study, implementing this tool in the testing phase led to an estimated 18.6% production cost savings and a remarkable carbon footprint reduction of 38.7%. The testing phase involved an electric machine product from the heavy-duty vehicle industry, demonstrating a 14.7% reduction in material demand.

Farazee Adif, a researcher at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, highlighted that achieving these benefits requires manufacturers to invest an additional 10.6% in design. This investment is crucial for realizing the potential savings and environmental advantages offered by circular design practices. As the EV industry continues to evolve, such innovative tools will play a vital role in making sustainable manufacturing a reality.

The Benefit of Low Carbon Footprint

Reducing the reliance on virgin material extraction not only cuts production costs but also significantly lowers the carbon footprint associated with manufacturing. Simulations conducted during the study revealed that up to 80% of the electrical steel in EV motors could be reused or remanufactured, with the remaining 20% recycled. Similarly, 60% of the magnets and 56% of the regular steel could be reused, contributing to a sustainable manufacturing process.

Circular economy practices are essential for ensuring the availability of resources for future EV manufacturing, particularly for components that heavily rely on rare earth elements like electric motors. Asif emphasized the need for significant design innovations and economic and environmental impact modeling to fully realize the benefits of circular practices. The new simulation tool developed by the researchers addresses this need, providing manufacturers with a valuable resource for optimizing their production processes.

A Bit More on Rare Earth Elements

Rare earth elements such as neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium are crucial for producing the powerful magnets used in electric motors. The decision-making tool developed by the researchers enables manufacturers, suppliers, and recyclers to predict the availability of these materials, ensuring timely delivery to manufacturing plants. By simulating the logistics of transporting materials and components, this tool helps streamline the supply chain and enhance resource management.

Scaling up circular practices could meet up to 70% of future neodymium demand for EVs by 2050, according to the study. This highlights the potential of circular design to address resource challenges in the EV industry. However, the success of such initiatives relies on substantial upfront investments in design and infrastructure. Manufacturers may require regulatory incentives or guaranteed returns to commit to these investments, paving the way for a more sustainable future.

The measure overturning the rule now goes to the White House, where Trump is expected to sign it, along with two other resolutions that would block California rules curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks. All three measures were approved by the Senate on Thursday and by the House earlier this month.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, and state air regulators say that what Congress is doing is illegal and they will sue to keep the rules in place.

“This is not about electric vehicles,” Newsom said at a news conference while the Senate was still voting on the measures. “This is about polluters being able to pollute more.”

California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state plans to sue over the way that Republicans passed the measures blocking the emissions rules. Senate Republicans established a narrow exception to the filibuster Wednesday to clear the way for the votes.

The GOP effort could have a profound impact on California’s longtime efforts to curb air pollution. California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends — especially because about a dozen states have already followed California’s lead. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.

Senate Democrats charged that Republicans are acting at the behest of the oil and gas industry and they say California should be able to set its own standards after obtaining waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency.

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the votes should “send a chill down the spine of legislators in every state.”

“What we have at stake is a state’s ability, it’s right to make its own laws and to protect its own citizens, without having this body overturn that right,” Schiff said.

Republicans say the phaseout of gas-powered cars, along with other waivers that California has obtained from the EPA, is costly for consumers and manufacturers, puts pressure on the nation’s energy grid and has become a de facto nationwide electric vehicle mandate.

“America cannot meet these impossible standards –- not next year, and not in 10 years,” said Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the second-ranking Republican.

Newsom announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles within 15 years as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.

The Biden administration approved the state’s waiver to implement the standards in December, a month before Trump returned to office. The California rules are stricter than a Biden-era rule that tightens emissions standards but does not require sales of electric vehicles.

Biden’s EPA said in announcing the decision that opponents of the California waivers did not meet their legal burden to show how either the EV rule or a separate measure on heavy-duty vehicles was inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.

Republicans have long criticized California’s waivers and have worked to find a way to overturn them. The Government Accountability Office said earlier this year that California’s policies are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows Congress to reject federal regulations under certain circumstances with a simple majority vote not subject to the filibuster. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that ruling, but Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., cleared the way for the votes anyway with a workaround that established a new Senate precedent.

Democrats fought those changes, which were the latest attempt to chip away at the Senate filibuster after both parties have used their majorities in the past two decades to lower the threshold for nominations. Democrats tried in 2022 to roll back the filibuster for legislation, as well, but were thwarted by members of their own caucus who disagreed with the effort.

Republicans have insisted that they would not try a similar move after regaining the majority this year. But Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the move to block California’s laws were a “point of no return” and called the Republicans “fair weather institutionalists.”

Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan was the only Democrat to support the measure to block the phaseout of gas-powered vehicles. She said in a statement after the vote that she has a “special responsibility to stand up for the more than one million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry.”

John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an auto industry association and lobby group, said there is a gap between the vehicles that car buyers are purchasing and the rules that would force a transition to electric vehicles.

“The fact is these EV sales mandates were never achievable,” Bozzella said.

In December, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Biden administration approved a California state rule requiring all new cars sold in the state to be electric or otherwise non-emitting by 2035. Months later, Thune is trying to overturn that.

""This week, we're going to be moving to take up Congressional Review Act resolutions to overturn Clean Air Act preemption waivers the Environmental Protection Agency granted to California that allow California to dictate emission standards for the whole country, effectively imposing a nationwide electric vehicle mandate,"" Thune said last week in a floor speech.

The Senate could vote on the matter as soon as this Wednesday, despite the Government Accountability Office issuing an opinion saying that the waiver is not a rule and therefore is not subject to the CRA. That opinion was seconded by the Senate parliamentarian.

In response, Schumer warned Thune and other Republicans that ""what goes around comes around,"" threatening to deploy similar strategies to get around opinions by key, nonpartisan rule makers if and when he grabs back control of the chamber, Axios reported. He and other Democratic leaders have described the GOP move as a ""nuclear option,"" a term both parties use for changing the Senate's rules.

Other Democrats have backed Schumer in his rhetoric. For instance, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, said Tuesday that if Republicans proceed, ""they should expect a future Democratic government will have to revisit decades worth of paltry corporate settlements, deferred prosecution agreements, and tax rulings.""

""These partisan actions cut both ways,"" Wyden said.

Republicans haven't yet outlined what procedural hurdles they will need to clear to get the resolutions to final votes of adoption on Wednesday, yet some of them are assuring fellow senators about ignoring the parliamentarian.

Most notably, Senate Rules Chair and former Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a staunch defender of Senate procedure, spoke in favor of using the CRA during a closed-door lunch last week. His voice was particularly influential for some senators on the fence, according to Axios.

However, Republicans have argued the California waiver is a unique case and that the GAO does not get to decide what rules can be undone. ""We are not talking about doing anything to erode the institutional character of the Senate,"" Thune argued on the Senate floor on Tuesday.

Democrats have also expressed concern over the possibility of Republicans continuing to ignore the parliamentarian, making them willing to flout on other things too, like what policies can and can't be included in the GOP's party-line tax and spending package that could be coming over from the House as soon as this week.",https://d.latintimes.com/en/full/562883/thune-aipac-11202024-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 18:05:22.792292

Low-carbon liquid fuels are often described as ""drop in"" solutions, as they can work with existing petrol tankers, fuel bowsers and internal combustion engines.
A compromise can be found by blending synthetic fuel with the fossil equivalent, lowering emissions and making it more affordable.
The transition from fossil to low-carbon liquid fuels is already underway in some of these sectors.
The nation's science agency believes making low-carbon liquid fuels domestically would help shore up the country's energy security.","When Formula 1 cars nudge speeds of 330 kilometres per hour next year, hundreds of millions of people will witness existing engines and infrastructure working with a fuel once considered futuristic.

The fuel burning inside the turbocharged V6 engines won't be gutted from the Earth like traditional fossil fuels; instead, most will be chemically synthesised and involve the recycling of existing carbon dioxide — making it close to carbon neutral.

""It would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent,"" Liam Parker said, chief communications officer at Formula 1.

""The technical analysis shows zero drop in performance, so you're racing green, you're providing a solution for the automotive sector and the wider consumer, but you're also giving the public and the fans what they want.""

Five different companies — many of them sponsors — will be supplying the 100 per cent synthetic and biofuel to the 11 teams on the grid, once again positioning Formula 1 as the breeding ground of the kind of innovation that trickles to road cars and other vehicles.

Industry stakeholders believe these low-carbon liquid fuels provide a window of opportunity for Australia, claiming it can help connect the vehicles, ships and planes of today to a net-zero tomorrow, and create a multi-billion-dollar domestic manufacturing industry that would also bolster the nation's fuel security.

""We estimate the Australian low-carbon liquid fuel market could be in the order of $36 billion a year by 2050, and a feedstock market of about $15 billion,"" said Rupert Maloney, executive director of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), a Commonwealth-funded investment firm backing green initiatives.

What makes synthetic and biofuel different?

There are two main types of low-carbon liquid fuels: synthetic and biofuel.

Both of them source carbon from the atmosphere when they're being developed, effectively recycling it once it is burned by an engine.

But whereas biofuel is processed from organic material such as sugarcane, used cooking oil and sawmill residue, the latest synthetic fuel doesn't affect food production.

It chemically synthesises the elements that make fuel: hydrogen and carbon.

The hydrogen is split from water in a process powered by renewable electricity, while the carbon is either captured from the air using emerging technology, extracted from algae, or gleaned from sustainable sources like waste.

The domestic biofuel industry is already growing as local feedstock is exported internationally, but industry stakeholders believe synthetic fuel has greater scale-up potential.

Global companies want to make synthetic fuel in Australia

At least two companies are looking at manufacturing synthetic fuel in Australia — HIF (Highly Innovative Fuels) and Zero Petroleum — with each expected to start construction on plants in 2026.

HIF is aiming to produce 100 million litres of synthetic fuel a year once its manufacturing plant is up and running in 2030 — about 500 times more than its concept plant in Chile.

The company, which counts Porsche among its investors, claims it is spending about $2 billion constructing the plant in Tasmania.

""What we look for are locations where the feed stocks that we need to make this product are available and are also cost efficient,"" said Ignacio Hernandez, chief executive of HIF Asia Pacific.

""One of the main ingredients that we need is renewable energy, and Australia is well known globally for having a big renewable energy potential.""

Meanwhile, Zero Petroleum — founded by former F1 engineer Paddy Lowe and chemical engineer Nilay Shah — is examining the feasibility of building a plant in South Australia.

The facility would produce up to 10 million litres of synthetic aviation fuel, gasoline and diesel a year.

It works with our cars today, but will we use it?

Low-carbon liquid fuels are often described as ""drop in"" solutions, as they can work with existing petrol tankers, fuel bowsers and internal combustion engines.

But there's disagreement on whether the fuel would be used in the nearly 16 million passenger vehicles registered in Australia.

How much it costs at the bowser will be a key determinant.

A compromise can be found by blending synthetic fuel with the fossil equivalent, lowering emissions and making it more affordable.

""The cost of the product will come down, and eventually you're able to transition to 100 per cent synthetic, without impacting materially the cost to the final consumer,"" Mr Hernandez said.

A key factor in the price coming down is the cost of renewable electricity, as wind and solar farms would power the manufacturing process to keep the carbon footprint as low as possible.

""We need very low renewable energy costs in order to get that hydrogen price down,"" Max Temminghoff said, Mineral Resources Lead at the CSIRO Futures.

""And then on the other flip side is the carbon dioxide. Pulling that out of the atmosphere currently is technologically not as mature and is a bit expensive, so that's what the CSIRO is working on.""

Betting on electric vehicles and new infrastructure

Instead, there is a concerted effort to transition cars and the infrastructure powering them to electric — but there's a long way to go to meet the CSIRO's target of 97 per cent by 2050.

The latest data from the federal government, dated January 2024, reveals there are 15.7 million passenger vehicles registered in Australia.

One per cent — or 159,460 — were electric.

Vehicles powered by petrol or diesel made up 95.5 per cent — or 14,958,462 vehicles.

""There will be an existing fleet of internal combustion engines, we think, still operating at that point [in 2050], and there needs to be a solution for those cars,"" HIF's Mr Hernandez said.

Sustainable fuel could be used in vehicles that are hard to electrify

The demand, policy and money opportunities suggest synthetic fuel will be used to power trucks driving interstate, ships travelling across oceans and planes flying internationally.

""By 2050, about 30 billion litres in Australia will likely be hard to electrify and will likely require low carbon liquid fuels or other decarbonisation technologies,"" the CEFC's Mr Maloney said.

The transition from fossil to low-carbon liquid fuels is already underway in some of these sectors.

Qantas imported 1.7 million litres of sustainable fuel in early May, hoping to blend it at a ratio of 18 per cent with traditional jet fuel.

The airline claims it could power the equivalent of 900 flights from Sydney to Auckland, reducing carbon emissions by 3,400 tonnes.

But it had to shop overseas, importing the biofuel from Malaysia.

""The creation of a domestic sustainable aviation fuel industry is key to our efforts towards the decarbonisation of aviation,"" said Vanessa Hudson, the chief executive of Qantas Group.

Manufactures say updated policy will drive investment

The federal government is hoping to foster a low-carbon liquid fuel manufacturing industry in Australia, announcing $250 million in grants in March.

""Australia has the know-how and skills to meet the crucial task of decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation, heavy transport and mining that rely on liquid fuels,"" Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen said.

But the industry is asking for the kind of regulations popping up in other parts of the world, including mandates that would require select sectors to blend a percentage of synthetic fuel with their current fossil stock.

""Some of the mandates that are getting rolled out across Asia are in the order of 1 per cent blend, so it will not have a large impact on end use pricing,"" Mr Maloney said.

""It provides an investment signal back to the production side of the market to develop these facilities, and that brings down the cost.""

HIF's facility could produce enough synthetic fuel to meet a quarter of Tasmania's demand, Mr Hernandez said, but instead it'll likely export supply to other countries.

""There are other markets in the world that have more advanced regulation to support the uptake of these products,"" he said.

Australia relies on liquid fuels for more than half of its energy demand, according to federal government data, but the number of local refineries has dwindled from seven to two.

The nation's science agency believes making low-carbon liquid fuels domestically would help shore up the country's energy security.

""Currently we import about 80 per cent of our refined fuels and we get those fuels through pretty extensive supply chains that are exposed to a range of geopolitical risks,"" the CSIRO's Mr Temminghoff said.

""Being able to produce our fuels locally means that we have more control over the variables that go into the price.

""We really see this opportunity as fleeting.""",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/0bf9183b303ef09f6430416b77d65dfe?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=1863&cropW=3312&xPos=4&yPos=92&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-05-25 17:05:03.244829

However Rema has since become focused on other potential reforms, such as regional pricing, with plans to decouple electricity and gas prices sidelined.

Bell argues that severing the gas-electricity price link by removing gas plants from the wholesale power market would be “the single biggest move the government could make to cut bills in the short run”.

Some unions and think tanks have called for Britain’s remaining gas plants to be nationalised to solve the issue, but Stonehaven says this could face legal hurdles, as well as running up against the government’s fiscal rules.

A “less contentious and more easily implementable alternative” would be “a new out-of-market mechanism to manage a gas strategic reserve”, it argues. Gas plants would be offered a regulated return through a regulated asset base model to run when ordered to do so by the National Energy System Operator (Neso).

• Why are UK energy bills so high? The costs explained

Bell said his initial estimate was that the change could cut energy costs by at least £2 billion a year, both by reducing gas plants’ income and by reducing the wholesale price paid to other plants. About a third of energy costs are borne by households, suggesting a benefit of about £23 per household a year.

Bell argued such a model could actually be attractive to gas plant owners as it would offer guaranteed returns for remaining in the strategic reserve, rather than an increasingly unpredictable income stream as more renewables are built. The government’s 2030 clean power plans require most of Britain’s gas plants to remain available for back-up power, but aims for them to account for no more than 5 per cent of generation.

A spokesman for the energy department said: “As long as Britain remains exposed to the rollercoaster of global fossil fuel markets, we will be vulnerable to energy price rises over which we have no control.

“Our clean energy mission is the route to protecting consumers and bringing down bills for good. In the Clean Power Action Plan, we have already made clear that once we are less reliant on gas, we will consider a range of options, including an out-of-market system.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2F8e18d17b-0d98-40ef-b448-568bfdd77e89.jpg?crop=4109%2C2311%2C0%2C315&resize=1200,N,,2025-05-25 18:05:20.110134

Appendix : Global Solar Sustainable Alliance (GSSA)

As the backbone of renewable energy, the global solar sector provides consumers, industries, and society with affordable and reliable clean energy. It has made remarkable contributions to advancing global energy transition and promoting sustainable development, with immense potential yet to be realized.

On the other hand, after decades of growth, the social and environmental footprints of the solar industry, particularly the associated risks across its supply chain—have increasingly emerged. These challenges pose significant obstacles to unleashing the industry's full potential and achieving its own sustainable development.

In light of this, we, as the undersigned photovoltaic enterprises and supply chain participants, guided by the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), hereby launch the Global Solar Sustainable Alliance (GSSA).

High costs have discouraged potential offtakers, dampening interest in the idea of extracting hydrogen from renewable resources instead of simply squeezing it from natural gas or coal. However, China did not get the memo…

China’s Excellent Green Hydrogen Adventure

Three weeks ago, S&P Global took note of a new hydrogen report posted by China’s National Energy Administration. Although China continues to produce a prodigious amount of hydrogen from from fossil resources, the nation’s green hydrogen footprint is growing into a market force to be reckoned with.

“China now accounts for 50% of global green hydrogen production capacity,” S&P summarized. The strong showing suggests that competition from Chinese producers is one reason why diversified energy stakeholders in the US and elsewhere have rolled back their plans for renewable H2, to concentrate on their traditional business.

Further wracking nerves among green H2 producers in other regions is China’s pursuit of patents. Earlier this month the Asia-Pacific news organization Recessary was among those taking note of an analysis by the Japanese firm Astamuse, indicating that China has been scrambling to file renewable hydrogen patents at a furious pace since 2020, when the nation announced its carbon targets.

“The large number of patents has driven down the cost of hydrogen production equipment in China to just a quarter of that in Europe,” Recessary noted, referring to electrolyzer systems powered by renewable energy, which deploy electricity and a catalyst to push hydrogen gas from water (see more green H2 background here).

Scaling Up Green Hydrogen For Green Ammonia

Rounding out the news from China, last week the firm Envision Energy announced that the global testing and inspection firm Bureau Veritas has certified its forthcoming 500-megawatt Chifeng facility in Inner Mongolai for industrial-scale renewable ammonia, to be produced with green hydrogen. The facility began limited production last year and is on track to reach full volume this September.

Although much attention has been paid to the role of green hydrogen as a fuel for fuel cell vehicles of various sorts, hydrogen is also an industrial input with a firm grip on the ammonia fertilizer field, and that is where another opportunity lies. Last week Envision reached an agreement with the leading Japanese infrastructure and commodities trading firm Marubeni, indicating that the demand for green ammonia can support industrial scale electrolyzer systems.

“The project uses Envision’s advanced electrolyzer technology, powered by wind and solar, to produce 300,000 tons of green ammonia annually, making it one of the world’s first and largest commercial projects of its kind,” Envision explained.

“It is a testament to how innovation and sustainability can go hand-in-hand – from our advanced electrolyzer technology to the use of 100% renewable power, we’re redefining what’s possible in green hydrogen and ammonia production,” emphasized Envision VP Frank Yu in a press statement.

Meanwhile, Over Here In The USA …

The US is one of those other regions where green hydrogen producers are getting a case of the yips, though not particularly on account of forthcoming competition from China. Instead, the call is coming from inside the house.

Just a few years ago, hydrogen stakeholders were anticipating a bonanza of federal and investor support through the new $7 billion Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs program. Launched during the Biden administration, the initiative was supposed to stimulate and diversify hydrogen production across the US. The program included space for natural gas extraction as required by the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, but much of the emphasis was on renewable hydrogen, including biomass resources as well as water electrolysis.

Trump put the program on ice after taking office, except for the natural gas end of things. Shocker!

Still, outside of the program some green hydrogen projects have wriggled through. Earlier this year, for example, the startup TalusAg launched a green ammonia venture in Iowa, featuring a reproduceable business model aimed at producing ammonia fertilizer locally for rural markets.

The E-Fuels Solution: Follow The Money … To Texas

The emerging e-fuels (aka electrofuels) industry is another source of support for the global green hydrogen market. E-fuels stakeholders began drifting into Texas several years ago, lured by copious wind and solar resources along with access to seaports and inland energy infrastructure.

The e-fuels industry leverages green hydrogen and captured carbon to produce synthetic, drop-in replacements for liquid fuels, with SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) being a priority target.

The California startup Infinium was among the first to foray into Texas. The company’s Project Pathfinder e-fuels operation is already up and running in Corpus Christie, and neither competition from China nor the frowning face of the Trump administration has stopped it from moving forward with plans for a second facility.

On May 19 the company dropped word that construction has begun on Project Roadrunner in Texas, near the city of Pecos. The venture was publicized after Infinium closed on financing from A-listers Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst.

“The site is expected to become the world’s largest eFuels production facility when operational, producing 23,000 tonnes per year (7.6 million gallons) of sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) and other eFuel products,” Infinium enthused.

Infinium already has offtake relationships with American Airlines here in the US, and with the UK firm IAG, which owns British Airways, Aer Lingus. IAG has already agreed to import its eSAF to the UK.

“Commercial agreements for the project—including feedstock, vendor and offtake contracts — have been structured and de-risked to attract the infrastructure capital and debt required for the continued scaling of the eFuels market,” Infinium emphasized.

If all goes according to plan, production will begin in 2027, with power supplied from a nearby wind farm under the umbrella of NextEra Energy Resources. Infinium also anticipates that the system will overproduce hydrogen, enabling it to pursue additional offtake agreements for green hydrogen as well complete e-fuels.

Green Hydrogen: The Electrolyzer Factor

Infinium has tapped the Massachusetts firm Electric Hydrogen to supply its turnkey “HYPRPlant” electrolyzer system to produce the green hydrogen for Project Roadrunner. According to Electric Hydrogen, the pre-assembled solution can cut the installed cost of green hydrogen by up to 60%, compared to conventional electrolyzers systems. Electric Hydrogen also pre-tests the system before shipping it out, relieving producers from on-site troubleshooting.

In March, Electric Hydrogen announced that its electrolyzer system will be manufactured by the Texas firm Titan Production Equipment. Regardless of global trends, the firm is confident that opportunities persist here on its home turf and in Europe as well.

“The partnership with Titan illustrates how growth in the hydrogen industry creates opportunities for expansion of energy businesses and jobs in Texas,” Electric Hydrogen noted in a press statement.

Perhaps they are on to something. Despite President Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” energy policy, longtime oil and gas stakeholders have been casting around for new business in the clean energy field, and Titan is a good example. The company traces its roots as a manufacturer of oil and gas process equipment back to the 1920’s, and now it is applying that know-how to electrolysis systems.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/green-hydrogen-china-envision-us-infinium.png,N,,2025-05-25 15:08:09.769002

The urgency for lithium, a critical component in electric vehicle (EV) batteries and renewable energy storage, has never been more pronounced. With major automakers like Tesla and BMW intensifying their search for reliable lithium sources, Elektros Inc.'s advancements come at a pivotal moment.

Industry analysts highlight the strategic importance of West African lithium reserves in diversifying the global supply chain, reducing dependency on traditional markets, and fostering economic growth in emerging regions.

Investor-Centric Growth and Market Potential

Elektros Inc.'s streamlined share structure and proactive exploration strategies have caught the attention of investors seeking opportunities in the booming EV and renewable energy sectors. The company's recent developments are anticipated to catalyze increased trading activity and shareholder value.

""Elektros Inc. is not just exploring lithium; we're unlocking the future of energy,"" remarked CEO Shlomo Bleier. ""Our Sierra Leone project exemplifies our dedication to innovation and shareholder prosperity.""

Lithium, often called the ""white gold"" of the energy sector, is one of the most coveted and strategically essential commodities in the global economy today. It is the critical element powering every electric vehicle (EV) on the market-from Tesla and Mercedes-Benz to BMW and Lexus. Its high energy density, lightweight nature, and rechargeable capabilities make it indispensable for lithium-ion batteries, which are the heartbeat of the EV industry.

According to Benzinga, ""Thanks to global green initiatives and the increasing demand for electric vehicles (EVs), lithium stocks could be a good place to invest if you're looking for growth and capital appreciation."" Benzinga further notes that lithium demand is projected to rise with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% through 2026, fueled by the shift to electric transportation and renewable energy.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts lithium demand could surge up to 42 times by 2040, driven by unprecedented demand for clean technologies. But with supply bottlenecks and limited global extraction sites, companies with early-stage discoveries like Elektros Inc. are positioned for long-term impact and success.

Benzinga highlights several lithium-related stocks as high-growth investments, and Elektros Inc.'s recent breakthrough in Sierra Leone places it firmly on the radar of institutional and retail investors alike.

These are just a few examples of unions fighting to make a pro-worker clean energy economy real.","State and local governments have begun taking concrete steps toward a clean energy economy, and for now, even under Donald Trump, green union jobs are increasing.

Meanwhile, unions have partnered with climate activists to win legislation for more such jobs. Six states have passed “climate jobs” bills to expand renewable energy and raise labor standards for that construction. Four more have union coalitions advocating for such legislation.

Will the green surge continue? And if it does, will workers reap the economic benefits — or get left behind?

The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) opened the door for clean energy projects across the country. Many IRA tax credits were designed to encourage the use of high-wage union labor. But under the Trump administration, most of this IRA funding is either in limbo or has been canceled outright.

Still, more workers are getting experience on jobs that will be central to the potential clean energy economy of the future.

How do workers feel about these jobs? And are they laying the groundwork for more workers to embrace a clean energy transition?

Solar Puzzle

The solar panels we see on rooftops of public buildings and private homes are relatively easy to install, and unions like the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) have many members with experience in the industry.

IBEW Local 3 has a solar training program based in Long Island, New York, that is required for all apprentices. Chris Schroth, a Local 3 member, says increased solar work provides a hedge against unemployment when there’s a slowdown in construction. These slow periods are happening more frequently: with more people working from home, demand for commercial construction has decreased.

But solar work comes with limitations. The panels can be installed quickly and require very little maintenance, so many workers don’t see them as long-term projects offering stability. And so far, says Schroth, “only a small percentage of our members have worked on solar. So the idea that this kind of work can be an alternative still doesn’t feel real to people.”

Joe Mirkin is an IBEW Local 7 member in Massachusetts, where many members have worked on big solar farms. The jobs are good while they last and can include a lot of overtime. But Mirkin echoed concerns about their short-term nature. “The work is managed by out-of-town contractors,” he said. “These aren’t long-term careers.”

While more and more IBEW members are working in solar, most solar jobs are still nonunion, and they’re often exploitative. Though some nonunion solar workers have reached out to the IBEW, according to Mirkin this hasn’t led to new organizing.

Huge strides have been made over the last decade in developing offshore wind. The North Atlantic off New England offers ideal conditions. In Rhode Island, building trades unions supported the development of Block Island Wind, the nation’s largest offshore wind project, and jumped at the chance to use further funding through the IRA.

The Trump administration has blocked all new permits for wind energy development, at least for now. But work on existing projects continues.

Erin Vaughan, a member of IBEW Local 223 in Massachusetts, is currently working to build wind turbines off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard. This is part of the Vineyard Wind 1 project, one of eleven offshore wind farms attached together on federal lands.

Generally, Vaughan thinks the working conditions on offshore wind are better than on other projects she’s been part of. But it can be dangerous, as workers deal with huge components in very tight spaces. She had to go through a rigorous six-week training program in four different states.

Vaughan is concerned about the Trump administration’s freeze on offshore wind and other IRA projects. “There’s decades of work out here, and I would hate to see it all stopped,” she said.

Compounding this is the shutdown of more nuclear plants. Maintenance of these non-carbon-emitting plants is a big source of employment for IBEW members.

Maintaining existing fossil fuel infrastructure is not enough to substantially increase work, says Vaughan. “If you have the ability to travel for oil refinery maintenance, that’s good, but it doesn’t add many jobs.”

Deeper Organizing

Of course, the clean energy transition we need is not limited to wind and solar. The union officers pushing climate jobs bills are often also advocating for geothermal energy, battery storage, building retrofits, and nuclear power to add to a transition. The United Auto Workers’ recent successes organizing electric vehicle plants are encouraging.

Project Labor Agreements, while great for guaranteeing higher wages on construction work, also contain no-strike clauses and limit workers’ scope of activity on the shop floor. It’s hard for workers to become on-the-job organizers who can take on problems in a context where labor peace with contractors is established from the very start.

Especially in the current political climate, workers in the building trades need to more aggressively organize nonunion clean energy workers. A new clean energy economy is an opportunity for the building trades to bring more of a union culture to these projects and combat longstanding problems like mandatory overtime and speed-up.

The shift to a green economy is also a great opening for unions to do internal education about the benefits to workers of clean energy development. Sometimes this member education can happen in the midst of real-time legislative fights unions are helping to lead.

The Rhode Island AFL-CIO fought for the state’s Act on Climate, which set binding targets for carbon emissions reductions. The act was passed in 2021.

In New York City, the building trades helped pass the Public Solar Bill in September 2024, setting the stage for the installation of one hundred megawatts of solar on public buildings by 2030. The Climate and Equitable Jobs Act in Illinois, passed in 2021 with unanimous labor support, contains ambitious climate targets while maintaining a strong commitment to putting unions in the driver’s seat.

These are just a few examples of unions fighting to make a pro-worker clean energy economy real.

At their best, campaigns like these aren’t simply lobbying exercises for leadership, but include political education and member mobilization. They are an opportunity to engage members on the shop floor and educate about the potential benefits of a clean energy transition.",https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/25132902/GettyImages-2162346307.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 14:05:06.804115

This setback could prove incredibly damaging, delaying progress on converting the global economy to renewable energy.
Projects across solar, wind, hydro, and even nuclear power are contributing to massive growth in the renewable energy sector.
In fact, renewable energy is set to be able to meet nearly half of the global electricity demand by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency.
Seventeen states and Washington, D.C., recently announced that they are suing the administration over its wind power obstruction.","Reuters reported that Macquarie, an Australian investment bank, canceled the sale of Corio Generation because of a lack of interested buyers. Corio owns and oversees a major 25-gigawatt collection of offshore wind projects that span several continents, from Asia-Pacific to Europe and the Americas.

The update comes at a time when President Trump's administration has sent global economies into a tailspin with aggressive tariffs, leading to overall market instability. However, the hesitancy also comes as the Trump administration has doubled down on dirty fuel sources like oil and gas, backpedaling on the significant advancements in renewable energy projects made in previous years.

Now, Corio is downsizing instead. A spokesperson told Reuters that with the ""challenging"" market conditions, the company is ""refocusing its global operations to prioritize the development of a smaller portfolio of projects which have the clearest route through to construction.""

Additionally, they said, ""This will also require a restructure of the organization to reflect that change in strategy.""

Corio's projects are also facing challenges with skyrocketing construction costs, higher interest rates, and supply chain issues, Reuters explained.

Why is this downsizing concerning?

Wind power is both a positive economic force as well as a boon for the environment, curbing planet-heating pollution as it creates high-paying jobs. The U.S. Department of Energy predicts that the wind industry will have the potential to support hundreds of thousands more jobs in the coming decades. It also provides critical tax dollars, contributing an estimated $2 billion in state and local tax payments and land-lease payments annually, per Clean Power.

Yet despite this, the Trump administration suspended leasing for new offshore wind projects on his first day back in office in January; the president has also halted the development of other existing projects. This setback could prove incredibly damaging, delaying progress on converting the global economy to renewable energy.

This green transition is crucial for achieving carbon neutrality and ensuring the atmospheric stability and the future of the planet. But in the short term, projects like Corio's also generate positive financial returns for investors.

What's being done to keep incentivizing wind power?

While Corio is downsizing, the march toward a renewable-powered future still persists. Projects across solar, wind, hydro, and even nuclear power are contributing to massive growth in the renewable energy sector. In fact, renewable energy is set to be able to meet nearly half of the global electricity demand by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency.

And when it comes to wind project development, many states are pushing back on the Trump administration's anti-environmental actions. Seventeen states and Washington, D.C., recently announced that they are suing the administration over its wind power obstruction.

Legal observers note that the case could ultimately reach the Supreme Court, where previous environmental rulings — including the Court’s narrowing of the EPA’s regulatory powers — have signaled an increasingly skeptical view of federal environmental authority.","In a striking escalation of tensions over environmental policy, California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Governor Gavin Newsom announced Friday that the state will initiate legal action in response to a move by Senate Republicans to dismantle key components of California’s clean vehicle regulations. The officials cast the maneuver as a politically motivated attempt to undermine longstanding efforts to combat air pollution and climate change.

“With these votes, S enate Republicans are once again bending the knee to former President Donald Trump,” Attorney General Bonta said at a press briefing. “Their weaponization of the Congressional Review Act to attack California’s waivers is the latest salvo in a relentless, partisan crusade against our state’s leadership in environmental protection. It is an unlawful misuse of Congressional authority, and California will not sit idly by while they attempt to erode our right to protect public health and the planet. We will take this fight to court.”

Governor Newsom echoed Bonta’s remarks, accusing Senate Republicans of acting in direct defiance of legislative precedent and constitutional norms. “This vote is not only illegal, it’s an affront to decades of bipartisan environmental progress,” Newsom said. “Republicans circumvented their own Senate parliamentarian to push this through — betraying principles that date back to the Republican administrations of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. We will not allow Trump-aligned Republicans to drag us backward, to undo progress on clean air and cede our economic and technological future to competitors like China. California will meet them in court and defend our waivers.”

A Battle Over Waivers and State Sovereignty

At the heart of the legal dispute is California’s longstanding authority to set stricter vehicle emissions standards under the federal Clean Air Act. For over half a century, California has operated with a special waiver granted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), allowing the state to enforce its own vehicle emissions regulations — often more stringent than those mandated by federal law. Other states have the option to adopt California’s standards, which has effectively enabled the state to shape national vehicle policy.

The current standoff began under the Trump administration, when the EPA submitted three of California’s key waivers to Congress as if they were federal agency rules subject to the Congressional Review Act (CRA) — a legislative mechanism that allows Congress to overturn federal regulations within a narrow window of time. The waivers in question cover the state’s Advanced Clean Cars II program, its omnibus regulations to curb nitrogen oxide emissions from heavy-duty vehicles, and its Advanced Clean Trucks mandate.

Earlier this month, the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives voted to repeal the waivers, and now the Senate has followed suit, over the objections of legal experts and nonpartisan authorities. Both the Government Accountability Office and the Senate Parliamentarian previously concluded that California’s waivers are not “rules” under the CRA and therefore not subject to repeal through that process.

Legal and Environmental Stakes

The state’s legal challenge could set a major precedent for how far Congress can go in intervening in state-level environmental policy, particularly in the context of national efforts to address climate change. At issue is not only whether California retains the right to exceed federal standards — a practice that has helped drive innovation in cleaner cars and trucks — but also whether future administrations will be able to reverse course on environmental protections by circumventing standard procedures.

The Clean Air Act, originally signed into law in 1970 and amended in 1990, explicitly allows California to seek waivers from the EPA to implement its own emissions rules, a provision that acknowledges the state’s unique air quality challenges. The EPA must grant those waivers unless the agency finds that California’s standards are arbitrary, unnecessary, or not needed to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions. None of those criteria, California argues, are applicable in this case.

“For decades, California has stood at the forefront of the fight against smog, vehicle pollution, and climate change,” Bonta said. “We’re not going to give that up because of a procedural stunt in Congress.”

The lawsuit, once filed, is expected to attract broad attention from environmental groups, automobile manufacturers, and other states that have adopted California’s emissions standards. Legal observers note that the case could ultimately reach the Supreme Court, where previous environmental rulings — including the Court’s narrowing of the EPA’s regulatory powers — have signaled an increasingly skeptical view of federal environmental authority.

As California prepares its legal defense, state officials say they will continue enforcing their clean vehicle regulations, which are key to meeting California’s ambitious climate goals — including a mandate that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035.

“We’re not backing down,” Newsom said. “The air our children breathe, the future of our climate, and the strength of our economy depend on us holding this line.”",https://cdn.autoconnectedcar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/staronly.png,N,,2025-05-25 14:05:20.851927

Starting this summer, the company will introduce the Trail Boss trim to the 2026 Silverado EV lineup — a lifted, off-road-ready variant that blends the robust capability Trail Boss is known for with the powertrain of a next-generation electric vehicle.

First launched in 2019 on the gas-powered Silverado, Trail Boss quickly became one of the brand’s top-performing trims. The EV iteration aims to build on that success, offering up to 725 horsepower, 775 lb-ft of torque, and a towing capacity of 12,500 pounds with the Max Range battery pack, according to preliminary figures from General Motors.

“Trail Boss has been one of the highest-turning trims in our portfolio,” said Scott Bell, Chevrolet’s vice president. “Adding it to Silverado EV gives customers an option that builds on our strong truck pedigree, high electric range, and off-road capability.”

Electric Grit

Engineered for adventure, the Silverado EV Trail Boss includes a 2-inch lift, providing a 24% ground clearance increase over the base model. It features a unique coil suspension with hydraulic rebound control, 35-inch all-terrain tires, and off-road drive modes like Terrain and Sidewinder. The latter enables a diagonal crawl at low speeds, moving all four wheels in unison — a boon in rocky environments or tight spaces.

“This is a true off-road vehicle,” said Joe Roy, chief engineer of the Silverado EV, who noted the trim shares much of the rugged DNA expected from the Trail Boss nameplate.

Design cues reflect that spirit: a high-angle approach front fascia, red tow hooks, black cladding, and exclusive badging. Inside, switches for auxiliary gear, such as off-road lights, come prewired — a nod to customization.

Tech and Range

Built at GM’s Factory ZERO facility in Detroit, the Silverado EV Trail Boss will be available with two battery configurations: Extended (EPA-estimated 410 miles) and Max Range (GM-estimated 478 miles). It will also be among the first Silverado trims to benefit from an upgraded version of GM’s Super Cruise, the company’s hands-free driving technology, now offering greater lane-change autonomy and better integration with Google Maps.

Super Cruise with towing capabilities will be available on both the LT and Trail Boss trims. Adaptive cruise control, now enhanced to adjust speeds to match posted limits, will be standard.

A Broader Lineup

The Trail Boss joins the Work Truck (WT) and LT as part of the growing Silverado EV family. Chevrolet will sunset its launch-edition RST model to make way for broader consumer options. Prices for the 2026 Silverado EV start at $54,895, with Trail Boss models ranging from $72,095 to $88,695, depending on battery pack.

All trims include a 17.7-inch infotainment screen, Google built-in compatibility, and up to 10.2 kW of off-board power — a feature useful for job sites or outdoor excursions.

Chevrolet’s move to add the Trail Boss trim signals the brand’s intention to remain competitive in the increasingly crowded electric truck segment, where traditional capability and modern tech are no longer mutually exclusive.

Bye Bye EV Tax Credits?

The U.S. House of Representatives has passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” a sweeping tax and spending package that includes the elimination of federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credits. The legislation proposes ending the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs by December 31, 2026, with an earlier cutoff of December 31, 2025, for automakers that have sold over 200,000 qualifying vehicles.

Additionally, the $4,000 credit for used EVs would be terminated after this year. The bill also introduces new annual registration fees of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners to replace traditional fuel taxes.

Proponents of the bill argue that it reduces government spending and prevents taxpayer money from subsidizing high-income individuals purchasing luxury EVs. Critics, however, warn that removing these incentives could hinder the growth of the EV market, potentially leading to job losses and reduced competitiveness in the global clean energy sector. Some Republican senators have expressed concerns that a full repeal of the tax credits could disrupt job growth and the energy sector.

The bill now moves to the Senate, where its future remains uncertain. While some lawmakers support the measure, others have raised concerns about its potential impact on the economy and the environment. It is expected that the outcome will significantly influence the direction of U.S. energy policy and the adoption of electric vehicles in the coming years.

Orange EV Surpasses 100-Truck Fleets

Orange EV, the leading U.S. maker of pure-electric yard trucks, announced that several customers now operate fleets of over 100 Orange EV trucks across the U.S. and Canada. These companies cite the high cost, inefficiency, and downtime of diesel yard trucks as key reasons for converting to electric.

The company’s e-TRIEVER® trucks offer over 98% uptime, lower operating costs, and superior driver comfort. Customers have reported dramatic savings—one fleet saved nearly $400,000 in fuel from just two electric trucks with over 30,000 operating hours each. While electric trucks involve a higher upfront cost, lower fuel and maintenance expenses have delivered strong long-term returns.

With more than 1,400 trucks deployed and 8.5 million operational hours logged across 40 states and Canada, Orange EV continues to lead the charge in zero-emission yard truck adoption, offering a turnkey package that includes vehicles, charging infrastructure, and full service support.

ChargePoint and Eaton Partner

ChargePoint and Eaton have announced a strategic collaboration to accelerate the deployment of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. The partnership aims to streamline the purchase, design, and installation of EV charging systems by offering integrated, turnkey solutions that include chargers, electrical infrastructure, and engineering services.

Together, the companies will co-develop technologies to advance bidirectional charging and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) capabilities, enabling EVs to serve as power sources for homes and buildings. This one-stop-shop approach will help reduce costs, manage site power needs more efficiently, and boost the reliability of charging systems.

ChargePoint CEO Rick Wilmer and Eaton’s energy transition head Paul Ryan emphasized the partnership’s role in addressing key electrification challenges and supporting large-scale energy transition. The collaboration positions ChargePoint as a comprehensive EV ecosystem provider, integrating vehicles, infrastructure, and cloud-based management tools to support a wide range of charging scenarios from fleet and residential to public and commercial applications.",https://cdn.autoconnectedcar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/staronly.png,N,,2025-05-25 15:08:04.734216

Washington, DC — : A massive revival of nuclear energy is underway in the United States as former President Donald Trump signs a sweeping executive order to increase nuclear energy production by 300% over the next 25 years. The announcement, made from the Oval Office, marks a decisive shift in the nation’s energy policy, emphasizing nuclear as the cornerstone of future American power generation.

The ambitious initiative outlines four major actions: accelerating the approval of new nuclear reactors, reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), starting three reactors by July 4, 2026, and expanding investment in the industrial base supporting nuclear infrastructure. Trump declared that the U.S. is entering a “nuclear energy era”, committing to large-scale, long-term development to meet surging domestic power demands.

The plan includes restarting shut-down nuclear power plants that were previously closed due to market pressures from cheap natural gas and renewables. Both the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense have been instructed to spearhead these restarts, as well as to explore the construction of new reactors on federal land — including U.S. military bases.

The United States, currently second only to China in electricity consumption, used 4,200 terawatt-hours of power in 2023, with 19% of that—775 terawatt-hours—coming from nuclear sources. Under the Trump-backed expansion strategy, one-third of the nation’s electricity could be nuclear-powered within the next two and a half decades.

Today, the country operates 94 nuclear reactors spread across various power plants, with Illinois leading the count at 11 active units. However, several plants have been retired in recent years, reflecting economic shifts that favored natural gas and solar/wind alternatives. This new policy push is expected to reverse that trend, providing the regulatory and financial framework to reinvigorate America’s nuclear energy industry.

Reforms to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are central to the plan. Trump’s directive aims to streamline licensing procedures and eliminate bureaucratic bottlenecks that have historically slowed down the construction and operation of new nuclear facilities. The goal is to establish a faster, more innovation-friendly regulatory environment that encourages private sector participation.

Infrastructure spending is another key pillar. Investments will target reactor design innovations, uranium supply chains, safety modernization, and manufacturing capabilities, ensuring that the U.S. nuclear sector is both globally competitive and domestically reliable. Plans also involve mobilizing public-private partnerships to drive R&D and accelerate deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs) and next-generation nuclear technologies.",https://internationalnewsandviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Donald-trump-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 17:05:13.010486

But now, that incentive might be getting tossed out the window, and the fallout could hit GM and Ford like a freight train, while Tesla quietly wins the long game.

A new budget proposal from House Republicans is looking to end the federal tax credits that helped EVs find their place in American garages. If it goes through, not only would it pull the rug out from under new and used EV buyers, but it would also throw a wrench in the plans of two legacy automakers who bet big on the electric future.

The fine print: How the credit worked

The EV tax credit was something you claimed when filing your federal income taxes the following year. It knocked up to $7,500 off your tax bill, but only if you owed that much in the first place. You didn’t get a refund check for the difference, and you couldn’t roll it over. It wasn’t generous, just helpful.

To qualify, the vehicle had to be built in North America and meet strict sourcing rules for battery materials. Plus, there were income caps for buyers. The rules weren’t simple, but they made EVs more accessible and helped move the market forward. That system could vanish now.

The controversial proposal

Under the GOP-backed plan, the $7,500 credit for new EVs and the $4,000 credit for used EVs would both be eliminated. It would also pull support for clean energy production and EV battery plants, undercutting the incentives that drove recent investment in domestic manufacturing.

Lawmakers pushing the change are calling it a fiscally responsible move. But for automakers like GM and Ford, it’s more like watching the floor fall out just as they finally got their EV plans off the ground.

General Motors and Ford have poured billions into battery facilities, new EV platforms, and ambitious timelines. GM’s Ultium platform and Ford’s massive BlueOval campuses were designed with the tax credit in mind.

If those credits disappear, so does a big chunk of that consumer motivation. GM and Ford are still racing toward profitability on their electric lineups. Without the credits, they might find themselves in a slower lane than they can afford to be in.

Tesla, naturally, is grinning

While other companies scrambled to adjust to sourcing requirements and final assembly rules, Tesla had already built most of its production right here in the U.S. They’ve got more control over their supply chains, fewer international dependencies, and a huge head start on turning a profit from their electric fleet. They also have enough breathing room to cut prices aggressively… with or without government help.

So while legacy automakers may scramble to make their business models work, Tesla will keep selling cars, with or without Uncle Sam’s backing.

Leasing: the one loophole that might survive

There is, however, one potential escape hatch, and it’s not very glamorous: leasing.

Under the current rules, commercial buyers (like leasing companies) can still access the full $7,500 credit. Many of them pass the savings on to consumers through reduced monthly payments. That’s part of why EV leasing has exploded lately —because it’s one of the few ways regular drivers can still benefit without jumping through hoops.

Unless this new proposal shuts that down too, it might become the last bridge between consumers and affordable EV access.

If the tax credit dies, the impact will be immediate. EV sales are likely to surge briefly — a final rush from buyers trying to cash in while they still can. But once that grace period ends, expect a cool-down. Mass-market EVs will become harder to sell, and automakers counting on rapid adoption will be forced to rethink their timelines.

If you’re planning to buy an EV, better act fast — because in 2026, that $7,500 discount may be just another part of the electric dream that disappeared in a cloud of exhaust. Meanwhile, Elon Musk? He’s already five exits ahead.",https://eladelantado.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gm-ev-charging.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 13:09:17.801880

The overturned waivers block the state’s mandate to phase out all gas-powered cars by 2035 and tighten emissions on certain trucks. The House voted on the waivers last month.

The vote was 51-44, with only Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan siding with Republicans.

Under the federal Clean Air Act, California has historically been able to create its own stricter emission standards compared to national standards with the approval of the Environmental Protection Agency, which gives the state waivers for each approved policy. Other states have had the option to adopt California’s more stringent policies.

Washington is one of 17 states to do so, meaning its ability to enforce certain vehicle policies is jeopardized by the federal government’s latest decision.

There are questions of legality about the federal government’s use of the Congressional Review Act, which was cited to revoke the waivers. The Senate parliamentarian, a nonpartisan staffer who interprets Senate’s rules, and the Government Accountability Office, both concluded it was an illegal use of the act. While the determinations are only advisories, the staffer’s and office’s guidance are traditionally followed.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta has said the state will challenge the action in court, but in the meantime, public health groups, environmental agencies and government officials in Washington are worried how the decisions will hinder the state’s ability to meet its emission goals.

By 2050, Washington must cut gas emissions by 95% of 1990 levels. The most recent data from the State Department of Ecology shows that transportation is the largest contributor to statewide emissions, at almost 40%.

“The Senate’s action to waive California’s vehicle emissions standards will drastically impact Washington’s ability to combat climate change, will hurt human and environmental health, and will set economic and job growth back,” wrote Michael Mann, executive director of Clean and Prosperous, a climate policy research organization. “Ultimately, this is a step backward that will increase air pollution and delay the transition to cleaner, more affordable sources of transportation fuels for Washington businesses and drivers.”

All their efforts are starting to pay off now, as Kenya’s electric motorcycle sales seem to be taking off.
The share of electric motorcycles rose to 3.6% in 2023 from 2.8% in 2022 and 0.5% in 2021.
Now imagine if, say, five players out of the over thirty players in Kenya’s electric motorcycle sector also push to add 5,000 electric motorcycles in the next 2 years or so.
Back to ARC Ride: ARC Ride says the move to add 5,000 electric motorcycles will directly result in over 100,000 metric tonnes of CO2 per year being saved as electric mobility replaces petrol motorbikes.","Several Kenya-based firms have done a magnificent job of building the country’s electric motorcycle industry from scratch starting about 7 years ago. After going through the various stages of early pilots, further pilots, multiple iterations, and pivots, a number of them found the sweet spot and then graduated into early commercialization phases of their products. These firms had to dig deep in their research and development phases to produce electric motorcycles that can manage the demands of the boda boda industry and at the same time handle the local terrain as well as rough road conditions. This is because for their products to take off, they really needed to make products that are robust enough to match or exceed the fossil-fueled products that are currently on the market.

That meant they could not just bring off-the-shelf products and components from overseas, but they really had to adapt their designs for these conditions. After that, the next thing was to show that these new electric motorcycles had a lower total cost of ownership. Then the next step was to forge strategic partnerships with partners that are already in the distribution and financing ecosystem for traditional motorcycles. This would unlock important channels that align with their route to market strategies.

All their efforts are starting to pay off now, as Kenya’s electric motorcycle sales seem to be taking off. In 2023, there were 70,691 motorcycles sold in Kenya. 2,557 of these were electric. That means 3.6% of motorcycles sold in 2023 in Kenya were electric. That is almost 4%. So, we did not expect it to be long before the market share reached the critical 5%, which is generally viewed as the tipping point indicating the start of mass adoption. The share of electric motorcycles rose to 3.6% in 2023 from 2.8% in 2022 and 0.5% in 2021. 2024 was even better — market share surged to 7.1%. The KNBS Economic Survey Report (2025) shows that 68,804 new motorcycles were registered Kenya in 2024. Of these, 4,862 motorcycles were electric according to data presented by the Electric Mobility Association of Kenya (EMAK). That is where the 7.1% market share comes from.

Several firms are already positioning themselves for an even bigger 2025. One of these firms is ARC Ride. ARC Ride, an e-mobility battery-as-a-service (BaaS) provider, recently announced $5 million of financing from British International Investment (BII), the UK’s development finance institution and impact investor, to provide affordable, reliable, and clean e-mobility solutions for rapidly developing cities in Kenya.

E-mobility is crucial to Kenya’s climate goals. Kenya is aiming for a low-carbon transport system by 2030. The transport sector, responsible for 13% of Kenya’s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, sees electric vehicles (EVs) as key to reducing emissions and improving air quality.

However, due to limited access to charging facilities and appropriate financing solutions, EV adoption has been slow. ARC Ride is addressing this challenge by providing affordable and user-friendly BaaS solutions. The company has already installed 170 charging stations in Nairobi. This reduces the upfront cost of electric two-wheelers (E2Ws) and enables quicker battery swaps.

BII’s financing will enable ARC Ride’s initial rollout of 5,000 E2Ws and accelerate the expansion of E2W BaaS infrastructure. By building Africa’s first and largest automated battery swapping network, it is also establishing the industry standard for battery swapping of E2Ws both for ARC Ride and other manufacturers, which is important for more EV adoption. Remember that about 4,800 electric motorcycles were sold in Kenya last year across all operators. So, ARC Ride making 5,000 electric motorcycles available will give the sector a massive boost! Now imagine if, say, five players out of the over thirty players in Kenya’s electric motorcycle sector also push to add 5,000 electric motorcycles in the next 2 years or so. We could be getting 25,000 electric motorcycles per year in the medium term! Back to ARC Ride: ARC Ride says the move to add 5,000 electric motorcycles will directly result in over 100,000 metric tonnes of CO2 per year being saved as electric mobility replaces petrol motorbikes.

Daniel Wilcox, Economic Counsellor, British High Commission Nairobi, said: “There is enormous potential for green manufacturing in Kenya to drive economic growth and job creation. The UK is a long-term partner for long term growth in Kenya — and this investment will support Kenya’s climate ambitions, support hardworking Kenyans and their jobs, make Nairobi not only a healthier place to live, and a more attractive place to do business. This investment compliments the UK’s effort in supporting the decarbonisation of the Nairobi transport systems — long may Nairobi remain the green city in the sun!”

Seema Dhanani, Head of Office, Kenya and Coverage Director, East Africa at BII said: “In Kenya, a Boda Boda is more than just a motorbike; it’s a crucial part of the transportation system, helping millions of people to commute. That is why electrifying Boda Bodas is essential for creating a green and sustainable future for the country. As the UK’s DFI, we are backing modern technology and innovative companies such as ARC Ride to accelerate the transition and have a transformative impact on people and the planet.”

Joseph Hurst, CEO of ARC Ride, said: “This strategic partnership between ARC Ride and BII marks a significant milestone in our ongoing efforts to expand scale and expand our Pan African footprint. Together, we will ensure millions of clean kilometres will be driven. Putting more money in the pockets of our riders whilst protecting the environment.”

To show just how much traction the electric mobility industry has got in Kenya now, Roam, the Nairobi-based electric mobility manufacturer, has been named Kenya’s fastest-growing company and among Africa’s top 40 in the 2025 Financial Times and Statista ranking of Africa’s Fastest Growing Companies. The firm placed 35th overall on the continent — the highest among 11 Kenyan businesses on the list — and emerged as the leading electric mobility manufacturer featured.

Compiled by the Financial Times and data firm Statista, the ranking assessed over 130 companies across Africa based on their compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and absolute revenue growth between 2020 and 2023. Roam posted an 86.4% CAGR and 547.8% revenue growth, solidifying its position at the forefront of Africa’s clean technology movement.

Founded in 2017, Roam designs and manufactures electric motorcycles and buses tailored for African markets. In recent years, the company has launched Roam Hubs — charging and battery rental stations — in Nairobi, Kiambu, and Machakos counties; partnered with ride-hailing platforms like Uber and Bolt to make electric motorcycles more accessible for boda boda riders; and collaborated with Italy’s Energica to advance local EV engineering. Roam also completed a record-setting 6,000-kilometre electric journey from Nairobi to Stellenbosch in 2024, positioning Africa as a rising hub of innovation.

Roam’s appearance on the FT list places it ahead of prominent Kenyan firms, including M-KOPA, a digital asset financing platform and key Roam partner, and Quickmart Supermarket, which collaborates with Roam on charging infrastructure expansion. Others featured include Victory Farms, TPS Serena Hotels, KCB Group, and Co-operative Bank. This year’s ranking reflects a shift toward more diversified economic growth in Kenya. While fintech and traditional sectors remain strong, Roam’s hardware-first, impact-focused business model highlights the continent’s growing capacity in advanced manufacturing and climate tech. Kenya ranked third overall in company representation, behind South Africa and Nigeria.

Roam’s success also comes amid a global contraction in venture capital funding and rising macroeconomic headwinds. Its steady growth bucks the trend that has challenged high-profile African startups like Jumia and Gro Intelligence in recent years, reinforcing investor confidence in Kenya’s clean energy and industrial potential.

Habib Lukaya, Roam’s Field Operations Manager: “This recognition is not just a milestone for Roam—it is a moment of pride for Kenya. It shows that local manufacturing can thrive, creating jobs and delivering affordable, high-quality electric motorcycles made in Kenya, for Africa. We are building an industry, and with this momentum, we are expanding our footprint to reach more riders and communities across the continent.”

So, we can say it’s been a good week for Kenya’s electric mobility sector. I’m sure we will keep getting these kinds of developments and even bigger ones in the near future.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ARC-Ride-electric-motorcycle-battery-swapping-charging-station.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 13:09:32.686419

The manufacturer said last week the 2026 edition of RAV4 will be available with Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) or Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) powertrains.

The 2026 RAV4 models are expected to be available in the fall. Suggested retail prices are to be disclosed closer to the dealership rollout.

“At Toyota, customer choice is paramount,” said David Christ, group vice president and general manager of its Toyota division.

“With three distinct styles, two highly efficient electrified powertrains, and available front- or all-wheel Drive, the (2026) RAV4 offers something for everyone and is ready to take on all of life’s adventures.”

Toyota reported in January it sold just more than 1 million Toyota and Lexus electrified vehicles in the U.S. during 2024, comprising 43.1% of 2.33 million vehicles sold.

There were a record 883,426 Toyota electrified vehicles sold, up 56.1% year over year, while total Toyota sales were up 4.2%.

RAV4 has been the best-selling SUV in the U.S. for eight consecutive years, with HEV sales up 29.3% and PHEV sales up 19.3% over 2023.

Triad plant update

The RAV4 transition to hybrid vehicles comes as production of lithium batteries is under way at the mammoth Toyota Battery Manufacturing N.C. plant in Randolph County.

The plant represents the largest single economic capital investment in North Carolina history, as well as Toyota’s first in-house overseas battery manufacturing facility.

Shipments are projected to begin in June, the automaker told civic and elected officials during a reception May 18.

Don Stewart takes over June 6 as the plant’s manager, as well as group vice president for Manufacturing Region 7 that includes the Liberty plant.

Stewart said Toyota is nearing 2,000 plant employees. Toyota‘s latest workforce goal is reaching at least 3,000 by the end of 2025 and 5,100 at full production.

Stewart said the manufacturer continues to test production lines for the lithium batteries being produced for hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles. The outcome of those trials will determine the timing of shipments.

The Liberty plant will feature at full production 14 production lines: 10 dedicated to battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; and four to hybrid electric vehicles.

The Biden-era Clean Power Plan marks the third major attempt by the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. It follows the Obama administration's original Clean Power Plan, which required power plants to shift toward lower-carbon sources of electricity.

""Many have voiced concerns that the last administration’s replacement for that rule is similarly overreaching and an attempt to shut down affordable and reliable electricity generation in the United States, raising prices for American families, and increasing the country's reliance on foreign forms of energy,"" the EPA spokesperson said. ""As part of this reconsideration, EPA is developing a proposed rule.""

The spokesperson did not provide further details about the draft plan but said it will be released after an interagency review and once it is signed by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

""President [Donald] Trump promised to kill the Clean Power Plan in his first term, and we continue to build on that progress now,"" the spokesperson quoted Zeldin as saying. ""We are seeking to ensure that the agency follows the rule of law while providing all Americans with access to reliable and affordable energy.""

The first Trump administration's Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule formally rescinded and replaced the Obama-era regulation.

The only currently known technology capable of achieving such reductions is carbon capture and sequestration, which has not yet been deployed at that scale.

The rule quickly came under legal challenge from a coalition of Republican-led states, utility companies, and coal industry stakeholders. Critics said that carbon capture is not economically viable or technologically mature enough to be used at the nation's roughly 200 coal plants. They also pointed to logistical problems, such as the extensive infrastructure needed to pipe captured carbon dioxide into underground storage sites that are located hundreds of miles from the plants.

""So this Court understandably denies the stay applications for now,"" Kavanaugh wrote, adding that if the challengers lose at that level, they may again ask the Supreme Court for relief while appealing the case.

Herein lies the bitter irony: attempting to improve security in the short term could undermine efforts to address the climate threat, which itself is a long-term security risk.
Solar energy company 1Komma5 deliberately avoids using Huawei inverters, despite the higher cost of alternatives.
On one hand, dependence on China does create a real strategic risk.
The issue of Chinese solar inverters is just a small part of a larger mosaic of technological and geopolitical competition.","The recent discovery of hidden cellular communication components in Chinese-made solar inverters installed in American energy farms raises troubling questions about the balance between national security and economic development. This phenomenon comes as no surprise to those following U.S.-China relations in recent years, but it sharpens a strategic dilemma that few are willing to confront openly.

The case reported last November, when solar inverters in the U.S. were remotely disabled, demonstrates the depth of the problem. Whether it was a deliberate ""test run"" or a technical malfunction, the practical result is identical: a foreign entity is capable of disrupting critical energy infrastructure at the push of a button. When it comes to the power grid, the consequences could be catastrophic - from paralyzing healthcare systems to shutting down security facilities.

However, addressing this risk is much more complex than simply replacing Chinese equipment with Western alternatives. China has become a superpower in manufacturing components for the renewable energy industry, with price advantages and production capabilities that have no competitors. Chinese companies, led by Huawei, dominate the global market not only through low prices but also through enormous technological investments and years of specialization.

Complete disconnection from Chinese technology would severely impair Western nations' ability to meet ambitious climate goals. Solar inverters, which constitute a central part of renewable energy systems, would significantly increase in price and slow down the adoption rate of green technologies. Herein lies the bitter irony: attempting to improve security in the short term could undermine efforts to address the climate threat, which itself is a long-term security risk.

But confronting this phenomenon need not be binary. Instead of choosing between the extremes of complete trust in foreign technology or its total rejection, more sophisticated security and defense mechanisms can be developed. A balanced strategy would include several layers:

First, developing independent testing and verification capabilities that can identify suspicious components before installation. Thorough hardware and software testing can reveal ""backdoors"" and undocumented communication mechanisms.

Second, creating a network architecture based on the principle of isolation and separation. Even if a particular component is compromised, a well-distributed electrical system can prevent systemic collapse and limit damage to isolated areas.

Third, developing local manufacturing capabilities for critical components. While it is unlikely that Western countries can compete with China across the entire production chain, they can certainly invest in developing independence in strategic segments.

Germany's experience provides interesting insights in this context. Solar energy company 1Komma5 deliberately avoids using Huawei inverters, despite the higher cost of alternatives. This decision reflects an understanding that long-term security is worth a certain economic premium.

It's important to note that dependence on Chinese technology is not a problem unique to the U.S. Europe, which leads the transition to renewable energy, is even more exposed. Britain has already begun a comprehensive review of Chinese technology in its energy infrastructure, a sign that awareness of the risk is growing.

The real challenge is not just technical, but also political. Public discourse focusing on the ""Chinese threat"" tends to drift into populist rhetoric and sometimes misses the complexity of the problem. On one hand, dependence on China does create a real strategic risk. On the other hand, a complete disconnect from the Chinese market would exact a heavy economic and environmental price.

What is needed is a sober approach based on more sophisticated risk management. Western countries need to develop standards and guidelines that require transparency and verification of critical components, regardless of their country of origin. At the same time, they should accelerate investments in security technologies that can address potential threats.

The issue of Chinese solar inverters is just a small part of a larger mosaic of technological and geopolitical competition. How we deal with this challenge will affect not only the security of energy infrastructure but also our ability to balance national security considerations with economic and environmental needs. The right path is not a dichotomous choice between dangerous dependence and expensive isolationism, but finding a middle path that combines strategic independence with supervised global cooperation.",https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2016/07/13/7132451/7132451_0_0_1000_563_0_large.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 13:09:36.718799

India's renewable power capacity has surged threefold in the last decade, reaching 232GW, driven by significant growth in solar and wind energy. Solar module manufacturing has skyrocketed, transforming India into a global leader with ambitious targets for 2030. The nation is also expanding biopower generation and compressed biogas production, aiming for energy self-sufficiency and reduced import dependence.

India has logged threefold growth in its renewable power capacity in the last decade, with the installed green energy capacity reaching 232GW, including large hydro power plants, currently compared to 75.52GW capacity in March 2014, official sources said. India has emerged as a global front runner in renewable energy space as the traiff of the grid-connected solar power plants has gone down by 80 per cent to Rs 10.95 per unit (for 170MW at Neemuch), sources said.

In March 2014, India's installed solar energy capacity was 2.82 GW, which has crossed 108GW now, recording multifold growth. Wind energy capacity has more than doubled to 51GW presently from 21GW in 2014.

Sources mentioned that during the UPA regime, India was almost absent in the solar manufacturing scene, with a meagre 2GW of solar module production in 2014.

In 2024, India has transformed into a global leader, with solar module manufacturing skyrocketing to 90GW and by 2030, the nation will reach an impressive 150GW, they said.

In 2014, India had almost zero domestic production of solar cells and wafers, which was a stark failure of the previous government's policy, official sources said.

Live Events

Today, India has built a strong foundation with 25GW of solar cell production and 2GW of wafer production.

India has planned solar cells and wafer capacity of 100GW and 40GW respectively by 2030, which is aimed at reducing dependence on imports and becoming a self-sustaining power house.

Even in fully integrated production, the country has reached 3.2GW in 2024, with a target of 24GW by 2030.

Similarly, the biopower generation capacity has increased by 42 per cent from 8.1GW to 11.5GW over the last 10 years.

Compressed Biogas (CBG) sector expanded from a single project with 8 tonnes per day (TPD) CBG generation capacity in 2014 to 150 projects with a cumulative capacity of 1,211 TPD in 2024.

The PM-Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, has gained significant traction, benefitting almost 13.3 lakh households, with nearly 12 lakh installation in the past 10 months, sources stated.

India has added a record 25GW of renewable energy capacity in 2024, which is 34.63 per cent higher than 18.57 GW achieved in the previous year.

India has set an ambitious target of having 500GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, which requires the addition of about 50GW of green capacity per annum in the next five to six years, they stated.

Four renewable energy implementing agency (REIA), SECI, NTPC, NHPC and SJVN, have collectively issued RE power procurement tenders of around 44GW in fiscal year 2024-25.

Earlier in April, India became the world's third-largest producer of electricity from wind and solar energy in 2024, overtaking Germany.

This threefold increase signifies the country's emergence as a global leader in clean energy. Notably, solar power has driven much of this transformation. Solar energy capacity has grown exponentially from just 2.82 GW in 2014 to over 108 GW in 2024. Wind energy capacity has also more than doubled, rising from 21 GW to 51 GW over the same period. Large hydro power plants also contributed to this growth. Tariffs for solar power have dropped by 80 per cent over the decade, with current rates as low as Rs 10.95 per unit at Neemuch, significantly boosting affordability and adoption. India’s solar manufacturing capabilities have similarly expanded. In 2014, solar module production capacity stood at a modest 2 GW. By 2024, this has jumped to 90 GW, with projections estimating 150 GW by 2030. Solar cell production now stands at 25 GW, and wafer production at 2 GW—up from negligible levels a decade ago. The government targets solar cell and wafer capacities of 100 GW and 40 GW, respectively, by 2030, with fully integrated production capacity expected to reach 24 GW. Biopower capacity has also seen steady growth, increasing by 42 per cent from 8.1 GW in 2014 to 11.5 GW in 2024. The compressed biogas sector, once limited to a single project with an 8 tonnes per day (TPD) capacity, now boasts 150 projects with a combined capacity of 1,211 TPD. In the rooftop solar segment, the PM-Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana has made a substantial impact, supporting 13.3 lakh households. Of these, approximately 12 lakh installations have been completed in just ten months. India added 25 GW of renewable energy capacity in 2024 alone, marking a 34.63 per cent rise from the previous year's 18.57 GW. To meet its ambitious target of 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, the country must continue adding around 50 GW annually. In line with these goals, four renewable energy implementing agencies have issued tenders for approximately 44 GW for the fiscal year 2024–25. As of April 2024, India has become the world’s third-largest producer of electricity from wind and solar energy, surpassing Germany and consolidating its position as a key player in the global clean energy transition.

This support encompasses both sovereign and non-sovereign operations, reinforcing Egypt’s standing as the Bank’s second-largest regional member country shareholder—after Nigeria—and the third-largest overall.

Speaking to Daily News Egypt, Diaw revealed that AfDB’s current portfolio in Egypt totals $2.045bn, with private sector operations accounting for $800m, or 39%. The Bank is currently involved in 13 active private sector projects: seven in the power sector, three in finance, and one each in healthcare, industry, and agribusiness.

Key Projects in 2025

AfDB is advancing four major initiatives in Egypt for 2025:

Minapharm Expansion and Renovation Program

Approved in March 2025, this project aims to scale up Egypt’s pharmaceutical capacity by producing biosimilar monoclonal antibodies for oncology and autoimmune diseases—addressing a critical gap in Africa’s healthcare landscape.

JELES

Set for board approval in June, Jobs, Entrepreneurship, and Livelihood Enhancement Support (JELES) will promote youth employment by supporting startups, MSMEs, and inclusive value chains across Egypt.

Partial Credit Guarantee for Samurai Bond

Expected to go before the board in September 2025, this $400m equivalent guarantee (in Japanese yen) will back the issuance of a $500m sustainable Samurai bond, helping Egypt secure more favorable financing terms amid global economic uncertainty.

Large-Scale Solar PV and Battery Storage Project

A private sector-led initiative in southern Egypt, this project will combine solar generation with battery storage and a high-voltage substation to deliver dispatchable clean energy, strengthen grid reliability, and enhance frequency and voltage control.

Sector Focus and Strategic Priorities

Finance is now the largest segment of AfDB’s Egypt portfolio, representing 31%, followed by energy (21%), multisector (19%), agriculture (10%), water and sanitation (9%), and transport (8%). The social and industrial sectors account for just 1% each.

Highlighting Egypt’s prominence in pharmaceuticals—MENA’s largest market with revenues exceeding $56bn—Diaw emphasized AfDB’s investment in critical health infrastructure. In March 2025, the Bank approved a €15m senior loan to Minapharm Pharmaceuticals. It is also conducting due diligence on what could become Africa’s first facility for producing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for small molecules, with a board decision expected by year-end.

Diaw added that the Bank is in discussions to support medium-sized pharmaceutical companies through local commercial banks. Over the past three years, AfDB has funneled $293m to Egyptian banks, mainly to finance SMEs, with future funding tied to performance evaluations.

Looking ahead, AfDB is prepared to back Egypt’s green hydrogen ambitions as part of its broader energy transition and regional hub strategy.

Regional Development Vision

Under its 2022–2026 Country Strategy Paper, AfDB prioritizes enhancing Egypt’s competitiveness through private sector-led growth and job creation, especially for youth.

Beyond Egypt, the Bank is a cornerstone of the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA), a joint initiative with the African Union Commission and NEPAD. AfDB is engaged in 56 PIDA projects spanning transport, energy, water, and ICT.

As part of its 2024–2033 Ten-Year Strategy, AfDB aims to accelerate infrastructure connectivity, eliminate trade barriers, harmonize regulations, and bolster the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).

Mon, Feb 24, 2025 Atoms for Appalachia: The role of nuclear energy in economic development Report By Lauren Hughes Advanced nuclear technologies can drive economic security and energy security within Appalachian states.","On Friday, US President Donald Trump signed four executive orders related to the rapid deployment of next-generation nuclear technologies in the United States. Overall, the orders represent a policy outlook on nuclear energy that has remained relatively consistent for nearly a decade. However, there are a few key breaks from precedent, especially in that the orders encourage commercial nuclear fuel recycling and decrease the independence of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

New reactors and national security

“Deploying Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security” is the most comprehensive of the four. It aims to speed the deployment of advanced reactors at Department of Defense facilities, in order to provide power for military installations and for operational energy. The executive order notes that the regulatory pathway will be through the United States Army and ambitiously calls for one reactor to be operational at a “domestic military base or installation no later than September 30, 2028.” It also calls for the deployment of advanced reactors at Department of Energy facilities, and it directs the US secretary of energy to designate artificial intelligence (AI) data centers that “are located at or operated in coordination with Department of Energy facilities . . . as critical defense facilities, where appropriate.”

In a departure from what has been the US government’s de facto stance toward commercial nuclear fuel recycling in the United States (assuming that it refers to commercial reactors), this order calls for the US secretary of energy to “identify all useful uranium and plutonium material within the Department of Energy’s inventories that may be recycled or processed into nuclear fuel for reactors in the United States.” There are currently no domestic commercial fuel recycling facilities in the United States, and the partnership outlined in this order between the Department of Energy and industry will likely be a boon to US reactor companies looking to use recycled fuel, especially as competitor countries stand up their own recycling capabilities. The order then goes on to direct the Department of Energy to provide high assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) for commercial reactors that are authorized to deploy at the department’s sites. This will add to the demand signal for HALEU fuel and strengthen the domestic nuclear fuel supply chain.

Importantly, the order excludes the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy from the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for construction of advanced reactors on some federal sites. It also notes that there may be additional categories that will be excluded from adhering to NEPA. The Department of the Interior already has a number of categorical exclusions for NEPA (for example, for geothermal exploration) but does not yet have any listed for nuclear reactors. The rest of this order touches on interagency coordination, civil nuclear exports, and employee clearances.

Changes to the NRC

At first glance, the next executive order, “Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,” appears more measured than news reports had predicted over the past few weeks. It mentions a reduction in force for the commission, but it notes that “certain functions may increase in size consistent with the policies in this order, including those devoted to new reactor licensing.” At the same time, the order directs the NRC to finalize a revision of its regulations and guidance documents, and this revision must be concluded within eighteen months. It also directs an eighteen-month deadline for final decisions on construction and operation applications for any type of nuclear reactor. It is difficult to see how an understaffed agency will be able to complete more work in less time.

Although the new executive order does not explicitly mention White House oversight of the NRC, it does note the involvement of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and especially the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in reorganizing the NRC. These measures, combined with the February 18 executive order “Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies”—which already decreased the independence of the NRC—could likely reduce the NRC’s workforce and lessen its standing among global nuclear regulatory authorities. This could happen even as the White House directs it to hasten its regulatory processes to expedite the licensing and deployment of next-generation nuclear technologies.

The question of new testing

A third order, “Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy,” directs the national laboratory system to reform its process for ensuring that reactor developers are able to test their reactors quickly and effectively. However, the document does not explicitly direct the national laboratory system to construct new test reactor facilities. The first Trump administration signed into law the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Capabilities Act in 2017, which addressed the need for a fast-neutron test reactor and resulted in the start of the Versatile Test Reactor (VTR) project at Idaho National Laboratory.* But Congress later defunded this project. Although the new order does not explicitly call for the construction of a new testing facility, its direction to increase capacity for testing new reactors may lead Congress to look again at the VTR project.

The broader nuclear base

Finally, “Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base” addresses well-trodden issues, such as workforce development and the restarting, completion, uprating, or construction of nuclear power plants. It also calls for a new report to address the fuel cycle, especially regarding high-level waste management, fuel recycling (including commercial recycling), isotopes, and enrichment and conversion. This new report would follow the Nuclear Fuel Working Group’s 2020 report “Strategy to Restore American Nuclear Energy Leadership,” which focused on the front-end of the fuel cycle as well as civil nuclear exports. The order also notes that the US secretary of energy shall update the department’s “excess uranium management policy to align with the policy objectives of this order and the Nuclear Fuel Security Act” of 2023, which was signed into law by US President Joe Biden.

Based on these new executive orders and earlier announcements, the second Trump administration’s policies toward nuclear energy seem largely aligned with the policies of the Biden administration and the first Trump administration. The major shift that is reflected in this set of executive orders is the desire to conduct a reduction in force across government agencies and to weaken the independence of regulatory authorities, including the NRC. In the new orders, the Trump administration has articulated ambitious goals for rapid deployment of next-generation nuclear technologies; however, reducing personnel and funding for the NRC and the Department of Energy, along with weakening the NRC’s independence and global credibility, will make it challenging to realize the full potential of the US nuclear energy industry.

August 2023: Evading tariffs US Department of Commerce investigation concludes that Chinese solar manufacturers are circumventing solar tariffs by shipping their products through South-east Asia.","– On a humid day in February, a small group of workers huddled in front of a large solar panel factory in Thailand’s biggest manufacturing hub in the eastern coastal province of Chonburi, home to some of the world’s top solar panel producers.

The men and women, mostly in their 20s , were all hoping to land a job on a production line assembling solar cells into panels destined for export.

They knew they might not hold the job for very long after reading former employees’ complaints on social media about work being regularly cut when orders were low.

But the company promised fair pay and, needing work, they were willing to take the risk.

That risk is growing, with Thailand’s solar industry now caught in an escalating trade war between the US and China, with Thai solar workers paying the price.

Large Chinese companies dominate Thailand’s solar manufacturing industry, which produces solar cells and panels for export to the US market.

But as Washington erects trade barriers to protect its home-grown solar sector from a rising tide of cheap Chinese imports, Thailand’s industry is being squeezed.

Solar manufacturers that rely heavily on Chinese components in South-east Asia’s second-largest economy are now facing nearly 400 per cent tariffs on their products exported to the US.

Analysts say the tariffs threaten to hurt Thailand’s manufacturing sector and its workers, and could have a knock-on impact on solar roll-out in the country.

But the changing trade landscape also creates an opportunity for producers to find new markets, including by accelerating solar deployment and the energy transition across South-east Asia.

The heat of the solar trade war

For more than a decade, the US has waged a tariff war on growing imports of cheap Chinese solar panels, which it says harm its domestic industry.

China’s mass production of solar cells and modules has enabled the expansion of clean energy globally.

The cost of solar panels has declined by 90 per cent in the past decade. But China’s subsidised and cut-price solar production has also led to accusations of unfair trade practices.

In response, Chinese manufacturers have relocated their final production stages to neighbouring Asian countries, in an attempt to avoid the US import tax, turning South-east Asia into a major solar panel assembly hub and export base.

As Chinese exports of solar components to Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and Cambodia boomed, so did US imports of South-east Asian solar panels.

By 2023, 80 per cent of US solar module imports came from those four countries. Nearly a third of that came from Thailand alone.

But, in recent months, several Chinese manufacturers with factories in South-east Asia have suspended some of their operations in the region, after the US announced a string of anti-dumping duties on solar imports from the four countries in a bid to close the loophole.

Thousands working in Thailand’s solar factories – most of whom had left the agricultural north of the country to seek better-paying employment in an industry which promised decent jobs – were put on leave or suddenly dismissed.

Climate Home News analysed local media reports and social media posts relating to worker dismissals at three leading solar manufacturers with factories in the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), the country’s largest manufacturing zone: Chinese companies Trina Solar – one of the world’s largest solar photovoltaic manufacturing companies – and Runergy, and Canadian Solar, which has long conducted most of its manufacturing operations in China.

Climate Home found that close to 8,000 full-time staff and subcontracted workers were either temporarily or permanently dismissed in 2024 after a two-year US tariff waiver on solar products from South-east Asia expired.

An industry losing its grip on its biggest export market

In April, US trade officials unveiled hefty tariffs of at least 375 per cent on imports of solar cells from Thailand.

The US International Trade Commission, a bipartisan government agency, is due to make a final decision about the tariffs in June.

In private, analysts say they are likely to be approved.

The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (Ieefa), a US-based think-tank, recently found that any price increases beyond 250 per cent would make most South-east Asian imports “untenable”.

“Any company in any country where the combined tariffs are greater than 250 per cent will likely see their orders decline or get cancelled,” Mr Grant Hauber, strategic energy finance adviser for Asia at Ieefa, told Climate Home News.

In 2024, US officials investigated a complaint from American manufacturers that companies with factories in South-east Asia were dumping subsidised and unfairly cheap products on the US market.

Their tariff deliberations over the past year have rocked Thailand’s solar industry.

“There has been a broad suspension of operations among Chinese companies in South-east Asia, including Thailand, with many closures likely to be permanent,” said Mr Zhu Linxiao, a research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.

“The region risks losing a significant share of its solar manufacturing capacity due to the loss of access to the US market.”

Agreeing, BloombergNEF’s Thailand energy transition analyst Forbes Chanthorn said: “Thailand’s solar manufacturing industry faces some serious challenges. It is losing its grip on some of its biggest export markets without any short-term alternatives in sight.”

And the situation could go from bad to worse as US President Donald Trump threatens an additional 37 per cent import tariff on all goods from Thailand – one of the highest rates in Washington’s planned universal tariff onslaught, now paused until June. If applied, this would push the tariffs on Thailand’s solar cells up to 426 per cent.

In an interview, Ms Charuwan Phipatana-Phuttapanta, a solar expert at Thailand’s Energy Ministry, acknowledged that the tariffs will impact employment in the country’s solar industry.

Workers fall victim to tariffs

Spanning three provinces on Thailand’s eastern coast, the EEC is key to the government’s plan to transform the area into an economic powerhouse.

Enticed by generous tax breaks and cheap labour, international companies have flocked here to manufacture everything from air-conditioners to batteries for electric vehicles and solar panels for the regional and global markets.

Several leading Chinese solar manufacturing companies set up shop in the EEC nearly a decade ago. Soon, Thailand’s solar exports to the US soared.

But, in June 2024, a two-year US tariff waiver on solar products from South-east Asia – introduced by then President Joe Biden to boost solar deployment in the country – came to an end.

Companies in the region importing silicon wafers from China to make solar cells for export to the US became subject to tariffs.

In the days that followed, several manufacturers slowed down or suspended operations, letting go of staff to adjust to the new tax regime, Rayong Labour Protection and Welfare office director Amnuay Ngamnet , the Labour Ministry’s local representative, told Climate Home.

Videos posted on TikTok in recent weeks show deserted carparks and unusually quiet grounds around some solar factories.

“No matter how good you are, if life stumbles, you cannot succeed. Goodbye,” one solar worker posted on the social media platform with a photo of a dismissal letter.

Amnat, whose name has been changed to avoid jeopardising his job prospects, was among thousands affected.

Like many others, the 39-year-old left his home town in the agricultural north-eastern region in 2022 to find a better-paying job at a solar plant in the EEC.

“It seemed like a promising industry. I hoped to spend years there,” he told Climate Hom e . “But it didn’t turn out that way.”

Amnat worked as a subcontractor at a few Chinese solar factories, eventually landing a staff position at Runergy, which manufactures solar cells and modules.

He worked six days a week and earned approximately 25,000 baht (S$980) a month, way above the average income for unskilled workers.

But, in October 2024, he was dismissed along with “almost all of the employees” at the factory, according to local media reports.

Amnat told Climate Home the retrenchment affected nearly 3,000 workers.

Runergy did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

That same month, Runergy opened its first module manufacturing plant in the US to keep supplying the American market – one of a number of solar companies hoping to benefit from tax credits under the US’ Inflation Reduction Act.

As a permanent employee, Amnat was compensated with 75 per cent of his monthly wage, a lifeline during the three months it took him to find another job. But others were not so lucky.

Thousands of workers hired as subcontractors and benefiting from fewer rights were left without work or pay overnight as companies suspended some of their operations.

At risk of labour rights violations

“After leaving the solar company, my girlfriend was left unemployed for two months. It was difficult for us,” a TikTok user, who had complained about the dismissals on social media, told Climate Home.

The subcontracting company employing her made her sign a dismissal letter absolving it of paying the compensation she was entitled to, he explained.

Mr Bunyuen Sukmai, a local labour lawyer and rights activist, told Climate Home “most workers are not aware that the practice violates their rights”, despite being routinely deployed.

In the workers’ housing estate in Chonburi province, a few kilometres outside the industrial zone, the offices of subcontracting companies are flanked by hair salons and restaurants. A steady stream of job seekers fill in application forms and scan QR codes to follow job announcements on social media.

“Subcontractors are usually the first to be affected by industry changes. They usually receive lower benefits and are most at risk of having their rights violated,” said Mr Bunyuen.

But legal cases over unfair dismissal are rare, as few workers have the resources to go down the judicial route, he added.

A representative of Trina Solar in Thailand declined to respond to questions. Canadian Solar did not respond to Climate Home’s repeated requests for comment.

However, in a letter dated June 2024 and shared on social media, Canadian Solar said it had paused operations at one of its factories to make changes to its production line and improve machinery.

“Due to the current economic conditions and trade competition, the company needs to adjust to the market situation and the direction of the domestic and international economy,” it said.

It added that it had “great confidence in the potential and economic conditions of Thailand”, where it intended to continue operating.

In search of new markets

Some large Chinese panel-makers have already started setting up production lines in Indonesia and Laos, which are not currently affected by the US solar import duties.

The Middle East has also emerged as a growing destination for Chinese solar investments, including for the production of key solar components such as polysilicon ingots and wafers.

“These efforts are designed to forge a supply chain completely outside of China, serving the Middle East, the US and other markets that may be subject to tariff risks,” Mr Zhu wrote in a recent report for the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.

To continue operating in Thailand, analysts say large solar manufacturers will need to seek new export markets outside of the US.

In the short term, exports could be redirected to the European Union and India. The Thai government is racing to finalise a free trade deal with the EU, where demand growth for solar equipment may be stronger than in the US, said Ms Laura Schwartz, a senior Asia analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft.

“However, over half of China’s solar cell and module exports already go to Europe, so Thai exports would face stiff competition,” Ms Schwartz told Climate Home. And Indian solar developers will have to use locally made solar cells in government projects from June 2026.

However, Ms Christina Ng, director of the Energy Shift Institute, a think-tank focused on Asia’s energy transition, said that the tariffs could also mark “a turning point” for South-east Asia’s solar industry, which could focus on supplying emerging markets in Africa and South America, and urgently accelerate the region’s own solar deployment.

Thailand is dependent on natural gas for electricity generation, but the government has set out plans for 51 per cent of its electricity to come from renewables by 2037, with most of the additional renewable power expected from solar.

Only around 3 per cent of Thailand’s electricity currently comes from solar.

Thai companies assembling solar modules in the country are already calling for more incentives to expand a home-grown supply chain.

Mr Krit Pornpilailuck, chief executive of Solar PPM, fears Chinese solar manufacturers that cannot export their goods to the US “will flood the South-east Asian market and plunge the price” of modules.

To protect the industry, Mr Krit wants to see more support for Thai manufacturers to produce solar cells and other upstream components domestically.

Ms Charuwan, the government’s solar expert, said: “Thailand has more than six million tonnes of solar-grade quartz reserves that could be used to produce polysilicon – the key ingredient to produce solar wafers.”

But developing the resources would require “technical expertise and high investment”, she added.

The Energy Shift Institute’s Ms Ng said: “This is a chance for (manufacturers) to move up the value chain – from being seen as mainly low-cost assemblers to becoming leaders in more advanced clean energy technologies.

“If the region takes this moment seriously and diversifies, it won’t just weather the disruption; it will emerge more resilient and competitive.”

Residential energy workforce gap analysis

The Clean Energy Transition Institute (CETI) in partnership with Kinetic West, BW Research Partnership, and Uncommon Bridges conducted a residential energy workforce gap analysis for the Washington State Department of Commerce (Commerce). The report includes a landscape analysis of the current residential energy efficiency workforce with a focus on six priority occupations: electricians, insulation workers, plumbers, construction and building inspectors (including energy auditors), carpenters, and HVAC/refrigeration mechanics and installers. Additionally, the report included an outcomes analysis for historically underrepresented populations in this workforce, workforce development engagement strategies and recommendations for Commerce to prepare the workforce to make residential building improvements to meet the state’s emissions goals.

Commerce awards 38 Clean Energy Community grants

The Washington State Department of Commerce has awarded $36 million in Clean Energy Community grants to 38 organizations across the state. Recipients included local governments, tribal communities, educational institutions, nonprofits, and more. These organizations will use grant funds to implement projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support the implementation of clean energy technologies. From Yakima Neighborhood Health Services’ project installing solar power and battery storage for a permanent supportive housing project serving homeless families and young adults with disabilities to the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community’s project installing a solar array and battery backup for an IT/Medical Building, we are excited to see the impact that these clean energy projects will have on Washington’s communities.

A ride in a robotaxi—just you and a machine at the wheel. Tempting? Terrifying? I haven’t taken one yet, so I can easily picture myself nodding serenely on the outside, while my inner backseat driver screams in silence at every unexpected turn.

Recommended Videos

If you’re also hesitant about the new technology, you’re not alone: According to an MIT/JD Power survey, 83% want more safety data before taking the plunge, and 86% want the ability to take over the steering wheel—just in case tech takes a wrong turn.

It didn’t help that the year kicked off with the story of a tech entrepreneur almost missing his plane in Phoenix, Arizona after his robotaxi experienced a glitch and looped 8 times around a parking lot.

That being said, overall consumer confidence in the technology has steadily increased over the past few years, coinciding with rising numbers of safety studies. And, of course, U.S.-market leaders, such as Alphabet’s Waymo, Amazon’s Zoox, and soon Tesla’s robotaxis, are increasingly deploying automated-driven wheels on city streets.

Waymo

Just this past week, Waymo received approval to further expand its operations around the San Francisco Peninsula, including San Jose. With a fleet of over 1,500 vehicles already operating in California, Arizona, Texas and Florida, the company is the undisputed robotaxi leader in the U.S., delivering over 250,000 rides per week.

Before you start your first ride inside one of Waymo’s Jaguar I-Pace EVs, you’ll receive a walkthrough of the vehicle and app, including how to start the ride, lock/unlock doors, and contact support—building comfort from the start.

Once seated inside, you’ll find a screen in front of you displaying a live map and the vehicle’s exact location. This real-time information helps you understand what the car is doing and where it’s going. Studies show these “situational awareness displays” can ease anxiety and reduce feelings of powerlessness—just like the in-flight maps on airplanes. If your backseat driver tendencies are still kicking in, audio and visual cues let riders know what the car is about to, such as ‘slowing for a pedestrian’ or ‘waiting to make a left turn’, to reinforce trust in the vehicle’s decision-making.

For Waymo, as with most other manufacturers of robotaxis, ensuring safety starts with using expensive navigational technology: Waymo’s vehicles rely on pre-mapped roads, sensors, cameras, radar, and lidar (a laser-light radar). This largely explains why Waymo was able to receive an early nod from safety regulators and take the lead in the U.S. market.

Tesla

Tesla, which is set to launch its own robotaxis in Austin, Texas in June, has taken a different, less expensive, approach: Its self-driving technology relies on multiple onboard cameras to feed AI machine-learning models which, in turn, help the car make decisions. That technology has so far remained under much tighter scrutiny from regulators.

At this stage of the game, automakers continue to test different blends of navigational tech, and eventually, the results will have to speak for themselves. But it’s interesting to note that just one month before the launch of its own robotaxis, Tesla’s head of Autopilot and AI Software, Ashok Elluswamy, made a stunning admission: “Technically, Waymo is already performing,” Elluswamy said during an interview with an Indian podcaster. “We are lagging by maybe a couple of years.”

Zoox

Zoox, Amazon’s self-driving unit, has also been making headlines this past week, announcing it will soon begin testing self-driving cars in Atlanta. The fleet will consist of retrofitted SUVs with human safety operators, marking the company’s seventh testing location.

Stepping into a Zoox, maybe the first thing you’d notice is the absence of a steering wheel and then, the seating arrangement: Four individual seats arranged in a symmetrical, face-to-face configuration—two seats on each side—without a traditional front or back.

According to the company, this setup fosters a lounge-like atmosphere, encouraging conversation among passengers and eliminating the hierarchy often associated with front and back seats in conventional vehicles. Each seat offers equal space, comfort, and access to features, ensuring no passenger is prioritized over another. In your personal seat, you’ll find amenities such as cupholders, wireless charging pads and touchscreens that allow you to control music, climate settings, and lighting.

Personally, I’d say the absence of a steering wheel and the chance to chat face to face in a lounge-like environment should help me forget about my backseat driver tendencies.

Lithium-ion batteries contain a wealth of valuable materials that really should be recycled, because it’d be a shame to discard the lithium, manganese, cobalt, nickel or even something as basic as copper.","Lithium-ion battery manufacturing is dominated by one country: China. According to a report from analytics firm Rho Motion, in 2023, the large Asian nation accounted for more than 80 percent of global production capacity. Last year, the two largest companies building these energy-storage systems were CATL and BYD, two Chinese concerns, followed by LG Energy Solution. Combined, these three companies accounted for more than 60 percent of the total market. But what about battery recycling, is the story any different?

This Should Be No Surprise

In short, no, it’s not, because China also dominates in this area as well, which makes sense. Lithium-ion battery manufacturing and recycling go hand in hand. Kind of a chicken-and-egg situation, you can’t really recycle batteries at scale if there’s not a sizable supply of second-hand batteries to recycle.

According to a post from Rho Motion, it’s estimated that in 2025 China will “account for 78 percent of battery pre-treatment capacity and 89 percent of black mass refining capacity,” some 3.6 million metric tons of the former and 2.5 million of the latter. Visualizing this in the form of a chart makes it much easier to see just how dominant China is projected to be in the battery-recycling field.

More Electric Vehicles = More Batteries To Recycle

Providing a robust pipeline of batteries to recycle, the country is expected to dominate in battery manufacturing. Rho Motion estimates China will account for around 85 percent of global battery manufacturing in 2025, roughly a 5 percent increase compared to 2023.

Lithium-ion batteries contain a wealth of valuable materials that really should be recycled, because it’d be a shame to discard the lithium, manganese, cobalt, nickel or even something as basic as copper. Before these substances can be reclaimed, used batteries must first be mechanically broken down, shredded into a material called black mass.

After that initial stage, the black mass is refined to create pre-cathode active material (pCAM), or further treated to produce cathode active material (CAM) that can be used in new lithium-ion batteries. This is how recycling companies can close the loop, reclaim the valuable materials found in batteries, so they don’t go to waste.

They’ll be the ones with the right industrial strategy that invests in people, places smart bets, and aligns policy incentives with long-term intent.","Governments around the world are scrambling to adopt the right industrial strategy to stay competitive in the global race for the jobs of tomorrow.

In the United States, the Trump administration’s tariff strategy is primarily aimed at bringing manufacturing back to the country. In Australia, the newly re-elected Albanese Labor government is placing a AUD $ 20 billion+ bet on green manufacturing to reindustrialize the nation. Meanwhile, in the UK, the Starmer government has launched a 10-year AI Opportunities Action Plan, focused on scaling compute infrastructure and making Britain a global hub for AI-driven jobs.

With the World Economic Forum forecasting that nearly as many jobs will disappear as will be created in the coming decade, the stakes could not be higher. In a world shaped by technological disruption, geopolitical realignment, and climate volatility, no single lever is enough.

What matters is the alignment of skills, sector focus, and smart incentives, which ought to be the building blocks of any serious strategy for job creation and industrial renewal.

These are the three questions every government must answer to compete for the next wave of jobs.

1. Education Is the Foundation of Industrial Strategy—Do You Have It Right?

This question comes first for a reason. No matter which industries a country prioritizes—or how much capital it attracts—none of it sticks without the right talent.

Education systems are the foundation that determines whether a country can attract, retain, and grow the industries of tomorrow.

Ireland’s rise from a struggling, high-emigration economy in the 1980s to a high-income innovation hub is one of the most striking industrial policy success stories of the modern era.

While often credited to low corporate tax rates, what also kept companies like Apple, Google, and Pfizer there and growing was talent. Firms like Intel, Meta, and Alphabet have consistently cited Ireland’s skilled workforce as a key reason for their success.

By contrast, one of the most high-profile failures of the past decade—the $10 billion Foxconn deal in Wisconsin—collapsed in part because the local workforce reportedly lacked the specialized skills needed to support advanced manufacturing.

There are many ways to upskill a population, both in the short and long term. In markets with clear potential, the private sector is already stepping in. In South Africa, Microsoft and Google have launched large-scale training programs in AI and digital skills, viewing widespread youth unemployment as an opportunity to build a future-ready workforce.

Such initiatives are tailored to meet real and immediate job demand. As Evan Jones, CEO of Collective X, puts it: “We’re not just skilling for the sake of it—we’re skilling for absorption.”

Collective X is a public-private partnership tackling South Africa’s digital skills gap at scale. It manages a R500 million ($28 million) outcomes-based fund that only pays training providers when learners are placed in real jobs. To date, over 500 organizations have signed on.

But while short-term technical bootcamps may fill immediate gaps, they’re no substitute for long-term talent strategy. That starts with reforming higher education.

According to the World Economic Forum’s 2025 Future of Jobs Report, the fastest-growing roles—from AI engineers to renewable energy technicians—require not only technical skills but also adaptive capabilities such as analytical thinking, creativity, and complex problem-solving. These are precisely what traditional lecture-based university models struggle to deliver on a large scale.

To stay competitive, universities must evolve from passive knowledge providers and rethink not only what students learn, but also how they learn.

One promising approach is peer-to-peer learning, a student-driven, project-based approach that fosters collaboration, initiative, and effective communication. Paired with co-designed curricula and digital platforms, it helps bridge the gap between academic theory and real-world readiness.

Countries that embed these models into their higher education systems have a better chance of attracting investment and retaining talent at home.

2. What Industry Anchors Your Industrial Strategy—And What Are the Trade-Offs?

Some countries, such as the U.S., can afford to bet on multiple high-growth sectors. However, even the U.S. faces trade-offs, including talent, infrastructure, and political bandwidth. No country can do everything well.

In a world of limited resources and global competition, focus matters. That means setting priorities, making trade-offs, and resisting the urge to chase everything because trying to do it all often means doing none of it well.

India’s Special Economic Zones (SEZs) offer a cautionary tale. Meant to boost exports across dozens of sectors, many fell short of their targets. A World Bank report blamed “policy fragmentation, lack of sector focus, and poor coordination.” Some zones became real estate plays; a few built lasting industrial strength.

By contrast, one often-overlooked sector with real potential is the creative economy. When Bill Gates recently named the three job categories most resilient to AI—pharma, energy, and coders—music, film, and live events didn’t make the cut.

Yet countries like Nigeria and Kenya are leaning into the creative economy as potential job creators. Nigerian artists now top global charts, Nollywood is among the world’s largest film industries, and Kenyan animators and storytellers are gaining traction across the continent.

A range of ancillary industries and services will be needed to support this momentum. UNCTAD estimates that Africa’s creative economy could generate up to 20 million jobs by 2030, particularly for young people and women. One example: Move Afrika, a touring platform backed by Global Citizen, created over 1,000 jobs during its stop in Kigali and increased local sourcing from 75% to 90% in just 18 months (Disclaimer: I work for Global Citizen).

However, transforming the creative economy into a genuine engine of job creation will require a proper policy framework—modern copyright laws, fair digital revenue-sharing, and robust intellectual property protections. This is especially urgent as broad exemptions to copyright are being proposed in several jurisdictions, threatening the ability of artists and creators to earn a living, and, by extension, generate jobs.

This is precisely why the Music and Entertainment Development Initiative (MEDI) was launched: to provide governments with the data needed to justify innovative policy frameworks and unlock the full economic potential of their creative economies. MEDI is mapping music ecosystems across 22 African countries and will provide targeted policy recommendations to support growth, from intellectual property (IP) reform to infrastructure and investment.

Not every country needs to chase AI labs or hyperscale data centers. The point isn’t to mimic Silicon Valley. Instead, the countries that win and retain jobs won’t be the ones that try to do everything—they’ll be the ones that do something well.

3. What Policy Incentives Will Drive Your Industrial Strategy Forward?

Even with the right sectors and skills in place, nothing moves without investment.

That’s where smart incentives come in. Today’s investors are seeking predictable, de-risked environments in a world that is increasingly messy and ever-changing. That means:

Stable procurement pipelines. India’s solar auction system is a standout example of a bright and stable policy. Launched in 2010 under the National Solar Mission, it invited developers to bid competitively for utility-scale projects backed by 25-year power purchase agreements. As a result, costs dropped, investor confidence surged, and solar jobs nearly tripled. According to IRENA, the sector grew from just over 110,000 jobs in 2010 to more than 318,000 by 2023, spanning manufacturing, installation, and maintenance.

Targeted subsidies and industrial strategy incentives. In Collie, Western Australia, the state government took a proactive approach to transitioning from coal to clean energy and green manufacturing. A flagship project is the Collie Green Steel Mill—a $400 million facility that will produce low-carbon rebar using renewable-powered electric arc furnaces. It’s expected to create 500 construction jobs and 200 long-term roles.

To support the project, the government committed:

AUD 2.7 million for feasibility and approvals via its Industry Attraction Fund

AUD 134 million through the Collie Industrial Transition Fund for infrastructure and site development

Long-term industrial strategy policy certainty and investor confidence. Even the best incentives fall flat if investors don’t believe they’ll last. As strategist and investor Taufiq Rahim explores in his new book, Trump 2.5, today’s industrial strategies—particularly in the U.S.—are increasingly shaped by short-term political cycles and populist pressures. Investors—and foreign governments eyeing an opening—need to pay close attention to where policy continuity might hold, where it might fracture, and what that means for capital flows.

As a case in point, just a few years ago, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act was poised to help catalyze a boom in clean energy investment, with 142,000 renewable energy jobs added in 2023 alone. But that momentum now risks being reversed following the House’s passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

One climate tech founder recently warned that his entire business—built around a $85-per-ton carbon capture credit—could be “vaporized overnight” if the credit disappears or is diluted, as now seems increasingly possible.

As a counterpoint, after years of stagnation, nuclear energy appeared to be making a comeback in the U.S., driven by rising demand, concerns over grid reliability, bipartisan support, and net-zero goals. But with the passage of the House version of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” prospects have once again become mixed.

That’s a challenge—because, like all major energy infrastructure, nuclear projects require coordinated, credible policy that investors can count on for years. The timelines are long, the risks are high, and without lasting policy commitment, capital stays on the sidelines.

As nuclear-focused investor Arthur Hyde put it to me recently: “All energy infrastructure is long-lived. Timelines are a red herring. The real question is who offers credible, coordinated policy over time.”

Ultimately, the countries that win the new industrial era won’t be the ones with the loudest rhetoric. They’ll be the ones with the right industrial strategy that invests in people, places smart bets, and aligns policy incentives with long-term intent. The industrial strategy playbook is there. To those with the discipline to follow it, will go the spoils.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68332004d5cfd55d8b2acea7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-05-25 11:05:06.871093

The first intention of the U.S. to expand nuclear power generation is to revive the nuclear power industry and create quality jobs.
This month, the Belgian and Swedish parliaments passed a bill to abolish the nuclear power plant bill and fund the construction of new nuclear power plants.
Candidate Kim said in his pledge that he would increase the proportion of nuclear power generation to 60% (35% of large nuclear power plants and 25% SMR) by smoothly pushing for six large nuclear power plants under construction or planned.","After European countries such as Italy, Denmark, Belgium, and Sweden scrapped their nuclear power plant policies one after another, the United States also started building 10 more large nuclear power plants. Stable power supply is essential for high-tech industries such as artificial intelligence (AI) data centers and semiconductors because nuclear power plants are the best alternative for now.

U.S. President Donald Trump signed four executive orders on the 23rd (local time), including the revitalization of the nuclear industry's foundation to foster nuclear technology. The executive order instructed the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to prioritize the construction of 10 new large nuclear reactors that are in design completion by 2030. It also includes ways to support nuclear energy, such as restarting closed nuclear power plants, increasing power production at current nuclear power plants, completing suspended reactor construction, building new advanced reactors, and preparing improvement measures related to the nuclear fuel supply chain.

""It's the nuclear age,"" Trump said. ""We're signing a huge executive order today. This will make the United States 'real power' again.""

The executive order also includes reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to meet the actual needs of the industry, aiming to quadruple nuclear power generation capacity over the next 25 years. This includes a decision to permit a new nuclear power plant within 18 months, the Associated Press reported, citing a government official. ""The move will put back more than 50 years of excessive regulatory clock on the nuclear industry,"" said Interior Minister Doug Burgum, an ""energy tsar.""

President Trump also signed an executive order easing restrictions related to testing three new experimental reactors, with the goal of operating them in July next year.

The first intention of the U.S. to expand nuclear power generation is to revive the nuclear power industry and create quality jobs. Westinghouse, a Pennsylvania-based U.S.-based nuclear power plant company, reportedly had more than 50,000 employees during its heyday in the 1970s and 1980s, but now has fewer than 10,000 employees.

The second is to respond to the power demand of AI data centers. According to the PWC, power usage in data centers around the world is expected to more than double in a short period of time from 460 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2022 to 1050 TWh in 2026. Stable power supply is essential enough to require one nuclear power plant to operate one semiconductor plant.

Prior to the United States, European countries are also scrapping their nuclear power plant policies one after another. The Italian government, the world's first de-nuclear power plant country, approved a bill to reintroduce nuclear power plants to parliament at the end of February. This month, the Belgian and Swedish parliaments passed a bill to abolish the nuclear power plant bill and fund the construction of new nuclear power plants.

In Taiwan, where the proportion of the semiconductor industry such as TSMC is high in Asia, a bill to increase the life of nuclear power plants from 40 years to 60 years passed the legislative court on the 13th.

However, even though Korea says it will support the AI and semiconductor industries, it has been idling away as politicians have made nuclear power plants a political issue.

Lee Jae-myung, presidential candidate of the Democratic Party of Korea, said in a TV debate on the 23rd, ""Nuclear power plants are cheap right now, but if you convert waste disposal costs or risks into costs, they may be extremely expensive energy."" At the same time, he emphasized the expansion of new and renewable energy such as solar and wind power.

On the other hand, Kim Moon-soo, candidate for People's Power, said in a discussion, ""The heat wave requires a lot of electricity for the use of air conditioners and the AI industry, and preparing a lot of cheap, stable and clean nuclear power is the core of the national energy strategy. We will also do renewable energy such as tidal power and wind power with nuclear power at the center."" Candidate Kim said in his pledge that he would increase the proportion of nuclear power generation to 60% (35% of large nuclear power plants and 25% SMR) by smoothly pushing for six large nuclear power plants under construction or planned.

Experts say that the U.S. and South Korea should strengthen cooperation in nuclear power plants to enter the global nuclear power market as a ""KOR-US.""",https://wimg.mk.co.kr/news/cms/202505/25/news-g.v1.20250525.09e8ad0c152243a9ba83caa28da293f0_P2.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 12:09:59.157387

“In a few moments, you’ll become graduates of the most elite and storied military academy in human history,” Mr. Trump said.
But in the U.S., power plants were responsible for about 25 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in 2022.
They emitted about 1.5 billion metric tons of emissions in 2023, which is more than the total greenhouse gas emissions produced by most countries.
“If they’re successful with regard to power plants, they’re pretty much going to be successful with everything else,” he said.","Wearing his red “Make America Great Again” hat, Mr. Trump leaned into his aggressive agenda to purge diversity, equity and inclusion programs from the government, military and virtually every facet of American life, in making his pitch that the nation was worth fighting for again.

He took credit for building the military “better than ever before,” saying it had bolstered its recruitment numbers, morale and commitment to protecting America first. He drew applause from guests at times, such as when he discussed the issue of transgender athletes playing in female sports and hiring on merit over diversity.

At the outset of his second term, he issued a spate of executive orders targeting programs and policies that aimed to help address systemic racism, which he deemed divisive and unpatriotic.

He claimed that his predecessors had “subjected the armed forces to all manner of social projects and political causes, while leaving our borders undefended and depleting our arsenals to fight other countries’ wars.”

“All of that’s ended. It’s ended strongly,” he said. “They’re not even allowed to think about it anymore.”

Mr. Trump’s crusade against diversity has been particularly pronounced in the military, where there has been an aggressive erasure of the valor of Black people, women and other groups, down to eliminating and obscuring content honoring those buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

Mr. Trump has also sought to overhaul the military by making its ranks less diverse. He removed a Black four-star general as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and dismissed high-ranking women. He also banned transgender people from serving in the military.

His defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News host who served in the Army National Guard, has been among the most aggressive champions of Mr. Trump’s campaign. At his first staff meeting, he proclaimed: “I think the single dumbest phrase in military history is ‘our diversity is our strength.’”

Academics at West Point, a historically apolitical military academy that is run by the Department of Defense, was recently caught in the crossfire of Mr. Trump’s culture war.

To comply with Mr. Trump’s and Mr. Hegseth’s orders, the institution targeted books about race and gender for removal, disbanded a dozen affinity groups, scrubbed curriculums and dropped classes. Faculty members have publicly criticized what they see as a dangerous infringement on the school’s academic freedom, and one even quit.

In his commencement address, Mr. Trump did not address the turmoil on campus directly, but boasted about how he had “liberated our troops from divisive and demeaning political trainings.” He also trumpeted how, in his administration, appointments and promotions are not based on politics or identity.

“We’re a merit-based country again,” he said.

Mr. Trump’s remarks drew a stark contrast with the speech he gave when he spoke on the campus during his first term, as the country was in the midst of a reckoning over its racist history following the killing of George Floyd, a Black man whom the world watched cry for his mother as he lay dying under a white police officer’s knee.

In that 2020 speech, Mr. Trump urged West Point’s graduating class to “never forget” the legacy of soldiers before them, including those who had fought a bloody war to “extinguish the evil of slavery.”

“What has historically made America unique is the durability of its institutions against the passions and prejudices of the moment,” Mr. Trump said then. “When times are turbulent, when the road is rough, what matters most is that which is permanent, timeless, enduring and eternal.”

This year, Mr. Trump extolled the starkly different cultural reckoning he was leading.

“We’re getting rid of the distractions,” Mr. Trump said, “and we’re focusing our military on its core mission: crushing America’s adversaries, killing America’s enemies and defending our great American flag like it has never been defended before.”

“The job of the U.S. armed forces is not to host drag shows, to transform foreign cultures,” he continued, before seeming to misspeak by adding, “but to spread democracy to everybody around the world, at the point of a gun.”

Mr. Trump also rambled at times as he took shots at his opponents and told stories about his famous golf buddy Gary Player and how the real-estate developer William Levitt came to have a “trophy wife.”

He also spent considerable time praising the achievements of the graduates — he brought several of them onstage — and told them that they were graduating at a “defining moment” in the Army’s history, and were “respected more than any army anywhere in the world.”

Mr. Trump, who never served in the military and avoided the Vietnam War by citing bone spurs in his foot, touted projects that he hoped the new officers would be excited about, including new “brand-new, beautiful planes,” and the Golden Dome missile defense shield initiative that he unveiled earlier this week.

“In a few moments, you’ll become graduates of the most elite and storied military academy in human history,” Mr. Trump said. “And you will become officers in the greatest and most powerful army the world has ever known. And I know, because I rebuilt that army, and I rebuilt the military.”

But in the United States, the power sector was the second biggest source of greenhouse gases, behind transportation, according to the most recent data available on the E.P.A. website. And globally, power plants account for about 30 percent of the pollution that is driving climate change.

The E.P.A. sent the draft to the White House for review on May 2. It could undergo changes before it is formally released and the public is given the opportunity to offer comments, likely in June.

The proposed regulation is part of a broader attack by the Trump administration on the established science that greenhouse gases threaten human health and the environment. Scientists have overwhelmingly concluded that carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases from the burning of oil, gas and coal are dangerously heating the planet.

“Fossil fuel power plants are the single largest industrial source of climate destabilizing carbon dioxide in the United States, and emit pollution levels that exceed the vast majority of countries in the world,” said Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, an environmental group.

She called the proposed regulation “an abuse of the E.P.A.’s responsibility under the law” and added, “It flies in the face of common sense and puts millions of people in harms way to say the single largest industrial source of carbon dioxide in the United States is not significant.”

The draft reviewed by The New York Times said the agency “is proposing to repeal all greenhouse gas emissions standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants.” That would include Biden-era requirements that existing coal-fired units capture carbon pollution before it leaves the smokestack and store it, and that require some new gas plants use technologies that pollute less.

“We are seeking to ensure that the agency follows the rule of law while providing all Americans with access to reliable and affordable energy,” Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, said in a statement.

Mr. Zeldin’s spokeswoman, Molly Vaseliou, declined to offer more information about the plan other than to say “the proposal will be published once it has completed interagency review and been signed by the administrator.”

The Trump administration is methodically uprooting policies aimed at curbing climate change, and the E.P.A. is at the epicenter of that effort. In recent weeks, Mr. Zeldin has shuttered offices responsible for regulating climate and air pollution, and has launched the repeal of more than two dozen regulations and policies.

The agency is feeling pressure from the White House to finalize its deregulations by December, according to two people briefed on internal discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to describe them. That would be an extraordinarily fast pace. Rewriting regulations can typically take more than a year.

One target is a 2009 E.P.A. finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health. That determination underpins most federal climate regulations, and repealing it would erase the agency’s legal authority to regulate carbon pollution from power plants, vehicles, oil and gas infrastructure and other sources.

Mr. Zeldin said deregulation would drive “a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion.”

In proposing to lift regulations on power plants, the E.P.A. points to the fact that the U.S. share of global power sector emissions represented about 3 percent of worldwide greenhouse gases in 2022, down from 5.5 percent in 2005. So, it argued, even if American power plants erased all their greenhouse gases from the power sector, the risk to public health would not be “meaningfully” improved.

But in the U.S., power plants were responsible for about 25 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in 2022. They emitted about 1.5 billion metric tons of emissions in 2023, which is more than the total greenhouse gas emissions produced by most countries.

Just a year ago, when the Biden administration announced tough new limits on pollution from existing coal-fired power plants as well as some new gas-burning plants, the E.P.A. said the restrictions would mean that by 2035 the nation would annually avoid up to 1,200 premature deaths, 870 hospital visits, 1,900 cases of asthma, 48,000 school absences and 57,000 lost work days.

Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University, noted that solving climate change means undertaking a large number of seemingly small measures, like curbing emissions from automobiles, oil and gas wells, air travel, landfills, buildings and more.

“Just because there are multiple contributors to a problem doesn’t mean we should excuse all but the top one,” Dr. Oppenheimer said. “Just because a polluter’s emissions are decreasing doesn’t mean that they aren’t still far too high.”

Attorneys who represent utility companies said they agree that the sector is a small part of the global climate problem. “The argument is a solid argument,” said Jeffrey R. Holmstead, who served in the E.P.A. during both Bush administrations and now represents utility companies as a lawyer for the firm Bracewell.

But he wondered if it would hold up under a legal challenge. “I just don’t know if you’re contributing 3 percent of greenhouse gas emissions the court will say ‘that's not significant’ when there’s hardly anybody that contributes more than that.”

Only China releases more pollution from its power plants than the United States.

The E.P.A. plan is likely to face lawsuits once it is finalized. If it survives, it could block future administrations from regulating carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, eliminating a tool that Democratic administrations have relied on to tackle climate change. It also could make it easier to unravel other climate regulations, some experts said.

“If the administration is going to do this, it is the strategically smartest way,” said Jonathan Adler, a conservative law professor at Case Western University. “If they’re successful with regard to power plants, they’re pretty much going to be successful with everything else,” he said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/25/multimedia/25trump-news-header-swap-kzjf/25trump-news-header-swap-kzjf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 11:06:02.294026

It aligns with national and global sustainability goals and is expected to play a critical role in accelerating the deployment of decentralised renewable energy solutions.
Speaking at the event, the REA boss stated that the programme aims to empower young Nigerian graduates from across the six geopolitical zones, enabling them to become part of the renewable energy sector.

The Managing Director/CEO of the Rural Electrification Agency (REA), Engineer Abba Aliyu, made this announcement over the weekend in Abuja during the launch of the Next-Gen Renewable Energy Service Company (RESCO) Programme.

This transformative initiative is designed to engage, empower, and equip Nigerian youth with the skills and opportunities needed to thrive in the energy and technology sectors through skill development, mentorship, and strategic empowerment platforms.

Tribune Online reports that the programme is a forward-thinking platform aimed at building capacity, fostering innovation, and encouraging collaboration among RESCOs to scale up clean energy access across Nigeria. It aligns with national and global sustainability goals and is expected to play a critical role in accelerating the deployment of decentralised renewable energy solutions.

Speaking at the event, the REA boss stated that the programme aims to empower young Nigerian graduates from across the six geopolitical zones, enabling them to become part of the renewable energy sector. He explained that the pioneer cohort of 120 participants will undergo a paid three-month classroom education at the National Power Training Institute of Nigeria (NAPTIN), followed by a nine-month internship with selected Renewable Energy Service Companies.

He emphasised the need for Nigerians to turn the challenge of energy access into an opportunity, which is precisely what the RESCOs seek to achieve.

“We need to turn this challenge into an opportunity. Rather than seeing it as a crisis, we should view it as an opportunity—an opportunity to address the access gap, an opportunity to localise investment in renewable energy, and an opportunity to create a talent pipeline to tackle this challenge.

“To make Nigeria the renewable energy hub of Africa, several factors must be put in place. First is financing. We need sufficient funds to develop the necessary infrastructure and drive localisation efforts.

“And to date, we have secured a substantial amount of financing. Under the leadership of Mr President, the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) obtained approval for the largest public sector renewable funding in the world—a $750 million fund. Beyond this, discussions are ongoing for additional co-financing of $200 million, as well as potential funding of around $700 million for the Desert to Power initiative.”

Aliyu added: “In terms of localisation, through Mr President’s deliberate policies, our country now has a photovoltaic (PV) panel manufacturing capacity of 600 megawatts, up from just 110 megawatts.

“In Lagos, LPV operates at 100-megawatt capacity and is now fully functional. Here in Abuja, JRV has a 250-megawatt capacity, Oxano has 120 megawatts, and GridConnect is on the verge of completing a 150-megawatt capacity in Idu, Abuja. So, we are changing the narrative when it comes to localisation. Additionally, we now have more than 50 renewable energy service companies, compared to only 10 in the past.”

The Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, speaking through the Ministry’s Director of Renewable and Rural Power Access, Dr Sunday Owolabi, encouraged the renewable energy sector to continue investing strategically in human capacity and leadership. He described the programme as “a strong example of how government, industry, and development partners can collaborate to unlock new opportunities for innovation and impactful sustainable energy developments in the country.”

The Minister of Youth Development, Ayodele Olawande, while launching the programme, urged the graduates to explore opportunities within the renewable energy sector, adding that the Federal Government would always provide an enabling environment for them to succeed.",https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/1001012608-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 10:02:38.061641

The 389-page bill, approved by a narrow 215-214 vote, will likely inflict severe consequences on working families and job growth in the renewable energy sector. All Democrats opposed the measure, while just two Republicans, Representatives Davidson and Massie, voted in favor of protecting American jobs.

This legislation seeks to repeal several clean energy credits first established under President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which generated substantial revenue through stricter tax enforcement on the wealthy.

$3.7 Trillion Tax Cut for Wealthy Elites Risks Higher Energy Costs for Families

These credits included incentives for electric vehicle manufacturing that encouraged investment and job creation across the country. Analysts warn that scrapping these credits could lead to higher electricity prices and increased reliance on fossil fuels, adversely affecting air quality and public health.

Moreover, the bill is projected to add approximately $3.7 trillion to the national debt due to its significant tax cuts directed at the wealthiest Americans. In stark contrast to the Inflation Reduction Act, which was revenue-positive, the current Republican proposal is expected to worsen the fiscal deficit, channeling funds away from working families and towards affluent interests.

Additionally, the legislation targets pollution regulations established by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), raising concerns about potential health risks and escalating energy costs for ordinary Americans. With new regulations on the horizon and the trend towards electric vehicle manufacturing shifting to countries like China, many fear the loss of American jobs in this sector.

India has emerged as a global frontrunner in the renewable energy space as the tariff of the grid-connected solar power plants has gone down by 80% to ₹10.95 per unit (for 170 MW at Neemuch), sources said.

In March 2014, India's installed solar energy capacity was 2.82 GW, which has crossed 108 GW now, recording multifold growth. Wind energy capacity has more than doubled to 51 GW presently from 21G W in 2014.

Sources mentioned that during the UPA regime, India was almost absent in the solar manufacturing scene, with a meagre 2 GW of solar module production in 2014.

In 2024, India transformed into a global leader, with solar module manufacturing skyrocketing to 90 GW and by 2030, the nation will reach an impressive 150 GW, they said.

In 2014, India had almost zero domestic production of solar cells and wafers, which was a stark failure of the previous government's policy, official sources said.

Today, India has built a strong foundation with 25 GW of solar cell production and 2 GW of wafer production.

India has planned solar cells and wafer capacity of 100 GW and 40 GW, respectively, by 2030, which is aimed at reducing dependence on imports and becoming a self-sustaining powerhouse.

Even in fully integrated production, the country has reached 3.2 GW in 2024, with a target of 24 GW by 2030.

Similarly, the biopower generation capacity has increased by 42% from 8.1 GW to 11.5 GW over the last 10 years.

The Compressed Biogas (CBG) sector expanded from a single project with 8 tonnes per day (TPD) CBG generation capacity in 2014 to 150 projects with a cumulative capacity of 1,211 TPD in 2024.

The PM-Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana has gained significant traction, benefitting almost 13.3 lakh households, with nearly 12 lakh installation in the past 10 months, sources stated.

India has added a record 25 GW of renewable energy capacity in 2024, which is 34.63% higher than the 18.57 GW achieved in the previous year.

India has set an ambitious target of having 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, which requires the addition of about 50 GW of green capacity per annum in the next five to six years, they stated.

Four renewable energy implementing agencies (REIA), SECI, NTPC, NHPC and SJVN, have collectively issued RE power procurement tenders of around 44GW in fiscal year 2024-25.

Earlier in April, India became the world’s third-largest producer of electricity from wind and solar energy in 2024, overtaking Germany.

Sources mentioned that during the UPA regime, India was almost absent in the solar manufacturing scene, with a meagre 2GW of solar module production in 2014.

In 2024, India has transformed into a global leader, with solar module manufacturing skyrocketing to 90GW and by 2030, the nation will reach an impressive 150GW, they said.

In 2014, India had almost zero domestic production of solar cells and wafers, which was a stark failure of the previous government's policy, official sources said.

Today, India has built a strong foundation with 25GW of solar cell production and 2GW of wafer production.

India has planned solar cells and wafer capacity of 100GW and 40GW respectively by 2030, which is aimed at reducing dependence on imports and becoming a self-sustaining power house.

Even in fully integrated production, the country has reached 3.2GW in 2024, with a target of 24GW by 2030.

Similarly, the biopower generation capacity has increased by 42 per cent from 8.1GW to 11.5GW over the last 10 years.

Compressed Biogas (CBG) sector expanded from a single project with 8 tonnes per day (TPD) CBG generation capacity in 2014 to 150 projects with a cumulative capacity of 1,211 TPD in 2024.

The PM-Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, has gained significant traction, benefitting almost 13.3 lakh households, with nearly 12 lakh installation in the past 10 months, sources stated.

India has added a record 25GW of renewable energy capacity in 2024, which is 34.63 per cent higher than 18.57 GW achieved in the previous year.

India has set an ambitious target of having 500GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, which requires the addition of about 50GW of green capacity per annum in the next five to six years, they stated.

Four renewable energy implementing agency (REIA), SECI, NTPC, NHPC and SJVN, have collectively issued RE power procurement tenders of around 44GW in fiscal year 2024-25.

The President claims that such rules make household appliances less effective and more expensive. However, this stance conflicts with government data and industry expertise.

What's happening?

As The New York Times reported, the Energy Department is focusing on 47 regulations the Trump administration believes are increasing costs and lowering Americans' quality of life.

These regulations address everything from faucets to microwaves, air conditioners, and, oddly, even people trying out for sports teams organized for another gender.

However, energy-efficiency experts say that eliminating these regulations would actually drive costs up for American consumers. Without them, running household appliances would become more expensive, draining more natural resources and adding more pollution to our environment.

Andrew deLaski, the Appliance Standards Awareness Project's executive director, said in the Times report, ""If this attack on consumers succeeds, President Trump would be raising costs dramatically for families as manufacturers dump energy- and water-wasting products into the market.""

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency plans to eliminate Energy Star certifications for home appliances and other clean energy programs.

Why are water and energy regulations important?

Regulations like the 47 on the Energy Department's list described as ""burdensome"" and ""costly"" are crucial because they ensure that our planet's resources are used sustainably. They are particularly essential right now as our changing weather patterns create new environmental challenges that threaten the lives of all species.

Scientific data proves that renewable energy is among the best ways to lower American families' energy costs. Energy-efficient appliances can help reduce home energy bills by 30% or more.

According to government scientists cited by the Times, efficiency standards saved American households an average of $576 in 2024 while reducing U.S. energy consumption by 6.5% and public water use by 12%.

What's being done to protect efficiency regulations?

Climate activists and supporters of energy efficiency aren't giving up on these important regulations without a fight. According to the Times' sources, laws prohibit the government from becoming more lenient on standards already in place.

Eliminating energy standards will likely be met with legal challenges, as their supporters say doing so is illegal. Even if approved, the process would likely take months or even longer to implement.

In the meantime, you can do your part to conserve resources while saving money within the comfort of your private home. Energy-efficient appliances like washers and dryers can cut utility bills and contribute to less waste and pollution.

You can take your personal actions a step further by contacting your elected officials and encouraging their support for regulations that protect our clean water and energy supplies.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/energy-efficiency-regulationsimage-recH8iqR6Lql1M6zt.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 09:02:54.395645

However, the development of EV infrastructure is far from even across all states.

While some states are racing ahead with robust charging networks, others are dragging their feet, leaving EV drivers with few options.

Which brings us to the matter at hand: which US states have the best (and worst) EV infrastructure?

VISIT SBX CARS – View live supercar auctions powered by Supercar Blondie

The US currently has more than 192,000 public charging ports, with around 1,000 added every week, according to the Department of transportation.

While that might sound impressive, it falls short of national goals.

The White House previously announced a target of 500,000 chargers by 2026, which is out of reach at this point.

Looking forward, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory projects the need for more than two million chargers by 2030, which may seem like a huge number.

However, given how companies like BYD are developing EVs so affordable, it’s clear the demand is there.

So how do we measure which states are ahead of the game, and which are falling behind?

Enter the HERE-SBD EV Index, a metric developed by mapping company HERE and automotive research firm SBD Automotive.

It scores states on four key areas:

Charger power – Faster chargers are better. The higher the wattage, the quicker the charge.

Charging points per mile of road – It’s not only about how many chargers a state has, but how well they’re spread out.

EV market share – A higher share of EVs show stronger adoption.

EVs per charger – Fewer EVs per charger means it’s easier to find an available spot.

So what are the top 10 states for EV infrastructure?

1) Delaware – 79.4

2) Washington, DC – 72.5

3) Massachusetts – 64.2

4) Nevada – 64.2

5) Connecticut – 63.7

6) New York – 62.3

7) California – 61.8

8) Vermont – 60.8

9) New Jersey – 60.3

10) Rhode Island -60.3

These are the states leading the charge (literally), with most of the top performers in the northeast, and a few out west.

And what about the bottom 10?

51) Alaska- 19.6

50) Arkansas – 33.3

49) Idaho – 35.3

48) Nebraska – 37.3

47) Minnesota – 40.7

46) Mississippi – 40.7

45) Kentucky – 42.1

44) Michigan – 42.1

43) Kansas – 42.2

42) Illinois – 42.2

These states lag in both availability and power. Alaska, for example, has almost no utility rebates or incentives for EV charging.

On the other hand, Arkansas has better coverage, but the incentives for a Level 2 charger is only $500, compared to the national average of $3,488.

While rebates aren’t part of the EV index score, there’s a clear connection. States with generous incentives often score higher.

For example, Washington, DC offers a 50 percent tax credit up to $10,000 for Level 2 chargers, plus utility programs that cover installation costs.

New York offers over 19 different rebate programs, some targeted at specific communities or building types.

Even at-home charging can help ease the strain on public infrastructure, as 56 per cent of the US offers residential rebates, averaging $534.

Perhaps EV owners should use this hack to charge their cars from ‘literally’ anywhere, while the infrastructure develops.

While the US still has a long journey to reach 500,000 public chargers by 2026, progress is being made.

The study indicates that expanding incentive programs and investing in more chargers will be key to keeping up with rising demands.

After all, most American auto executives seem to think that cheap Chinese EVs entering the US market is only a matter of when, not if.",https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Your-paragraph-text-13.webp,N,,2025-05-25 09:03:02.300442

The U.S. plans to cut Energy Star. Could that raise costs for Canadians?

Energy Star, a popular program that highlights energy-efficient appliances from furnaces to dishwashers, is reportedly on the chopping block in the U.S.

It and other divisions that oversee climate change and energy efficiency would be eliminated as part of the Trump administration's reorganization of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Washington Post and the New York Times reported earlier this month.

That could affect the labels Canadians rely on to know what products will help them save on energy bills, say observers such as Sarah Riddell, policy research associate with the non-profit Efficiency Canada.

""They can see … just with that one symbol that it's going to be one of the top performers in terms of energy efficiency,"" she said.

But will that symbol still exist after the U.S. program is gone?

While Energy Star Canada is administered by the Canadian government, it relies on U.S. standards, certification and testing for many products — and it's not clear how it will operate without the U.S. program.

Girls and young women need better access to mental health care, StatsCan report suggests

When Emma Bockner was eight, she was prescribed medication for ADHD. Then as a teen, she started experiencing problematic substance use.

""There were a lot of things that happened in my childhood that left me with feelings of inadequacy,"" said Bockner, 26, who lives in Richmond Hill, Ont. She's survived emotional and sexual abuse and struggled with an eating disorder.

When Bockner graduated from high school, she saw her friends moving on with fulfilling lives, as she found herself with a part-time job, often sitting in her room alone, drinking and doing drugs.

""It took me about six months to get into treatment, a couple of months to get into a group home,"" Bockner recalled.

Waitlists for mental health and substance use services are one of the deterrents for girls and young women in Canada looking for professional help, a new report from Statistics Canada suggests.

The report looked at access to mental health and substance use health supports among girls and women aged 15 to 29 using 2022 data, the most recent available.

Of these girls and young women, nearly four in 10 met the criteria for at least one of generalized anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, social phobia, or alcohol and substance dependence, said Kristyn Frank, a senior researcher with Statistics Canada's health analysis division in Ottawa.

In comparison, fewer than two in 10 in Canada's general population met the criteria for a mental health or substance use disorder that same year, the report found.

""There definitely is something going on with young women and girls in terms of mental health and substance use increasing during the pandemic,"" Frank said.

'Rifts in families': Alberta parents seek better talk on vaccines as measles outbreak grows

As the measles outbreak grows in Alberta, some parents are feeling the strain. They're trying to keep kids safe and navigate touchy vaccine conversations with friends and family, whether they support them or not.

Jillian Carter lives in Lethbridge, where the vaccination rate for seven-year-olds last year ranged from 47 per cent in the surrounding county to 80 per cent within the city.

Her first child is an eight-week-old infant who is too young to be vaccinated. So Carter leaves her at home when she shops for groceries, goes out less, covers her daughter's bucket seat when she enters a building and generally avoids meeting new people socially.

""It does make it hard to branch out into like other communities, knowing that your child's safety is at risk when you don't know where other people are standing [on vaccines],"" she said.

""You find your people and you know your people. But it's also something that does make you a little bit scared leaving the house with a newborn.""

Measles was once eradicated in Canada, but it's coming back after a drop in vaccination rates. In Alberta, the outbreaks started in March and have since grown to 505 cases.

The highly contagious disease typically causes a fever and cough, then a rash. This can normally be managed at home, but in some cases, it brings serious complications such as ear infections, pneumonia and encephalitis, which can lead to lasting brain damage.

As of this week, Alberta had one child with measles in intensive care.

CBC News stopped by a popular playground at Henderson Lake in Lethbridge recently to talk with parents about how this is affecting them and their families.
