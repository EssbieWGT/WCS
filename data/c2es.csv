This week, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it has awarded Texas with Class VI primacy, officially erasing Louisiana’s head start.","In 2023, Louisiana celebrated securing Class VI primacy from the Environmental Protection Agency. At the time, I gave a statement to the press that Louisiana gaining the ability to do its own permitting of carbon capture and storage projects was putting our state “on the verge of a new golden age” of energy production and all that comes with it — new jobs, more state revenue and a stronger economy.

With carbon capture and storage poised to take American energy dominance to new heights, we were years ahead of any other state.

As the Trump administration repealed many of the Biden-era tax credits, it doubled down on support for carbon capture and storage in the One Big Beautiful Bill because the technology is viable and has a market demand.

In the two years that followed Louisiana gaining primacy, industry announced $70 billion in new investment coming to our state, almost all with a carbon capture and storage component. Investments like this coming to fruition can create more of the job opportunities that will keep our kids here in Louisiana and improve lives across our state.

But as we’ve had the opportunity to use this existing technology to supercharge Louisiana’s economy past other Southern states, we have spent two legislative sessions debating whether to kneecap the biggest economic advantage Louisiana has had in our lifetime.

Now, almost two years since gaining Class VI primacy, Louisiana has only permitted one project, and Texas is on the verge of surpassing us.

This week, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it has awarded Texas with Class VI primacy, officially erasing Louisiana’s head start. My counterpart at the Texas Oil and Gas Association Todd Staples is saying “Texas is now poised to lead the world in CCS, which means more investment and more jobs for Texans.”

While we no longer have the lead, the game is not over. Companies are deciding, right now, whether it is better to do business in Louisiana or Texas. They are looking at regulatory uncertainty, the influence of antibusiness trial attorneys, and the hesitancy of a state to seize clear opportunities.

The company also said that its deliveries of 13,201 in the quarter will be its highest quarter for the year.
Rivian was gross-profit positive for the second time this year The company reported a small consolidated gross profit of $24 million in the quarter, a $416 million improvement from the year-ago quarter, and its second quarter of gross profit this year.

That sent Rivian's stock soaring by more than 20% following the results.

But it's important to put the latest results into context. So let's look at three important takeaways from the third quarter and what they might mean for the electric vehicle (EV) company.

1. Revenue was higher than expected, thanks to tax credits

Automotive revenue jumped 47% to $1.1 billion in the quarter, with management saying the increase was driven in part by increased vehicle deliveries and a rise in average selling prices. That helped boost consolidated revenue by 78% to about $1.6 billion.

It's important for investors to know that part of the sales increase was also due to customers rushing to buy a vehicle before the EV tax credits expired at the end of September. The company's EVs were too expensive to directly qualify for them, but some customers were able to take advantage of leasing loopholes.

With the credits now expired, management said on the earnings call that it doesn't expect to have meaningful revenue from the sale of regulatory credits, ""and we've taken those out of our forecast."" The company also said that its deliveries of 13,201 in the quarter will be its highest quarter for the year.

In short, a rush by customers to get their hands on a new Rivian was partly fueled by credits, which helped boost deliveries and sales.

2. Tariff costs will be much lower

Tariffs have already caused a lot of turmoil in the auto industry, and their impact has had Rivian and its peers scrambling to find ways to lower costs. But a recent policy change from the Trump administration allows for vehicles built in the U.S. -- as Rivians are -- to receive a partial credit that helps offset some of the tariffs.

That's the technical way of saying that tariffs are going to be cheaper for the EV maker. Chief financial officer Claire McDonough said on the earnings call that the previous tariff impact on each vehicle in the third quarter was just under $2,000, but it will be reduced to just ""a few hundred dollars per unit"" for its new builds.

Tariffs of any amount aren't great for Rivian, but the new, lower costs are a big win for the company. It still has some vehicle inventory that doesn't qualify for credits, but management said once those are sold, its new vehicle builds in the fourth quarter will benefit from the tariff offsets.

3. Rivian was gross-profit positive for the second time this year

The company reported a small consolidated gross profit of $24 million in the quarter, a $416 million improvement from the year-ago quarter, and its second quarter of gross profit this year. It's not all sunshine and rainbows on this front, but it's making some progress that should be noted.

First, the company's automotive gross profit loss of $130 million was still a significant $249 million improvement from the year-ago quarter, thanks to increased average selling prices and cost reductions. What's more, Rivian had $154 million in software and services gross profit, improving $167 million from a loss in the year-ago quarter. The $167 million in gross profit as a result of its joint venture with Volkswagen.

While it was a good quarter on this front, Rivian will likely experience more fluctuations in its gross profitability, and investors shouldn't expect it to be positive from here on out.

Making the best of a difficult situation

Shareholders should keep an eye on Rivian's vehicle sales in the next quarter as the impact of the eliminated tax credits could cause them to be lower. Things could turn around a bit once the company launches its R2 model in the first half of 2026. It will have a lower starting price of around $45,000, which could be a catalyst for the EV maker, but it's still a big unknown at this point.

Still, as a shareholder, I'm pleased with Rivian's latest quarter, and it appears to be managing a difficult time in the EV industry very well.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/841920/20230302_ryan-salm_tahoe_1082_zwcadn.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 04:58:27.625956

Unlike gas stoves, induction stoves do not release any harmful pollutants into your kitchen, improving your home's indoor air quality. Induction stoves are also more energy-efficient and cook faster than gas stoves, saving you time and money in the kitchen.

However, upgrading to an induction stove sooner rather than later can save you even more money. Federal incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act are expiring by the end of 2025. As a result, if you switch to an induction stove before the year ends, you can receive up to $840 off the cost of an induction range. To claim these government incentives, simply submit an IRS Form 5695 when filing your taxes.

If a kitchen renovation isn't in your budget or you rent, you can still add induction to your home and reap these benefits. Plug-in burners are an affordable solution that don't require any home renovation to install. Plus, plug-in burners are relatively cheap, starting at just $50, so they're also a great option for homeowners looking to try out induction before making the full switch.

By upgrading to energy-efficient appliances, like an induction stove, you not only reduce the total cost of your home's energy bills but also decrease your household's pollution output. This is a win-win for your wallet and the environment, saving you money while reducing your environmental impact.

It's a big step forward for the nascent—and in some ways, promising—competitor to conventional lithium-ion batteries. But sodium-ion tech still has hurdles to overcome.

Experts say sodium-ion batteries have several advantages over traditional lithium-ion batteries. They experience far less degradation over time, demonstrate superior performance even in extreme cold and can cost comparatively less when scaled.

But there are trade offs. The cells have lower energy density than lithium-ion ones, which makes them more suitable for energy storage systems or less demanding applications like low-cost EVs. And the technology just isn't as mature as lithium iron phosphate (LFP), the low-cost lithium-ion chemistry that's taking off globally for both stationary storage and EV applications.

Peak Energy claims its sodium-ion energy storage battery can operate without active cooling, unlike lithium-ion batteries, which require complex cooling systems and fire-suppressant additives for safety and performance.

Under its agreement with Texas-based energy provider Jupiter Power, Peak Energy will provide 4.75 gigawatt-hours of sodium-ion battery energy storage systems (ESS) for deployment between 2027 and 2030.

The company claims its grid-scale sodium-ion battery system can hold 3.1 megawatts hours of energy and operates at temperatures ranging from -40 to 131 degrees Fahrenheit (-40 to +55 degrees Celsius). That's enough energy to fully charge more than 40 EVs with an average pack size of about 75 kilowatt hours. The ESS has no moving parts, no fans and no cooling system pipes running between the cells, according to the company.

It has already deployed what it calls the world’s first grid-scale passively cooled sodium-ion battery at a site in Watkins, Colorado. As per the company, this battery can save more than $100 million in project costs over its lifetime.

Grid batteries, which look like large shipping containers, are becoming increasingly important for a few reasons. AI data centers, EVs and electric heating are expected to significantly boost demand for power in the coming years and decades. Renewable power generation is growing too, but it's intermittent. We need to store energy for times when the sun isn't shining or when the wind isn't blowing.

These stationary battery banks are different from EV batteries. They operate at controlled temperatures and are designed to repeat the same charge-discharge cycles, typically for over 20 years, which is a less demanding use case than that of EVs. EV batteries are exposed to different road conditions and varied climates and are subject to a wide range of charging cycles and mixed use cases.

Historically, grid-scale batteries in the U.S. have used nickel-based chemistries. But more recently, the market is pivoting to LFP cells. Sodium-ion’s entry to the ESS market could herald a new chapter if successfully deployed. But some experts remain skeptical.

“LFP batteries are currently the lowest-cost and most widely available option for energy storage,” Evelina Stoikou, head of battery technology and supply chain research at the research firm BloombergNEF, told me in an email.

As EV sales growth slows down in the U.S., more battery companies are pivoting to produce LFP batteries for ESS, including LG Energy Solution and Stellantis-backed NextStar Energy.

Plus, Peak Energy is not the only U.S. company that has tried to scale sodium-ion batteries in the country. California-based Natron Energy wanted to build a $1.4 billion sodium-ion battery gigafactory in North Carolina, but ceased operations this year due to funding issues, the Raleigh News and Observer reported. Another sodium-ion startup, Bedrock Materials, cited the dropping cost of lithium as a reason for why it closed up shop this year.

“Sodium-ion energy storage systems have the potential to compete with LFP in terms of energy density and performance, but they are a less mature technology and may not yet benefit from the same economies of scale as LFP,” Stoikou added.

It’s unclear where Peak Energy has sourced its sodium-ion batteries from or where they are manufactured. The company did not respond to InsideEVs’ request for comment by the time of publication.

Since their lower energy density could pose an issue for EVs, Stoikou expects sodium-ion batteries to play a larger role in ESS applications. But the road to wider deployment will be long. BNEF expects sodium-ion batteries to account for 5% of ESS capacity additions by 2035.

That’s not necessarily the case outside the U.S., however. China's CATL, the world’s largest battery manufacturer, revealed production-ready sodium-ion batteries for light-duty EVs and commercial trucks at this year’s Shanghai Auto Show. And electric scooters powered by sodium-ion batteries are already on sale in China, costing as low as $400.

Over in the U.S., whether sodium-ion battery tech remains a niche experiment or scales into a meaningful part of the country’s energy ecosystem remains to be seen.

STATE NEWS

UTAH REJECTS PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING: A Utah judge rejected an extremely gerrymandered proposed congressional districts map drawn by Republicans in the state Legislature and instead, put in place a fairer map. Judge Dianna Gibson ruled that the Legislature’s map violated a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2018 that banned partisan gerrymandering and set neutral criteria for redistricting. This decision is an important win for democracy against partisan gerrymandering.

LCV ACTION FUND ENDORSES SHERROD BROWN FOR U.S. SENATE: LCV Action Fund announced its endorsement of former Senator Sherrod Brown for election to the U.S. Senate representing Ohio. Brown has played a key leadership role in passing clean energy and climate legislation, and will advocate for creating good-paying, family-sustaining, union clean energy jobs in Ohio and bringing down costs for families across the state.

LCVAF TAKE: LCV Action Fund Vice President of Political Affairs Craig Auster said, “It is critical to have strong clean energy champions like Sherrod Brown in the Senate to protect people and the planet while Trump’s government shutdown and attacks on cheap, fast clean energy is continuing to raise utility costs for families across the country. Sherrod Brown has the experience and proven leadership Ohioans can count on — he will never stop fighting for a clean energy future that helps workers and working families, rebuilds the middle class and brings down costs for everyone.”

PENNSYLVANIA PULLS OUT OF REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INITIATIVE: Governor Josh Shapiro announced the Pennsylvania state budget, which includes exiting the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). The decision is a significant setback that will result in a loss of over $1 billion in investments for clean energy that support lowering electricity prices.

CVPA TAKE: Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania Executive Director Molly Parzen said, “The state budget Governor Shapiro announced today represents a devastating, self-inflicted setback in addressing affordability, clean energy and pollution by walking away from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative without establishing an alternative approach. Pennsylvanians should not have to choose between critical social services and lower energy bills — and Governor Shapiro and legislative Democrats should have held the line and rejected that false choice. Their capitulation means that Pennsylvanians will now be robbed of more than $1 billion annually to lower electricity prices through investments in clean energy.

“This decision is even more stunning as it comes a week after Democrats across the nation, including in New Jersey, Virginia and Georgia, achieved record electoral victories by promising to combat skyrocketing energy costs. Policies like an end to utility rate hikes in New Jersey and a commitment to rejoin RGGI in Virginia resonated powerfully with voters. Rather than using these victories as momentum for ongoing negotiations, Governor Shapiro surrendered our most powerful tool to lower energy costs.

“We appreciate that House Democrats successfully secured continued funding for the Solar for Schools program, a win environmental and labor groups have worked hard for over the last few years. Unfortunately, this win does not come close to providing the level or breadth of annual clean energy investments Pennsylvania would have secured from RGGI. Moving forward, Pennsylvania’s working families deserve a laser-like focus on implementing common sense solutions for a clean energy agenda that lowers their electric bills. As Governor Shapiro himself has said about the transition to clean energy, ‘Doing nothing is not an option.’”

But if all work together toward the common goal, then the Voltage Valley moniker the Mahoning Valley has earned over the past five years will remain fully charged for the long haul.","General Motors’ recent announcement of massive layoffs at Ultium Cells in Lordstown hit the Mahoning Valley like a ton of bricks.

For some, it rekindled a sense of perverse deja vu, harkening back to the series of GM layoffs that began about 10 years ago and ended in 2019 with the moth-balling of the once-sprawling 13,000-employee vehicle assembly plant in the village.

That’s understandable. The announcement two weeks ago that GM will permanently lay off 440 hourly workers and temporarily release an additional 850 workers at its local Ultium Cells plant beginning Jan. 5 stands as the largest set of job losses from one company in the Mahoning Valley in several years.

But, unlike the chain reaction of job shrinkage at the Lordstown assembly plant that began a decade ago, this time around, all is not necessarily doom and gloom for the road ahead.

While we are disheartened over this jolt to our ever-evolving Voltage Valley and saddened over its impact on affected workers, plenty of room for optimism exists toward a viable rebound.

But that rebound will not come easily or quickly enough for many. Such a recovery also will require cooperation and commitments from all stakeholders in the future viability of GM in particular and electric-vehicle commerce in general for our region.

As most know by now, the downsizing and temporary closing of Ultium stems from a massive decline in EV sales after this summer’s Big Beautiful Bill scrubbed $7,500 tax credits on new EV purchases and weakened mandated fuel-economy levels. With the loss of those incentives, EV sales have plummeted 74% from their 2025 peak, according to data from analytics platform Cloud Theory.

To reverse that trajectory, the automaker and its workforce, represented by Local 1112 of the United Auto Workers, face a daunting challenge. They must prove they can make their product line succeed without artificial stimuli via federal tax credits and other public-sector incentives.

Given the current political climate in Washington, hopes for any resurrection of such generous government-funded incentives appear slim to none. That’s why any upturn in electric vehicle production and the batteries that charge them must originate with the company itself and its able workforce.

So far, the signs of such progress are encouraging.

GM CEO Mary Barra has vowed to do everything possible to reverse the current EV sales slide. “We will continue to invest in new battery chemistries, form factors and architectural improvements to drive profitability,” she said in a letter to shareholders.

Part of that investment will feature major upgrades to Ultium’s plants here and in Tennessee during the down time early next year so that when the plants reopen next spring or summer, they will be primed to produce more efficient and less costly product lines.

As for batteries, GM plans to dump the Ultium Cells one-size-fits-all brand and replace it with a series of batteries tailor-made for specific vehicles. New state-of-the-art batteries, such as the lithium manganese-rich battery cells under development in Warren, Michigan, are designed to give EV drivers a faster charge and longer-distance range.

As for the company’s unionized workforce, cooperation — not contentiousness — must be the watchword to achieve mutually desired goals. That means all traces of antagonistic relationships between the union and the company must be placed in the rearview mirror.

At this early stage, signs of such cooperation look promising.

UAW Local 1112 President George Goranitis said the union is actively discussing with the company opportunities to attract new product lines to the sprawling 2.8 million-square-foot production facility in the Valley.

In addition to the company and its employees, others will have roles to play to accelerate any EV resurgence.

The state of Ohio and private companies should prioritize fast-tracking plans to blanket the state with conveniently located charging stations. After all, the fear of batteries conking out mid-trip fuel many would-be EV buyers’ apprehension of making the leap to clean-energy cars, trucks and SUVs.

Dealers could also play a role in jumpstarting EV sales by taking a page from the playbook of those that are offering discounts and rebates on EV purchases and leases to make them comparable or less than the cost of the gas-guzzling varieties.

Broader communitywide investment in the recovery of the EV market also could contribute to success. The Drive It Home campaign, a coalition of business, labor and elected leaders who came together to urge General Motors to reinvest in the GM Lordstown Cruze plant and later succeeded in landing Foxconn at the site, could be reactivated to advocate for continued investment here and to assist the company and its workforce toward that end.

Clearly the road ahead will be paved with struggles and potential setbacks. But if all work together toward the common goal, then the Voltage Valley moniker the Mahoning Valley has earned over the past five years will remain fully charged for the long haul.",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.tribtoday.com/images/2016/10/11191558/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 00:58:13.969650

The members emphasized the urgent need to restore energy assistance to millions of vulnerable households facing rising utility costs and extreme weather conditions nationwide.

“LIHEAP is more than just a utility assistance program, it is a lifeline for seniors, children, and low-income families,” said Congressman Ruiz. “In my district, families face some of the highest temperatures in the country. There is an urgent need to protect people from extreme cold or heat. Without immediate LIHEAP funds, many must choose between safety and basic needs. That’s unacceptable.”

“Families across the country are already stretched thin by rising costs, and now millions are wondering how they’ll keep the heat on as temperatures continue to drop,” said Congresswoman Trahan. “No one should have to choose between staying warm and putting food on the table. The administration must act with urgency to get LIHEAP funding out the door, so families aren’t left out in the cold this winter.”

The letter is currently cosigned by 101 Democratic Members of Congress. The full letter can be found here(link is external).

LIHEAP is a federal program that helps eligible households afford heating in the winter and cooling during dangerously high summer temperatures. In previous years, nearly seven million families, seniors, and at-risk households have benefited from the program. However, recent administrative actions have placed the program—and millions of Americans who depend on it at risk.

Earlier this year, the Administration’s FY26 Budget Request proposed eliminating LIHEAP entirely, while reports in April indicated that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) had dismissed all LIHEAP staff. These decisions have created confusion and delay, leaving it unclear who will approve state energy assistance plans or oversee disbursement of funds now that the Continuing Resolution has been enacted.

The lawmakers noted that LIHEAP is already an underfunded and oversubscribed program—reaching only about 17 percent of eligible households. Without swift action to release funds, millions of seniors and families could be left without critical energy assistance until early 2026.

Key Impacts of Delayed LIHEAP Funding:

Families face dangerous exposure to freezing winter temperatures and life-threatening summer heat.

Rising electricity and heating costs are straining household budgets, particularly in rural and low-income communities.

Administrative delays at HHS threaten to postpone LIHEAP disbursements by months.

“Providing reliable LIHEAP funding is not a political choice, it is a moral and public health imperative,” Ruiz concluded. “We must act now to protect the most vulnerable families before temperatures drop, and lives are put at risk.”

Indiana has emerged as a pioneering state in the quest to transform environmental liabilities into strategic resources through its ambitious Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction program. Governor Mike Braun's administration has established a comprehensive framework targeting the recovery of critical minerals from approximately 1,900 abandoned mining locations scattered across the state's coal belt.

The initiative centres on extracting rare earth elements from various types of coal mining byproducts, including coal gob (coarse mining refuse), processing slurry containing fine materials, and acidic mine drainage deposits. This strategic pivot aligns with federal encouragement from the U.S. Geological Survey and the Office of Surface Mining, which have explicitly positioned Indiana as a testing ground for domestic rare earth supply chain development.

The programme represents more than just mineral recovery; it embodies a paradigm shift where historical mining liabilities become potential assets in America's critical minerals energy security strategy. By targeting unconsolidated materials that contain trace concentrations of yttrium, rubidium, and other strategic elements, Indiana aims to demonstrate that coal-producing regions can contribute meaningfully to national security objectives.

Assessing the Scale of Available Coal Waste Resources

Indiana's coal waste inventory presents a substantial foundation for Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction efforts, though the true commercial potential remains under evaluation. The state's abandoned mine sites contain diverse materials accumulated over decades of coal production, including fine coal refuse, coal ash deposits, and various processing residues.

Regional Distribution Analysis:

• Southwestern Indiana: Concentrates the majority of historical coal operations and associated waste materials

• West-central regions: Contains significant coal ash deposits from power generation facilities

• Northwestern areas: Features processing slurry deposits from historical coal preparation plants

• Scattered sites: Distributed across 1,900 documented locations requiring individual assessment

The materials targeted for extraction include coal gob piles containing coarse refuse materials, fine coal processing slurry with potentially higher rare earth concentrations, and acidic mine drainage deposits where leaching processes may have concentrated certain elements. Each material type presents unique extraction challenges and opportunities based on its geochemical composition and physical characteristics.

Coal ash represents a particularly interesting component of Indiana's inventory, as power plant combustion can concentrate rare earth elements that were originally dispersed throughout coal seams. These deposits often contain measurable concentrations of light rare earth elements, though recovery methods remain largely experimental.

Commercial Viability Assessment: Grade Reality Check

The fundamental challenge facing Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction lies in the extremely low concentrations of target elements compared to traditional mining operations. Current assessments indicate approximately 10 grams of yttrium per cubic yard in typical coal waste materials, representing concentrations far below conventional commercial thresholds.

Grade Comparison Framework:

Source Type Typical Concentration Commercial Status Chinese Ion-Adsorption Clays 500-2,000 ppm REO Actively mined Hard-Rock Monazite 50,000+ ppm REO Primary REE source Indiana Coal Waste 100-300 ppm REO Pre-commercial Carbonatite Deposits 2,000-8,000 ppm REO Established operations

This grade differential represents a critical economic hurdle. While traditional ion-adsorption clay operations in China's southern provinces extract rare earth elements from deposits containing 500 to 2,000 parts per million total rare earth oxides, Indiana's coal waste typically registers between 100 and 300 ppm according to preliminary assessments.

The concentration gap becomes even more pronounced when compared to hard-rock rare earth operations like Mountain Pass in California, where monazite deposits contain 50,000 to 100,000 parts per million rare earth oxides. This means Indiana's coal waste contains roughly 1/500th the concentration of elements found in commercially viable hard-rock deposits.

Converting the reported 10 grams of yttrium per cubic yard to standard industry measurements yields approximately 13 parts per million, which falls dramatically short of the general industry benchmark of 1,000 ppm total rare earth oxides for standalone commercial viability.

Emerging Processing Technologies for Low-Grade Materials

Despite the grade challenges, several innovative processing methodologies show potential for extracting rare earth elements from Indiana's low-grade coal waste materials. These technologies focus on maximising recovery efficiency while minimising processing costs through novel approaches that align with sustainable mining practices.

Bioleaching Applications

Biological extraction methods utilise specialised bacteria to dissolve rare earth elements from complex coal matrices. This approach offers several advantages over traditional chemical processing:

• Environmental sustainability: Reduces reliance on harsh chemical reagents

• Selective extraction: Bacteria can target specific elements whilst leaving unwanted materials

• Lower energy requirements: Operates at ambient temperatures and pressures

• Scalability potential: Can process large volumes of low-grade feedstock

Research institutions are exploring bacteria species including Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Thiobacillus thiooxidans for their ability to mobilise rare earth elements from coal ash and processing residues. While still in pilot-stage development, bioleaching represents a potentially transformative approach for coal waste valorisation.

Ion-Exchange Recovery Systems

Ion-exchange technology offers another pathway for processing large volumes of low-grade coal waste materials. This methodology employs specialised resins to selectively capture and concentrate target elements:

• Selective separation: Resins can target specific rare earth elements

• Continuous processing: Allows for automated, high-throughput operations

• Minimal infrastructure: Requires less capital investment than conventional mining

• Regenerative capability: Resins can be reused multiple times

The technology builds upon established industrial processes used in water treatment and metal recovery operations. Specialised resins designed for rare earth applications show promise for concentrating elements from dilute solutions created by leaching coal waste materials.

Hybrid Chemical Processing

Integrated processing approaches combine multiple extraction techniques to enhance overall recovery rates whilst optimising costs. These hybrid systems can adapt to the specific mineral compositions found in different types of Indiana coal waste:

• Multi-stage processing: Combines acid leaching, ion-exchange, and precipitation

• Waste stream optimisation: Maximises utilisation of all process inputs

• Adaptive workflows: Can adjust to varying feedstock characteristics

• Cost efficiency: Reduces overall processing expenses through integration

Federal Support and National Security Alignment

Federal backing represents a critical component enabling Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction initiative. The strategic alignment between state objectives and national security priorities creates funding mechanisms that could make otherwise uneconomic projects financially viable through industry innovation trends.

The U.S. Department of Energy and Office of Surface Mining have positioned Indiana as their preferred testing ground for domestic rare earth development technologies. This federal endorsement provides access to research funding, technical expertise, and regulatory support necessary for advancing extraction methodologies.

Key Federal Programmes Supporting the Initiative:

• Critical Materials Research Programmes: DOE funding for innovative extraction technologies

• Mine Reclamation Grants: Federal funding for environmental remediation with REE recovery components

• USGS Technical Support: Geological expertise and resource assessment capabilities

• National Defense Authorization: Strategic minerals research and development funding

The alignment addresses multiple policy objectives simultaneously: environmental remediation of abandoned mine sites, domestic critical minerals production, and reduced dependence on foreign rare earth suppliers. This multi-faceted approach enables funding streams that wouldn't support standalone mining operations.

Economic Model: Reclamation-Integrated Approach

Indiana's economic strategy cleverly repositions rare earth extraction as a secondary benefit of federally mandated environmental reclamation activities. Rather than pursuing traditional mining economics, the state treats REE recovery as value-added outcomes from necessary cleanup operations, incorporating mine reclamation innovations throughout the process.

Three-Tier Economic Structure:

Primary Objective: Environmental remediation of abandoned mine sites using federal reclamation funding

Secondary Benefit: Rare earth element recovery to offset cleanup costs and generate modest revenues

Tertiary Value: Technology development and export potential for other coal-producing regions

This approach circumvents traditional mining economics by leveraging environmental compliance requirements to subsidise extraction research and development. Federal reclamation grants effectively cover the base costs of site preparation, material handling, and initial processing infrastructure.

The model acknowledges that standalone REE extraction from Indiana's low-grade materials cannot compete with Chinese production costs or established hard-rock operations. However, when integrated with mandatory environmental cleanup activities, the combined value proposition becomes economically attractive.

Corporate and Research Institution Involvement

Several companies have established operations targeting coal waste rare earth extraction across the broader Appalachian and Midwest regions, with Indiana representing a significant expansion opportunity. These operations typically focus on processing capacities ranging from several hundred to several thousand metric tons annually.

The corporate landscape includes both established mining companies diversifying into coal waste processing and specialised startups developing novel extraction technologies. Companies are attracted to Indiana's initiative due to federal funding availability, regulatory support, and abundant feedstock materials.

Research Institution Partnerships:

• Indiana Geological and Water Survey: Leading state-level geological assessment and resource mapping

• Purdue University: Materials science and chemical engineering research support

• Indiana University: Geochemistry and environmental impact assessment studies

• Regional Collaborations: Multi-state geological surveys sharing data and methodologies

These partnerships leverage federal Department of Energy funding for three-year evaluation projects designed to demonstrate technical feasibility and economic potential. The collaborative approach pools expertise and resources whilst reducing individual institutional risks.

Global Context: International Coal Waste REE Programmes

Indiana's initiative operates within a broader international context of coal waste valorisation programmes, each addressing unique local conditions and strategic objectives. This global perspective provides valuable insights for feasibility study insights development.

International Comparison Framework:

Region Development Stage Key Advantages Primary Focus Indiana, USA Pilot/Early Commercial Federal funding support Integrated reclamation Appalachian Region Commercial operations Established supply chains Industrial-scale processing European Union Research-focused Advanced processing tech Environmental compliance Australia Exploration-stage High-grade coal waste Export potential

The Appalachian region has achieved more advanced commercial deployment, with several facilities processing coal waste at industrial scales. These operations provide valuable precedents for Indiana's programme whilst highlighting both opportunities and challenges in scaling extraction operations.

European Union coal waste programmes emphasise research and development of environmentally sustainable processing technologies, often with stronger regulatory frameworks and higher environmental standards. Australia's coal waste REE exploration benefits from higher-grade deposits but faces greater distances to processing facilities and export markets.

Environmental Benefits and Processing Considerations

Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction offers significant environmental advantages beyond mineral recovery, addressing long-standing ecological and public health concerns associated with abandoned mine sites. The National Academies report emphasises the potential for transforming environmental liabilities into productive assets.

Primary Environmental Outcomes:

• Acid Mine Drainage Remediation: Processing neutralises acidic water contamination affecting local watersheds

• Land Reclamation: Converts abandoned industrial sites into productive or recreational land uses

• Waste Volume Reduction: Significantly reduces coal waste pile volumes through processing

• Groundwater Protection: Eliminates ongoing leaching from unmanaged waste deposits

Modern extraction techniques prioritise environmental sustainability through closed-loop water systems that prevent contamination of local water resources. Processing facilities employ selective chemical processes designed to minimise reagent consumption and waste generation.

The integration of rare earth extraction with environmental remediation creates positive feedback loops where mineral recovery helps fund more comprehensive cleanup activities than would be economically feasible through reclamation grants alone.

Processing Infrastructure Requirements

Successful implementation requires specialised processing infrastructure adapted to coal waste characteristics:

• Materials handling systems: Capable of processing heterogeneous coal waste feedstocks

• Chemical processing facilities: Equipped for selective rare earth extraction and purification

• Water treatment systems: Managing both process water and acid mine drainage

• Quality control laboratories: Ensuring product specifications meet industrial standards

Technical and Market Development Challenges

Despite promising technological developments and federal support, Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction faces substantial technical and market challenges that must be addressed for commercial success.

Primary Technical Hurdles

Low Concentration Economics represent the most significant obstacle to commercial viability. Processing enormous volumes of coal waste to achieve meaningful rare earth output creates transportation, handling, and processing cost challenges that compound with scale.

Current extraction technologies achieve limited recovery efficiency from coal waste matrices, often capturing less than 50% of available rare earth content. Improving recovery rates requires continued technology development and optimisation for specific coal waste compositions.

Processing Complexity stems from coal waste containing diverse mineral matrices that require specialised separation techniques. Unlike traditional rare earth ores with predictable mineralogy, coal waste presents variable compositions that complicate standardised processing approaches.

Quality control for end-product specifications remains challenging when processing heterogeneous feedstocks. Industrial customers require consistent rare earth purity levels and elemental ratios that are difficult to achieve from variable coal waste inputs.

Market Development Requirements

Supply Chain Integration represents a critical success factor requiring development of downstream processing capabilities. Indiana's initiative must establish connections to facilities capable of converting rare earth concentrates into finished products for electronics, renewable energy, and defence applications.

Logistics networks require establishment for consistent delivery schedules and quality specifications. Industrial customers need reliable supply chains with predictable pricing and delivery terms that coal waste operations must demonstrate over extended periods.

Market Positioning Challenges:

• Price competition: Must compete with established Chinese and other international suppliers

• Volume limitations: Cannot match scale of traditional mining operations

• Quality consistency: Must demonstrate reliable product specifications

• Customer development: Building relationships with downstream industrial users

Implementation Timeline and Success Metrics

Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction programme follows a phased implementation approach designed to demonstrate technical feasibility whilst building toward commercial viability.

Short-Term Objectives (2025-2027)

The initial phase focuses on establishing pilot-scale operations at selected abandoned mine sites across Indiana's coal belt. These demonstration projects will test various extraction technologies under real-world conditions whilst generating data on processing costs and recovery rates.

Phase One Milestones:

• Site Selection: Identify 3-5 abandoned mine locations with optimal coal waste characteristics

• Technology Validation: Demonstrate bioleaching and ion-exchange methods at pilot scale

• Regulatory Approval: Secure necessary permits for processing operations

• Funding Security: Obtain federal grants for expanded reclamation-integrated projects

• Partnership Development: Establish relationships with downstream processing facilities

Federal funding represents a critical enabler for initial operations, with grants from the Department of Energy and Office of Surface Mining providing essential capital for pilot project development. These funding sources reduce private sector risk whilst demonstrating government commitment to domestic rare earth development.

Long-Term Vision (2028-2035)

The expansion phase envisions scaling successful pilot operations to process substantial volumes of coal waste whilst establishing Indiana as a regional centre for critical mineral processing.

Strategic Development Goals:

• Production Scaling: Process 10,000+ tons of coal waste annually across multiple facilities

• Economic Viability: Achieve cost-competitive rare earth element production through process optimisation

• Technology Transfer: Export proven extraction methodologies to other coal-producing states

• Regional Hub Development: Establish downstream processing capabilities for value-added products

Success depends on achieving cost reductions through technological improvements, scale economies, and continued integration with federally funded environmental remediation programmes. The long-term vision positions Indiana as a testing ground for technologies that could be replicated across coal-producing regions nationwide.

Investment Risk Assessment and Strategic Implications

Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction presents a complex investment proposition requiring careful evaluation of technical, economic, and strategic risk factors.

High-Risk Factors

Unproven commercial economics represent the primary investment risk, as current extraction costs exceed potential revenues at prevailing rare earth prices. The integration with federal reclamation funding provides crucial subsidies, but long-term viability requires either significant cost reductions or sustained government support.

Technology development uncertainties create additional risk as bioleaching and specialised ion-exchange processes remain largely experimental for coal waste applications. Scaling laboratory successes to industrial operations often encounters unforeseen technical challenges and cost escalations.

Regulatory approval processes for coal waste processing operations involve multiple agencies and environmental impact assessments that could delay or prevent project implementation. Changing federal priorities or reduced funding for reclamation programmes could significantly impact project economics.

Strategic Investment Advantages

Domestic supply chain security benefits provide strategic value beyond traditional financial returns. Companies and government agencies increasingly prioritise domestic rare earth sources to reduce dependence on Chinese suppliers and enhance supply chain resilience.

The environmental value proposition offers additional investment rationale through environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria that many institutional investors prioritise. Projects that simultaneously address environmental remediation and critical mineral production align with sustainable investment themes.

Technology development potential creates intellectual property and export opportunities that could generate returns beyond initial rare earth production. Successful coal waste extraction technologies could be licensed to other regions or countries facing similar challenges.

Market Psychology and Investor Positioning

Early-stage positioning allows investors to participate in potential breakthrough technologies before commercial validation reduces investment risks and returns. The federal government backing provides credibility and reduces regulatory uncertainties that typically complicate early-stage resource projects.

Investment interest should focus on companies with strong technical teams, federal funding relationships, and realistic development timelines. Speculative claims about massive resource values should be evaluated sceptically against demonstrated extraction capabilities and processing costs.

The market psychology around domestic rare earth production often involves significant hype cycles that can create investment opportunities and risks. Successful investors will distinguish between genuine technological progress and promotional claims unsupported by economic fundamentals.

Industry Context and Future Outlook

Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction initiative operates within broader industry trends toward supply chain diversification and critical mineral security. The programme's success could establish replicable models for coal-producing regions nationwide whilst advancing American strategic mineral independence.

The innovation hub potential extends beyond immediate rare earth production to encompass research and development capabilities that could benefit multiple critical mineral sectors. Universities, national laboratories, and private companies collaborating in Indiana could generate technologies applicable to other domestic mineral resources.

Global competitive positioning remains challenging given China's integrated rare earth supply chains and cost advantages. However, Indiana's programme targets specific market segments where domestic sourcing provides strategic value despite higher costs, particularly for defence and critical infrastructure applications.

The integration of environmental remediation with mineral extraction represents an innovative business model that could influence policy and investment approaches in other resource sectors. Success in Indiana could encourage similar programmes for mining waste streams containing critical minerals.

Long-Term Strategic Implications

The transformation of environmental liabilities into strategic assets aligns with broader trends in sustainable resource development and circular economy principles. Indiana's initiative demonstrates how historical industrial activities can provide feedstock for future critical mineral needs.

Federal support for coal waste rare earth extraction reflects broader policy priorities emphasising domestic critical mineral production and supply chain resilience. Continued bipartisan support for these objectives provides a favourable policy environment for programme expansion.

Technology development in Indiana could position American companies as leaders in low-grade rare earth extraction, creating export opportunities and competitive advantages in global critical mineral markets. The expertise gained from coal waste processing could apply to other unconventional rare earth sources worldwide.

Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction initiative represents a pragmatic approach to domestic critical mineral development that acknowledges economic realities whilst pursuing strategic objectives. While immediate commercial returns remain uncertain, the programme's alignment with federal priorities and environmental benefits creates a foundation for sustained development and potential breakthrough achievements in American rare earth production capabilities.

The laws are the most sweeping of their kind in the nation, and a collection of business groups argued in an emergency appeal that they violate free-speech rights.

The measures were signed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2023, and reporting requirements are expected to start early next year.

Lower courts have so far refused to block the laws, which the state says will increase transparency and encourage companies to assess how they can cut their emissions.

The Chamber of Commerce asked the justices to put the laws on hold while lawsuits continue to play out.

One requires businesses that make more than $1 billion a year and operate in California to annually report their direct and indirect carbon emissions, beginning in 2026 and 2027, respectively.

That includes planet-warming pollution from burning fossil fuels directly, as well as releases from activities such as delivering products from warehouses to stores and employee business travel. The Chamber of Commerce estimates it will affect about 5,000 companies, though state air regulators say it will apply to roughly 2,600.

The other law requires companies that make more than $500,000 a year to biennially disclose how climate change could hurt them financially. The state Air Resources Board estimates more than 4,100 companies will have to comply.

“Without this Court’s immediate intervention, California’s unconstitutional efforts to slant public debate through compelled speech will take effect and inflict irreparable harm on thousands of companies across the country,” the companies argued.

Companies that fail to publish could be subject to civil penalties. ExxonMobil also challenged the laws in a lawsuit filed last month.

The state has argued that the laws don’t violate the First Amendment because commercial speech isn’t protected the same way under the Constitution.

In 2023, Newsom called the emissions-disclosure law an important policy and of the state’s “bold responses to the climate crisis, turning information transparency into climate action.” The environmental group Ceres has said the information will help people decide whether to support the businesses.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule last year requiring some public companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, but the agency paused the regulation amid litigation.

The conservative-majority Supreme Court has cast a skeptical eye on some environmental regulations in recent years, including a landmark decision that limited the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in 2022, and another that halted the agency’s air-pollution-fighting “good neighbor” rule.

Energy efficiency can improve grid stability Expanding efficiency programs that reduce demand and improve grid stability is common sense, not partisanship.","Arizona’s technology economy is thriving, powered by innovation, growth and a shared commitment to building a more resilient future. However, this progress is now at risk.

The Arizona Corporation Commission’s ongoing effort to repeal the state’s Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff (REST) and Energy Efficiency (EE) rules threatens to undo bipartisan, pro-business energy leadership that has strengthened Arizona’s economy and increased Arizona’s grid reliability.

The ACC’s stated goal is to cut costs and preserve reliability. Repealing these standards will do the opposite. It will inject uncertainty into Arizona’s energy future, weaken the competitive advantage that clean technology brings and ultimately drive higher costs.

Adopted in 2006, the REST rules established a clear framework for utilities to gradually increase the share of electricity generated from renewable sources. The EE rules adopted in 2010 require utilities to help customers reduce energy use and peak demand through rebates and technology upgrades.

Together, these policies have been among the most successful, pro-growth energy tools Arizona has implemented. They have attracted billions in private investment, created tens of thousands of good-paying jobs and helped utilities avoid building expensive power plants, which translates into lower electric bills.

Across the state, companies are investing in advanced manufacturing and clean technology facilities that depend on affordable, reliable and increasingly renewable power. These investments have spurred job growth in both urban and rural communities, strengthened our supply chains and helped make Arizona one of the top states for clean energy manufacturing.

Energy efficiency remains the most cost-effective way to meet Arizona’s growing energy demand. According to The World Bank, for every dollar invested, consumers and businesses have seen nearly $4 in returns through lower utility bills and avoided infrastructure costs.

Energy efficiency can improve grid stability

Expanding efficiency programs that reduce demand and improve grid stability is common sense, not partisanship. Every megawatt saved through smarter energy use is a megawatt that doesn’t have to be generated, transmitted, or paid for by consumers.

Opponents of the REST and EE rules argue Arizona already has “met its goals” and utilities now voluntarily pursue clean energy targets, making the rules unnecessary. Voluntary goals can change overnight, however, and utilities may decide to walk back their clean energy commitments. Without a clear, consistent policy framework, there’s no guarantee that private investment in renewables and efficiency will continue at the pace our growing economy demands.

Some also claim the rules have “cost ratepayers billions.” That may have been true 15 years ago when early solar projects were expensive. But the point of policy is to drive progress, and it worked. Solar and wind prices have fallen by more than 80% since those early investments. Repealing the rules now would cut off the very progress that made clean energy affordable in the first place.

And while critics point to Arizona’s dust storms as proof that solar is unreliable, that’s exactly why we have a diversified energy mix. When gas or nuclear plants supplement renewables during peak demand, that’s not failure. That’s a well-designed system doing its job.

Repealing rules sends the wrong signal

The Arizona Technology Council represents more than 750 science and technology companies statewide, from innovative startups to Fortune 500 firms. Many support and depend on clean, renewable energy to power advanced manufacturing and data operations. These companies choose Arizona because our state has historically embraced an “all-of-the-above” approach: practical, balanced and forward-looking.

Repealing these rules would send the wrong signal to employers and investors at a time when other states are doubling down on clean technology and grid modernization. It would undercut Arizona’s leadership in industries like solar manufacturing, battery storage and high-tech construction, industries that bring quality jobs and long-term economic value.

The ACC should not pick winners and losers but provide stability, predictability and fairness. The REST and EE standards do exactly that.

If the ACC wants reform, let’s reform. But reform should mean modernizing standards and rules, not repealing them altogether. Let’s update the rules to reflect today’s technology and give utilities flexibility to meet them. Let’s continue to expand efficiency programs that save money and strengthen reliability. And let’s keep the policies that have made Arizona a national leader in energy innovation.

The Council urges the ACC to keep the REST and EE standards in place and build upon their proven success. Our future depends on it.

“By rescinding the 2024 rule, we are following the direction set by President Trump to unlock Alaska’s energy potential, create jobs for North Slope communities and strengthen American energy security,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement. “This action restores common-sense management and ensures responsible development benefits both Alaska and the nation.”

The action is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to “modernize resource policy in Alaska,” according to the Interior Department. In October, the department announced actions that include reopening the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas leasing and the completion of right-of-way permits for the Ambler Road project, which would provide access to an area rich in critical metals.

Other actions to increase Alaska energy production include a land exchange to facilitate the construction of a road between King Cove and the airport at Cold Bay which will convey approximately 490 acres within the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge to King Cove Corporation in exchange for 1,739 acres to be added to another part of the refuge.

Atticks also pushed back against speakers who compared the EV inspection fee to the $20 annual fee the department charges for gas pumps.
The EV charging companies point to that as evidence that the industry cannot afford additional stumbling blocks.
And, like the others, she also bemoaned the inspection cost.
We’re only, at best, a few years into any state regulating EV chargers,” Atticks said.","Key players in the electric vehicle industry said they’re concerned that state-imposed costs to fund a new charger inspection program could suppress the budding EV industry in Maryland.

At a virtual meeting Thursday, EV companies, drivers and local government officials told the Maryland Department of Agriculture that the $150-per-port fee it will levy to pay for the cost of inspections could make it too expensive for companies or others to offer EV charging.

“This feels like such a sock in the gut to me,” said Lynn Parsons, an EV driver who testified at the hearing. “I hope I’m wrong. But for someone who has struggled to find EV charging stations, this just feels like it’s going to slow down the advancement of adding additional charging stations.”

But Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks defended the testing, which will be administered by the weights and measures division that already tests gas pumps, grocery store scales and other equipment around the state for accuracy. That division relies on fees to fund its operations, he said. And state oversight is something drivers are asking for, Atticks said.

“We heard from a number of owners and drivers of EVs about the need for not only registration, but inspection — and then inspection as a prompt for remediation,” he said.

Atticks said lawmakers gave his department the authority to levy inspection fees as part of the annual Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act this year. The department prepared the regulation, passed it to the legislature’s regulations committee and then opened a 30-day public comment period — that drew zero comments.

Some speakers at Thursday’s meeting said they felt blindsided by the news of the fees, which came in late September. They argued that the regulation was quietly ushered toward the finish line, and there wasn’t an effort to solicit robust comment from the public until Thursday’s meeting — after the regulation had already taken effect, and the department heard pushback.

Maryland joins suit against Trump administration on electric vehicles

Atticks said that the department did not directly notify any stakeholders, because the law doesn’t require it. The department followed its typical procedure for rule-making, he said.

The new policy requires that all EV chargers that offer a charge in exchange for payment be registered with the state by Jan. 1, and pay the $150 fee for each port at the station. Inspectors will begin visual checks in January, Atticks said, ensuring that chargers are registered (and affixing decals confirming that) and clearly display key information like the responsible party and the method of sale.

They’ll also tag and shut down any chargers that are inoperable, said Atticks, who recounted his own misadventures driving his state-owned electric vehicle around Maryland.

“There have been numerous examples that I have experienced where getting to a charger, the charger is not working and it is not easily possible — with the device or with the app that is associated with the device — to somehow prompt that it be refreshed,” he said. “I think over time, systems upgrade to allow that. Until we’re at that point, these inspections are going to be pretty critical.”

Sometime in the spring, he said the department hopes to begin testing the charging ports for accuracy, using a roughly $135,000 piece of equipment, known as a “standard,” that will check whether chargers are accurately tabulating the amount of electricity dispensed.

The cost of the standard is just one factor that went into the department’s decision to charge $150 per port, Atticks said. The fee also needs to cover the cost of electricity for each test session, which can take up to 30 minutes per port, garage or parking lot entry fees, travel costs and the potential need for return trips if chargers are in use.

In short, “it will take a lot” to inspect the chargers, Atticks said.

In an early October letter signed by industry heavyweights, including Tesla and Rivian, the companies asked that the fee be paused, and ultimately lowered to $25 per port. They also asked to limit the total fees levied at any one location. Their letter said other states have set fees at $20-$25 per device. Connecticut charges $50 per device, and Florida $100, but Maryland would still be top of the pack.

“Maryland’s new EV charging device registration fee — the highest in the nation — will discourage EV charging deployment, will impose additional expenses on Maryland businesses, and will further hinder the state from achieving its EV adoption commitments,” the letter reads.

But Atticks said not all those states have to fund their operations through fees, as Maryland does. And some states have realized they “underestimated the amount of time and expense that it would take to accurately inspect EV chargers, and so they are going back to adjust their fees,” he said.

Atticks also pushed back against speakers who compared the EV inspection fee to the $20 annual fee the department charges for gas pumps. That fee is not per pump but per meter, he said, and with each gas pump having between four and 10 meters, the actual cost is $80-$200 per gas pump.

The new fees will leave businesses that offer EV charging with three options, according to the EV companies’ letter: Try to eat the cost, pass the cost on to customers, or cut costs by decommissioning chargers.

The changes come as the state grapples with ambitious commitments to electric vehicles — and ambitious climate goals.

Maryland is one of several states that follow California’s emissions standards, which require an increasing share of car sales be EVs, until model year 2035, when all new cars would have to be zero-emission.

But Gov. Wes Moore signed an executive order in April that allows the state to delay penalties for car manufacturers under the rule for model years 2027 and 2028. The EV charging companies point to that as evidence that the industry cannot afford additional stumbling blocks.

Moore issues executive order that could delay EV sales penalties

“The State has acknowledged the market challenges facing ZEV [zero-emission vehicle] adoption; now is not the time to impose a new annual registration fee on EV chargers that is the highest such fee in the nation,” their letter said.

Parsons and others Thursday were particularly concerned that the same fee will be levied for all types of commercial chargers, whether they are DC fast chargers at highway rest stops or slower Level 2 chargers at isolated condo or apartment complexes, which typically generate considerably less revenue.

Robert Borkowski, owner of EV charging company Plug IO, which focuses on installing chargers at multi-unit dwellings, said in an interview that many charging ports at housing complexes may not break even financially, because of the new fees.

“We do not have enough EVs to offset that cost, because right now, we are still in a very early [stage] of building out the infrastructure,” said Borkowski, who also spoke at Thursday’s meeting. “There may be not enough EVs, just even to generate the revenue to cover $150 per year.”

Others ech0ed the cost concerns. Anthony Willingham, public policy manager for charging company Electrify America, argued that the new fee structure will make it harder for his company to find welcoming sites for chargers, such as gas stations.

“It just makes the idea and the product much less attractive, especially when the registration fee is much higher than it is — or then it would be — in other jurisdictions,” Willingham said.

He said his company began installing chargers in 2017, some of which are still operational today. They are faltering not because of neglect but because of high demand, said Willingham, who compared it to :putting your dishwasher in a commercial kitchen. It’s going to struggle.”

Baltimore Gas & Electric, which operates hundreds of chargers around the state, also complained during Thursday’s meeting. Utilities are already required to report to the state’s Public Service Commission on the reliability of their chargers, and are required to maintain 97% uptime, said BGE’s Stephanie Leach. Charger shutoffs by Agriculture Department inspectors could make the PSC’s uptime standard harder to reach, she said.

And, like the others, she also bemoaned the inspection cost.

“We have over 700 chargers in the ground —public chargers and then additional multifamily chargers. So we’re talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars that will we will incur in registration fees this year,” said Leach, strategic programs manager at BGE.

Several speakers asked whether the department could cut inspection costs by inspecting less often, for example, or bypassing the expensive equipment and conducting visual inspections only.? But department staffers seemed resolute, and didn’t indicate that any changes would be made to their inspection plans.

Borkowski said he worries that condos and apartments with EV chargers that aren’t used very much will rip them out, to avoid the registration fee, or a fee for an inoperable charger. It would take a homeowners association or condo board that is “really pro EVs” to convince residents they should keep paying for costly charging stations because it’s “going to benefit you in the future,” he said.

Borkowski said he is already considering lowering the number of chargers in two upcoming projects at multi-unit complexes, because of the new fees.

Brian Booher, an EV specialist with the Montgomery County Department of Environmental Protection, agreed with Borkowski about the risk of charger shutdowns. He said the department should focus on fast-chargers being used by travelers in need of rapid power, rather than slower chargers used by building residents who are not necessarily in a rush to find a charge.

“The issues that we’ve encountered with reliability really apply and are most frustrating when we’re trying to find that fast charging — when we need power quick and it just doesn’t work,” Booher said. “The Level 2s around the county are really often there for convenience or you need them overnight.”

Atticks said concerns with multi-unit dwellings would be “one of our priorities to take back and just consider: What is the path forward?” But he also noted that other states don’t seem to differentiate between types of chargers in their programs.

“Now, look, this is new. We’re only, at best, a few years into any state regulating EV chargers,” Atticks said. “If we can be the ones to innovate and come up with the newest, best alternative, we’ll be happy to do that.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-101/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/54486116423_04fa1b1fa3_o-1024x7681763175895.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=VTVt3OFY,N,,2025-11-15 00:58:23.870440

But beneath the political disaster lies an unexpected success story: the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program forced America’s fragmented charging industry to adopt common standards that are finally making EV road trips reliable—and the program survived Trump’s inauguration day freeze attempt to become operational under his own administration.

The gap between Biden’s 2021 promise and 2025 reality gave Trump one of his most effective attack lines. At the Republican National Convention, he called the federal effort a “crazy electric Band-Aid” and claimed “They spent $9 billion on eight chargers, three of which didn’t work,” according to Politico Magazine’s deep dive into the program. The numbers were exaggerated—it was actually 15 stations at that point—but Trump had identified a genuine failure that resonated with voters frustrated by slow government action.

The Promise Versus The Reality

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg set expectations in 2021 when he predicted charging stations would appear “very quickly around the country.” Congress approved $5 billion for NEVI as part of the bipartisan infrastructure bill, with the primary goal of building a safety net of charging stations every 50 miles along major highways.

The execution proved far more complex than anyone anticipated. States struggled with Title 23 regulations—the 818-page rulebook governing federal transportation spending—while navigating Depression-era labor requirements and Biden-era Buy America mandates requiring 55% domestic content. The problem: hardly any American factories existed to produce EV chargers that could meet those standards.

Supply chain chaos compounded delays. Getting an electrical transformer for a charging station could take three years during the pandemic recovery. State departments of transportation, experts at building roads and bridges, found themselves managing technology projects involving software, payment systems, and grid connections—skills completely outside their expertise.

The Hidden Achievement No One Noticed

While NEVI failed to deliver visible charging stations, it succeeded at something more fundamental: forcing the chaotic charging industry to get its act together.

Before NEVI, America’s charging network was fragmented chaos. Companies like EV Institute in Maryland operated stations with 50-kilowatt speeds when modern EVs needed 150kW or more. Payment systems didn’t work across networks. Reliability was abysmal—Politico reporters visiting Maryland stations found multiple locations completely non-functional, with disconnected customer service numbers and graffiti-covered chargers displaying “OUT OF ORDER” signs.

NEVI’s 35,000-word guidance document established mandatory standards for reliability, interoperability, cybersecurity, and payment systems. To access billions in federal funding, charging providers had to meet these requirements. The program essentially told the industry: “You want government money? Here are the rules everyone must follow.”

The impact extended beyond NEVI-funded stations. States and utilities began adopting the federal standards as their own requirements. What started as conditions for federal funding became industry-wide best practices.

Tesla’s Network Opened Because Of NEVI Incentives

One of NEVI’s most significant but underappreciated achievements was helping push Tesla to open its Supercharger network to non-Tesla vehicles. The chance to tap NEVI funding was part of what spurred CEO Elon Musk to make the strategic shift, according to Politico’s reporting.

That decision transformed the competitive landscape. As EVXL documented in June 2025, Tesla’s Supercharger network dwarfs competitors like Electrify America, particularly along key routes. Tesla operates approximately 73,000 Supercharger stalls globally, and the network processed roughly 587,000 charging sessions per day during 2025.

The reliability gap remains stark. J.D. Power reported in May 2025 that public EV charger reliability hit 84% success rate—a notable improvement from 80% in 2021, but still highlighting the work remaining for non-Tesla networks.

Trump Tried To Kill It But Couldn’t

On inauguration day, Trump announced he would freeze NEVI along with numerous other Biden programs. But Democrats had written the program into law with such specific detail and embedded it so deeply into core federal highway spending that Trump found little room to maneuver.

The program not only survived a court challenge but was reluctantly adopted by the administration. While Trump relaxed some of the most burdensome requirements, the core mission of constructing a federal charging network endured, shielded by layers of Democratic legalisms and technicalities.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced in summer 2025 that the administration would reopen funding, saying “While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently.”

Duffy threw out Biden’s 35,000-word guidance document and replaced it with a brief 2,500-word version “to allow states to actually build EV chargers.” Gone were strict spacing requirements and detailed federal oversight. States gained flexibility to declare when their networks were finished.

Some EV advocates who typically opposed Trump policies found themselves praising the changes. The Electrification Coalition said it “appreciate[d] the Department’s efforts to streamline the program.”

Stations Finally Coming Online Under Trump’s Watch

With regulatory burdens reduced and states now experienced with the process, NEVI is hitting its stride. State transportation departments have wrapped their heads around charging infrastructure. Money is flowing and thousands of stations are under construction.

Analysts expect thousands of NEVI-funded chargers may be online by 2027 or 2028—exactly when the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation predicted back in 2022, though that timeline offered no political benefit to Biden.

Maryland officials say their first wave of 22 stations will be online by late 2026. Across the country, privately funded charging plazas are being built near highways without any federal assistance, suggesting NEVI’s standards have helped create conditions for market-driven expansion.

Andrew Dick of Electrify America told Politico that NEVI created “a level of consistency and cohesion that didn’t exist before,” noting that the federal rules became adopted as standard industry practice even beyond NEVI-funded projects.

EVXL’s Take

This story perfectly encapsulates the subsidy-dependent dysfunction we’ve been documenting across the EV industry. Biden’s NEVI program failed spectacularly at its visible mission—building charging stations—while succeeding at the invisible work of forcing industry standards. Then Trump killed it on principle but was forced to resurrect it because Democrats had made it legally unkillable.

The irony runs deep. Back in August 2024, we covered Trump’s wildly exaggerated claims about NEVI, noting his “$9 billion for 8 chargers” line was hyperbole but pointed to genuine failure. Now those same charging stations are being built under Trump’s relaxed rules, and he’ll likely take credit for “fixing” a program he tried to eliminate.

Here’s what nobody wants to admit: the charging infrastructure problem was always solvable through market forces if government would just get out of the way. Tesla proved this by building the world’s most reliable charging network without federal handouts. The company operates 73,000 Supercharger stalls globally that actually work, process 587,000 sessions daily, and recently opened real-time availability data to Google Maps for all EV drivers.

Meanwhile, NEVI spent four years navigating Title 23 regulations, Buy America requirements, and state bureaucracy to build 25 locations. The program’s real achievement—forcing reliability standards—could have been accomplished through simple federal mandates rather than a $5 billion spending program.

But let’s connect this to the broader collapse we’re witnessing. NEVI’s slow rollout occurred during the exact period when federal EV subsidies were propping up demand. Now that the $7,500 tax credit expired on September 30, 2025, we’re seeing the real market. As we reported last week, U.S. vehicle sales cratered in October with EV sales plunging 24% in a single month.

The timing matters. All those battery plants we documented sitting idle? The $28 billion Battery Belt collapse? That’s happening simultaneously with charging infrastructure finally coming online. We’re building the roads after the gold rush ended.

NEVI will ultimately deliver thousands of charging stations using taxpayer money to solve a problem Tesla already solved profitably. The program survived not because it was good policy, but because Democrats buried it so deep in federal spending that even a hostile administration couldn’t extract it without Congressional action. That’s not evidence of smart governance—it’s evidence of how hard it is to kill bad programs once they’re embedded in the bureaucracy.

The real lesson here isn’t about charging infrastructure. It’s about the dangers of building entire industries on government subsidies rather than actual consumer demand. When the subsidies end, demand collapses, and you’re left with empty battery plants and charging stations that finally work but serve a market that no longer exists at scale.

This week, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it has awarded Texas with Class VI primacy, officially erasing Louisiana’s head start.

While we no longer have the lead, the game is not over. Companies are deciding, right now, whether it is better to do business in Louisiana or Texas. They are looking at regulatory uncertainty, the influence of antibusiness trial attorneys, and the hesitancy of a state to seize clear opportunities.

Wright says the Trump administration is seeking to build small, modular reactors — a new, and cheaper alternative, though one that hasn’t been demonstrated.

These data centers, along with electric cars and an increase in U.S. manufacturing, will sharply raise demand for energy, according to Berkeley Lab reports.

But is nuclear a viable option?

“This is an industry that boomed from the mid-‘50s to the late ‘70s,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who also delivered the keynote address at this year’s American Nuclear Society conference in D.C.

Nuclear energy infrastructure, however, has slowed in recent decades. The average age of a nuclear power plant in the United States is 41 years old.

Wright says the Trump administration is seeking to build small, modular reactors — a new, and cheaper alternative, though one that hasn’t been demonstrated.

“President Trump’s bold objective was to get multiple reactors running before our 250th anniversary [on] July 4 next year,” he said. “I think we’ll get one or two under that deadline.”

The timeline also took a hit during the government shutdown, as the agencies assigned to oversee the projects were shut down. Nuclear regulators were furloughed; the Department of Energy also furloughed 80% of the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the country’s nuclear stockpile.

That latter group, from the NNSA, had never before been furloughed, even amid a shutdown. This unprecedented move was blasted by Democratic lawmakers, but Wright claims it was somewhat necessary due to the length of the shutdown.

“We’ve never had a shutdown so long. That is the longest government shutdown in history,” Wright said.

Trump, too, had recently raised concerns that the U.S. would be resuming nuclear weapons testing after more than 30 years, indicating as much in an interview with “60 Minutes” amid the shutdown.

Wright, however, said that would not be the case.

“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests. These are not nuclear explosions,” Wright claimed in a Fox News interview over the weekend.",https://www.cbs17.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2025/11/NuclearWDCWNexstar.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-15 03:00:09.892150

The Invest in African Energy (IAE) Forum, scheduled for March 30-April 1, 2026 in Paris, provides such a platform, bridging the gap between ambition and execution.
Discussions at COP30 have reinforced Africa’s dual imperative: expand universal energy access while building resilient, low-carbon systems.","The first days of COP30 in Belém have underscored Africa’s urgent energy needs, with leaders emphasizing that closing the continent’s energy-access gap is critical for both development and climate resilience. More than 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa remain without electricity, while UNEP estimates suggest that developing nations will need more than $310 billion annually by 2035 to adapt to climate-related impacts. COP30 participants have stressed that achieving energy access requires not only pledges but substantial, targeted capital and robust partnerships.

Among the first signals from the summit, major multilateral development banks (MDBs) reaffirmed their commitment to accelerate and scale support for African countries through adaptation and resilience finance. While MDBs delivered a record $137 billion in climate finance last year, nearly 40% went to high-income countries and only about 30% to adaptation projects. Meanwhile, the African Development Bank has unveiled a suite of climate-finance tools to help nations transition to low-carbon economies and access large-scale funding, reflecting a growing emphasis on structured, bankable projects in Africa. These early actions highlight a central challenge: while adaptation, renewable energy and energy-access projects are critical, they often remain less attractive to private capital, slowing deployment where it is needed most.

Against this backdrop, COP30 has highlighted priorities for Africa’s energy investment, including decentralized renewable energy systems, storage-enabled solutions, resilient grid infrastructure and integration with local industrial and social development objectives. Early initiatives at the summit – particularly those linking energy access with smallholder agriculture and social protection – underscore the importance of projects that simultaneously address climate, energy and socioeconomic goals. At the “Africa Day” dialogue, ministers and development institutions emphasized the need to mobilize financing for renewable energy, infrastructure and climate-resilient solutions, while noting that many existing mechanisms remain insufficiently attractive to private investors, limiting project scale and impact. Notably, the launch of the Climate‑Resilient Social Protection and Smallholder Agriculture Finance Partnership, endorsed by 44 countries, highlighted the interconnected nature of climate action, energy access and poverty reduction. The implication for energy investment is clear: integrated models combining decentralized renewables, storage, agro-industrial linkages and local services are likely to deliver the greatest impact.

These insights from COP30 underscore the need for forums that translate priorities into actionable investment opportunities. The Invest in African Energy (IAE) Forum, scheduled for March 30-April 1, 2026 in Paris, provides such a platform, bridging the gap between ambition and execution. While COP30 highlights why Africa needs urgent investment – the scale of the challenge and the imperative for resilient, inclusive projects – the IAE Forum demonstrates how stakeholders can convert these insights into pipeline-ready opportunities. It brings together African governments, investors, development institutions and private sector actors to explore financing models, risk-mitigation structures and deal flow that support both energy access and climate objectives.

Discussions at COP30 have reinforced Africa’s dual imperative: expand universal energy access while building resilient, low-carbon systems. IAE 2026 facilitates this by connecting global investors with locally relevant opportunities – ranging from mini-grid and off-grid solutions to renewable generation, energy storage and local manufacturing of clean energy components. By highlighting replicable models and practical pathways to scale, the Forum bridges policy commitments and investment delivery, ensuring financing structures, instruments and partnerships translate ambition into measurable impact across sub-Saharan Africa.",https://aecweeks3.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/14133351/cop30-image.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 05:58:09.433971

The announcement came Friday during a community event in Midlothian attended by federal, state and local leaders. The investment — Google’s largest in any state — includes a new data center campus in Armstrong County, two in Haskell County, and continued buildout of the company’s Ellis County facilities and Dallas cloud region.

“This is a Texas-sized investment in the future of our great state,” Gov. Greg Abbott said.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai said Texas has become a key location for next-generation computing. “Texas offers the right combination of energy, workforce and innovation,” Pichai said. “This investment will bring new data center campuses online, support thousands of jobs and help power the next era of AI development.”

Rural counties shift into the tech spotlight

The Panhandle and West Texas campuses bring major technology investment to rural areas traditionally known for agriculture and energy. Local leaders said the projects will diversify their economies and provide long-term jobs.

Armstrong County Judge Adam Ensey called Google’s investment “a generational opportunity” that places the region at the edge of the global digital economy. Haskell County Judge Kenny Thompson said the new campuses will strengthen infrastructure and create “top-tier employment opportunities” for residents.

Google is joining a growing cluster of high-density computing projects in the region.

Armstrong County commissioners recently approved an amendment to Crusoe Energy’s tax abatement agreement for a 3.5 million-square-foot AI data center complex south of Claude. Four buildings are currently under construction off Lima Road east of Highway 207 and could be completed within two years, according to company spokesman Tyler Hunt. Under the revised abatement, the county will receive $1.35 million per building per year, once each becomes operational, which could produce earlier revenue for the county beginning in 2026. Hunt said at the time that the company was negotiating with a tenant but did not yet have a final commitment.

Judge Ensey said the Crusoe structure benefits the county by tying payments to individual buildings as they come online rather than waiting for multiple phases to be completed. He also noted Armstrong County officials are tracking other regional developments, including Fermi America’s proposed 18 million-square-foot AI data center and energy campus in neighboring Carson County.

Part of a statewide data center boom

Texas has seen rapid growth in hyperscale data centers as companies seek land, renewable energy and access to the ERCOT grid. Google recently opened the first building at its Red Oak campus in Ellis County and continues expanding its Midlothian site and Dallas cloud region — part of the company’s global network of 42 cloud regions.

Deputy Secretary of Energy James Danly said the projects reflect the United States’ effort to strengthen its position in artificial intelligence. “This investment strengthens America’s AI competitiveness while helping keep energy reliable and affordable,” Danly said.

Energy planners say the rapid expansion of AI infrastructure is expected to increase statewide power demand, prompting closer coordination between developers and ERCOT.

State leaders, including Sen. John Cornyn, said the expansion will support national competitiveness in AI and cybersecurity.

Energy plans shaped around high-power AI needs

Google outlined several energy commitments to support the electricity demands of AI computing:

More than 6,200 megawatts of new energy generation and capacity through power purchase agreements with developers including AES, Enel, Clearway and Ørsted.

A co-located solar and battery storage project at one of the Haskell County campuses, developed with Intersect Power and TPG Rise Climate, designed to align on-site clean energy with heavy compute loads.

A $30 million Energy Impact Fund, beginning in 2026, to support local weatherization, energy efficiency upgrades and workforce development.

Company officials said pairing energy supply with data center load can reduce transmission strain and improve long-term grid planning.

Water and environmental commitments

Google said its new Texas campuses will use advanced air-cooling systems that significantly reduce water use, limiting consumption to non-computing needs such as kitchens and employee facilities.

The company also announced:

$2.6 million to Texas Water Trade to restore up to 1,000 acres of wetlands in the Trinity–San Jacinto Estuary, delivering about 300 million gallons of freshwater annually.

More than $2 million for agricultural programs, including regenerative farming efforts in North Texas and irrigation-efficiency projects in the High Plains.

Preparing Texas workers for AI-era jobs

To meet rising demand for electricians and data center technicians, Google partnered with the electrical training ALLIANCE to train more than 1,700 apprentices by 2030, supported by Google.org’s AI Opportunity Fund.

The company also committed $7 million for AI-related initiatives in healthcare, energy and education. Funding includes support for rural health outreach through CareMessage, energy research at the University of Texas and Texas Tech University, and AI-skills programs at Houston Community College.

Colleges across the state — including UT, Texas A&M, Texas State, Dallas College and South Texas College — are part of Google’s AI for Education Accelerator, which provides free AI training and career certificates to students and faculty.

Texas’ digital landscape continues to shift

Local officials said Google’s expansion — combined with active construction by Crusoe Energy in Armstrong County and the proposed Fermi America project in Carson County — reflects how the Panhandle and West Texas are becoming a significant cluster for AI and cloud-computing infrastructure.

And PM2.5 isn’t the only pollutant associated with coal power plants.
Robust data shows that people living near coal power plants face higher rates of hospitalization, chronic lung disease, and premature deaths.
Fortunately, as coal plants have shuttered, researchers have noted a decrease in associated mortality rates, meaning these deaths can be prevented.
Beyond the health burdens, economic costs and legal concerns around the order, Campbell is also inefficient.","Joining a slew of retired coal power plants in the state, the JH Campbell Generating Plant’s planned closure in West Olive was meant to signal the beginning of a new era — one where our energy needs can be met by cleaner, more sustainable means.

But just a week before Campbell was supposed to power down, the US Department of Energy issued an emergency order on May 23 to Consumers Energy to keep the plant online. With another extension on the horizon, it’s unclear how long the Campbell plant will be caught in limbo.

As long as Campbell and other coal-fired power plants keep polluting the air, Michiganders will continue to suffer immediate and long-term health consequences.

Most coverage has focused on the financial cost to ratepayers — including more than $80 million Consumers spent to keep Campbell running from May to September. But the human toll of coal is beyond economic comprehension, contributing to overburdened health care systems, sick children, and preventable, premature deaths.

Representing more than 400 Michigan health professionals, we at the Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action (MiCCA) know from a vast body of literature that coal-burning power plants are a major source of fine particulate matter air pollution.

Airborne particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter — known as PM2.5 — are imperceptible to the human eye. The smaller the particles, the greater the health risk, as they can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream. PM2.5 exposure is linked to a myriad of respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological issues.

Many industrial activities emit PM2.5, including vehicle tailpipe emissions and the combustion of oil and natural gas. These sources are a significant concern for clinicians in our network, but coal pollution is especially harmful to public health.

In a 2023 study published in Science, researchers found that PM2.5 from coal was associated with a 2.1-times greater risk of death than other sources of air pollution. Using emissions and Medicare data, the study’s authors also found that 460,000 deaths in the US were attributable to coal-related PM2.5 from 1999 to 2020.

And PM2.5 isn’t the only pollutant associated with coal power plants. Nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and heavy metals like mercury, lead and arsenic are all linked to coal-fired generation.

Robust data shows that people living near coal power plants face higher rates of hospitalization, chronic lung disease, and premature deaths. Pregnant women are more likely to experience adverse birth outcomes such as low birthweight, and research suggests that exposure to coal ash can harm children’s cognitive development.

Fortunately, as coal plants have shuttered, researchers have noted a decrease in associated mortality rates, meaning these deaths can be prevented. Trips to the emergency department and hospitalizations for lung-related causes have dropped, too.

The misguided order to keep Campbell operational also comes amid a number of proposed federal rollbacks that would weaken regulations on several public health measures, including the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, which limit emissions of hazardous pollutants from power plants.

Beyond the health burdens, economic costs and legal concerns around the order, Campbell is also inefficient. In legal filings challenging the order, environmental groups detailed how even during the summer’s highest demand day, the regional grid operator had a surplus of energy.

Actions that rescind environmental protections and force the continued operation of dirty coal are shortsighted and threaten to reverse decades of public health progress.

As health professionals, we cannot understate the importance of having affordable and reliable energy. But there is no evidence-based justification for prolonging a technology that is no longer necessary to meet our energy needs and causes undue harm to our most vulnerable communities.

We hope Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel will continue to fight this irrational order, and we call on the US Department of Energy to end this political theater and leave coal in the 20th century, where it belongs.

Saudi Aramco is shaking up the global gas market, locking in long-term US LNG supply agreements and a multibillion-dollar stake in a Louisiana project as Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince heads to Washington.

What does this mean?

Long dominant in oil, Saudi Aramco is now pivoting heavily into liquefied natural gas. The company is set to acquire a stake in Woodside Energy’s $17.5 billion Louisiana LNG facility, securing up to 2 million tons of LNG annually. It’s also in talks for another 2 million tons each year from Commonwealth LNG’s proposed Cameron, Louisiana plant. With these deals, Aramco aims to multiply its global LNG footprint from 4.5 million tons currently under development to a target of 20 million tons per year. While none of the companies have issued official statements, this aggressive push reflects rising LNG demand worldwide—especially in Asia and Europe—as buyers look for stable supply and US exports become more dominant.

Why should I care?

For markets: The US steps into the LNG driver’s seat.

With the US on course to claim the global top spot for LNG exports, these massive deals put Louisiana center stage for the industry’s expansion. The billions flowing into Woodside’s project alone show strong conviction in higher long-term demand, while major players jockey for a secure foothold in the evolving LNG landscape. Investors will be watching how these moves influence LNG prices, trade patterns, and corporate strategies as the sector heats up.

Budget 2025, p 347.
Budget 2025, p 351.
Budget 2025, p 349.","On November 4, 2025 (""Budget Day 25"") the Federal Government tabled Budget 2025.1 As part of Budget 2025, the Government introduced several tax measures, including proposed amendments to the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the ""Tax Act""), aimed at maintaining Canada's role as a global leader in the critical minerals space and continuing its journey to a net-zero economy. These measures are summarized below.

Extension of Mineral Exploration Tax Credit

Budget 2025 confirms the Government's intention, originally announced on March 3, 2025, to extend availability of the 15% mineral exploration tax credit (the ""METC"") available to subscribers of flow-through shares in resource issuers undertaking certain grassroots exploration activities.2 Under the current legislation, the METC would not apply to flow-through share agreements entered into after March 31, 2025, so confirmation that the Government intends to proceed with the extension, as previously announced, is welcome.

Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit

The Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit (""CMETC"") is a 30% tax credit available to investors who subscribe for flow-through shares in mining companies that explore for certain critical minerals. The list of eligible critical minerals currently includes copper, nickel, lithium (including lithium from brines), cobalt, graphite, rare earth elements, scandium, titanium, gallium, vanadium, tellurium, magnesium, zinc, platinum group metals, and uranium.

Budget 2025 proposes that the list of eligible critical minerals be expanded to include bismuth, cesium, chromium, fluorspar, germanium, indium, manganese, molybdenum, niobium, tantalum, tin, and tungsten.3 The proposed expansion of the eligible critical minerals list would apply to investments in flow-through shares issued under agreements entered into after Budget Day 25 and on or before March 31, 2027.4

Canadian Exploration Expense

Canada's flow-through share regime generally permits principal business corporations to renounce to subscribers of flow-through shares certain qualified expenditures incurred in the exploration phase of a mineral project's life. Expenditures capable of such renunciation must constitute ""Canadian exploration expenses"" (""CEE"") as defined in the Tax Act, and generally constitute expenses incurred for the purpose of determining the existence, location, extent or quality of a mineral resource in Canada.

Budget 2025 proposes to amend the definition of CEE to clarify that expenses related to determining economic viability or engineering feasibility of a mineral resource do not constitute CEE and are therefore not capable of renunciation pursuant to a flow-through share agreement.5 This amendment is effective as of Budget Day 25.

Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit

The Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (""CE ITC""), which is a 15% refundable tax credit (reduced to 5% in certain circumstances) in respect of the capital cost of eligible property and equipment used in the generation, storage and transmission of electricity, was first proposed in Budget 2023. Budget 2024 contained further details regarding the design and implementation of the program, proposed to be available in respect of new (i.e., not previously used) eligible property and equipment acquired and available for use on or after April 16, 2024 and before 2035, but the program has not yet been enacted. Budget 2024 restricted availability of the CE ITC to Canadian corporations, certain provincial and territorial Crown corporations, corporations owned by municipalities, corporations owned by Indigenous communities, pension investment corporations, and certain tax-exempt Canadian corporations.

Budget 2025 proposes that the Canada Growth Fund be expressly included as an entity eligible for the CE ITC, effective as of Budget Day 25.6 Additionally, recognizing that the Canada Growth Fund may act as an investor in other eligible entities, Budget 2025 proposes that financing provided by the Canada Growth Fund would not reduce an eligible entity's cost of property for purposes of computing entitlement to the CE ITC.7

Clean Technology Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit

The Clean Technology Manufacturing investment tax credit (""CTM ITC)"" is a 30% refundable tax credit in respect of the capital cost of eligible property and equipment used in the manufacture of renewable energy equipment (e.g., equipment used to manufacture solar, wind, water or geothermal equipment) or the extraction and processing of certain critical minerals (lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, rare earth elements and graphite).

Budget 2025 proposes to expand eligibility for the CTM ITC to support polymetallic extraction and processing by adding to the list of eligible critical minerals the following: antimony, gallium, germanium, indium and scandium.8 The expanded list will apply in respect of property that is acquired and becomes available for use on or after Budget Day 25.

Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage Investment Tax Credit

The carbon capture, utilization and storage investment tax credit (""CCUS ITC"") is a refundable tax credit in respect of the capital cost of certain eligible equipment utilized in the capture, utilization and storage of carbon. The rate of the credit ranges from 37.5% to 60% depending on the particular use of the eligible equipment. Under the current legislation, the CCUS ITC is available in respect of expenditures incurred prior to 2041, but the applicable rate of the CCUS ITC gradually decreases between 2031 and the end of 2040.

Budget 2025 proposes to delay the onset of reduced credit rates by five years such that the current full rates will apply to expenditures until the end of 2035 and the reduced rates would begin to take effect thereafter.9

Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I) held a press call this morning from Belém, where he is serving as the entirety of the U.S. Congressional delegation. In his opening remarks, the Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee outlined four key messages that will guide his engagement at COP. First, he said that the Trump Administration represents the will of the fossil fuel industry rather than the will of the American people on climate issues. Second, the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is our last “lifeboat” for climate safety. Third, economic shocks of the climate crisis are occurring, including an insurance crisis that is spreading across the U.S. And finally, the fossil fuel industry is the villain in this story of climate action.

EESI Article: “Trade in the Age of Climate Change: The Role of a U.S. Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism”

Shipshow: Sen. Whitehouse said that one goal for his engagement at COP30 will be protecting CBAM from what happened to the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s) Net-Zero Framework—a U.S.-led campaign that paused the process for a year, which Whitehouse described as a “thuggish battering.” The internationally-supported landmark IMO proposal would establish a marine fuel standard and impose an emissions fee on the global shipping industry.

EESI Briefing: International Trade and Climate Policy

We Cannot Afford Fossil Fuels: Sen. Whitehouse was also asked if he agrees with Bill Gates’s controversial memo, which urged the climate community to shift its focus from rising temperatures to poverty and disease. Contrasting Gates, he instead proposed a new approach that connects fossil fuel “mischief” to the affordability crisis facing American consumers. Sen. Whitehouse added that innovation will never solve the climate crisis so long as the government continues to subsidize the fossil fuel industry.

EESI Fact Sheet: Proposals to Reduce Fossil Fuel Subsidies

Polluter Presence: Kick Big Polluters Out, a global network of more than 450 organizations, reported that more than 1,600 fossil fuel lobbyists are present at COP30. This is the largest proportion—one in every 25 attendees in Belém—in UNFCCC history. COP30 is also operating under new rules dictating that nongovernment observers must disclose their funding sources and institutional ties. However, this rule does not apply to government delegations, which account for 160 of the 1,600 lobbyists. Larry Rousseau of the Canadian Labour Congress remarked that “this is not what meaningful participation looks like .… If we are serious about an ‘implementation COP,’ if we are serious about the Paris Agreement, we must be serious about protecting these negotiations from the vested interests that profit from delay.”

Drivers of Change: A new declaration on transportation decarbonization and resilience responds to a lack of specific global action on transportation emissions and calls for a shared framework with measurable goals and indicators to monitor progress. It also calls for a “just, inclusive, and tailored” transition; accordingly, the contributions of each participating country will be commensurate with the “differing capacities and realities” of developing countries. The declaration, co-led by Chile and Brazil, has so far been signed by Austria, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain. At a press event for the declaration, one Chilean transportation minister touted an 8.5% improvement in efficiency standards for light-duty vehicles, and success in deploying 4,400 electric buses in Santiago. Meanwhile, a representative from the Dominican Republic reported success in meeting the country’s 2020 NDC to build out its capital’s metro system.

Resilience Stats: Race to Resilience, an initiative of the High-level Climate Champions, released its 2025 progress report. During his opening remarks, Chile’s COP25 High-Level Champion Gonzalo Muñoz highlighted the initiative’s accomplishments: 437 million people have been touched by resilience work, 18.4 million hectares of ecosystems in 78 countries have been conserved, and $4.2 billion in adaptation finance has been deployed. Muñoz underscored that the insurance sector has immense ability to accelerate progress. “Insurance companies know that they need to provide new conditions for business to thrive and for governments to be more stable … Race to Resilience can provide the link of the insurance sector to all of the other sectors of the economy to generate the conditions that we require for being resilient.”

Women Leading Towards a Net-Zero Future: A session at the We Don’t Have Time studio highlighted inclusive leadership by women who are shaping business and climate policy. We Mean Business Coalition CEO María Mendiluce shared that moving to net zero is not easy, but that when women take the lead on climate, positive change happens through collaboration. “Change is not linear, it’s exponential,” she said. Kerry Constabile, director of decarbonization strategy at Amazon, added that successful business strategies for net zero should focus on collective action over silos or competition. For women leaders specifically, Constabile highlighted the importance of mentorship.

A Win-Win-Win for Climate, Health, and Justice: A UNFCCC side event hosted by the World Health Organization and the United Nations University spotlighted the intersectional approach to climate, health, and justice through the lens of two major breakthroughs: the Belém Health Action Plan, which was released yesterday, and the International Court of Justice’s July decision that states are obligated to protect people from climate harm. This event also featured the release of two special reports supporting the Belém Health Action Plan: one that compiles evidence underpinning the plan, and another that offers guidance on social participation to strengthen the plan’s implementation.

Data Center Discourse: A press conference held by the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) focused on artificial intelligence data center infrastructure and the associated climate costs. Jean Su, director of the CBD Energy Justice Program, pointed out that the U.S. consumes more energy from data centers than anywhere else in the world, with dangerous consequences for environmental justice. Speaking on the situation in Brazil, Cynthia Picolo from the Laboratory of Public Policy and Internet shared that the country’s policy framework has been designed to streamline data center development without public input or socio-environmental considerations. Su and her fellow panelists proposed guardrails through the UNFCCC, such as the disclosure of national data center emissions in future NDCs.

City staff briefed the committee on recent federal policy changes that narrow funding and regulatory tools local governments expected to use for climate and electrification work. ""The scaling back of clean energy and electrification incentives was a major shift,"" a staff presenter said, listing reduced production and investment tax credits, cuts to consumer rebates and termination of programs such as the EPA’s Solar for All.

Members and staff discussed how those federal shifts translate to state and local effects. An attendee from the state energy forum reported that the Oregon 'homes' electrification programs remain funded and are moving toward a 2026 implementation timeline, but several Inflation Reduction Act and competitive grant opportunities have largely been exhausted. ""Those funds were already allocated,"" a participant said of state-level programs obligated to proceed.

Committee members flagged administrative actions that could also affect local work, including proposed changes to the EPA endangerment finding and revocation of the Clean Air Act waiver that underpins stricter state vehicle standards. Staff noted the City of Bend filed public comments opposing any rescission of the endangerment finding.

Discussion covered strategic responses: members suggested building coalitions with other cities, targeted advocacy to protect obligated programs, and profiling local infrastructure projects (for example, wastewater treatment upgrades linked to climate-driven costs) to communicate state and federal impacts to elected officials.

Next steps: the committee and staff will monitor federal and state program rollouts, continue coalition participation, and identify policy and funding opportunities to prioritize under a tighter resource environment.

Energy Transfer Investment Narrative Recap

To be a shareholder in Energy Transfer, you need to believe in a world where natural gas remains a vital bridge fuel for power generation and data infrastructure, underpinned by long-term contracts with top-tier customers. The recently announced 20-year agreement with Entergy Louisiana reinforces Energy Transfer's ties to fast-growing digital demand but does not materially alter the most immediate catalyst: the successful delivery and ramp-up of large-capacity pipeline projects, nor does it offset the core risk of execution delays and volume shortfalls in key basins.

Recent news about the new Midland Basin processing plant, expected online in late 2026, stands out as directly relevant. This facility complements the long-haul transportation commitments and supports Energy Transfer’s push to reliably meet the surging demand for natural gas tied to both new power plants and hyperscale data center clients, reinforcing near-term growth catalysts while putting additional pressure on execution. The real challenge, however, is the risk of construction delays or cost overruns, which investors should be aware of because...

Energy Transfer's outlook anticipates $99.8 billion in revenue and $6.7 billion in earnings by 2028. Achieving this requires annual revenue growth of 7.4% and a $2.2 billion increase in earnings from the current $4.5 billion.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Chamber of Commerce asked the Supreme Court on Friday to pause new California laws expected to require thousands of companies to report emissions and climate-risk information.

The laws are the most sweeping of their kind in the nation, and a collection of business groups argued in an emergency appeal that they violate free-speech rights.

The measures were signed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2023, and reporting requirements are expected to start early next year.

Lower courts have so far refused to block the laws, which the state says will increase transparency and encourage companies to assess how they can cut their emissions.

The Chamber of Commerce asked the justices to put the laws on hold while lawsuits continue to play out.

One requires businesses that make more than $1 billion a year and operate in California to annually report their direct and indirect carbon emissions, beginning in 2026 and 2027, respectively.

That includes planet-warming pollution from burning fossil fuels directly, as well as releases from activities such as delivering products from warehouses to stores and employee business travel. The Chamber of Commerce estimates it will affect about 5,000 companies, though state air regulators say it will apply to roughly 2,600.

The other law requires companies that make more than $500,000 a year to biennially disclose how climate change could hurt them financially. The state Air Resources Board estimates more than 4,100 companies will have to comply.

“Without this Court’s immediate intervention, California’s unconstitutional efforts to slant public debate through compelled speech will take effect and inflict irreparable harm on thousands of companies across the country,” the companies argued.

Companies that fail to publish could be subject to civil penalties. ExxonMobil also challenged the laws in a lawsuit filed last month.

The state has argued that the laws don’t violate the First Amendment because commercial speech isn’t protected the same way under the Constitution.

In 2023, Newsom called the emissions-disclosure law an important policy and of the state’s “bold responses to the climate crisis, turning information transparency into climate action.” The environmental group Ceres has said the information will help people decide whether to support the businesses.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule last year requiring some public companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, but the agency paused the regulation amid litigation.

The conservative-majority Supreme Court has cast a skeptical eye on some environmental regulations in recent years, including a landmark decision that limited the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in 2022, and another that halted the agency’s air-pollution-fighting “good neighbor” rule.

These data centers, along with electric cars and an increase in U.S. manufacturing, will sharply raise demand for energy, according to Berkeley Lab reports.

But is nuclear a viable option?

“This is an industry that boomed from the mid-‘50s to the late ‘70s,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who also delivered the keynote address at this year’s American Nuclear Society conference in D.C.

Nuclear energy infrastructure, however, has slowed in recent decades. The average age of a nuclear power plant in the United States is 41 years old.

Wright says the Trump administration is seeking to build small, modular reactors — a new, and cheaper alternative, though one that hasn’t been demonstrated.

“President Trump’s bold objective was to get multiple reactors running before our 250th anniversary [on] July 4 next year,” he said. “I think we’ll get one or two under that deadline.”

The timeline also took a hit during the government shutdown, as the agencies assigned to oversee the projects were shut down. Nuclear regulators were furloughed; the Department of Energy also furloughed 80% of the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the country’s nuclear stockpile.

That latter group, from the NNSA, had never before been furloughed, even amid a shutdown. This unprecedented move was blasted by Democratic lawmakers, but Wright claims it was somewhat necessary due to the length of the shutdown.

“We’ve never had a shutdown so long. That is the longest government shutdown in history,” Wright said.

Trump, too, had recently raised concerns that the U.S. would be resuming nuclear weapons testing after more than 30 years, indicating as much in an interview with “60 Minutes” amid the shutdown.

Wright, however, said that would not be the case.

“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests. These are not nuclear explosions,” Wright claimed in a Fox News interview over the weekend.",https://www.wbtw.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2025/11/NuclearWDCWNexstar.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-15 03:58:22.152144

THE DETAILS

Kimmeridge owned 5.66 million shares in Devon as of the end of September, the filing said. That would equate to an approximately 0.9% stake in Devon, according to Reuters calculations, and make it Devon’s 14th-largest shareholder, according to data provider LSEG. Devon shares fell 1% in the opening 30 minutes of trading on Friday, amid a broader market sell-off, giving the company a market value of around $22 billion.

The 13F filing from Kimmeridge did not detail anything beyond the number of shares held at the end of the third quarter, and whether Kimmeridge has since increased or decreased its position. The filing came at the deadline for investment firms to reveal their holdings in public companies as of September 30.

When approached by Reuters, Kimmeridge declined comment. Devon did not respond to a comment request.

THE PLAYERS

Oklahoma City-based Devon is one of the larger independent U.S. shale producers, with operations in multiple formations including the Delaware portion of the Permian basin covering Texas and New Mexico, the Eagle Ford of South Texas and Oklahoma’s Anadarko basin.

The company’s shares have gained 4% year to date, in line with the performance of the S&P Energy index.

Among the best-known activists within the oil and gas industry, Kimmeridge has in recent years pushed energy companies for better governance practices, prioritizing shareholder returns over expansive drilling programs, and consolidation to achieve economies of scale. Kimmeridge said on November 4 it owned a stake in Devon peer Coterra Energy, and was pushing for leadership changes and the sale of its Appalachia and Oklahoma operations to focus on Coterra’s Delaware basin holding.

Texas and California In other states, however, the relationship between rising electricity prices and data centers is less clear.
California, meanwhile, has the third most data centers in the nation and the second highest residential electricity prices, nearly 80% above the national average.","Electricity prices are surging, voters are growing angry, and the artificial intelligence industry's data centers are increasingly a target for blame with U.S. mid-term elections on the horizon.

Residential utility bills rose 6% on average nationwide in August compared with the same period in the previous year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The reasons for price increases are often complex and vary by region. But in at least three states with high concentrations of data centers, electric bills climbed much faster than the national average during that period. Prices, for example, surged by 13% in Virginia, 16% in Illinois and 12% in Ohio.

The tech companies and AI labs are building data centers that consume a gigawatt or more of electricity in some cases, equivalent to more than 800,000 homes, the size of a city essentially.

Virginia has the highest concentration of data centers in the world. Democrat Abigail Spanberger won the state's recent governor's race in a landslide by campaigning on cost of living. Spanberger put at least part of the blame for rising electricity prices on data centers, promising to make tech companies ""pay their own way and their fair share"" of the escalating costs.

The governor's race could be a harbinger of political headwinds for the AI industry's data center buildout with the mid-term elections just a year away and Democrats zeroing in on affordability as their central issue. In Washington, some Democratic senators are targeting the close relationship that President Donald Trump has developed with the leaders of the major tech companies and AI labs.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont took aim this week at what they described as the White House's ""sweetheart deals with Big Tech companies,"" accusing the administration of failing to protect consumers from ""being forced to subsidize the cost of data centers.""

""The techlash is real,"" said Abraham Silverman, who served as general counsel for New Jersey's public utility board from 2019 until 2023 under outgoing Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.

""Data centers aren't always great neighbors,"" said Silverman, now a researcher at Johns Hopkins University. ""They tend to be loud, they can be dirty and there's a number of communities, particularly in places with really high concentrations of data centers, that just don't want more data centers.""

Virginia, Ohio and Illinois

Looking at the top fives states for data centers can help sort out some of the politics of data centers from what is actually happening to electricity prices.

Virginia, Illinois and Ohio are among those states and are mostly served by the same grid operator, PJM Interconnection. PJM is the largest grid in the U.S., serving more than 65 million people across 13 states including New Jersey where Silverman advised the state utility board.

The PJM grid is facing a major imbalance between demand and supply. It holds auctions to secure electric capacity from power plants to ensure the grid remains reliable. The auction for 2024 to 2025 resulted in a bill of $2.2 billion. The bill then surged more than 500% to $14.7 billion for 2025 to 2026.

An independent watchdog that monitors those PJM auctions found that data center demand, actual and forecast, made up $9.3 billion, or 63% of the total power capacity bill for 2025 to 2026. In the latest auction, prices jumped another 10% to $16.1 billion.

""Data center load growth is the primary reason for recent and expected capacity market conditions, including total forecast load growth, the tight supply and demand balance, and high prices,"" the firm Monitoring Analytics said in its June Independent Market Monitor report.

Those capacity prices get passed down to consumers in their utility bills, Silverman said. The data center load in PJM is also impacting prices in states that are not industry leaders such as New Jersey, where prices jumped about 20% year over year. Democrat Mikie Sherrill won the governor's race in the Garden State in part on promising to freeze electric bill increases.

""It is an extremely large component of the affordability crisis we're experiencing right now,"" Silverman said of data center impact on capacity prices.

There are other reasons for rising electricity prices, Silverman said. The aging electric grid needs upgrades at a time of broad inflation and the cost of building new transmission lines has gone up by double digits, he said.

The utilities also point to rising demand from the expansion of domestic manufacturing and the broader electrification of the economy, such as electric vehicles and the adoption of electric heat pumps in some regions.

Although some Democrats are blaming the White House, the conditions that led to rising electricity prices in the PJM region began before the second Trump administration took office.

PJM's process for bringing new electric supply online has ""crashed and burned,"" Silverman said. Tax subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act led to a surge of renewable energy projects waiting for grid connection. PJM is struggling to keep up with approvals, which can take five years in some cases, he said.

PJM's watchdog said the grid may have seen tight power supplies without data centers, but the demand growth would have been slower and allowed more time for the market to address it.

""It is misleading to assert that the capacity market results are simply just a reflection of supply and demand,"" the watchdog said, describing the rapid load growth from data centers as ""unprecedented.""

Trump promised to cut electricity prices in half during his first year in office. That has not happened and is unlikely to happen in the coming years due to tight supply and demand.

""It's hard to see utility bills coming down in this decade,"" said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm.

Texas and California

In other states, however, the relationship between rising electricity prices and data centers is less clear. Texas, for example, is second only to Virginia with more than 400 data centers. But prices in the Lone Star state increased about 4% year over year in August, lower than the national average.

Texas operates its own grid, ERCOT, with a relatively fast process that can connect new electric supply to the grid in around three years, according to a February 2024 report from the Brattle Group.

California, meanwhile, has the third most data centers in the nation and the second highest residential electricity prices, nearly 80% above the national average. But prices in the Golden State increased about 1% in August 2024 over the prior year period, far below the average hike nationwide.

One of the reasons California's electricity rates are so much higher than most of the country is the costs associated with preventing wildfires. PG&E, the largest utility in the state, said in March that it expects rates to remain stable this year as costs associated with wildfire prevention are taken out of customers' bills.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108214315-17609846542025-10-20t181904z_237714832_rc2ofhalqo8x_rtrmadp_0_amazon-outages-aws.jpeg?v=1760984688&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-11-14 19:01:21.126486

Just over an hour north of the company’s Production Center that is under construction in Blythewood, South Carolina, the Charlotte location will further cement Scout Motors’ presence in the Carolinas and enable seamless coordination between manufacturing, corporate and technical operations.

The Scout Motors headquarters will be at the Commonwealth development in Plaza Midwood. Conveniently located in the heart of Charlotte’s most eclectic neighborhood, this vibrant development blends restored historic architecture with striking new construction.

Construction is progressing rapidly at Scout Motors’ Production Center in Blythewood, with initial production targeted to begin in 2027. Once it reaches full capacity, the Production Center is expected to create more than 4,000 jobs in South Carolina and attract additional suppliers and economic opportunities to the region.

The Charlotte headquarters will serve as the home base for executive leadership, research and development, finance, IT, sales, marketing, and other key corporate functions.

Scout Motors will begin establishing its Charlotte presence gradually, with plans for initial staffing and office development beginning in 2026 and full headquarters operations scaling up in the coming years.

Steve Spinks, CEO of The Spinx Company, was named the 2025 Business Leader of the Year by The South Carolina Chamber of Commerce (SC Chamber). The award was presented during the SC Chamber’s 46th Annual Summit on Oct. 29.

The SC Chamber selected Spinks “in recognition of his unwavering commitment to improving South Carolina’s business climate, his positive contributions to the state’s business community, and his dedication to giving back to the communities the Spinx Company serves.”

“I am deeply honored to receive this recognition from the SC Chamber,” said Spinks.

“Our business community faces many challenges, and the Chamber continues to be a vital advocate on the frontlines of these issues. I am grateful for the support they provide to me and my colleagues. As business leaders, it’s essential that we speak up and share our stories to advance the Chamber’s efforts on important matters such as tort reform. I look forward to continuing to work alongside the Chamber to strengthen South Carolina’s business community.”

The SC Chamber’s annual Business Leader of the Year award recognizes an individual who is the embodiment of personal success, and who has demonstrated a business record based on ethical conduct and corporate responsibility, public service, contributions to the preservation of South Carolina’s government, and commitment to creating a favorable business climate to improve the state’s economy.

The South Carolina Department of Veterans’ Affairs (SCDVA) announced Retired Army Master Sergeant Major Alfonso J. Boyd as the newest South Carolina Veteran of the Year. The Veteran of the Year award serves as recognition to honor the contributions of veterans in the community.

Boyd served with distinction in the United States Army for approximately 22 years. He returned to his hometown and established a successful JROTC program for Great Falls and Lewisville High Schools.

He later moved to expand the JROTC program at Chester High School. He served Chester County for at least 12 years in that capacity, helping to expand the minds and experiences of his students. Since then, he has aided Chester County veterans in receiving over a million dollars in benefits.

Boyd leads a productive team of disabled American veterans in an effort to seek and uplift other veterans. He leads the way in comradery by joining and encouraging others to become members of multiple veterans’ organizations to strengthen and preserve the attitude of a grateful nation. He is actively involved and supports the county's voting registration efforts.

He established and continues to sponsor the local “Ride For Jesus” Motorcycle Sunday held yearly in Chester County. He works actively in the church to motivate and guide youth to pursue careers and become productive citizens.

Boyd has been the commander of Disabled American Veterans, James D. Wessinger Chapter 19 for 10 years. He planned and executed programs such as 2017 Wounded Warrior Amputee Softball Tournament and Banquet, Quilt of Valor ceremonies, three Dinner with a General ceremonies celebrating the three native Chester County Generals, and the first-ever Vietnam Veteran Widow recognition ceremony.

The Veteran of the Year is selected by an Internal Selection Committee from Veteran of the Month candidates during a yearly cycle that runs from November through October.

VELUX, the global leader in skylights and daylight solutions, announced this week that its next-generation skylight won a prestigious Good Housekeeping 2026 Home Reno Award.

VELUX USA is headquartered in Fort Mill, South Carolina.

The VELUX Skylight System is a first-of-its-kind product that features a pre-installed, remote-controlled, solar-powered shade that reduces heat loss in winter and blocks heat gain in summer.

Research shows that when the double-pleated, room-darkening solar shade is in the down position, it enhances the already industry-leading thermal performance by up to 45 percent and blocks up to 19 percent more of the sun's radiation, providing year-round comfort and energy savings.

As homeowners increasingly prioritize wellness and smart home functionality, skylights are emerging as a key upgrade in renovation projects. The venting model of the Skylight System enhances indoor air quality by quickly refreshing stale indoor air, which the EPA reports is often two to five times more polluted than outdoor air.

Studies show that skylights can help remove indoor pollutants up to 15 times faster than vertical windows alone.",http://locable-assets-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/resource/file/1255510/unnamed_20-_202025-11-14T111055.202.jpg?timestamp=1763175492,N,,2025-11-14 21:58:15.143411

“This is an industry that boomed from the mid-‘50s to the late ‘70s,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who also delivered the keynote address at this year’s American Nuclear Society conference in D.C. Nuclear energy infrastructure, however, has slowed in recent decades.
Wright says the Trump administration is seeking to build small, modular reactors — a new, and cheaper alternative, though one that hasn’t been demonstrated.

These data centers, along with electric cars and an increase in U.S. manufacturing, will sharply raise demand for energy, according to Berkeley Lab reports.

But is nuclear a viable option?

“This is an industry that boomed from the mid-‘50s to the late ‘70s,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who also delivered the keynote address at this year’s American Nuclear Society conference in D.C.

Nuclear energy infrastructure, however, has slowed in recent decades. The average age of a nuclear power plant in the United States is 41 years old.

Wright says the Trump administration is seeking to build small, modular reactors — a new, and cheaper alternative, though one that hasn’t been demonstrated.

“President Trump’s bold objective was to get multiple reactors running before our 250th anniversary [on] July 4 next year,” he said. “I think we’ll get one or two under that deadline.”

The timeline also took a hit during the government shutdown, as the agencies assigned to oversee the projects were shut down. Nuclear regulators were furloughed; the Department of Energy also furloughed 80% of the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the country’s nuclear stockpile.

That latter group, from the NNSA, had never before been furloughed, even amid a shutdown. This unprecedented move was blasted by Democratic lawmakers, but Wright claims it was somewhat necessary due to the length of the shutdown.

“We’ve never had a shutdown so long. That is the longest government shutdown in history,” Wright said.

Trump, too, had recently raised concerns that the U.S. would be resuming nuclear weapons testing after more than 30 years, indicating as much in an interview with “60 Minutes” amid the shutdown.

Wright, however, said that would not be the case.

“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests. These are not nuclear explosions,” Wright claimed in a Fox News interview over the weekend.",https://www.counton2.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/11/NuclearWDCWNexstar.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-14 20:00:06.252605

Under its multiple-use mission, BLM manages lands for diverse purposes, including livestock grazing, energy development, recreation, and conservation. The agency also administers onshore federal energy and mineral resources generally.

BLM discretionary appropriations typically are provided in Title I of Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations acts. For FY2025, the enacted level in P.L. 119-4, the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, was $1,412.0 million. BLM also receives a portion of the discretionary appropriations to DOI for wildland fire management. In addition, BLM receives mandatory (permanent) appropriations under various statutes. The Interior Budget in Brief estimated FY2025 mandatory appropriations at $507.2 million, excluding $95.0 million for BLM deferred maintenance.

FY2026 Discretionary Appropriations Action

For FY2026, BLM is receiving appropriations at FY2025 levels under a continuing resolution (CR)—P.L. 119-137, Division A. The CR is in effect through January 30, 2026, unless other appropriations for BLM are enacted earlier. From October 1, 2025, until November 12, 2025, BLM experienced a lapse in appropriations because no FY2026 appropriations had been enacted. A BLM Contingency Plan (September 2025) addressing operations during a lapse in appropriations stated that many agency activities would cease while setting out exceptions (e.g., emergency response). It also stated that most BLM lands would be publicly accessible but not all services would be available.

For FY2026, President Trump requested $936.1 million for BLM—$475.9 million (34%) less than the FY2025 enacted level of $1,412.0 million. (See Table 1.) Among other changes, the President proposed decreases for BLM's two largest accounts—Management of Lands and Resources (MLR) and Oregon and California Grant Lands (O&C).

On July 24, 2025, the House Appropriations Committee reported H.R. 4754 (H.Rept. 119-215), with $1,301.6 million for BLM for FY2026. This would be a decrease of $110.4 million (8%) from the FY2025 level. H.R. 4754 contained decreases for the MLR and O&C accounts, among other changes. Also on July 24, 2025, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. 2431 (S.Rept. 119-46), with $1,374.6 million for BLM for FY2026. This would be a decrease of $37.3 million (3%) from the FY2025 level. (See Table 1.) S. 2431 would decrease funding for the MLR account and maintain level funding for the O&C account, among other provisions.

Discretionary Appropriations Accounts

Management of Lands and Resources (MLR). This account, BLM's largest, funds diverse activities and subactivities. For instance, the land resources activity includes subactivities such as rangelands and cultural resources. Table 1 shows amounts for the account's nine main activities (and mining law administration, with offsetting collections). Relative to the FY2025 level of $1,260.5 million, the President sought a $433.1 million decrease for FY2026. Details are not available on how the decrease would be reflected in the accounts' activities.

Relative to FY2025 enacted, the House committee-reported bill would be a $99.9 million decrease for the MLR account. Of the nine main activities (excluding mining law administration), H.R. 4754 would provide decreased funding for five activities, increases for two activities, and level funding for two activities. The Senate committee-reported bill would be a $36.8 million decrease for the MLR account. Of the nine main activities, S. 2431 would provide funding decreases for six activities, funding increases for two activities, and level funding for one activity. Despite its overall lower account total, H.R. 4754 contained higher funding than S. 2431 for some activities.

Oregon and California Grant Lands. This account funds management of more than 2 million acres of forested lands in Western Oregon, primarily for timber production. The FY2025 appropriation was $115.5 million for this account. Relative to the FY2025 level, the President sought a $46.2 million decrease, H.R. 4754 would be a $10.6 million decrease, and S. 2431 would provide level funding.

Range Improvements. The Range Improvements account funds rehabilitation, protection, and improvement of BLM rangelands. By law, 50% of grazing fees collected on BLM lands or $10.0 million—whichever is greater—is credited to a Range Improvements Fund. In recent years, BLM grazing receipts typically were less than $20.0 million annually and BLM received $10.0 million through this account, as in FY2025. For FY2026, H.R. 4754 contained $10.0 million; the President's request and S. 2431 contained $9.4 million.

Service Charges, Deposits, and Forfeitures. This account allows BLM to use monies paid to the agency for activities such as rights-of-way processing and energy and minerals authorizations. The FY2025 estimate was $30.0 million, offset by collections, the same as in the FY2026 House and Senate committee-reported bills. For FY2026, the President estimated $35.0 million, offset by collections.

Miscellaneous Trust Funds. This account appropriates contributions made to BLM (e.g., from individuals, states, and businesses). The FY2025 enacted amount was $26.0 million, the same as contained in H.R. 4754 and S. 2431. The President's request estimated $30.0 million.

Selected Mandatory Appropriations

Deferred Maintenance (DM). BLM estimated its DM at roughly $6.27billion in FY2024, more than five times the FY2019 estimate ($1.1 billion). The increase is largely due to changes in estimation methods. BLM receives both discretionary and mandatory appropriations for DM. Interior appropriations laws provide discretionary funds, with $20.0 million in FY2025. For FY2026, the President's discretionary request for BLM DM is unclear, due to the lack of an FY2026 budget justification. H.R. 4754 contained $17.5 million and S. 2431 included $8.0 million.

For FY2021-FY2025, a primary source of mandatory funding for DM was the National Parks and Public Land Legacy Restoration Fund (LRF), established by P.L. 116-152, the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA). Under GAOA, BLM's mandatory appropriation was about $95.0 million annually. The effect of this funding is not clear, because appropriations can take multiple years to spend, BLM's DM estimation methods have changed, and other factors. The President's FY2026 request proposed reauthorizing the LRF (p. DH-12), and the Senate Appropriations Committee supported reauthorization (S.Rept. 119-46, p. 5). The House Committee expressed interest in revising bill and report language, if needed, if the LRF is reauthorized (H.Rept. 119-215, p. 10).

The President's FY2026 budget request proposed to direct $17.3 million of mandatory funding from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) to BLM DM in FY2026. The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the proposal (S.Rept. 119-46, p. 11). The House Appropriations Committee stated that H.R. 4754 did not reflect an Administration proposal to amend LWCF law to authorize funding for DM (H.Rept. 119-215, p. 9).",https://www.congress.gov/img/opengraph1200by630.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 21:04:40.657269

TerraGen, a renewable energy developer, opened the Monte Cristo I Windpower Project in Hidalgo County, Texas this week. The facility has a 238.5-megawatt capacity — equivalent to powering 81,000 homes a year. And, 78.5 of those megawatts are committed to the copper mine outside Salt Lake City.

The agreement strengthens the company’s renewable energy portfolio in the country, Rio Tinto Kennecott managing director Nate Foster said in a statement.

Kennecott’s Bingham Canyon mine has been in operation for over 120 years and currently is ready to remain active until 2026. Up until recently, there were plans in place to extend mining until 2032, but the company is also preparing feasibility studies to prolong the mine’s life until 2040.

Bill Gates raised some eyebrows last week – and probably the blood pressure of climate activists – when he published a memo calling for a “strategic pivot” on climate change.

In his memo, the Microsoft founder, whose philanthropy and impact investments have focused heavily on fighting climate change, argues that, while global warming is still a long-term threat to humanity, it’s not the only one.

There are other, more urgent challenges, like poverty and disease, that also need attention, he argues, and that the solution to climate change is technology and innovation, not unaffordable and unachievable near-term net zero policies.

“Unfortunately, the doomsday outlook is causing much of the climate community to focus too much on near-term emissions goals, and it’s diverting resources from the most effective things we should be doing to improve life in a warming world,” he writes.

Gates’ memo is timely, given that world leaders are currently gathered in Brazil for the COP30 climate summit. Canada may not be the only country reconsidering things like energy policy and near-term net zero targets, if only because they are unrealistic and unaffordable.

It could give some cover for Canadian COP30 delegates, who will be at Brazil summit at a time when Prime Minister Mark Carney is renegotiating his predecessor’s platinum climate action plan for a silver one – a plan that contains fewer carbon taxes and more fossil fuels.

It is telling that Carney is not at COP30 this week, but rather holding a summit with Alberta Premier Danielle Smith.

The federal budget handed down last week contains kernels of the Carney government’s new Climate Competitiveness Strategy. It places greater emphasis on industrial strategy, investment, energy and resource development, including critical minerals mining and LNG.

Despite his Davos credentials, Carney is clearly alive to the fact it’s a different ballgame now. Canada cannot afford a hyper-focus on net zero and the green economy. It’s going to need some high octane fuel – oil, natural gas and mining – to prime Canada’s stuttering economic engine.

The prosperity promised from the green economy has not quite lived up to its billing, as a recent Fraser Institute study reveals.

Spending and tax incentives totaling $150 billion over a decade by Ottawa, B.C, Ontario, Alberta and Quebec created a meagre 68,000 jobs, the report found.

“It’s simply not big enough to make a huge difference to the overall performance of the economy,” said Jock Finlayson, chief economist for the Independent Contractors and Business Association and co-author of the report.

“If they want to turn around what I would describe as a moribund Canadian economy…they’re not going to be successful if they focus on these clean, green industries because they’re just not big enough.”

There are tentative moves in the federal budget and Climate Competitiveness Strategy to recalibrate Canada’s climate action policies, though the strategy is still very much in draft form.

Carney’s budget acknowledges that the world has changed, thanks to deglobalization and trade strife with the U.S.

“Industrial policy, once seen as secondary to market forces, is returning to the forefront,” the budget states.

Last week’s budget signals a shift from regulations towards more investment-based measures.

These measures aim to “catalyse” $500 billion in investment over five years through “strengthened industrial carbon pricing, a streamlined regulatory environment and aggressive tax incentives.”

There is, as-yet, no commitment to improve the investment landscape for Alberta’s oil industry with the three reforms that Alberta has called for: scrapping Bill C-69, a looming oil and gas emissions cap and a West Coast oil tanker moratorium, which is needed if Alberta is to get a new oil pipeline to the West Coast.

“I do think, if the Carney government is serious about Canada’s role, potentially, as an global energy superpower, and trying to increase our exports of all types of energy to offshore markets, they’re going to have to revisit those three policy files,” Finlayson said.

Heather Exner-Pirot, director of energy, natural resources and environment at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, said she thinks the emissions cap at least will be scrapped.

“The markets don’t lie,” she said, pointing to a post-budget boost to major Canadian energy stocks. “The energy index got a boost. The markets liked it. I don’t think the markets think there is going to be an emissions cap.”

Some key measures in the budget for unlocking investments in energy, mining and decarbonization include:

incentives to leverage $1 trillion in investment over the next five years in nuclear and wind power, energy storage and grid infrastructure;

an expansion of critical minerals eligible for a 30% clean technology manufacturing investment tax credit;

$2 billion over five years to accelerate critical mineral production;

tax credits for turquoise hydrogen (i.e. hydrogen made from natural gas through methane pyrolysis); and

an extension of an investment tax credit for carbon capture utilization and storage through to 2035.

As for carbon taxes, the budget promises “strengthened industrial carbon pricing.”

This might suggest the government’s plan is to simply simply shift the burden for carbon pricing from the consumer entirely onto industry. If that’s the case, it could put Canadian resource industries at a disadvantage.

“How do we keep pushing up the carbon price — which means the price of energy — for these industries at a time when the United States has no carbon pricing at all?” Finlayson wonders.

Overall, Carney does seem to be moving in the right direction in terms of realigning Canada’s energy and climate policies.

“I think this version of a Liberal government is going to be more focused on investment and competitiveness and less focused around the virtue-signaling on climate change, even though Carney personally has a reputation as somebody who cares a lot about climate change,” Finlayson said.

“It’s an awkward dance for them. I think they are trying to set out a different direction relative to the Trudeau years, but they’re still trying to hold on to the Trudeau climate narrative.”

The case centers on the 1935 Humphrey’s Executor precedent and follows Trump’s mid-March decision to fire two Democratic commissioners at the five-member FTC.
“Congress’s creation of independent agencies since Humphrey’s Executor does not justify retaining the decision,” Sauer said in the brief.

The U.S. Supreme Court should uphold Humphrey’s Executor, a precedent that provides tenure protection to members of independent agencies, a bipartisan group of 11 former commissioners at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission told the court Thursday.

If the court decides to overturn or modify the precedent, it should specify that its decision does not affect ratemaking commissions such as FERC, the former federal energy regulators said in an amicus brief.

In Trump v. Slaughter, the Supreme Court is considering whether President Donald Trump has the authority to fire members of the Federal Trade Commission at will. The case centers on the 1935 Humphrey’s Executor precedent and follows Trump’s mid-March decision to fire two Democratic commissioners at the five-member FTC.

The U.S. Constitution gives the president the authority to fire commissioners on multimember administrative agencies, such as the FTC, according to a brief filed by U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer. “Congress’s creation of independent agencies since Humphrey’s Executor does not justify retaining the decision,” Sauer said in the brief.

A decision by the court that would let a president fire FERC commissioners without cause and replace them with members of the administration’s party would threaten a key piece of the U.S. economy, according to the brief from the former agency officials.

Following what has been a norm, FERC currently has three Republican commissioners and two Democratic members, all with staggered terms and with the majority coming from the president’s party. The commissioners oversee wholesale electric and gas rates as well as transmission and oil and gas pipeline rates.

“Eliminating for-cause removal protections would expose energy investors to political uncertainty and policy volatility, which risk higher costs for American consumers and producers,” the former FERC commissioners said. “With FERC sitting at the center of the nation’s energy renaissance, discarding its structure could damage America’s global economic position.”

Rates set by FERC help finance $40 billion in new pipelines and power lines annually, and last year more than $1 trillion of oil, natural gas and electricity flowed through that infrastructure, they said.

“Overturning Humphrey’s Executor would bulldoze the structural supports that Congress built into ratemaking commissions to protect its price-setting power from abuse,” the former FERC commissioners said. “By shielding agency action from political control, for-cause removal protections allow ratemaking commissions to sustain stable policies for the long-term benefit of regulated companies and American consumers.”

The former commissioners contend that maintaining for-cause removal protections for ratemaking commissions exercising legislative power would appropriately defer to Congress’ powers over interstate commerce.

The court is set to hear oral arguments in the case on Dec. 8.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/23waU893myUInhRmaQwytHT4-PPW013xQBwg6bFjwks/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjQ0NjQzNjQ5LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-11-14 18:03:16.150779

The same trends held for clean energy projects more broadly.
Meanwhile, Trump’s Department of Energy recently said it would cancel a number of major grants for EV, battery and other clean energy manufacturing projects, hitting both Democratic and Republican districts.
His office didn’t respond to questions about ending the tax credit and other moves to cut support for EVs.
Lists have circulated showing more widespread DOE grants in line for cancellation, potentially affecting EV, battery, and other clean energy projects, including across a number of red states.","(TNS) — Congressional Republicans opposed sweeping electric vehicle and battery incentives passed under former President Joe Biden, but many praised the individual projects they funded — welcoming new jobs to their districts, hailing developments in press releases and attending ground-breaking ceremonies.

Now, though, many of those same projects supported by 2022's Inflation Reduction Act are under threat.

Amid dramatic policy shifts under President Donald Trump and shaky consumer demand, almost $23 billion worth of EV and battery projects have been canceled this year alone, involving more than 30,000 jobs, with 76 percent of those scrapped investments located in Republican districts, according to Atlas Public Policy, a Washington, D.C., data and policy research firm. Others are being downsized or delayed. And the pace of new investments has stalled since Trump's election, according to E2, a nonpartisan business group focused on energy and the environment.

""It's a self-inflicted wound by our leadership in Washington,” said Bob Keefe, executive director of E2. “This is an industry that just had left the starting line and was roaring down the track, and all of a sudden, unfortunately, it's facing hurdles and roadblocks that are tough to manage.""

Billions of dollars for electric vehicle and battery manufacturing — along with thousands of promised jobs — flowed to congressional districts represented by Republicans after the IRA's passage, spurred on by the new federal grants, loans and tax credits. In the last three years, well over 60 percent of new battery and clean vehicle projects went to these GOP-controlled districts, according to E2 data. The same trends held for clean energy projects more broadly.

The current flurry of cancellations follows the passage of the GOP-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act and other major policy changes pushed by the president. Trump has described moving from gas cars to EVs as “a transition to hell,” and labeled tax credits supporting such green energy projects a “giant scam.”

His signature tax and spending legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, strips several key supports for EVs, including the $7,500 tax credit for buying or leasing, which is expected to sharply reduce customer demand over the coming months. Meanwhile, Trump’s Department of Energy recently said it would cancel a number of major grants for EV, battery and other clean energy manufacturing projects, hitting both Democratic and Republican districts.

Three House Republicans representing districts with four combined EV battery gigafactories — stretching from Marshall, Michigan, south to Bowling Green, Kentucky — voted in favor of Trump’s big bill, despite getting among the largest total EV investments of anywhere in the country. These plants and many others, as The Detroit News previously reported, are trying to navigate an increasingly uncertain future, in some cases pausing construction and hunting for new customers beyond the auto industry.

Plenty of GOP lawmakers and other conservative leaders, like state governors, have publicly supported the projects in the past. But now they are carefully navigating a party and president who have taken a hard line against EVs.

U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie, a Kentucky Republican who chairs the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, represents a district encompassing two massive battery plants at different stages of completion. He celebrated their arrival and the jobs they would bring, noting in 2022 his area was “becoming an EV battery corridor and a leader in manufacturing this technology.”

He, at times, has raised concerns with EVs and the level of subsidies plants received, and other times indicated more support was needed. His office didn’t respond to questions about ending the tax credit and other moves to cut support for EVs.

U.S. Rep. Victoria Spartz, a Republican who represents the Kokomo, Indiana, area, where a large EV battery project is partially built, in 2022 signed onto a congressional letter to the DOE endorsing the project, and the agency later approved a $7.5 billion loan for it. Her office didn’t respond to questions about ending the tax credit and other federal support for the project.

U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg, a Republican who represents the large Ford Motor Co. battery plant in Marshall that remains under construction, has in the past both celebrated the new jobs but also raised serious concerns with the project’s ties to the Chinese firm — CATL, or Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. — licensing battery technology to Ford. His office declined to comment on the project’s current status or on how he views the future for EVs in the United States with less government support.

In letters sent before the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed over the summer, some Republicans whose districts had benefited from the IRA’s clean energy tax breaks had flagged concerns about cutting them. But the legislation ultimately passed with overwhelming GOP support in both chambers.

“The state politics of this are really complicated,” especially with the midterm elections coming up, said Barry Rabe, a University of Michigan professor emeritus in political science who studies environmental policy.

On one hand, he said, “most congressional districts are in such safe territory, it’s hard to see any partisan shift of control in them.” Yet there are GOP-controlled House districts that have seen broad benefits from clean energy investments where “this really could be a factor.”

Rabe said Republican politicians — especially in safe districts — will be wary of saying anything positive about EVs or other clean energy technologies that could invite backlash from the White House, and perhaps attract a primary challenger backed by Trump.

Even as Republicans on the national stage have fully turned against EVs, it’s been a different story on the state and local level. Several red-state governors, for instance, have fully embraced the EV manufacturing industry over the last couple of years, with their economic development agencies shelling out hundreds of millions to attract new projects.

“The Republican governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, has said he wants to be the electric mobility capital of the world,” said E2’s Keefe — and he just might succeed if the Republican governors of nearby South Carolina or Tennessee don’t “beat him to it.”

""These governors and the elected officials that represent these areas are all about bringing jobs and opportunity and investments to their states and regions,” Keefe added, “and unfortunately they're being thwarted by their party leadership in Washington.”

In Hardin County, Kentucky, which voted overwhelmingly for Trump in the last election, local leaders say the community has been largely receptive to Ford's massive new BlueOval SK battery plant.

And in Kokomo, Republican Mayor Tyler Moore recently recalled the full-court press that local and state officials used to attract what turned into a $6.3 billion, 2,800-job commitment from battery maker StarPlus Energy. Even then-Gov. Eric Holcomb, a Republican, had shown up in town to personally make the case to company officials, the mayor said, as Indiana sought to beat out neighboring states, including Michigan, vying for the investment.

Moore said he and other local leaders, knowing the potential impacts on the new battery plant, had more recently reached out to Spartz and other members of Congress to try to save the EV tax credit. The effort failed when the credits ended Sept. 30.

“At the local level, political lines need to be blurred,” Moore said. “On the federal level, if there’s a movement that’s more liberal or Democratic-leaning in nature that’s going to benefit our workforce here — and because we’ve got such a strong union presence and such — why would I, as a local Republican mayor, do anything that’s going to jeopardize (that)?”

The Trump administration continues to target EV and other clean energy subsidies that were approved under former President Biden. The latest example is DOE confirmation that it has terminated funding awards for 223 such projects totaling $7.5 billion. A DOE-provided list shows the grants cover everything from hydrogen and fuel cell projects, to university research efforts, to EV advocacy and research. One federal official posted that the moves were to stop “Green New Scam” funding that is fueling “the Left’s climate agenda,” and the cuts were targeting blue states.

A planning document obtained by The News indicated cancellations also might affect $800 million in grants for Michigan, including a $500 million grant for General Motors Co.’s Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant to convert to EV production.

The area is represented by U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett, a Charlotte Republican, who said he'd been in touch with the automaker and the Trump administration about it. Last month, he said his ""top priority will always be standing with the auto workers and ensuring tax dollars are spent effectively as we unwind the Biden EV mandates that tied the hands of our auto industry and stifled our manufacturing economy.""

Barrett praised GM's move to keep making the next-generation gas-powered Cadillac CT5 at the plant — reversing, for now, its EV conversion plans. GM recently acknowledged that a gas-powered vehicle wouldn't qualify for the conversion grant.

Lists have circulated showing more widespread DOE grants in line for cancellation, potentially affecting EV, battery, and other clean energy projects, including across a number of red states. DOE officials have not yet confirmed all of the projects will ultimately be cut off.

In an interview on CNN last month, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright called many of the grants “an incredible, irresponsible deployment of taxpayer money,” and pledged not only to target Democrat-led states. A review continues, he said, and “more project (cancellation) announcements will come.”

T1 Energy Inc., a leading player in the renewable energy sector, has released its Form 10-Q report for the third quarter of 2025. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial and operational performance, highlighting significant milestones and challenges faced during the period. The company, which specializes in the production and sale of photovoltaic (PV) solar modules, has shown notable progress in its business operations despite facing some financial hurdles.

Financial Highlights

Total Net Sales: $210.5 million, reflecting the commencement of PV solar module sales post-Trina Business Combination.

Gross Profit: $21.1 million, indicating the profitability from sales after accounting for the cost of sales.

Operating Loss from Continuing Operations: $(94.7) million, driven by increased operating expenses including a $53.2 million impairment of intangible assets.

Net Loss: $(130.6) million, impacted by both continuing and discontinued operations, with a significant impairment charge.

Net Loss Per Share - Basic and Diluted: $(0.87), reflecting the overall net loss attributable to common stockholders.

Business Highlights

Revenue Segments: The company reported total net sales of $210.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, and $396.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. These sales were primarily driven by the sale of PV solar modules, with significant contributions from related party transactions with the Trina Group.

Customer Concentration: During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, three customers accounted for 60%, 17%, and 15% of total net sales, highlighting a significant concentration of revenue from a few key customers.

Production Facility: The company operates a single solar module production facility in the United States, which is critical to its operations. Any disruption to this facility could significantly impact the company's ability to meet customer demand.

New Production Launches: The company is progressing with the development of its G2_Austin solar cell manufacturing facility in Rockdale, Texas, which is expected to enhance production capacity.

Future Outlook: The company anticipates that the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 will positively impact liquidity and capital resources, particularly through the advanced manufacturing production credit under Section 45X of the Internal Revenue Code. This credit is expected to provide a significant source of funding through 2032.

Operational Challenges: The company is facing potential disputes regarding acquired customer contracts, which have led to an impairment loss of $53.2 million. This issue has affected expected sales volumes and could impact future operations.

Strategic Focus: The company is focused on ensuring compliance with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) by December 31, 2025, to retain the availability of tax credits, which is a significant regulatory and business priority.

Market Conditions: The company is operating in a volatile macroeconomic environment, with potential impacts from changes in global trade policies and tariffs, which could affect market conditions and operational performance.

The Colorado Energy Office and the governor’s office announced in a joint news release on Thursday that homeowners could be eligible for up to $14,000 in rebates for heat pumps, electric stoves and other appliances and upgrades.

The funding was made available through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a federal law passed under former President Joe Biden that directed hundreds of billions of dollars toward clean energy and climate-related programs.

That included $140.3 million in rebates for Colorado, which are now being passed down to residents as part of the state’s Home Energy Rebate Program .

Here’s what homeowners could be eligible for:

Up to $8,000 for a cold climate heat pump for space heating or cooling

Up to $4,000 for a breaker box upgrade

Up to $2,500 for electric wiring

Up to $1,750 for a heat pump water heater

Up to $1,600 for insulation, air sealing and ventilation

Up to $840 for an electric stove, cooktop, oven or heat pump clothes dryer

The rebates are income-based. Households making below 80% of their county’s area median income are eligible to receive the full amount, while those making between 80% and 150% could see up to half.

The rebates are expected to be available through 2029, or until funds run out. These benefits are different from the federal clean energy tax credits that were also passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, some of which have already been phased out. Credits for electric vehicles ended in September, while credits for home appliances and solar installation expire on Dec. 31.

For the rebate program, homeowners must work with a registered contractor to receive the benefit. More than 55 contractors across Colorado have already begun the registration process, and the state will continue to add to the list of approved contractors over the coming weeks as more contractors complete the process.

Eliminating EV Range Anxiety in Remote Areas

The fundamental promise of these systems extends beyond simple cost savings. They address a critical barrier to EV adoption – the fear of being stranded in remote areas without charging options.

American electric vehicle owners will no longer face limitations on where they can travel. National parks, remote recreational areas, and rural destinations become accessible to EV drivers when reliable charging infrastructure exists independent of traditional electrical grids.

This accessibility factor drives economic development in previously underserved areas. Rural communities can now attract EV-driving tourists and residents without waiting for costly grid infrastructure improvements.

Market Timing and Industry Disruption

The launch comes at a critical moment in American energy infrastructure development. Traditional electrical grids face increasing strain from extreme weather events, growing electricity demand, and aging infrastructure. Bi State Developers' solution provides resilience through independence.

Industry analysts project significant growth in off-grid charging solutions over the next decade. Early adopters gain competitive advantages in serving EV-driving customers while contributing to national energy security goals.

The timing also aligns with federal infrastructure initiatives and clean energy mandates. Organizations implementing these systems often qualify for various tax incentives and grant programs, further improving the economic case for adoption.

Scalability and Future Expansion

You can start with double-carport installations and expand as demand grows. The modular design allows for seamless capacity increases without major infrastructure changes. This scalability makes the systems attractive for organizations with uncertain future charging demand.

The technology platform also supports future enhancements. As battery technology improves or new charging protocols develop, existing installations can be upgraded rather than replaced.

Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released its draft risk evaluation for 1,2-dichloroethane (also known as ethylene dichloride) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). EPA preliminarily determined that 1,2-dichloroethane presents an unreasonable risk of injury to human health and the environment driven by certain conditions of use (COUs).

1,2-Dichloroethane Draft Risk Evaluation

EPA is preliminarily determining that 1,2-dichloroethane presents unreasonable risk of injury to human health driven by inhalation and dermal risks to workers and inhalation risks to occupational non-users (ONUs) from 15 COUs. EPA is also preliminarily determining that 1,2-dichloroethane presents an unreasonable risk to the environment driven by chronic exposure to aquatic invertebrates via surface water and sediment exposures from two COUs. The agency did not preliminarily identify a risk of injury to human health or the environment from five other COUs evaluated for 1,2-dichloroethane. For COUs with unreasonable risk to workers, these preliminary risk determinations do not reflect the use of personal protective equipment (PPE); however, as the draft risk evaluation shows, the use of PPE may reduce exposures to and mitigate risk from 1,2-dichloroethane.

EPA is preliminarily determining that 1,2-dichloroethane exposure to consumers or the general population, associated with any COU, does not significantly contribute to unreasonable risk of injury to human health.

Read the draft risk evaluation for 1,2-dichloroethane.

Next Steps

Upon publication of the Federal Register notice, the agency will accept public comments on the draft risk evaluation for 1,2-dichloroethane via docket EPA-HQ-OPPT-2018-0427 on regulations.gov for 60 days.

EPA’s Science Advisory Council on Chemicals (SACC) reviewed the draft human health hazard assessment for 1,2-dichloroethane during the September 2024 SACC meeting. The draft risk evaluation for 1,2-dichloroethane released today reflects both SACC and public comments on the draft human health hazard assessment for 1,2-dichloroethane. Additionally, the methodologies used in the development of the 1,2-dichloroethane draft risk evaluation have been previously peer reviewed by the SACC. Therefore, EPA is not soliciting additional external peer review of the draft risk evaluation for 1,2-dichloroethane.

After the agency has considered public comments, EPA will issue a final risk evaluation that includes its determination as to whether 1,2-dichloroethane represents an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment.",https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-standard-og.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 19:59:39.359729

""From our commitment to cutting red tape and fostering innovation to our talented workforce, there is no better place to do business than the Lone Star State,"" Cornyn said. ""I look forward to seeing Google's positive impact on our state for years to come.""

Three new Google data centers to be located in Texas

One of Google's three new data centers will be in Armstrong County, the other two in Haskell County.

Google said it will continue to invest in the existing Midlothian and Dallas campuses, part of the company's global network of 42 cloud regions that businesses and organizations ""use to build and scale their own AI-powered solutions.""

The Haskell County data centers will be built directly alongside a new solar and battery energy storage plant, creating an industrial park in partnership with Interset and TPG Rise Climate.

Google said the three new data centers will use advanced air-cooling technology. It also said the company will contribute $2.6 million to ""help Texas Water Trade create and enhance"" up to 1,000 acres of wetlands along the Trinity-San Jacinto Estuary.

Google to add thousands of megawatts to Texas electricity grid and advance water security

Google said that, to date, it has contracted to add more than 6,200 megawatts of ""new net energy generation and capacity"" to the Texas electricity grid through power purchase agreements with other energy developers, namely AES Corporation, Enel North America, Interset and X-Elio.

The company said, as part of the wetlands along the Trinity-San Jacinto Estuary, it will deliver roughly 300 million gallons of freshwater annually in southeastern Texas.

Google also said it is providing over $2 million to support Texas agriculture, including a regenerative program in the DFW area and an irrigation project in the High Plains.

Investing in the Texas workforce

The company said funding from Google.org's AI Opportunity Fund will increase the number of apprentices in the state and integrate AI into the training curriculum. Google said more than 1,700 apprentices in the state will be trained by 2030.

Google said it is already working with key sectors of the state for responsible use and adoption of AI, and is committing $7 million in grants to support AI initiatives in healthcare, energy and education in the state.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/03/07d65ac2-abf7-437c-bbf6-d7b99798aebe/thumbnail/1200x630/137b63ca2dd3dee014e88fe839d0f0ed/cbsn-fusion-judge-lets-google-keep-chrome-must-share-search-data-rivals-thumbnail.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 17:01:56.673193

The laws are the most sweeping of their kind in the nation, and a collection of business groups argued in an emergency appeal that they violate free-speech rights.

The measures were signed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2023, and reporting requirements are expected to start early next year.

Lower courts have so far refused to block the laws, which the state says will increase transparency and encourage companies to assess how they can cut their emissions.

The Chamber of Commerce asked the justices to put the laws on hold while lawsuits continue to play out.

One requires businesses that make more than $1 billion a year and operate in California to annually report their direct and indirect carbon emissions, beginning in 2026 and 2027, respectively.

That includes planet-warming pollution from burning fossil fuels directly, as well as releases from activities such as delivering products from warehouses to stores and employee business travel. The Chamber of Commerce estimates it will affect about 5,000 companies, though state air regulators say it will apply to roughly 2,600.

The other law requires companies that make more than $500,000 a year to biennially disclose how climate change could hurt them financially. The state Air Resources Board estimates more than 4,100 companies will have to comply.

“Without this Court’s immediate intervention, California’s unconstitutional efforts to slant public debate through compelled speech will take effect and inflict irreparable harm on thousands of companies across the country,” the companies argued.

Companies that fail to publish could be subject to civil penalties. ExxonMobil also challenged the laws in a lawsuit filed last month.

The state has argued that the laws don’t violate the First Amendment because commercial speech isn’t protected the same way under the Constitution.

In 2023, Newsom called the emissions-disclosure law an important policy and of the state’s “bold responses to the climate crisis, turning information transparency into climate action.” The environmental group Ceres has said the information will help people decide whether to support the businesses.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule last year requiring some public companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, but the agency paused the regulation amid litigation.

The conservative-majority Supreme Court has cast a skeptical eye on some environmental regulations in recent years, including a landmark decision that limited the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in 2022, and another that halted the agency’s air-pollution-fighting “good neighbor” rule.

Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, said the EPA has failed for months to release a report on PFNA, a type of PFAS contaminant. PFAS, often called “forever chemicals,” are man-made substances found in air, groundwater and drinking water across the country.

“There is no legitimate reason for this delay,” Pingree said.

“This isn’t just a few states,” she added. “Every state has these impacts.”

Pingree sent a letter last month to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin demanding an update, but she said the agency has not responded. She argues the government shutdown is hardly a viable excuse.

In a statement, the EPA cited ongoing litigation as the reason for the delay and said “the Trump EPA is committed to addressing PFAS and ensuring that regulatory compliance is achievable.”

In May, the agency upheld Biden-era drinking water regulations on two PFAS chemicals, PFOA and PFOS, but said three others — PFHxS, PFNA and GenX — remain under legal review.

Pingree said she worries the agency is bowing to industry pressure.

“We’re just worried that this follows a pattern of this administration being … bullied by the industry that, of course, doesn’t want to have to deal with this chemical,” she said.

Environmental advocates also accuse the EPA of ignoring clear scientific evidence. Kyla Bennett, a former EPA scientist who now works with Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, said PFAS exposure can cause developmental issues in children, obesity, cholesterol problems and thyroid disorders.

“My fear is that with these people running the agency, the American people are going to start to get sicker and sicker,” Bennett said. She described the environment for current EPA scientists as “hostile.”

Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., who co-chairs the bipartisan PFAS Caucus, is also sounding the alarm. She accuses the EPA not only of delaying the PFNA report but of slowing PFAS cleanup work at military bases across the country.

Dingell joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers who sent a letter of concern to the Defense Department last month. She also plans to continue pressing the issue with Trump administration officials.

Trump, urging the administration to finalize key biofuel policies that strengthen domestic energy production, promote the use of U.S.-grown soybean oil, and ensure that federal programs prioritize American feedstocks over imports.

In the letter, the groups commended the President’s leadership in restoring access to the China market and expanding global export opportunities for U.S. soybeans and soybean meal, while emphasizing that strong domestic market growth is critical. The organizations called on the administration to finalize policies that expand domestic biofuel production, include strong volumes for biomass-based diesel (BBD) in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), and limit the generation of RFS credits for foreign feedstocks and biofuels.

The U.S. soybean processing industry has invested more than $6 billion over the past four years to increase capacity by over 25 percent and today crushes more than half of all soybeans grown by U.S. farmers. To maximize their impact, these investments depend on stable federal policy frameworks that provide certainty for biofuel producers and preserve the economic value of U.S. soybeans here at home.

The organizations also highlighted the importance of the U.S. Department of the Treasury finalizing guidance for the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit without delay. Timely and clear implementation is essential to providing market certainty for ongoing biofuel investment and ensuring that the benefits of the 45Z credit flow to fuels produced from North American feedstocks, as directed by Congress in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

But is nuclear a viable option?

“This is an industry that boomed from the mid-‘50s to the late ‘70s,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who also delivered the keynote address at this year’s American Nuclear Society conference in D.C.

Nuclear energy infrastructure, however, has slowed in recent decades. The average age of a nuclear power plant in the United States is 41 years old.

Wright says the Trump administration is seeking to build small, modular reactors — a new, and cheaper alternative, though one that hasn’t been demonstrated.

“President Trump’s bold objective was to get multiple reactors running before our 250th anniversary [on] July 4 next year,” he said. “I think we’ll get one or two under that deadline.”

The timeline also took a hit during the government shutdown, as the agencies assigned to oversee the projects were shut down. Nuclear regulators were furloughed; the Department of Energy also furloughed 80% of the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the country’s nuclear stockpile.

That latter group, from the NNSA, had never before been furloughed, even amid a shutdown. This unprecedented move was blasted by Democratic lawmakers, but Wright claims it was somewhat necessary due to the length of the shutdown.

“We’ve never had a shutdown so long. That is the longest government shutdown in history,” Wright said.

Trump, too, had recently raised concerns that the U.S. would be resuming nuclear weapons testing after more than 30 years, indicating as much in an interview with “60 Minutes” amid the shutdown.

Wright, however, said that would not be the case.

Accoding to the latest data from the California Energy Commission, 13,880 MW come from 248 large utility-scale projects.
Within the United States, California leads all states on installed storage capacity, followed by Texas with roughly 9 GW.
At COP30 on Thursday, Newsom also announced that California is joining the Global Energy Storage and Grids Pledge, a COP initiative backed by more than 100 countries and organizations.
We’re deploying more battery storage than any state in America, building a stronger grid, cutting pollution, and making abundant clean energy even more affordable.”","Addressing the UN Climate Change Conference in Brazil, Governor Gavin Newsom announced that California has installed 16,942 MW of cumulative energy storage projects, underscoring the state’s climate leadership.

The new total represents an increase of about 1,200 MW in the past six months and a 2,100% surge since Newsom took office in 2019. California has now built one-third of the 52 GW of storage capacity estimated to be needed by 2045 to reach its clean energy goals – a major step toward redefining grid reliability and accelerating the state’s transition to 100% clean energy, the governor said.

Accoding to the latest data from the California Energy Commission, 13,880 MW come from 248 large utility-scale projects. The rest is from behind-the-meter battery systems installed on more than 200,000 homes (2,213 MW) and businesses, schools and local government facilities (849 MW). Within the United States, California leads all states on installed storage capacity, followed by Texas with roughly 9 GW.

The state’s rapid battery buildout has allowed the grid to remain stable even as renewable penetration has grown. California has now gone three consecutive years without needing a Flex Alert – a voluntary call issued by CAISO asking residents and businesses to reduce electricity use during the early evening peak to prevent rolling blackouts. Batteries have played a pivotal role in avoiding those alerts by providing power as solar generation declines.

Newsom emphasized that storage investments, along with new clean generation, have strengthened the grid’s ability to meet demand during heat waves and extreme weather. Even as California added record amounts of new clean energy – now supplying nearly 67% of in-state retail electricity sales – and faced warmer-than-average temperatures in 2024, the grid held steady, underscoring its growing reliability and resilience.

Battery systems now provide enough capacity to serve about one-quarter of California’s record peak demand for several hours. Meanwhile, the California Independent System Operator, which serves roughly 80% of the state’s electricity consumers, has on average met demand with 100% clean energy for nearly six hours every day so far this year.

At COP30 on Thursday, Newsom also announced that California is joining the Global Energy Storage and Grids Pledge, a COP initiative backed by more than 100 countries and organizations. California will be the first subnational government to join the pledge, which sets global targets to deploy 1,500 GW of energy storage, double worldwide grid investments, and build 25 million kilometers of new transmission by 2030 – essential steps toward achieving the global renewable-energy tripling goal agreed to at COP28.

Newsom is the most senior US political figure attending the COP30 summit in Belém after President Trump took the unprecedented step of not sending a US delegation. Appearing on several panels earlier this week, Newsom criticized the administration’s absence as an abdication of responsibility and referred to Trump as an “invasive species” whose dismissal of the climate crisis is “an abomination.”

In his latest adress, Newsom said: “Donald Trump’s reckless energy agenda puts China first and America last – letting Beijing seize the global clean energy economy and the good-paying jobs, manufacturing, and economic prosperity that come with it. California won’t stand by and watch.”

“While Donald Trump is failing, the Golden State is leading. We’re deploying more battery storage than any state in America, building a stronger grid, cutting pollution, and making abundant clean energy even more affordable.”",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2560px-Gavin_Newsom_47998168401-2048x1366-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 17:01:02.376546

“What’s happening at North Carolina A&T is redefining what it means to be a land-grant university in the 21st century,” said Martin.
“This investment allows us to accelerate from excellence to exponential growth – transforming knowledge into impact for North Carolina, the nation and the world.”","Historic commitment elevates N.C. A&T’s cumulative support from Scott to $108 million, fueling its ascent as leading doctoral research HBCU

EAST GREENSBORO, N.C. (Nov. 14, 2025) — North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University today announced a record $63 million investment from philanthropist and author MacKenzie Scott, the largest single gift ever received by the university.

Five years after Scott’s landmark $45 million gift, this latest commitment raises her total support to $108 million. It affirms her confidence in the university’s vision, leadership and trajectory as one of the nation’s most dynamic research institutions.

“No investor in higher education history has had such a broad and transformational impact across so many universities,” said Chancellor James R. Martin II. “North Carolina A&T is deeply grateful for Ms. Scott’s reaffirmed belief in our mission and for the example she sets in placing trust in institutions like ours to drive generational change through education, discovery and innovation.”

Accelerating A&T’s Strategic Vision

Scott’s investment will catalyze A&T’s next phase of growth, aligning directly with Preeminence 2030: North Carolina A&T Blueprint, which envisions the university as a model for 21st century doctoral research land-grant excellence. The investment will advance A&T’s pursuit of the Research 1-Very High Research Spending and Doctorate Production designation in the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, strengthen student success outcomes and expand research and innovation in key disciplines including engineering, agriculture, life and health sciences, data science and artificial intelligence.

“This is an investment in A&T’s capacity to solve society’s most pressing challenges,” said Martin. “It will accelerate our momentum as a research and innovation powerhouse, ensuring that A&T continues to lead at the intersection of technology, human progress and social transformation.”

Trust, Stewardship and Long-Term Impact

Like her previous investment, Scott’s latest commitment is unrestricted – reflecting both trust in A&T’s leadership and confidence in its stewardship. This flexibility will enable the university to deploy resources strategically to achieve sustainable impact that extends well beyond campus borders.

A&T’s growing endowment – expected to surpass $300 million following this investment – will strengthen its ability to attract exceptional talent, support transformative research and create opportunities that change lives and communities for generations.

“On behalf of the North Carolina A&T Board of Trustees, I extend our deepest gratitude to Ms. Scott for her extraordinary gift,” said board chair Gina L. Loften ‘90. “This transformative investment will strengthen our capacity to fulfill A&T’s mission of exemplary teaching, transformative research and impactful public service. It expands opportunities for our students, empowers innovation that addresses critical challenges and further elevates A&T’s leadership among the nation’s premiere institutions of higher learning.”

A&T’s Rising National Profile

Since Scott’s initial investment in 2020, A&T has experienced a period of remarkable growth and recognition. Enrollment now exceeds 15,000 students, making A&T the first historically Black college or university (HBCU) to surpass that milestone. The university was recently ranked America’s No. 1 public HBCU in LinkedIn’s national college rankings and has secured more than $350 million in research awards over the past five years. Faculty innovations have led to the development of numerous new patents and the establishment of expanded national partnerships in agriculture, the life sciences, autonomy and advanced manufacturing.

“What’s happening at North Carolina A&T is redefining what it means to be a land-grant university in the 21st century,” said Martin. “This investment allows us to accelerate from excellence to exponential growth – transforming knowledge into impact for North Carolina, the nation and the world.”",https://www.ncat.edu/news/2022/07/campus-quad.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 17:02:03.423599

At least 36 states have crafted subsidies specifically for data center projects, according to Good Jobs First, a nonprofit watchdog group that tracks economic development incentives. But only 11 of those states — Arizona, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin — disclose which companies receive those incentives.

In a new study, the organization examined a lack of transparency in data center deals, which are proliferating across the country as technology demands increase.

Despite data centers' significant energy requirements, states frequently compete heavily to land the projects, which invest millions or even billions into new construction. But the study noted those projects often employ nondisclosure agreements, project code names and subsidiary names that hide the firms behind the new server farms.

""Only when governments disclose information on which companies get public money and what they do with it can there be meaningful analysis, greater public participation, and wiser use of public financial resources,"" the report says.

Good Jobs First specifically examined sales and use tax exemptions that benefit data centers. The study does not account for local property tax abatements, corporate income tax credits and discounts on electricity and water rates.

Virginia, the largest data center market in the world, forgoes nearly $1 billion in state and local sales and use tax revenue each year without telling the public which companies benefit or how much they receive, the study said.

Good Jobs First underscored state calculations that show data center subsidies do not provide a return on taxpayer investments. It recommends states eliminate or curtail data center subsidies. ""At the very least, states should practice full transparency,"" the report said.

Good Jobs First says states must reassess their investments in data centers with federal cuts looming that will strain state finances.

The 70-year-old lawmaker said he had come to Belem, Brazil, to underline that Trump's aggressively pro-fossil-fuel policies do ""not represent the American people"" -- and that the United States is forfeiting a vast economic opportunity.

""Right now, we are deliberately losing our competition on solar, on wind, on battery storage, on electric vehicles and all the support technologies that go into that,"" he said in an interview.

""It is a huge self-administered blow that Trump is doing, entirely to pay back his fossil fuel donors.""

Whitehouse said that as he arrived in the Amazonian city in the early hours of the morning, he passed numerous Chinese electric vehicle dealerships -- a sight that hammered home his message about America falling behind.

The Trump administration declined to send an official delegation to the COP30 summit, leaving only a few prominent Democrats to attend in an unofficial capacity, including California Governor and presumed 2028 presidential-candidate Gavin Newsom.

""The Trump administration does not represent the American people on climate,"" said the Rhode Island senator, known for his long-running ""Time to Wake Up"" speeches on global warming in Congress.

""They are doing political work for the fossil fuel industry and the public very much supports climate action,"" he continued, citing a slew of polls to back his point.

For Whitehouse, one of the few remaining pathways to climate safety lies in carbon pricing, which he argued is essential to spark the innovation needed to slash emissions.

""If it's free to pollute, there's really no pathway to safety,"" he said, reiterating his support for Europe's carbon border tax -- a key point of contention with developing countries at COP30.

Trump, who received hundreds of millions of dollars from oil and gas giants during his presidential campaign, pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement for a second time on the day he returned to office.

But he cannot take part in negotiations on the COP's outcome.

Attending the conference itself was made more complicated by resistance from the State Department, he said, which forced him to get his badge through a nonprofit organization.

In August 2021, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) issued a Final Order (Final Order) declaring Goldston Oil Corporation (Goldston) as a Responsible Party with respect to the McBay Oil and Gas State Superfund Site, a 20.32-acre former oil refinery and reclamation plant near Grapeland, Texas. This decision was in connection with a single 1986 sale of 165 barrels of skim oil, allegedly containing two calculated barrels of basic sediment and water (BS&W).

In its Final Order, TCEQ designated Goldston, along with 146 other parties, as a Responsible Party with respect to this Superfund Site and attendant cleanup obligations. TCEQ made this Responsible Party designation under the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act, and exercised jurisdiction over Goldston, when its mere alleged statutory violation was, again, the sale of 165 barrels of skim oil to a third-party as part of a legitimate commercial transaction in 1986 without any knowledge of the purchaser’s planned use of the 165 barrels.

Thus, 35 years after the fact, TCEQ issued this Final Order labeling Goldston as a Responsible Party, with all the attendant legal issues and ramifications. With only 3-weeks notice of the TCEQ hearing to address this matter, the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association (TIPRO) stepped forward in support of Goldston and the broader Texas oil and natural gas industry. TIPRO issued letters to TCEQ Commissioners in support of Goldston and officially engaged with legal counsel, but to no avail. Goldston’s Responsible Party designation was affirmed, despite a lack of corroborating evidence.

Goldston, in Travis County District Court, contested the TCEQ Final Order. TCEQ’s improper usurping of the RRC’s jurisdiction, in derogation of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) and TCEQ, which has been formally memorialized in the Texas Administrative Code, was a centerpiece of Goldston’s position in this Travis County District Court lawsuit.

In connection with Goldston’s legal efforts, and through TIPRO’s steadfast, active involvement, RRC Commissioners meaningfully supported Goldston’s position, specifically with respect to Goldston’s effort to preserve the RRC’s jurisdiction and enforce the Petroleum Exclusion. This support included each Commissioner’s having written correspondence to express to Attorney General Paxton their respective concerns. RRC Chairman Jim Wright prepared and submitted an Affidavit in support of Goldston’s filed Motion for Summary Judgment, which is available here.

Through the pursuit of persistent legal efforts from the representation of counsel Gary Zausmer with Butler Snow LLP and the consistent support from TIPRO over the last four years, Goldston achieved a proposed settlement by July 2025. The Agreed Final Judgment, open for public comment until mid-August 2025, included TCEQ’s release and covenant not to sue Goldston, effectively removing them as a Responsible Party upon finalization, marking the first known outcome in Texas under similar circumstances of challenging this designation for historical skim oil sales.

On November 4, 2025, the Travis County Court Judge officially signed the settlement document. In this extraordinary outcome for Goldston and decisive victory for the Texas oil and natural gas industry, the Travis County District Court approved an Agreed Final Judgment resolving all claims in the litigation (D-1-GN-21-005412) against TCEQ over Goldston’s alleged responsibility for cleanup at the McBay Oil & Gas Superfund Site in Houston County, Texas. Key elements in the agreement include:

Exoneration as Responsible Party: The Court explicitly ruled Goldston is not a Responsible Party under the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act. TCEQ conceded that publicly available exculpatory evidence at the RRC (proving the transaction involved only unused, unrefined, uncontaminated crude oil) would have prevented their initial designation as a Responsible Party, retroactively clearing Goldston of all site-related liabilities.

Full Mutual Releases: TCEQ fully releases Goldston from any past, present, or future claims, costs, or actions tied to the site, Final Order, or litigation, including under state/federal environmental laws (e.g., CERCLA). Goldston receives complete protection from cost recovery, contribution, or indemnity demands.

No-Sue Covenants: TCEQ covenants never to sue or pursue Goldston for site remediation, response costs, or related enforcement, except narrow reservations (e.g., future post-Effective Date activities or criminal matters unrelated to this case). Goldston’s reciprocal covenant is limited to this dispute.

Contribution Protection: Goldston gains ironclad statutory shields (Tex. Health & Safety Code §361.277; CERCLA §§107/113) against third-party claims for recovery or indemnity on matters addressed here, ensuring no downstream financial exposure.

No Payments or Costs: Zero dollars awarded to either party; each bears its own litigation expenses, sparing Goldston and the TCEQ any additional financial burden.

This is a landmark ruling for the Texas oil and gas sector, safeguarding operational predictability and limiting regulatory overreach. By exonerating Goldston from liability as a Responsible Party under the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act for a 1986 transaction involving unused, unrefined, and uncontaminated crude oil, the settlement averts broader industry risks and reinforces key legal protections and jurisdictional constraints.

If this settlement was not achieved, it could have established a concerning norm requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and assume liability for the downstream fate of every barrel sold, potentially spanning decades. This would impose massive administrative and financial burdens, as companies might face retroactive cleanup costs for waste generated by unrelated third parties at distant sites like the McBay Superfund location. The judgment in favor of Goldston eliminates this threat in this context, allowing producers to focus on core operations without perpetual tracking obligations that could stifle innovation and increase costs across Texas’ vast energy market.

The ruling upholds critical exemptions for petroleum under environmental law, confirming that routine, traditional crude oil transactions fall outside the scope of hazardous waste regulations like the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act. This mirrors federal CERCLA exclusions for petroleum not otherwise designated as hazardous, preventing the erosion of protections that have long shielded the industry from undue liability. Without this affirmation, routine sales could trigger Superfund-style claims, exposing companies to unpredictable remediation demands and undermining Texas’ pro-energy framework.

The settlement solidifies the RRC’s primary authority over oil and gas waste management, as evidenced by the reliance on RRC documentation (e.g., Form P-18) to prove the transaction’s legitimacy. This Judgment stands to curb potential encroachment into RRC-regulated domains, such as production, disposal, and recycling of oilfield wastes. By drawing clear lines, it supports efficient oversight under the RRC’s specialized rules, reducing duplicative regulation and ensuring Texas remains a leader in energy production without conflicting agency mandates.

Over the past five days, the Governor stepped up as the leading U.S. presence on the global stage – forging strategic partnerships with world leaders, strengthening international coalitions, and advancing solutions that protect the planet while building sustainable, equitable economies.

The Governor learned about local cultural conservation practices and nature-based solutions that support local livelihoods while protecting the forest. Today’s visit underscored the central role Indigenous communities play in safeguarding the Amazon — and the planet.

Strengthening California’s global climate partnerships at COP30:

Chile: California and Chile signed a memorandum of understanding regarding exchanging information, developing best practices, and cooperating on methane emissions reduction. Methane is a highly potent greenhouse gas and the partnership between California and Chile opens up new opportunities for both partners to cooperate on methane reduction in waste, agriculture and energy sectors.

Colombia: California and Colombia signed a partnership to advance joint efforts on forest conservation, methane reduction, climate resilience, and clean energy development. The memorandum of understanding deepens coordination on protecting the Amazon, strengthening biodiversity, and expanding nature-based climate solutions that support sustainable and equitable economic growth.

Nigeria: California signed a memorandum of understanding with Nigeria on sustainable urban transportation, green ports, low-carbon transportation fuels, climate adaptation, methane detection and abatement policies, greenhouse gas emissions and air quality, and academic exchange and university partnerships. The partnership will build upon our shared commitment to sustainable growth, accelerate the transition to zero-emission transportation, and expand opportunities for the next generation.

Brazil: Governor Newsom signed a declaration of intention with the Brazilian federal government on innovation, as well as a partnership with the State of Pará to strengthen cooperation on wildfire prevention and response — enhancing forest monitoring, identifying areas most at risk, and sharing research and expertise to improve firefighting and emergency management. In September 2025, California announced a new partnership with Brazil to advance market-based carbon pricing programs, clean transportation expansion, including zero-emission vehicles and low-carbon fuels, and strengthen air quality management through enhanced monitoring and regulatory controls. The partnership also focuses on the conservation of 30% of lands and coastal waters by 2030, including nature-based solutions and biodiversity protection.

California’s climate leadership in action

Pollution is down and the economy is up. Greenhouse gas emissions in California are down 21% since 2000 – even as the state’s GDP increased 81% in that same time period, all while becoming the world’s fourth largest economy.

California also continues to set clean energy records. In 2023, the state was powered by two-thirds clean energy, the largest economy in the world to achieve this level. California has also run on 100% clean electricity for part of the day almost every day this year.

Since the beginning of the Newsom Administration, battery storage has reached 16,942 megawatts (MW) and about a 1,200 MW increase in storage capacity in the past six months. Under Governor Newsom’s leadership, California has now built one-third of the storage capacity estimated to be needed by 2045 to reach 100 percent clean electricity.

Supply-chain strains are hitting even the workhorse of the power grid: natural gas turbines.","Two new data centers in Silicon Valley have been built but can’t begin processing information: The equipment that would supply them with electricity isn’t available.

It’s just one example of a crisis facing the U.S. power grid that can’t be solved simply by building more power lines, approving new power generation, or changing out grid software. The equipment needed to keep the grid running – transformers that regulate voltage, circuit breakers that protect against faults, high-voltage cables that carry power across regions, and steel poles that hold the network together – is hard to make, and materials are limited. Supply-chain bottlenecks are taking years to clear, delaying projects, inflating costs and threatening reliability.

Meanwhile, U.S. electricity demand is surging from several sources – electrification of home and business appliances and equipment, increased domestic manufacturing and growth in AI data centers. Without the right equipment, these efforts may take years longer and cost vast sums more than planners expect.

Not enough transformers to replace aging units

Transformers are key to the electricity grid: They regulate voltage as power travels across the wires, increasing voltage for more efficient long-distance transmission, and decreasing it for medium-distance travel and again for delivery to buildings.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that the U.S. has about 60 million to 80 million high-voltage distribution transformers in service. More than half of them are over 33 years old – approaching or exceeding their expected lifespans.

Replacing them has become costly and time-consuming, with utilities reporting that transformers cost four to six times what they cost before 2022, in addition to the multiyear wait times.

To meet rising electricity demand, the country will need many more of them – perhaps twice as many as already exist.

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation says the lead time, the wait between placing an order and the product being delivered, hit roughly 120 weeks – more than two years – in 2024, with large power transformers taking as long as 210 weeks – up to four years. Even smaller transformers used to reduce voltage for distribution to homes and businesses are back-ordered as much as two years. Those delays have slowed both maintenance and new construction across much of the grid.

Transformer production depends heavily on a handful of materials and suppliers. The cores of most U.S transformers use grain-oriented electrical steel, a special type of steel with particular magnetic properties, which is made domestically only by Cleveland-Cliffs at plants in Pennsylvania and Ohio. Imports have long filled the gap: Roughly 80% of large transformers have historically been imported from Mexico, China and Thailand. But global demand has also surged, tightening access to steel, as well as copper, a soft metal that conducts electricity well and is crucial in wiring.

In partial recognition of these shortages, in April 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy delayed the enforcement of new energy-efficiency rules for transformers, to avoid making the situation worse.

Further slowing progress, these items cannot be mass-produced. They must be designed, tested and certified individually.

Even when units are built, getting them to where they are needed can be a feat. Large power transformers often weigh between 100 tons and 400 tons and require specialized transport – sometimes needing one of only about 10 suitable super-heavy-load railcars in the country. Those logistics alone can add months to a replacement project, according to the Department of Energy.

Other key equipment

Transformers are not the only grid machinery facing delays. A Duke University Nicholas Institute study, citing data from research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, shows that high-voltage circuit-breaker lead times reached about 151 weeks – nearly three years – by late 2023, roughly double pre-pandemic norms.

Facing similar delays are a range of equipment types, such as transmission cables that can handle high voltages, switchgear – a technical category that includes switches, circuit breakers and fuses – and insulators to keep electricity from going where it would be dangerous.

For transmission projects, equipment delays can derail timelines. High-voltage direct-current cables now take more than 24 months to procure, and offshore wind projects are particularly strained: Orders for undersea cables can take more than a decade to fill. And fewer than 50 cable-laying vessels operate worldwide, limiting how quickly manufacturers can install them, even once they are manufactured.

Supply-chain strains are hitting even the workhorse of the power grid: natural gas turbines. Manufacturers including Siemens Energy and GE Vernova have multiyear backlogs as new data centers, industrial electrification and peaking-capacity projects flood the order books. Siemens recently reported a record US$158 billion backlog, with some turbine frames sold out for as long as seven years.

Alternate approaches

As a result of these delays, utility companies are finding other ways to meet demand, such as battery storage, actively managing electricity demand, upgrading existing equipment to produce more power, or even reviving decommissioned generation sites.

Some utilities are stockpiling materials for their own use or to sell to other companies, which can shrink delays from years to weeks.

There have been various other efforts, too. In addition to delaying transformer efficiency requirements, the Biden administration awarded Cleveland-Cliffs $500 million to upgrade its electrical-steel plants – but key elements of that grant were canceled by the Trump administration.

Utilities and industry groups are exploring standardized designs and modular substations to cut lead times – but acknowledge that those are medium-term fixes, not quick solutions.

Large government incentives, including grants, loans and guaranteed-purchase agreements, could help expand domestic production of these materials and supplies. But for now, the numbers remain stark: roughly 120 weeks for transformers, up to four years for large units, nearly three years for breakers and more than two years for high-voltage cable manufacturing. Until the underlying supply-chain choke points – steel, copper, insulation materials and heavy transport – expand meaningfully, utilities are managing reliability not through construction, but through choreography.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/702071/original/file-20251112-56-a9byln.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C187%2C6000%2C3000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-14 16:01:34.656532

The funding round was led by MaC Venture Capital with support from Collab Capital. The investment shows strong confidence in 3D solar systems that can reshape renewable energy worldwide.

Traditional solar panels cover large flat areas on rooftops or open fields. This approach uses a lot of land and misses much of the day’s available sunlight. The Sun moves across the sky, but flat panels capture energy best only when it is directly overhead.

Janta Power takes a different approach. The company’s pivoting solar towers stack panels vertically to create a compact three-dimensional structure that captures more sunlight throughout the day. Think of it as the solar version of a skyscraper: more power from less ground space.

NEVER NEED AN EV CHARGING STATION AGAIN WITH THESE ROOFTOP SOLAR POWER PANELS

Each tower uses smart tracking software that follows the Sun’s path from sunrise to sunset. By adjusting its position throughout the day, the system collects more sunlight than traditional fixed panels. This design allows the towers to produce about 50% more energy while using only one-third of the land required by flat-panel systems.

Because of their vertical orientation, the towers can capture sunlight during early morning and late afternoon when flat arrays are least efficient. The result is a steadier flow of electricity across the entire day, reducing stress on power grids and lowering the need for short-term backup plants.

Janta’s towers are also built for strength. Each structure can withstand winds up to 170 miles per hour. The towers feature durable steel frames and modular foundations that simplify installation in a wide range of environments.

Pilot programs are already operating at Munich International Airport, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, and facilities managed by Aena, which oversees more than 70 airports worldwide.

The company’s 3D geometry gives each site a capacity factor of around 32%, compared to roughly 22% for flat panels. This greater efficiency lowers the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) to about $0.05 per kilowatt-hour, well below the global average of $0.15.

That advantage can make renewable power more accessible for industries such as data centers, universities and telecom operations that need reliable and consistent energy.

For businesses and communities, Janta Power’s technology could mean smaller solar installations that deliver more energy for less money. Because the towers need less land, they can fit into urban areas, airports or industrial zones that could not host traditional solar farms.

For everyday consumers, these innovations can bring cleaner, more stable and more affordable power to local grids while supporting a greener energy future.

The Empire State was on the precipice of fully enacting the All-Electric Buildings Act that Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul signed in 2023. The first-in-the-nation standard requires most new buildings to install efficient, electric appliances such as heat pumps instead of health-harming gas, propane, and fuel-oil systems. Regulators finalized the rules in July; they were set to take effect Dec. 31.

But on Wednesday, the state agreed to not enforce the zero-emissions standard until the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals makes its decision on a two-year-old lawsuit challenging the All-Electric Buildings Act. Climate-advocacy nonprofit Earthjustice expects that’ll delay the landmark building code until at least the fall of 2026, as oral arguments have yet to be scheduled.

The legislation ​“was a promise that New York would stop locking families into expensive, polluting fossil-fuel systems and start building for the future,” said Democratic Assemblymember Gabriella Romero on a Thursday call with reporters. ​“Delaying this law is a total betrayal of that promise.”

Putting the all-electric building code on ice is an abrupt about-face for the administration. On Oct. 1, the state filed a brief saying that New Yorkers would ​“suffer irreparable harm if the Code amendments are delayed from taking effect,” because it would allow new buildings to depend on fossil-fuel equipment that would generate greenhouse gases and local air pollution for decades to come. That, in turn, would drive up the health, agriculture, and broader economy costs imposed by worsening climate catastrophes.

But just over one month later, Hochul signaled openness to pausing the law after a group of 19 Democratic state legislators raised concerns about its affordability and impact on the grid. Multiple studies have found that the grid has ample room for all-electric new buildings, and making them the default would benefit the planet and people’s pocketbooks.

Hochul’s office has positioned the delay as a pragmatic step that could expedite implementation of the rule in the long term. By voluntarily pausing the law, Hochul may be trying to avoid a potentially multiyear holdup should the case reach the U.S. Supreme Court and get on its ​“shadow docket.” That emergency process is typically less transparent than the court’s usual decision-making protocol.

“The Governor remains committed to the all-electric-buildings law and believes this action will help the State defend it, as well as reduce regulatory uncertainty for developers during this period of litigation,” Ken Lovett, energy and environment spokesperson for Hochul, told Canary Media. She’s ​“resolved to providing more affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy for New Yorkers.”

Earthjustice argues that there’s no reason to expect that the groups challenging the law would’ve been able to hamper its implementation if the state hadn’t made the concession itself.

The plaintiffs in the case — including the New York State Builders Association, National Association of Home Builders, and National Propane Gas Association — allege that the federal Energy Policy and Conservation Act preempts the all-electric buildings law. That same reasoning was used to overturn Berkeley, California’s pioneering gas ban. In July, New York prevailed when a federal district judge in the state rejected the argument.

Hochul’s decision to slow-roll building electrification is part of her administration’s realpolitik embrace of fossil fuels. Last Friday, New York regulators signed off on a Trump-backed underwater gas pipeline, after having denied the requisite permits three times before. The same day, her administration announced a deal to allow a gas plant that mainly powers cryptocurrency mining to keep operating for at least five years. She also has yet to sign a bill that repeals gas-hookup subsidies. Legislators passed it in June.

Hochul justified recent moves by saying the state needs to ​“govern in reality.”

“We are facing war against clean energy from Washington Republicans, including our New York delegation, which is why we have adopted an all-of-the-above approach,” she said last week in a statement.

Democratic Assemblymember Sarahana Shrestha said she’s deeply concerned about the administration’s trajectory. Reducing the lethal and expensive harms born of the climate crisis ​“is not an optional goal,” she said. ​“Really, we’re talking about a disruption to our economy if we don’t act — in the same way the pandemic disrupted our economy.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2217332123.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=bd7db0f30e6c6f489573564316ebc059,N,,2025-11-14 18:01:54.953361

In Carlisle, a sleepy town in the heart of Pennsylvania Trump country, solar energy appears to have escaped the black hole of partisan politics. Or at least, that’s been the experience of Carlisle Area School District superintendent Colleen Friend, who has met little resistance spearheading a project to install a solar array about the size of a football field at a local elementary school.

The project is itself the beneficiary of a political anomaly, the $25 million “Solar for Schools” initiative. The bill that created it last year made it through Pennsylvania’s divided state government even though basically nothing else on energy policy has reached the governor’s desk in recent years.

It also remains one of the few policy bright spots for clean energy advocates in the state budget deal struck on Wednesday, which saw the program re-upped for another year, even as Democratic leadership agreed to exit a potentially paradigm-shifting regional carbon cap-and-trade program.

Friend isn’t surprised that Solar for Schools proved a survivor in a budget battle that dragged on for months. The bill signing ceremony in Harrisburg last year was “very bipartisan,” she said. Her school district received $252,000 in funding for the ongoing project, and Friend now plans to apply for more.

“We already know the next building we’re going to put a solar array at,” she said.

But does distributed solar — the diffuse installation of small-scale arrays on the roofs and lawns of homes, businesses and municipal buildings — present a wider bipartisan opportunity to move climate policy forward in the acrimonious world of Pennsylvania politics?

Long a fossil fuel juggernaut with bountiful reserves of coal and gas, Pennsylvania at one point was also considered an innovator on renewable energy. But it has since fallen into position as a national laggard. Fights over fracking and former Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s move to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the interstate cap-and-trade program known as RGGI, had ground down any progress in the space to next to nothing.

On paper, distributed solar appears to have breakthrough potential. Solar for Schools’ wide bipartisan support last year followed what advocates describe as a herculean effort by its sponsor, state Rep. Elizabeth Fiedler. The Philadelphia Democrat and chair of the House Energy Committee toured the state to discuss its opportunities, focusing on economic benefits and reaching across the aisle.

Flora Cardoni, deputy director of the nonprofit PennEnvironment, helped champion the program and said it proved to be a rousing success in its first year, with 88 applications requesting $88 millionin funding, more than three times what the budget allowed. Ultimately, 73 schools were awarded a total of $22.6 million in May.

“There’s clear demand, that more schools applied for the Solar for Schools grants than were able to receive an award,” Cardoni said. “We would just love to see even more schools follow their lead.”

Distributed solar also stands to benefit from deregulatory policy, a potential attraction for conservatives. Among five energy-related statehouse bills packaged under Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s “Lightning Plan,” the one that promises to adjust regulations to facilitate “community energy” projects — picture neighbors subscribing to a local communal solar array — has garnered the most bipartisan support.

Distributed solar can also avoid perhaps the biggest hurdle to solar development in Pennsylvania at present: the backed-up queue of grid operator PJM Interconnection, which oversees large, utility-scale energy development. Utility-scale renewable projects are waiting years for approval to hook in, but distributed solar skips that step entirely.

Ron Celentano, president of the Pennsylvania Solar & Storage Industries Association, thinks it has high potential. He points to a 2018 analysis by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection that found rooftop solar could account for 10 percent to 35 percent of all solar power in the state by 2030, if lawmakers enact solar-friendly policies.

“I tend to push hard on [distributed solar], because it’s often a missed opportunity in a lot of areas,” Celentano said.

And yet, advocates wonder how much ground can be covered, especially in light of the new budget agreement. Cardoni believes that RGGI could have generated about $1 billion annually for Pennsylvania to invest in clean energy technologies while forcing a market shift toward renewables, an impact that dwarfs an additional $25 million slated for the second year of Solar for Schools.

In the lead-up to the budget breakthrough, advocates had also heard that Lightning Plan bills could be part of the negotiations. But in the end, there was nothing to suggest that any of them, including the community energy bill, would be brought up for a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate.

“We would need to get a lot of policies like that passed to make up for RGGI in terms of carbon reduction,” Cardoni said.

And even the calculus behind Solar for Schools is shifting. Advocates say that many school districts had planned to combine state grant money with federal financial incentives covering another 30 percent to 50 percent of costs, depending on demographic factors. But those credits are now scheduled to expire next year after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act rolled them back.

With a deadline to start construction looming next summer, Celentano said that timelines are getting tight for school districts to go through bidding and design, never mind finding a contractor in the midst of a rush.

Pennsylvania schools continue solar projects despite tax rollbacks

Adding to the problem is what Celentano said are delays at Pennsylvania electric utilities such as PECO and PPL, which have their own waiting lines for applicants seeking to connect rooftop solar and other similarly sized ground arrays to the grid. PECO did not respond to requests for comment, but a spokesperson for PPL confirmed that approval for larger examples of such projects may take “one to three years, depending on complexity.”

“We remain committed to processing interconnection applications as quickly and efficiently as possible,” PPL spokesperson Dana Burns wrote in an email, adding that the utility is “actively working to minimize delays and prioritize transparency and communication with applicants.”

No schools districts have yet announced abandoning their plans, but Celentano said some clients have asked him to run new analyses on what costs will be without federal tax credits. He predicts many projects wouldn’t survive a scenario in which they lose up to half of their funding via federal incentives, and the impact on interest for a second year of funding remains unknown.

“There’s a little bit of concern to some of these schools: Are we going to make it?” Celentano said.

Bipartisan Opportunities

On paper, distributed solar has political potential across red and blue counties in Pennsylvania. In a September report analyzing the first year of Solar for Schools, PennEnvironment calculated that approximately 5,000 schools across the commonwealth have the physical capacity to install solar. Collectively, they would save a potential $342 million over the lifetime of the systems, while powering the equivalent of 187,000 homes and reducing carbon emissions by the equivalent of 300,000 cars.

“The rooftops of Pennsylvania’s roughly 5,000 schools are often flat and unshaded, making them excellent sites for solar panels,” the report noted.

What’s more, rural counties, with their often-abundant space, stand to benefit considerably. PennEnvironment calculated that Lancaster County, quintessential home of the Pennsylvania Dutch, had the second highest cost-savings potential, after Pittsburgh’s Allegheny County. And while the nonprofit found that the 20 counties that stand to save the most in total are the most populated, it is mostly rural counties that would save the most per school.

“That just speaks to the vast savings potential,” Cardoni said.

The 2018 Department of Environmental Protection solar potential report calculated that distributed solar would also employ more people than large “grid-scale” arrays, at about 3 to 5 jobs per megawatt hour installed, compared to less than 2.5 jobs.

In a high-end scenario where 35 percent of the state’s solar mix came from rooftop arrays, the analysis predicted the creation of more than 32,000 total jobs. That’s about triple the current number employed in Pennsylvania’s waning coal industry.

Fiedler, the Solar for Schools sponsor, said she leaned into the economic benefits of solar and sought the support of labor unions as she traveled across the commonwealth stumping for the program. It worked: In final votes on the legislation last year, 10 of 101 House Republicans and 21 of 28 Republican senators joined all Democrats in voting yes.

“We think as individual households the bills that we get are high,” Fielder said. “And they are, they’re going up. But for school districts it’s even more—add a couple of zeros on the end.”

Jim Gregory, a former three-term Republican state representative who is now executive director of the Pennsylvania Conservative Energy Network, said he also makes economic and reliability arguments when lobbying his former colleagues on supporting renewable energy. He believes the political gridlock on energy will have to give way soon, given dramatically escalating electricity ratesfor consumers in the state. He’s pitching solar as an important and quickly scalable option within an “all of the above” energy strategy, with the ability to take “pressure” off fossil fuel supplies.

“We can’t continue to do nothing. … The pain is going to overcome the fear that people have of a pipeline in their backyard on the Left, or a solar field on the farmer’s property next to theirs in rural Pennsylvania,” Gregory said.

But it’s not clear how much wider bipartisan support for solar truly exists in the legislature. Some efforts this year seem to have stalled out.

Democratic State Rep. Peter Schweyer’s community energy bill passed the House in May by a 114-89 margin, with more Republican support than Solar for Schools received. But the bill has remained in a Senate committee ever since, with no signs of movement even in the wake of a budget deal.

Democratic State Rep. Robert Merski, meanwhile, introduced a measure to put solar on municipal buildings like firehouses. But that legislation has remained stuck in a House committee since January.

And the cross-party coalition on these issues appears somewhat fragile.

State Rep. Craig Williams, a Republican from Delaware County in the Philadelphia suburbs, voted for both Solar for Schools and the community energy bill and said he believes there is a dire need to adjust state energy policy in the midst of rapidly rising costs.

“I’m trying to work across the aisle to get any form of generation online that’s clean and sustainable,” Williams said, adding he finds geothermal and nuclear particularly promising.

But Williams, a former PECO assistant general counsel, has also at times proved a thorn in the side of solar advocates, introducing amendments to legislation that they fear could negatively impact net metering, the way that owners of distributed solar panels receive financial compensation from utilities.

Williams said he thinks the current compensation system unfairly increases costs for non-solar owners, an issue utilities have also raised to state regulators. Solar advocates dispute that. Celentano said he’s pressed for evidence of such a cost shift, “and they can never show us the data.”

For Williams, discussions about advancing solar and community-generation policies are also part of an all-of-the-above strategy. He wants to see Democrats move off long-held positions against bringing new fossil fuel power plants online, citing concerns about power demand outstripping supply.

“There is a tremendous opportunity if we can get out of our own way,” Williams said.

What Next?

Numerous advocates said they believe Fiedler’s Solar for Schools program has benefited from a unique combination of her persistent efforts, fortunate timing and the non-controversial nature of saving school districts money. One former clean energy lobbyist, speaking on the condition of anonymity after taking a job with a public entity, said a one-off program with $25 million in the bank is more politically palatable than something with wider ramifications, like a community energy bill that could shift how electricity is generated and distributed in Pennsylvania.

“It’s a little bit of an easier selling point than saying, ‘Hey let’s create a whole new system of microgrids that the utilities see as an existential threat,’” the former lobbyist said, adding that he thinks supporters would be wise to focus on rising consumer costs. “I think that argument has not been made. And into that vacuum have come the utilities that quietly whispered in the ears of the Pennsylvania Senate to say, ‘Hey, this could hurt us.’”

The recent budget deal did little to boost hopes. Advocates note that a House vote on H.B. 501, the so-called PRESS bill that would elevate renewables in the state’s energy mix, has now been set for Monday, an apparent consolation prize to climate advocates upset about RGGI. But there’s no indication Senate Republican leadership will also bring it up in their chamber.

Similarly, the budget includes language that would clear the way for the state to use $156 million in federal “Solar for All” funding, which would install rooftop solar in low-income areas in Pennsylvania. But the fate of that Biden-era federal appropriation remains tied up in the court system after the Trump administration attempted to cancel it.

Sharon Pillar, executive director of the nonprofit Pennsylvania Solar Center, suggests that solar supporters may have better luck focusing not on the legislature but on the state Public Utility Commission, which has the power to draft new rules for utilities. In early November, the advocacy group Vote Solar launched a petitionasking the commission to require more transparency on utilities’ solar connection queues and also create “clear, enforceable timelines” for applications.

“If the state can fix those things—if they’re willing to—then we can be moving this forward without a lot of other action,” Pillar said.

In an email, PUC spokesperson Nils Hagen-Frederiksen said the commission has “not been made aware” of any backlogs for small-scale projects like residential rooftop solar, which he said are often given same-day, automatic approval for standard designs. But larger, more complex commercial arrays, he said , take more time to process given cost and safety consideration, along with an application rush ahead of federal incentive sunsets.

“The Commission continues to review interconnection-related issues statewide to ensure that the process remains timely, transparent, and fair for all customers,” Hagen-Frederiksen wrote.",https://www.alleghenyfront.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/climate-change-pa-farmers-6-solar-panel-768x511.jpeg.webp,N,,2025-11-14 15:00:30.907868

Alaska LNG, a branch of the New York City and Anchorage-based Glenfarne energy company, and energy technology giant BakerHughes announced an alliance that will bring to reality and accelerate plans for a nearly 1,000-mile, 42-inch LNG pipeline down the middle of the Last Frontier, and a corresponding terminal on the Kenai peninsula.

The 807-mile pipeline is projected to begin near Prudhoe Bay on the Arctic Ocean and run down to Nikiski – a village halfway between Anchorage and Homer.

Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum announced the agreement, with Glenfarne CEO Brendan Duval saying that BakerHughes’ partnership on the project is a big deal due to the company’s expertise in LNG compression technology.

Duval said the deal reflects an increased momentum toward the mega-project’s future realization and praised the project’s ability to attract “global partners [in order] to achieve national and state energy objectives.”

“Alaska LNG has the potential to be one of the most significant energy infrastructure projects in our nation’s history,” Wright said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

“Today’s investment announcement is an important step forward for the project, prosperity in Alaska, and the energy security of America and our allies. The Trump administration remains committed to unleashing Alaska’s energy potential, including by supporting Alaska LNG.”

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum added that U.S. LNG is “not just an energy source [but] a strategic asset that powers our economy.”

Burgum, who chairs the National Energy Dominance Council, added that Glenfarne and BakerHughes working together will undoubtedly bear fruit in terms of new energy infrastructure that will create long-term affordable power for Americans that is based in America.

BakerHughes chairman Lorenzo Simonelli said in a statement that natural gas provides secure and reliable energy at an affordable rate to consumers. Simonelli also touted its lower carbon output than other fuels.

BURGUM, ZELDIN, WRIGHT: THIS IS HOW AMERICA WILL ACHIEVE ENERGY DOMINANCE

According to reports, the project will include a carbon-capture plant on Alaska’s remote North Slope that will have the capacity to remove seven million tons of carbon dioxide from the project annually.

Alaska’s energy potential has been repeatedly touted by Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who previously told Fox News Digital he is interested in an all-of-the-above approach devoid of politics that instead focuses on what will work and what will keep energy jobs in Alaska and the U.S. writ large versus overseas.

Dunleavy and Alaska officials battled the Biden administration over what they called intentional roadblocks against natural resources exploration in places like Ambler and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge’s Section 1002; commonly dubbed ANWR.

As COP30 faces the reality of changing the global energy sector, five areas are worth watching: Carbon markets.
COP30 will refine carbon pricing, trading and nature-based offsets regulations to support investment in low-carbon supply or abatement solutions.
Given the track record of US participation in global climate initiatives, what can we expect from the US at COP30?
Leading hyperscalers have invested in zero carbon power technologies such as advanced nuclear power in 2025.","At the outset of the United Nations in 1945, US President Harry Truman acknowledged a global challenge ahead. “We all have to recognize – no matter how great our strength – that we must deny ourselves the license to do always as we please.” Truman was referring to prioritising problem-solving for the good of the world over national interests. And making climate change a priority for all countries will remain a challenge at the latest iteration of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, COP30.

Progress on lowering global carbon emissions is stubbornly slow. In our latest Energy Transition Outlook, the world is on a 2.6 °C emissions pathway, with the 1.5 °C pathway increasingly out of reach. Energy security and affordability, rather than climate, have risen to the top of the agenda for many countries around the world. Meanwhile, gas-fired power investment, primarily in the US, is surging, driven by AI.

New nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that are due at COP30 lack the ambition to meet the Paris climate accord goals. Protestors who tested COP30’s security earlier this week illustrate the challenge of managing multiple stakeholders, each with specific priorities.

With these issues on the table, COP30 has been billed as ‘the implementation COP’. This means it will develop existing climate policies, rather than announce a range of new goals. As COP30 faces the reality of changing the global energy sector, five areas are worth watching:

Carbon markets. COP30 will refine carbon pricing, trading and nature-based offsets regulations to support investment in low-carbon supply or abatement solutions.

China’s pledges. China will likely outperform its latest climate pledge to expand wind and solar capacity sixfold by 2035. Rather than its NDC, watch how fast China expands its low-carbon supply chain.

US policy. With the US out of the Paris Agreement for the second time, state-level policies, load growth and corporate policies will be the primary drivers of low-carbon investment in America.

Expanding biofuels. The Belém Commitment for Sustainable Fuels, known as Belém 4x, intends to quadruple the production and use of sustainable fuels, including hydrogen and its derivatives, biogases, biofuels and synthetic fuels, by 2035.

CBAM compliance. As Europe begins to scale its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), developing countries will likely seek longer phase-in periods and industry carve-outs to comply with carbon taxes over time.

For COP30, the absence of the US is the elephant in the room. As the world’s largest economy, second-largest carbon emitter and the largest oil and gas producer in the world, the US can influence the pace of low-carbon investment globally. Describing the Paris Agreement as an “unfair, one-sided rip-off”, President Donald Trump withdrew the US from it on his first day in office in 2025.

The US has an on-again, off-again relationship with global climate governance. President Bill Clinton signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1998, but the US Senate feared the Kyoto Protocol could “result in serious harm to the economy of the United States”, stopping Congressional ratification in its tracks. President George W. Bush withdrew the US from the Kyoto Protocol in 2001. Since 2015, the US has joined and exited the Paris Agreement twice.

Given the track record of US participation in global climate initiatives, what can we expect from the US at COP30?

The Wood Mackenzie view

Although the US is out of the Paris Agreement, it is still influencing global policy on climate change. For example, strong resistance from the US administration caused the International Maritime Organization to delay a vote on whether to adopt its Net Zero Framework. But while the US is out of the climate agreement now, it is not out of decarbonisation altogether. Far from it.

After the US election of President Trump in 2024, ExxonMobil urged the Trump administration to stay in the Paris Agreement to influence global carbon policy and international regulations that could impact US companies. According to a study from the UCLA Anderson School of Management, 57% of the S&P 500 companies have net zero and carbon neutrality goals. Leading hyperscalers have invested in zero carbon power technologies such as advanced nuclear power in 2025.

What is also clear is that the US power market will need renewables going forward. According to Patrick Huang, Senior Analyst, US power, “Our Lens Power platform shows that the combination of 2% to 3% per year demand growth, coal retirements and limits to natural gas-fired power means the US power grid requires several hundred gigawatts of new solar and wind capacity through 2035.”

Huang concludes: “Renewable power is still the lowest-cost option to meet power demand.”

At COP30, the leading voice for renewable power will be the US Climate Alliance, chaired by California Governor Gavin Newsom. The group’s 24 governors represent 57% of US GDP and 54% of its population, according to the group. The states within the alliance outpaced the national average in net emissions reductions by 8% between 2005 and 2023, according to its figures.

State-level policy remains critical to low-carbon investment in the transport sector. According to the California Air Resource Board, the state’s clean fuels standard supported US$4 billion in new investments in low- or zero-emissions transport technologies such as biodiesel, biogasoline and electric vehicles. Low-carbon fuel standards have expanded across the western US to include Washington, Oregon and New Mexico.

Federal government policy will no doubt change as a result of future presidential elections, but state-level autonomy remains a bedrock of the US energy sector. According to Lindsey Entwistle, coauthor of Wood Mackenzie’s Energy Transition Outlook, in our base case outlook between 2025 and 2060, US emissions fall by 60%. In our delayed transition scenario, which posits a slower investment pathway for low-carbon supply, emissions fall by 43% over the same time period.

In brief

‘The Art of the Deal’ for strategic sectors

In early November, Vulcan Elements and ReElement Technologies announced a US$1.4 billion private-public partnership with the US government and private investors. The partnership aims to build a new 10,000-metric tonne magnet production facility.

ReElement’s technology will recycle and refine rare-earth oxides, which Vulcan will then convert into completed high-performance magnets. While this announcement will not end China’s dominance in global rare earths production and supply, it is a step towards establishing a US-led supply chain.

This announcement reflects how the Trump administration approaches strategic sectors: moving beyond policy support, such as tax incentives, to partnering with specific companies via equity investing, profit sharing and loans. Key examples include the administration’s 10% equity stake in Intel, a 15% profit share of Nvidia chip sales to China and the potential for equity with Brookfield’s $80 billion investment announcement in US nuclear.

Tariffs are still likely despite Supreme Court review

The US Supreme Court is reviewing President Trump’s authority to impose trade tariffs, a major challenge to the president.

The Trump administration argues that the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) empowers the executive branch to impose tariffs. The counterargument is that the US Constitution says tariffs are Congress’ domain unless it delegates the specific authority on tariffs to the president. According to initial reports, justices questioned the administration's argument that IEEPA's ambiguous power to “regulate” imports includes the authority to levy tariffs.

Regardless of what happens at the Supreme Court, the Trump administration has laid the groundwork for more Section 232 and 301 tariffs in the future. So far this year, the Trump administration has opened investigations that could lead to new or expanded tariffs for critical minerals, polysilicon, wind turbines and semiconductors.

Houston’s Power and Trading Conference

Wood Mackenzie presented our short-term power market analysis this week to break down how large loads are reshaping gas and power markets in the US. Rebekah Llamas, Principal Analyst, noted the scale of large loads, highlighting, for instance, Lake Mariner, a data centre in New York, which represents approximately 9% of NYISO Zone A demand.

One crucial question for power markets is how price-responsive large loads are. There is clear price-responsive behavior above US$100/MWh thresholds, with facilities reducing consumption during high-price periods and backfilling from onsite generation or storage resources. Looking at Tesla’s gigafactory in Texas, we are seeing a spike in electricity consumption ahead of congestion-driven price rises, according to Wood Mackenzie’s short-term power analysis.

Concentrated demand creates significant basis risk that must be actively managed. RTOs across the country will need to revise and update short-term load-planning methodologies to inform long-term investments. “Real-time visibility tools provide trading advantages for those who can detect unforecasted load ramps,” according to Llamas.

Wildcard of the week

Introducing a new occasional section in the Energy Pulse: the wildcard of the week. This is intended to identify a specific trend, announcement or investment that could impact the US energy sector in unanticipated ways. As we wrote about in last week’s Energy Pulse, a proposed rulemaking from the Department of Energy (DOE) could accelerate large load interconnections to the US grid.

The wildcard here will be the reaction from the power sector. According to Ben Hertz-Shargel, Director Grid Edge, greater Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) jurisdiction would be fought tooth and nail by states and utilities in the stakeholder process and then the courts. Further, the utility industry is likely to support FERC’s existing authorities over a federal takeover. Nevertheless, the real opportunity is for FERC and the states to take up the DOE's recommendations within existing jurisdictional limits.

If events go that way, we could see acceleration of large load co-location with generation and a host of new partnerships. Look out for industry comments to the DOE rulemaking from 21 November.

Quote of the week

“We have significant lending authority at the loan program office… by far the biggest use of those dollars will be for nuclear power plants – to get those first plants built.” US Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Chris Wright at the American Nuclear Society Conference on 10 November.

On the heels of the US$80 billion investment announcement in nuclear power last week, Secretary Wright highlighted the key role that the loan program office (LPO) will have in supporting new nuclear power investments – the DOE can redirect spending in line with the executive branch’s priorities. Nuclear power could receive a larger share of DOE grants or loans as the Trump administration shapes the LPO. The Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act appropriated around US$400 billion to the LPO, according to external sources.

Chart of the week

From our latest quarterly outlook on the global geothermal sector. Our geothermal team believes the sector is shifting its focus from expansion to execution as policy support, technological innovation and surging data centre demand converge. Data centre growth is emerging as a critical driver for US power where baseload power requirements are accelerating partnerships between technology companies and geothermal developers.

Moreover, the inclusion of CAFO-based projects can make such developments more attractive to ESG-oriented investors who value not only carbon reductions but also traceability and independent verification of feedstock and emissions.

Certification under Green-e® now also means animal-waste-based RNG projects can benefit from enhanced reputational and risk-mitigation value. By complying with Appendix A, these projects demonstrate that they meet rigorous environmental and sustainability safeguards—such as community input, wildlife and water-quality protections—and strict feedstock definition for CAFOs. This third-party guardrail reduces investor risk around feedstock legitimacy or public-relations concerns (often associated with large animal operations) and allows developers to anchor a certification label in their marketing and contracting. In turn, investors may view certified RNG from animal waste as lower-risk and more bankable, especially when paired with offtake contracts or voluntary-buyer portfolios requiring certified credentials.

Although the future of financial incentives for RNG projects on the public side is a little more uncertain and subject to some growing pains in the near term, the development of the voluntary credit market for these projects is a welcome relief.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15872_4946.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 15:00:58.659477

The proposed changes are largely intended to reduce reporting obligations, exempting from reporting finished goods imports (referred to as “imported articles” under TSCA), de minimis uses of PFAS, and certain PFAS considered manufacturing byproducts or chemical impurities.

The proposed changes will proceed to public comment and could become effective as soon as early 2026. The reporting window is expected to be available to regulated entities in the middle of 2026, opening 60 days after the effective date of the final rule and closing after three months.

In addition to the proposed exemptions, EPA has published updates to the TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule website, a Frequently Asked Questions document, an Instructions for Reporting document, and a press release discussing the proposed rule that may assist businesses in understanding the scope of and rationale for these new exemptions.

EPA’s Six Proposed Exemptions

EPA is proposing six specific exemptions to the TSCA PFAS reporting rule, with the goal of providing “both regulatory relief and greater regulatory certainty to regulated parties, resulting in a net reduction in cost while retaining the majority of PFAS manufacture reporting requirements.” The six currently proposed exemptions are as follows:

Imported Articles. EPA intends to exempt imported articles from reporting, noting that “importing PFAS in articles between 2011-2022 is an activity about which manufacturers are unlikely to have known or reasonably ascertainable information.”

De Minimis Exemption of 0.1%. Reporting would not be required for PFAS in mixtures or products at concentrations of 0.1% or lower. This low-concentration exemption would apply regardless of the total production volume of the mixture or article.

Certain Byproducts. Byproducts are chemical substances produced during the manufacture, processing, use, or disposal of another chemical substance. EPA is proposing to exempt “any byproduct not used for commercial purposes.”

Certain Impurities. Impurities are chemical substances unintentionally present within another chemical substance. EPA would not require reporting as to PFAS impurities, which have “no distinct commercial purpose apart from the substance, mixture, or article in which they are contained.”

Research and Development (“R&D”). EPA proposes to exclude reporting related to PFAS manufactured or imported when done so only for R&D purposes.

Non-Isolated Intermediates. EPA proposes an exemption for non-isolated intermediates because these substances usually remain in a closed system and therefore “do not result in meaningful human or environmental exposure.”

No exemptions specifically for small manufacturers are contemplated, although some of these proposed exemptions may apply to many small manufacturers.

What Aspects of the Reporting Rule Remain the Same?

EPA has left many of the key aspects of the TSCA PFAS reporting rule unchanged, including the following:

Due Diligence Standard: A reporting entity is still expected to report information that is known to the entity or reasonably ascertainable by the entity.

Definition of PFAS:

The broad definition of PFAS under the rule remains the same: “Any chemical substance or mixture containing a chemical substance that structurally contains at least one of the following three sub-structures:

R-(CF2)-CF(R′)R″, where both the CF2 and CF moieties are saturated carbons;

R-CF2OCF2-R′, where R and R′ can either be F, O, or saturated carbons;

CF3C(CF3)R′R″, where R′ and R″ can either be F or saturated carbons.”

Lookback Period: The relevant reporting lookback period remains the 11 years between January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2022.

Confidential Business Information & Joint Submissions: Requirements for claiming confidential business information, as well as options to complete joint submissions with suppliers or vendors, remain the same.

Data Required for Submission: Where reporting is required under EPA’s proposed rule, the information required to be reported remains the same. (See BCLP’s Insight on the original TSCA PFAS reporting rule for further details on the substantive reporting requirements.) The following information must be reported:

Company and facility information;

Chemical-specific information, including chemical identity and molecular structure;

Information on industrial processing and use (what industries use the reported chemical and for what purposes);

Information on consumer and commercial use (who uses the reported chemical downstream and for what purposes);

Quantities of each reported chemical manufactured, produced, or imported for each calendar year from 2011 to 2022;

""All existing information concerning the environmental and health effects” of the reported PFAS chemicals in the company’s possession or control, which is not limited to information published since 2011;

Information regarding worker exposure for the reported chemicals, including the number of individuals exposed, activities performed by the workers, and exposure scenarios and duration; and

Information regarding disposal of the reported PFAS chemicals, including amounts and disposal methods.

Next Steps for Reporting Entities

Public comments are due on the proposed rule 45 days after the rule is published in the Federal Register. The rule would likely be finalized in early 2026, with the reporting window set to open 60 days after the effective date of the final rule and remaining open for three months. This submission period may be shorter than the current reporting window, set to close on October 13, 2026, as EPA has indicated it believes that “reporters have had adequate time to consider how they intend to comply with the rule.”",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15569_1953.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 14:01:29.790936

Click here to read Governor Stein’s and Commissioner Causey’s letter in support of H.R.","Today Governor Josh Stein and Commissioner of Insurance Mike Causey called on Congress to pass H.R. 3161, the Preventing Environmental Hazards Act of 2025, a bill co-introduced by Congressman Greg Murphy (NC-03). H.R. 3161 would create more proactive support for coastal homeowners whose homes are at risk of collapse. In recent weeks, severe weather events have caused homes in Buxton and Rodanthe to collapse into the ocean.

“Since 2020, 27 oceanfront houses have collapsed into the ocean on North Carolina’s Outer Banks, including 16 houses just since this September. When these houses collapse, it isn’t just a tragedy for the homeowners. The destroyed houses also spread debris for miles and risk people’s safety on our beaches,” said Governor Stein and Commissioner Causey. “We respectfully urge the House Financial Services Committee to advance and Congress to pass H.R. 3161. The State stands ready to work with you to protect coastal communities, taxpayers, and our treasured Outer Banks.”

The implementation of H.R. 3161 would help North Carolina move from a stance of after-the-fact cleanup to proactive relocation or removal of oceanfront structures that are under threat. The bipartisan bill would authorize the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to offer pre-collapse coverage so that homeowners could demolish or relocate condemned structures before they fall into the ocean. This recommendation aligns with a key idea from a joint report by the National Park Service (NPS) and the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) that was released in August 2024.

Leopold, Ashley T.K. Phillips, Jason A. Hill",,,,,https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/11/texas-granted-primacy-over-class-vi-wells,"Primacy is viewed as a critical step toward streamlining and significantly accelerating the permitting process for carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects across the state.
Texas is now the sixth state to receive primacy for its Class VI UIC program from EPA, joining Arizona, West Virginia, Louisiana, Wyoming and North Dakota.
The EPA will conduct regular reviews of the RRC's Class VI UIC program to ensure that it is effective and continues to meet or exceed federal standards.
Texas' Class VI UIC primacy solidifies its position as a leader for the development of the CCS industry in the U.S.
With the regulatory landscape for Class VI UIC in Texas firming up, the implementation of commercial-scale CO2 storage in the state is expected to accelerate.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Nov. 12, 2025, announced a final rule granting the State of Texas primary implementation and enforcement authority (also known as primacy) for Class VI Underground Injection Control (UIC) wells when EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin signed the pre-publication version of the final rule on behalf of the agency.

This important decision supports cooperative federalism goals by transferring the sole authority for permitting wells used for geologic carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration from the EPA to the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC). Primacy is viewed as a critical step toward streamlining and significantly accelerating the permitting process for carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects across the state. Texas is now the sixth state to receive primacy for its Class VI UIC program from EPA, joining Arizona, West Virginia, Louisiana, Wyoming and North Dakota. The final rule will become effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register, which is expected at any time.

As analyzed in Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""The Path to Class VI Primacy in Texas: MOA Reveals State and Federal Review,"" the EPA and RRC established a memorandum of agreement detailing how application reviews would be coordinated during the transition, as well as how EPA will provide oversight to the RRC. The EPA will conduct regular reviews of the RRC's Class VI UIC program to ensure that it is effective and continues to meet or exceed federal standards. Accordingly, the EPA will maintain a seat beside the RRC in a role of programmatic review.

Texas' Class VI UIC primacy solidifies its position as a leader for the development of the CCS industry in the U.S. This grant of primacy to the RRC is anticipated to reduce ""red tape"" and delays associated with federal EPA review, which can take years to complete following an already lengthy application process due to the engineering and geologic complexity of Class VI UIC wells and the CCS projects they support.

Unlike other similar agencies in other states, the RRC seems uniquely well positioned to follow through on this promise, as it can leverage its extensive experience in permitting other wells (including all types of UIC wells) and deep staff experience to provide a more efficient and predictable regulatory framework. As of Nov. 12, 2025, the RRC has 18 applicants currently under review and anticipates additional applications in the coming weeks. In its accompanying press release, the RRC remains laser focused in support its new Class VI UIC program, noting that primacy will ""provide certainty for energy companies looking to invest in CCS development.""

Next Steps

For energy companies and investors in the CCS space, this development presents a significant opportunity, given Texas' favorable geologic conditions. If CCS projects can be supported by a streamlined and predictable permitting timeline, project risk can be reduced, thereby supporting viability. Companies now have multiple opportunities to ensure that these new primacy considerations are embedded into and support their CCS projects in Texas. Those planning projects should consider engaging with counsel to understand the nuances of the new RRC-specific requirements, as well as help navigate any subsequent challenges to the Texas primacy rule. Similarly, those already holding federal Class VI UIC permits should consider risks and opportunities associated with the process of transfer from EPA to RRC jurisdiction.

In addition, companies should consider the benefits of engaging in the RRC's process at the earliest feasible date to ensure that permit applications receive the most favorable slot in the queue for RRC review. With the regulatory landscape for Class VI UIC in Texas firming up, the implementation of commercial-scale CO2 storage in the state is expected to accelerate.

,North Carolina and Evs,2025-11-14 17:56:14+00:00,Los Angeles Times,Toyota confirms up to $10 billion investment in the U.S. - Los Angeles Times,Chester Dawson,,,,,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-11-14/toyota-confirms-up-to-10-billion-investment-in-u-s,"David Christ, Toyota’s U.S. sales chief, said that will be revealed at a later date.
In an attempt to blunt that earlier criticism, Toyota promised in 2017 to invest $13 billion in U.S. manufacturing.
Toyota has four lines currently producing batteries for hybrids, which at full capacity can supply up to 600,000 gas-electric vehicles.
“With the regulation changes, it’s changed a little bit,” Don Stewart, president of the battery plant, told reporters.
Demand for EVs is expected to soften, and BloombergNEF now forecasts a major surplus in U.S. battery cell manufacturing capacity by 2030.","Toyota Motor Corp. confirmed it will plow as much as $10 billion into the U.S. over the next five years to boost its local operations, less than a month after President Trump flagged that the Japanese carmaker planned such an investment.

The announcement clears up a confusing moment from Trump’s visit to Tokyo last month, when he said Toyota would build plants all over the U.S. “to the tune of over $10 billion.” At the time, the automaker wouldn’t confirm such a plan, calling it mere speculation.

The automaker provided no further details on how it will spend the funds. David Christ, Toyota’s U.S. sales chief, said that will be revealed at a later date.

“We’ll announce the investment plans for the $10 billion as we get closer to making the investments,” Christ told reporters Wednesday at a ceremony for a new battery plant in North Carolina.

The investment announcement comes as the Trump administration pressures the global auto industry to shift more production to the U.S. and imposed punitive tariffs on many car parts and vehicles sourced from abroad.

Toyota’s top executive in the U.S., Ted Ogawa, said the battery plant and new investment “marks a pivotal moment in our company’s history.”

The president called out Toyota by name earlier this year for importing too many vehicles from Japan to the U.S., and also singled it out during this first administration for building up manufacturing operations in Mexico.

In an attempt to blunt that earlier criticism, Toyota promised in 2017 to invest $13 billion in U.S. manufacturing. The company said earlier this year that it had spent those funds and that its total investment in the U.S. currently exceeds $50 billion — spread over nearly seven decades.

The Japanese company imported about half of the vehicles it sold in the U.S. last year, mostly from Canada and Mexico but also including some 281,000 vehicles made in Japan.

The latest investment commitment was timed to coincide with the official opening of Toyota’s newest plant, a lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility located near Greensboro, N.C.

Construction of the factory in the rural town of Liberty cost $13.9 billion and production is expected to slowly ramp up over the next decade. Toyota said it will create 5,100 new jobs and supply both hybrid gas-electric and all-electric models.

Swift about-face

When Toyota first announced the U.S. battery plant project in 2021, it envisioned a steady rise in Americans’ demand for EVs due in part to then-President Biden’s efforts to speed adoption of zero-emission vehicles with favorable policies.

Trump’s return to the White House has led to a swift about-face in federal emissions regulations, including the abandonment of incentives for EV buyers such as a $7,500 tax credit.

Toyota has four lines currently producing batteries for hybrids, which at full capacity can supply up to 600,000 gas-electric vehicles. Those will be installed in models such as the Camry mid-size sedan and hybrid versions of the Corolla Cross crossover and best-selling RAV4 compact SUV.

Three more lines will be added next year, one dedicated to batteries for 45,000 all-electric vehicles a year and two that can make batteries for an additional 74,000 fully electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles, Anne Souder, a plant general manager, told reporters at a briefing.

The carmaker aims for a total of 14 lines to be operational by 2034, but its decision to scale back ambitious plans to sell as many as seven EV models in the U.S. has injected uncertainty into Toyota’s plans for production of all-electric vehicle batteries.

“With the regulation changes, it’s changed a little bit,” Don Stewart, president of the battery plant, told reporters.

Demand for EVs is expected to soften, and BloombergNEF now forecasts a major surplus in U.S. battery cell manufacturing capacity by 2030. That’s largely due to a 14-million-unit downward revision in projected U.S. sales of EVs by then.

The carmaker delivered fewer than 30,000 all-electric vehicles in the U.S. in 2024, even as its sales of hybrid gas-electrics have skyrocketed.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6c92b5e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+212/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F14%2F597726e24ddb91692cf7e6754410%2F531925-me-new-cars-13-rcg.JPG,N,,2025-11-14 14:02:35.750610

Consumers simply seem a lot more interested in electric sedans and SUVs than electric trucks.
Even with sales supercharged as consumers raced to tap expiring EV tax credits, Americans purchased just about 60,000 electric pickup trucks through the third quarter of this year, but bought more than 900,000 electric SUVs, sedans, and sports cars.
But there might be a path forward for the electric truck yet, says Art Wheaton, an expert on transportation industries at Cornell University: small and cheap.
“Changing policies, lower demand, and higher costs have made electric trucks a harder sell,” he said.","This analysis and news roundup comes from the Canary Media Weekly newsletter. Sign up to get it every Friday.

Back in May of 2021, Ford’s F-150 Lightning debuted with star-spangled flair. Then-President Joe Biden visited Ford’s sparkling new Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Michigan, where the company displayed the truck in front of a giant American flag alongside its gas-powered siblings. And after declaring that ​“the future of the auto industry is electric,” Biden even took the Lightning for a zippy test drive.

The picture is decidedly less bright today. A factory fire has forced Ford to pause production of the groundbreaking truck — and The Wall Street Journal reports that the company is considering halting production of the Lightning altogether after years of sluggish sales.

It’s not just the Lightning that has stalled. Electric trucks as a category have sputtered, largely due to their cost. A standard gas-powered F-150 starts at just shy of $40,000, while a Lightning with the lowest trim package starts at $55,000. Charging at home can help EV drivers recoup that cost difference, but it’s hard to ignore the initial sticker shock — especially given that federal EV incentives are now dead under President Donald Trump’s July budget law.

Politics may also be to blame. While the gas-powered Ford F-150 is among the most popular vehicles in counties that voted for Trump in 2020, the president’s repeated railing against EVs, coupled with Biden’s early endorsement, has put electric cars at the center of America’s polarized politics.

Still, even the Cybertruck, which carries a very different political connotation, isn’t doing so hot. Tesla sold just under 40,000 Cybertrucks last year in the U.S., while Ford sold about 33,500 Lightnings.

Consumers simply seem a lot more interested in electric sedans and SUVs than electric trucks. Even with sales supercharged as consumers raced to tap expiring EV tax credits, Americans purchased just about 60,000 electric pickup trucks through the third quarter of this year, but bought more than 900,000 electric SUVs, sedans, and sports cars.

But there might be a path forward for the electric truck yet, says Art Wheaton, an expert on transportation industries at Cornell University: small and cheap.

“Changing policies, lower demand, and higher costs have made electric trucks a harder sell,” he said. ​“Canceling the Lightning and replacing with a much lower-cost, smaller electric truck makes long-term sense given the current policies towards electric vehicles.”

More big energy stories

A tale of two gas bans

Massachusetts and New York may be neighbors, but they’re seemingly heading in different directions when it comes to transitioning their buildings off of fossil fuels.

Back in 2022, Massachusetts created a pilot program that let 10 municipalities prohibit fossil-fuel hookups in new buildings and major renovations. Advocates tell Canary Media’s Sarah Shemkus that the program is already lowering energy bills and reducing emissions — and lawmakers are considering new legislation to bring another 10 cities and towns into the fold.

New York has also made big commitments to clean up its buildings, including enacting rules this summer that would require all-electric appliances in most new construction. But last week, 19 Democratic state lawmakers sent a letter to Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul urging her to postpone implementation of the All-Electric Buildings Act. And on Wednesday, the state agreed, pausing the rules from taking effect at the end of this year.

COP30 kicks off with a focus on climate resilience

Leaders and advocates from around the world gathered in Brazil this week for the beginning of the United Nations’ COP30 climate summit. The Trump administration didn’t send a formal delegation, but that was OK with many diplomats — and with California’s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who called the president a ​“wrecking ball” to climate action during one panel.

Digs at the U.S. were aplenty during the first days of the conference, as were discussions of the need to ramp up climate adaptation and resilience work as extreme weather events grow more frequent and more intense. Jamaica, for example, is facing as much as $7 billion in damages — a third of its gross domestic product — in the wake of last month’s Hurricane Melissa. But in the storm’s aftermath, Jamaica has also shown how resilience efforts pay off. The island has deployed more than 60 megawatts of rooftop solar power since 2015, and many solar-equipped homes became neighborhood hubs in the wake of Melissa’s destruction.

By matching Tesla’s $55 monthly price in GMP’s program, Enphase achieves price parity with a major competitor in what Vermont regulators have called a pioneering utility battery program.","On November 12, 2025, Enphase Energy and Green Mountain Power announced an expanded partnership that adds Enphase battery systems to GMP’s existing home energy storage lease program. The announcement, which was distributed as a corporate press release, presents the program as offering Vermont customers “true energy independence.” However, a detailed examination of the program’s structure reveals significant details that were not included in the announcement—particularly regarding when homeowners can actually use their batteries and what the true costs are.

What the Program Offers

According to GMP’s program page and the official press release, eligible customers can lease two Enphase IQ Battery 10C units through one of two payment options:

Monthly payments of $55 for 120 months (10 years)

A one-time upfront payment of $5,500

The two-battery system provides 20 kilowatt-hours of storage capacity and comes with a 15-year warranty, according to Solar Power World. This configuration is generally capable of powering an entire home, including high-demand appliances like HVAC systems and water pumps, according to technical specifications from Wolf River Electric.

The program matches the pricing of GMP’s existing Tesla Powerwall lease program, which charges the same $55 monthly rate, according to GMP’s tariff filing.

The Installation Cost Omission

The announcement’s “$5,500 one-time cost” figure does not represent the total amount customers will pay. According to an analysis by SolarReviews, homeowners must separately pay for installation of the batteries, which brings the total cost over the lease term to between $7,500 and $10,000.

This means customers choosing the upfront payment option should expect to pay between $7,500 and $10,000 in total—the $5,500 lease payment plus an estimated $2,000 to $4,500 for installation. The press release and program materials do not prominently disclose this additional mandatory cost.

The Critical Usage Restriction

The most significant detail omitted from the announcement concerns when and how homeowners can actually use their leased batteries. According to SolarReviews’ explanation of the program: “While homeowners can only use the batteries in the event of a power outage, Green Mountain Power can use as much of the energy stored in the batteries as they want, at any time.”

This restriction is formalized in GMP’s Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) program terms, which specify that customers “may not use the battery system for any controls other than providing backup power for the customer’s premises.”

In practical terms, this means:

What homeowners CAN do: Use the battery for backup power during grid outages

What homeowners CANNOT do: Use the battery to reduce their electric bills by shifting energy use to off-peak hours, storing solar energy for evening use, or any other purpose when the grid is functioning normally

GMP maintains operational control of the batteries at all times except during outages, using them as part of its 75-megawatt Virtual Power Plant, according to the press release.

How the Virtual Power Plant Works

The leased batteries become part of what the announcement describes as “the largest dispatchable energy resource in Vermont”—GMP’s 75-megawatt Virtual Power Plant. According to documentation from GMP, this network has saved GMP customers up to $3 million annually in recent years.

The savings mechanism works like this: GMP remotely controls thousands of distributed battery systems across its service territory. During periods of high electricity demand, when wholesale power prices spike, GMP discharges these batteries instead of purchasing expensive power from the regional grid. According to research from Rocky Mountain Institute, this reduces costs for all of GMP’s 265,000+ customers, not just those hosting batteries.

In exchange for ceding control of their batteries, lease participants receive the discounted equipment price. The broader customer base benefits from the $3 million in annual system-wide savings.

The Federal Subsidy Structure

The low pricing of the program is made possible by the 30% Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC), though this is not mentioned in the announcement. Under the lease model, GMP—as the system owner—claims this federal tax credit rather than the homeowner, according to Utility Dive’s reporting on GMP’s battery programs.

According to that report, GMP’s actual cost for similar battery systems had risen to approximately $22,000, but the utility maintained the $55 monthly customer price specifically because “the federal Inflation Reduction Act provides a 30% investment tax credit for the systems.”

This means the federal government is effectively subsidizing roughly $6,600 of each system’s cost through the tax credit, which GMP captures and uses to offer the reduced lease price to customers.

The timing is significant: according to guidance from Enphase, the 30% ITC for homeowner-purchased systems is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2025. However, lease and power purchase agreement models—like GMP’s program—remain eligible for the credit beyond that date.

The Value Proposition: What Customers Trade

To understand what customers give up in exchange for the discounted price, it’s useful to compare the lease cost to retail purchase prices.

Based on pricing data from renewable energy suppliers, two Enphase IQ Battery 10C units cost approximately $13,000-$13,200 at retail. Additional required equipment (controllers, combiners, etc.) adds roughly $2,000-$3,000. Professional installation and permitting typically costs $8,000-$9,000, based on cost discussions in solar industry forums.

This brings the total retail installed cost to approximately $23,000-$25,000—roughly 2.5 to 3 times the GMP lease program’s upfront price of $7,500-$10,000.

In exchange for this substantial discount, customers provide GMP with:

Operational control: The utility can dispatch the battery’s stored energy whenever it determines there is grid need

The federal tax credit: Worth approximately $6,600, which GMP claims instead of the homeowner

Equipment ownership: GMP owns the equipment; the customer cannot take it if they move (unless they buy out the lease)

Customers who purchase battery systems outright retain full control over when and how to use their stored energy, own the equipment, and can claim federal tax credits themselves (if purchased before the credit’s expiration).

Strategic Context: Enphase and Market Competition

While the announcement frames the partnership as primarily benefiting Vermont customers, it also represents a significant competitive and financial development for Enphase Energy.

Enphase is the dominant supplier of solar microinverters but faces stronger competition in the home battery market. According to analysis from TradingView, the company’s stock price has declined approximately 58% over the past year amid challenging market conditions.

By matching Tesla’s $55 monthly price in GMP’s program, Enphase achieves price parity with a major competitor in what Vermont regulators have called a pioneering utility battery program. The announcement generated positive stock market response, with Benzinga reporting that Enphase shares traded higher following the news.

According to Enphase’s Q2 2025 earnings materials, the company “anticipates a shift in the U.S. solar market towards lease/PPA models.” This GMP partnership validates that strategic direction by demonstrating a scalable utility partnership model.

Program Evolution and Pricing Changes

Evidence suggests this announcement represents an expansion and price reduction from an earlier pilot program. A separate GMP announcement regarding Enphase battery options referenced pricing of $65 per month or $6,500 upfront. The current program’s $55/$5,500 pricing appears to represent both an expansion in scale and a price reduction to match the Tesla Powerwall program terms.

What Happens Next

Vermont homeowners interested in the program can enroll through GMP’s designated program page. According to the enrollment process described by Enphase, approved installers handle the lease agreement, installation, and system setup.

Customers considering the program should:

Request total cost estimates that include both the lease payment and installation costs before committing

Understand the usage restrictions—batteries can only be used for backup during outages, not for bill reduction during normal grid operation

Recognize the trade-off—a substantial discount in exchange for ceding battery control to the utility

Consider their backup power needs—whether whole-home backup during increasingly severe storms justifies the cost and control limitations

Compare to purchasing—especially if interested in using stored energy for purposes beyond emergency backup

For customers primarily interested in backup power during outages and willing to allow utility control during normal operations, the program offers professionally installed, warrantied battery systems at prices significantly below retail purchase costs.

For customers interested in energy independence, time-of-use bill management, or maximizing their own solar energy use, the program’s restrictions may limit its appeal. These customers might consider purchasing battery systems outright (before the federal tax credit’s December 31, 2025 expiration) or waiting to see how battery programs evolve.

GMP and Enphase have announced that additional products, including a bidirectional EV charger expected in 2026, will be integrated into the partnership in the future, according to the press release.

The program represents Vermont’s continued experimentation with virtual power plant models—using networks of distributed residential batteries to provide grid services while offering homeowners backup power at subsidized prices. Whether this model serves customer interests depends largely on individual circumstances and priorities regarding cost, control, and the value of backup power.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!30zh!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0ea1e49-8c61-4333-8c4c-3caa45460129_1148x750.png",N,,2025-11-14 16:02:25.441517

NMG is a North American mining company positioning itself to be the first fully integrated, carbon-neutral producer of natural graphite. Natural graphite is considered a critical mineral - given its necessity for everything from energy storage to electric vehicles - and can be found in many industries, including energy, technology, defense and manufacturing.

With China dominating mining and production of graphite, the Western world is forming alliances to protect supply, and NMG is benefiting from that. “Graphite goes into about fifteen applications and we were focused on the EV market, which is arguably the biggest demand and the biggest volumes. We demonstrated we can build a full vertical,” Desaulniers told Benzinga during the interview. “Now we intend to do the same thing in other markets.”

NMG is seeing a lot of interest from G7 and NATO countries that are looking for a producer outside of China, so much so that it was able to sign four off-take agreements at a recent G7 meeting.

“Great agreements, that’s what you need when you are building a project,” said the CEO. “You need certainty and partners, and that’s what we have delivered for our shareholders.”

Hydropower is a cornerstone of the Northwest’s clean energy future.
Northwest families, workers and communities want leaders who can protect salmon and keep energy affordable.","When President Franklin Roosevelt dedicated the Bonneville Dam in 1937, he called it a “yardstick for the future” — a promise that the Pacific Northwest could generate clean, affordable power for all. Nearly nine decades later, that promise endures. Hydropower remains the beating heart of our region’s clean energy system, providing reliable, carbon-free electricity to millions of homes and businesses.

It’s a legacy rooted in bipartisan support. Presidents, governors, and leaders of both parties have long recognized that hydropower is essential to the Northwest’s prosperity and remains the foundation of state climate policies. During our time in Congress, we were part of a bipartisan coalition strongly committed to policies and public investment to protect and grow our cherished salmon populations while supporting hydropower.

Today, we face a challenge that demands the same spirit of collaboration and balance: how to ensure salmon and a strong hydropower system can share healthy rivers. That challenge should be met through thoughtful, inclusive dialogue that brings our region together.

We’re making progress. Billions of dollars of electric customer investments in science-driven habitat restoration and fish passage, and partnership with federal, state and tribal governments are leading to meaningful results for fish, clean energy and communities. Salmon and steelhead returns are increasing. We need to continue to learn and build on our successes.

As former members of Congress representing Washington and Oregon, we’ve seen firsthand that lasting solutions emerge when states, tribes, farmers, utilities and conservationists work together. Yet despite clear progress, the conversation around salmon recovery has too often turned to litigation or decision-making behind closed doors rather than collaboration.

Having spent decades working in Pacific Northwest politics and policy, we know that fighting is sometimes the only option. Now is not that time.

As we confront the challenges of climate change and the energy transition required to address it, fractured decision-making wastes time, erodes trust and jeopardizes the future of this vital system that millions of people depend on every day.

Instead of channeling energy into lawsuits, we’re calling on Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek and other leaders to channel their energies into pragmatic partnership rooted in science and progressive values.

Hydropower is a cornerstone of the Northwest’s clean energy future. As our states strive to meet ambitious climate goals while serving dramatically increasing electric usage, we cannot afford to sideline the single largest source of renewable energy in our region. At the same time, we must remain steadfast in our commitment to healthy salmon runs — vital to tribal cultures, commercial and recreational fisheries and the ecological fabric of the Pacific Northwest.

Fortunately, this is not a zero-sum choice. Modern technologies and collaborative management are proving that we can support both fish populations and reliable, affordable hydropower. State-of-the-art fish passage technologies, science-driven hatchery programs and habitat restoration projects are yielding measurable results. We have more work to do together. Continued innovation and cooperation, not conflict, will drive the next chapter of progress.

We urge the governors of Washington and Oregon to lead together in that spirit, set aside costly litigation and instead convene an inclusive forum for science-based public policy and innovative solutions that address today’s realities. This governance will build on decades of progress, help mitigate rising electricity costs and ensure the Columbia Basin remains a vital, connected landscape for all who depend on it.

Northwest families, workers and communities want leaders who can protect salmon and keep energy affordable. Endless litigation does neither. This moment calls for courage — the courage to unite rather than divide and to act not out of ideology but out of responsibility to future generations.

President Roosevelt envisioned a public power system that would empower the people of the Northwest for decades to come. Today, that vision depends on leaders willing to honor both the power of the river and the life within it. The salmon and the people of our region deserve nothing less.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11132025_tzr_tzr_114431.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-11-14 13:00:41.570175

Dive Brief:

Shell has agreed to sell “a substantial portion” of its Volta electric vehicle charging network to Australian charger manufacturer Jolt, according to an announcement this week.

The deal includes thousands of media-enabled EV chargers affiliated with the Volta Media advertising network across 34 states. In separate statements to C-Store Dive, Jolt CEO Doug McNamee and a Shell spokesperson both said the final numbers won’t be available until the deal closes since both parties are in discussions with site hosts. The acquisition is expected to close on Jan. 1, 2026, according to the announcement.

Shell is selling most of Volta less than three years after acquiring the charging company for $169 million in a move that aimed to scale the oil giant’s EV capabilities in the U.S.

Dive Insight:

Shell made waves when it bought Volta in early 2023. Volta’s chargers feature large-format digital advertising screens and the company’s proprietary PredictEV platform, which uses behavioral science and machine learning to help commercial property owners, cities and electric utilities plan EV infrastructure.

However, in early 2024, Shell notified Volta’s leadership that it was winding down its operations, with Shell taking over operations internally, and that the majority of its roughly 200 team members would be let go. In a statement this week, Shell’s spokesperson said that move was part of the integration between the two companies, which led to Volta’s assets being rebranded into the Shell Recharge program. However, Shell retained the Volta Media network name for advertising purposes, the spokesperson added.

First Solar selects South Carolina for new US production facility

Cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film photovoltaic (PV) module maker First Solar Inc of Tempe, AZ, USA is to establish a new facility in Gaffney, Cherokee County, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 Plus modules initiated by the company’s international fleet. The firm expects to spend about $330m to establish the new facility, which is scheduled to begin commercial operation in second-half 2026. The facility is forecasted to create more than 600 new jobs with an average manufacturing salary of $74,000 per year, approximately twice the per capita income in Cherokee County.

First Solar says that the South Carolina facility — which will directly support American energy affordability goals — was catalyzed by demand for domestically produced energy technology created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Donald J. Trump in July. The facility is expected to increase First Solar’s capacity to produce US-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance, by 3.7GW, reaching 17.7GW of annual nameplate capacity in 2027.

“We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the US market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives,” says First Solar’s CEO Mark Widmar.

First Solar's investment in Cherokee County will “greatly strengthen the local economy and help advance America's energy independence,” notes South Carolina’s Governor Henry McMaster.

The onshored processes will transform thin-film solar cells produced by First Solar’s international fleet into fully completed modules. The new facility expands the firm’s footprint in South Carolina, which currently includes a distribution center in Duncan, Spartanburg County, and a longstanding partnership with Inland Port Greer. The Gaffney plant will be part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and R&D footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one each in Alabama and Louisiana, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. Altogether, First Solar, which expects to directly employ over 5500 people in the USA by the end of 2026, will have invested about $4.5bn in US-based manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

Having manufactured in the USA since 2002, First Solar is the country’s leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company and the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the USA. By 2027, the firm expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3bn in labor income.

Fewer solar developers reported delays in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year, the Energy Information Administration said in a Monday report.

In the third quarter this year, “solar projects representing about 20% of planned capacity reported a delay, a decrease from 25% in the same period in 2024,” EIA said.

“Despite the relatively high number of projects reporting delays in 2024, that year was a record year for U.S. solar capacity additions,” EIA said. Developers added around 31 GW of utility-scale solar capacity last year, though their projections at the beginning of the year forecasted 36 GW in additions.

“Because survey respondents may not anticipate the occurrence or duration of delays, ultimate capacity additions tend to be less than the expected amount that developers report to us at the beginning of the year,” EIA said. The agency said in February that it predicts 32.5 GW of utility-scale solar will be added this year, indicating that less solar may come online this year than last year, despite the decrease in delays.

EIA also noted that delays are more common than cancellations, and “less than 1% of planned solar capacity is entirely cancelled in a typical month … Much of the reported delayed capacity occurs at projects that are in the late construction or testing phases just before they come online. These delays are typically only for a month or two.”

Justin Baca, vice president of markets and research at the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in an email that it’s “important to note that most of the solar capacity that has come online this year began construction last year.”

“The vast majority of what began construction this year received permits prior to July of this year, when the memo from the Department of the Interior slowing permitting was released,” Baca said. “As such, this data does not yet reflect the recent permitting obstruction, including from the DOI memo.

IN THE NEWS

President Donald J. Trump signed a narrow spending package to end the 43-day government shutdown, allowing federal agencies to begin reopening after the longest lapse of government funding in U.S. history. The bill, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives 222–209 after a group of Democratic congressmembers broke with their party to advance it, funds the government through January, reverses recent federal worker layoffs, and guarantees back pay for furloughed employees. The package omits Democrats’ priority of extending Affordable Care Act tax credits, prompting a separate vote over health-care subsidies in mid-December.

​​The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case challenging its 2015 legalization of gay marriage in Obergefell v. Hodges. In Obergefell, the court held that marriage is a fundamental right that states cannot deny to couples on the basis of their same-sex partnership. In the denied case, a Kentucky county clerk sought relief from fines she received after refusing to issue same-sex marriage licenses. Some observers thought the Court might overturn Obergefell, after it overturned the right to abortion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, in which Justice Thomas called in his concurrence for a reconsideration of Obergefell. This denial, however, leaves Obergefell intact.

A federal judge ordered the release of hundreds of immigrants detained during the Trump administration’s Chicago-area raids, “Operation Midway Blitz.” U.S. District Judge Jeffrey I. Cummings directed the U.S. Department of Justice to identify by November 19 which of the more than 600 immigrants remain in custody, and he barred officials from pressuring detainees into voluntary deportation. The ruling, issued amid allegations that federal agents conducted warrantless arrests in violation of a 2022 order, could lead to hundreds more releases as courts review the raids’ legality.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) may lose funding after the Trump Administration announced that, under its new legal interpretation, the CFPB’s current funding source is unlawful. The Administration declared in a memorandum that the CFPB’s funding, which comes from the “combined earnings of the federal reserve system,” means only profits—so when, as in recent years, the system operates at a loss, the CFPB cannot receive funding. The National Treasury Employees Union revealed the memorandum as part of its ongoing lawsuit to prevent “the Executive Branch’s ongoing effort to dismantle the CFPB.”

The Trump Administration is preparing to allow new offshore oil and gas drilling off the California coast for the first time in roughly four decades, per a draft U.S. Department of the Interior map. Governor Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) said the proposal would be “dead on arrival” in California. The proposal would schedule six lease sales between 2027 and 2030 and expand drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, though it is unclear how much interest companies have in California waters after decades of limited activity.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed lowering reporting requirements for manufacturers or importers of products containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which can take hundreds to thousands of years to break down in the environment. The current rule requires companies to report data to EPA related to PFAS exposure and any existing environmental and health effects. The proposed change would exempt companies producing compounds containing less than 0.1 percent of PFAS from the reporting requirement. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated that the proposed rule would decrease compliance burdens.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced it will remove the “black box” warning label—the most severe safety label FDA places on prescription drugs—from hormone therapy drugs, which are used to treat menopause. The label was added after a study found that the drugs increased several health risks including breast cancer, strokes, and dementia. Another study released before the FDA announcement, however, indicated the benefits of hormone therapy drugs in treating menopause as long as patients did not have certain health conditions. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary announced that an internal panel reviewed the latest scientific studies and recommended the warning’s removal.

The U.S. Supreme Court extended its previous order blocking full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program(SNAP) benefits for the month of November until 11:59 p.m. on November 13. The Court’s initial order paused a lower court ruling that required the Trump Administration to distribute SNAP payments using congressionally appropriated contingency funds while the federal government was shut down. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson stated that she would not have extended the order pausing benefits. In the meantime, several states implemented stopgap measures to cover SNAP benefits while federal funds were on hold.

WHAT WE’RE READING THIS WEEK

A recent report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined how the U.S. Department of Energy is investigating the current and past use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) at its sites for purposes such as firefighting and uranium enrichment. PFAS, or “forever chemicals,” can remain in the environment for hundreds or thousands of years and cause health problems such as cancer and infertility. GAO found that since the Energy Department announced its intention to survey PFAS contamination at 57 sites in 2022, it had not finished reviewing over half of them, and over 100 other sites were not surveyed at all. GAO observed that the lack of completed site reviews means that the Energy Department will not know the extent of its PFAS contamination or where it poses health risks. As a result, GAO concluded that the Energy Department is not currently able to prioritize cleanup actions and estimate cleanup costs.

In a forthcoming article, Evangelos Razis, a staff member at the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy & Commerce, and James C. Cooper, a law professor at George Mason University, argued that Congress should pass a moratorium on state AI regulations, allowing Congress to devise a single, nationwide AI law. States’ urgency to pass consumer AI regulations threatens to create a patchwork of laws that would hamper innovation, Razis and Cooper claimed. Congress, however, risks doing more harm by passing a federal regulation too hastily. Razis and Cooper argued that there is past precedent for a temporary moratorium—such as temporary bans on state regulation of commercial space flights or the internet—which would allow more time to evaluate how current laws are managing AI harms and determine what gaps must be filled.

In a working paper published by The George Washington Law Review, Jennifer Nou of the University of Chicago Law School argued that modern presidents rely on the Executive Office of the President (EOP) to coordinate and manage regulatory decisions. She explained that “presidential brokering” is a White House–led process through which advisers gather information, test competing arguments, and guide agencies. Nou described the Domestic Policy Council and National Economic Council as central brokers and that brokering is distinct from other mechanisms like executive orders. Nou contended that brokering can improve responsiveness and the quality of regulatory decisions, but the practice increases opacity, raises decision costs, and risks concentrating too much power in the presidency. She concluded by proposing reforms for presidents, Congress, and courts to enhance transparency, accountability, and the legitimacy of presidential involvement in regulatory policy.

EDITOR’S CHOICE

In an essay in The Regulatory Review, Russell Wheeler, nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Governance Studies Program, argued that the 2018–2019 federal government shutdown exposed longstanding “deferred maintenance” of the federal judiciary. Wheeler extended Paul Light’s concept of a “quiet crisis” in public service to the courts, showing how underfunding, unfilled vacancies, and outdated resource allocations have weakened the judiciary’s ability to function as an independent branch. Wheeler identified three main problems worsened by shutdowns: a high number of judicial vacancies, the lack of new judgeships despite rising caseloads, and growing difficulty in recruiting judges and staff. He concluded that, although the crisis may renew attention to public service reform, it is unlikely to generate lasting investment in the courts, leaving the judiciary’s structural deficiencies unaddressed.",https://www.theregreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WIR.jpeg,N,,2025-11-14 15:00:45.971255

Toyota Motor North America President Ted Ogawa, said:

Over the next five years, we are planning an additional investment of $10 billion in the U.S. to further grow our manufacturing capabilities, bringing our total investment in this country to over $60 billion,

Toyota’s 11th U.S. factory, on a 1,850-acre (749-hectare) site, will be able to produce 30 GWh annually at full capacity and house 14 battery production lines for plug-in hybrids and full EVs. It will eventually employ 5,000 workers.

Last month in Japan, U.S. President Donald Trump said Toyota planned a $10 billion investment in the United States. “Go out and buy a Toyota,” Trump said. He has been critical of Japanese and other auto imports and imposed hefty tariffs on imported vehicles.

Toyota has been one of the slowest automakers to move to full EVs but has rapidly moved to convert its best-selling vehicles to hybrids.

Ogawa said on Wednesday,

We know there is no single path to progress,

“That’s why we remain committed to our multi-pathway approach, offering fuel-efficient gas engines, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery electronics and fuel cell electronics.”

Other automakers like Volkswagen (VOWG.DE), have said they will add more hybrids as the Trump administration has rescinded EV tax credits, and eliminated penalties, that incentivized EV sales.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at the event the administration plans to soon propose to ease fuel economy standards, saying prior rules were too aggressive.

Duffy in January signed an order to direct the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to rescind fuel economy standards issued under President Joe Biden for the 2022-2031 model years that had aimed to drastically reduce fuel use for cars and trucks.

Proposed Exemptions The Proposed Rule seeks to add the following exemptions to the one-time PFAS reporting requirement: De Minimis.
Under the Proposed Rule, PFAS present in mixtures or articles at concentrations below 0.1 percent are exempt from reporting, regardless of total production volume.
The Proposed Rule exempts PFAS imported as part of an article from reporting.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Nov. 13, 2025, published a proposed rule (Proposed Rule) to modify the scope of the Biden-era one-time reporting requirement for manufacturers and importers of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) under Section 8(a)(7) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).

The current rule, published by the EPA in October 2023 (Rule) after being directed to do so by the U.S. Congress under the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year (FY) 2020, requires PFAS manufacturers (including importers) to electronically report information regarding uses, production volumes, disposal, exposures and hazards from PFAS or PFAS-containing articles between 2011 and 2022. (See Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""EPA Publishes Comprehensive PFAS Reporting Rule Under TSCA,"" Oct. 17, 2023.) Since publication of the Rule, EPA has extended the reporting deadline twice, most recently extending the start of the data submission period from July 2025 to April 2026.

The Proposed Rule – which responds to stakeholder feedback and the deregulatory priorities of the Trump Administration – aims to reduce unnecessary or duplicative reporting, minimize compliance costs for small manufacturers and focus reporting obligations on those likely to have relevant information. The agency is now proposing several key exemptions and technical clarifications to the Rule, which are expected to significantly reduce compliance burden and costs for regulated entities.

This announcement follows the release of the Trump Administration's regulatory agenda, where the EPA outlined several anticipated actions over the next season, including this Proposed Rule. (See Holland and Knight's previous alert, ""EPA's PFAS Rulemaking Trajectory: Key Updates Across CERCLA, TSCA, RCRA, SDWA and CWA,"" Oct. 7, 2025.)

Proposed Exemptions

The Proposed Rule seeks to add the following exemptions to the one-time PFAS reporting requirement:

De Minimis. Under the Proposed Rule, PFAS present in mixtures or articles at concentrations below 0.1 percent are exempt from reporting, regardless of total production volume. Under the current Rule, there is no de minimis level – all concentrations of PFAS are reportable.

Imported Articles. The Proposed Rule exempts PFAS imported as part of an article from reporting. This exemption, if finalized, will be critical for product importers that are unlikely to have sufficient knowledge of PFAS content in articles due to lack of notification requirements during the reporting period.

Byproducts, Impurities and Non-Isolated Intermediates. PFAS manufactured solely as byproducts (not used for commercial purposes), impurities or non-isolated intermediates are exempt if manufactured under conditions described in 40 C.F.R. 720.30(h).

Research and Development (R&D) Chemicals. PFAS manufactured (including imported) solely in small quantities for R&D purposes are exempt. The EPA determined that these quantities are not commercially relevant and, therefore, reporting would impose significant burden with minimal benefit.

It's the Japanese automaker's first battery plant outside Japan and the company's biggest single-site investment ever. Toyota expects to hire 5,000 staffers.

The plant comes amid a massive shift for automakers.

Clouds have been cast over the future of fully electric vehicles — the government's $7,500 tax credit ended, automakers have been laying off American workers who built EVs, and some companies might discontinue money-losing cars.

But Toyota's approach is different: it's leaning into booming hybrid sales.

'Toyota has put more vehicles with electrified powertrains on the road than any other automaker,' Emily Holland, a spokesperson for Toyota, told the Daily Mail. 'Hybrids represent an entry point into vehicle electrification.'

The North Carolina plant will build lithium-ion batteries for three types of products — hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and fully electric vehicles — with the vast majority devoted to hybrids that Toyota can't build fast enough.

This year, more than half of Toyota's cars sold in the US have some form of electrified engine.

And multiple Toyota best-sellers have gone hybrid-only. The ever-popular Camry no longer offers a gas-only version, and the RAV4, America's best-selling non-pickup truck, will drop its gas-only option in 2026.

In North Carolina, just four of the new facility's 14 planned lines are running, enough to supply battery packs for roughly 600,000 hybrids a year, including the Toyota Camry built in Kentucky and the Corolla Cross SUV in Alabama.

Meanwhile, the plant's plug-in and EV facilities remain more modest.

Toyota is building out capacity for about 74,000 plug-in hybrids and just 45,000 fully electric vehicles.

Those batteries will eventually power a new three-row, American-built electric SUV that Toyota hasn't revealed yet. The company told the Daily Mail it is scheduled to launch in late 2026.

It's a cautious approach that Toyota executives say matches where American buyers actually are.

'Toyota is a pioneer in electrified vehicles, and the company's significant manufacturing investment in the US and North Carolina further solidifies our commitment to team members, customers, dealers, communities, and suppliers,' Ted Ogawa, the company's US-based chief executive, said.

This massive investment also lands amid a shifting political and economic landscape for automakers.

Toyota broke ground on the facility in 2021, when the Biden administration was focused on building out battery manufacturing in the US.

But US sales of fully electric cars haven't accelerated as lawmakers initially hoped.

President Donald Trump said last month that Toyota would pump $10billion into the US, though the company didn't clarify how the new plant relates to its those spending plans.

At the same time, the industry is navigating Trump's sweeping tariffs on cars and parts.

Cars built in Japan — including around 30 percent of the Toyotas rolling off American dealership lots — are slapped with a 15 percent tariff at the US border.

Toyota's rate has angered Detroit automakers, who often have to pay more in tariffs for US-assembled vehicles.

And tariffs haven't slowed Toyota's momentum.

US sales are up 9.9 percent through the third quarter — more than 1.3million vehicles — driven largely by hybrids, the company can't build fast enough.

The automaker has the lowest days-on-lot metric in the industry, a measure of how quickly vehicles sell after arriving at dealerships.

And with four production lines humming in North Carolina and 10 more on deck, Toyota's bet is clear: the future might be electric, but the runway for hybrid sales remains intact.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/14/15/103887923-0-image-a-63_1763135233366.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 13:01:50.656587

Three years after Canada’s first large-scale lithium-ion battery manufacturing plant was announced in 2022, the Windsor site marked a major milestone in September with the completion of construction.

Article content

But just last week, NextStar Energy said it would shift focus to the rapidly expanding energy-storage sector in response to slumping demand for EV batteries brought in part by an ongoing trade war.

Article content

On whether any electric vehicle batteries were currently being produced at the plant, Lee replied: “We are going to wait until … demand is coming, but we are right now prioritizing the battery for the ESS market.”

The Future of U.S. Energy Policy The rollback of Biden-era restrictions raises questions about the future trajectory of U.S. energy policy.
The decision to rescind drilling restrictions in Alaska highlights the complex interplay between economic development, environmental conservation, and energy policy in the United States.","The Trump administration has finalized the reversal of Biden-era restrictions on oil and gas drilling in Alaska’s vast National Petroleum Reserve. This region is renowned for being the largest tract of undisturbed public land in the United States. The decision aligns with President Trump’s broader energy strategy aimed at increasing domestic oil and gas production, particularly in resource-rich areas like Alaska. The move has been met with mixed reactions, highlighting the ongoing debate over energy development versus environmental conservation in the region.

Impact on Alaska’s Land and Wildlife

The rollback of restrictions affects 10.6 million acres of Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve, a key area known for its pristine wilderness and diverse wildlife. Environmentalists argue that opening this land to drilling could have detrimental impacts on the ecosystem, threatening species such as polar bears, caribou, and migratory birds. The untouched nature of this land has made it a critical habitat for these species, which rely on the area for breeding and migration.

Proponents of the rollback insist that modern drilling techniques minimize environmental damage. They argue that the regulations in place are sufficient to protect the environment while allowing for energy development. However, critics remain skeptical, pointing to past incidents where oil spills and infrastructure development have caused irreversible harm.

The balance between economic development and environmental protection remains a contentious issue in Alaska.

Economic Implications for Local Communities

For local communities, particularly the Alaska Native group Voice of the Arctic Inupiat, the rollback is seen as a positive step. The group supports oil and gas development as it generates significant tax revenues, which fund essential services such as healthcare and education. Jobs created by the energy sector are also crucial for the economic stability of these communities.

However, the economic benefits are not uniformly distributed. While some communities see significant gains, others are concerned about the long-term sustainability of relying on fossil fuel extraction. The debate continues over whether the short-term economic boost is worth the potential environmental cost and the eventual transition to renewable energy sources.

National Energy Security and Policy Directions

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum emphasized the rollback as a move towards enhancing American energy security. By increasing domestic oil production, the United States aims to reduce its dependence on foreign oil imports, thereby strengthening its energy independence. This aligns with the Trump administration’s broader policy of prioritizing domestic energy production.

The decision also reflects a shift in policy direction from the previous administration, which emphasized transitioning to renewable energy sources. The Biden-era rule was part of a larger strategy to combat climate change by limiting fossil fuel extraction. The reversal highlights the ongoing policy tug-of-war between environmental sustainability and energy independence.

The Future of U.S. Energy Policy

The rollback of Biden-era restrictions raises questions about the future trajectory of U.S. energy policy. As global conversations intensify around climate change and sustainable development, the United States faces pressure to balance its energy needs with environmental responsibilities. The current administration’s focus on oil and gas development could impact international relations, particularly with countries prioritizing renewable energy.

The decision also underscores the importance of bipartisan dialogue in shaping a cohesive energy policy that addresses both economic and environmental concerns. As the energy landscape evolves, so too must the policies that govern it, ensuring they are adaptable to new challenges and opportunities.

The decision to rescind drilling restrictions in Alaska highlights the complex interplay between economic development, environmental conservation, and energy policy in the United States. As the nation grapples with these competing priorities, what future strategies will best balance these vital interests?

Solar generation jumped 498 TWh (+31%) compared to the same period last year, already topping all the solar power produced in 2024.
That brought the total share of renewables in global electricity – solar, wind, hydro, bioenergy, and geothermal – to 43%.
“Record solar power growth and stagnating fossil fuels in 2025 show how clean power has become the driving force in the power sector,” said Nicolas Fulghum, senior data analyst at Ember.
The next big question: can solar, wind, and the rest of the clean power sector keep up this pace consistently?","Solar and wind are growing fast enough to meet all new electricity demand worldwide for the first three quarters of 2025, according to new data from energy think tank Ember. The group now expects fossil power to stay flat for the full year, marking the first time since the pandemic that fossil generation won’t increase.

Solar and wind aren’t just expanding; they’re outpacing global electricity demand itself. Solar generation jumped 498 TWh (+31%) compared to the same period last year, already topping all the solar power produced in 2024. Wind added another 137 TWh (+7.6%). Together, they supplied 635 TWh of new clean electricity, beating out the 603 TWh rise in global demand (+2.7%).

That lifted solar and wind to 17.6% of global electricity in the first three quarters of the year, up from 15.2% year-over-year. That brought the total share of renewables in global electricity – solar, wind, hydro, bioenergy, and geothermal – to 43%. Fossil fuels slid to 57.1%, down from 58.7%.

Renewables are beating coal

For the first time in 2025, renewables collectively generated more electricity than coal. And fossil generation as a whole has stalled. Fossil output slipped slightly by 0.1% (-17 TWh) through the end of Q3. Ember expects no fossil-fuel growth for the full year, driven by clean power growth outpacing demand.

China and India are partly driving that shift. In China, fossil generation fell 52 TWh (-1.1%) as clean energy met all new demand, resulting from a structural change in its power system. India saw fossil generation drop 34 TWh (-3.3%), thanks to record solar and wind growth and milder weather.

Solar is leading the charge

Solar is doing the heavy lifting. It’s now the single biggest driver of change in the global power sector, with growth more than three times larger than any other electricity source in the first three quarters of the year.

“Record solar power growth and stagnating fossil fuels in 2025 show how clean power has become the driving force in the power sector,” said Nicolas Fulghum, senior data analyst at Ember. “Historically a growth segment, fossil power now appears to be entering a period of stagnation and managed decline. China, the largest source of fossil growth, has turned a corner, signaling that reliance on fossil fuels to meet growing power demand is no longer required.”

Electricity demand rose 2.7% in the first three quarters of 2025, far slower than the 4.9% jump seen last year when extreme heatwaves pushed up cooling demand in China, India, and the US. This year’s milder weather helped take some pressure off the grid, making it easier for clean energy to close the gap.

A turning point for the global power system

For the first time outside of major crises such as the pandemic or the global financial crash, clean energy growth has not only kept up with demand but surpassed it. The next big question: can solar, wind, and the rest of the clean power sector keep up this pace consistently? If they can, 2025 may be remembered as the year global fossil generation plateaued.

Gotion's ties to China created real concerns beyond typical local opposition.
We can’t let local opposition become the default setting every time a major employer shows interest in Michigan.
Because if we continue to hound away major investment, Michigan will cease to be considered — and will cease to have an economic future.","Michigan has a problem, and it's going to cost us if we don't change our tune.

A series of major development projects have failed to pan out. The reasons are diverse, but a common thread ran through them: serious local opposition. Backers of the projects fought through that — for a while — but the NIMBYism on display in each case sent a potent message that is really starting to add up.

We’re seeing this again with OpenAI and Oracle’s massive data center near Ann Arbor. It got the green light only after the developer agreed to fork over $14 million to address local concerns. Before that? Opposition from township officials who suddenly discovered all sorts of worries about a project that would bring substantial investment to the area. And the rumblings of discontent are far from over.

It's becoming a troubling pattern.

A $63 billion semiconductor factory near Flint — nearly 10,000 jobs — walked away, citing economic uncertainty but in the context of massive local opposition. The Gotion battery plant near Big Rapids? Dead after years of local battles and a recall election.

Even a project that has kept moving forward, like Ford Motor Co.’s battery plant in Marshall, has done so in the face of legal challenges.

Certainly, these failures aren’t just about NIMBYism. National economic turbulence and the EV slowdown played a role. Gotion's ties to China created real concerns beyond typical local opposition. But when companies are deciding where to invest billions of dollars, they're watching how Michigan handles these situations. And what they're seeing isn’t going to encourage them.

The message we're sending is: Come to Michigan if you want, but be prepared to fight with local officials, navigate recalls, shell out millions in sweeteners, and maybe still watch the whole thing fall apart.

That really is not the message we want site selectors to get from our state.

Communities should have a voice in what gets built in their backyards. There are legitimate questions about traffic, environmental impact and water usage. But there's a difference between healthy skepticism and reflexive opposition to anything big and new. Too often, Michigan communities seem to be defaulting to the latter.

Michigan spent decades watching manufacturing jobs disappear, watching companies build plants in Tennessee and Kentucky and Alabama instead. When we land a few big projects — batteries, semiconductors, data centers — we seem to be going out of our way to find ways to chase them off.

We can’t let local opposition become the default setting every time a major employer shows interest in Michigan.

There are success stories. Ford's battery plant in Marshall faced opposition but pushed through. It's on track to open next year. The data center near Ann Arbor seems to be moving forward, though there is still an undercurrent of opposition.

Other states are eating our lunch while we argue. They've streamlined their processes. They've made it clear to companies that if you're bringing jobs and investment, you'll find a partner and not an obstacle course.

It’s an important question: The Gotion and Mundy Township sites are still there, with tens of millions of dollars poured into them to prep them to one day be put to use.

Outreach to those communities to make that easier should be going on even in the absence of a new proposal. Lawmakers should also look at ways to give municipal leaders more legal insulation against opponents of using land for the purpose for which it is zoned.

But ultimately, it's incumbent on individual citizens of Michigan to get over the reflexive opposition to change. That has never gotten us very far. And anyone can make the case for progress to their neighbors, which is powerful persuasion.

Because if we continue to hound away major investment, Michigan will cease to be considered — and will cease to have an economic future.",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/Copy%20of%20Copy%20of%2032%20supertamplate.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 15:00:53.704336

First Solar, Inc. announced that it will establish a new facility in Gaffney, Cherokee County, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 Plus modules initiated by the company’s international fleet.

The company expects to spend approximately $330 million to establish the new facility, which is scheduled to commence commercial operations in the second half of 2026. The facility is forecast to create over 600 new jobs with an average manufacturing salary of $74,000 per year, approximately twice the per capita income in Cherokee County.

The South Carolina facility — which will directly support American energy dominance and affordability goals — was catalyzed by demand for domestically-produced energy technology created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Donald J. Trump in July 2025. The facility is expected to increase First Solar’s capacity to produce American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance, by 3.7 gigawatts (GW), reaching 17.7 GW of annual nameplate capacity in 2027.

“South Carolina is proud to be a destination for innovative energy companies that are powering our country with American technology,” said Governor Henry McMaster of South Carolina. “First Solar's investment will create 600 new jobs in Cherokee County, which will greatly strengthen the local economy and help advance America's energy independence. Their expanded presence in our state will provide even more opportunities for hardworking South Carolinians.”

The onshored processes will transform thin film solar cells produced by First Solar’s international fleet into fully completed modules. The new facility expands First Solar’s footprint in South Carolina, which currently includes a distribution center in Duncan, Spartanburg County, and a longstanding partnership with Inland Port Greer. The Gaffney plant will be part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one each in Alabama and Louisiana, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. Altogether, the Company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the U.S. by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the U.S. market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives.”

Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country’s leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company. It is the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the U.S. By 2027, the company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.",,N,,2025-11-14 17:02:06.994819

It stands now at about 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit), and last year alone actually exceeded the 1.5 mark.
It’s not a target, it’s not a goal, it’s a limit, it’s a boundary,” Rockstrom told The Associated Press.
Scientists don't know exactly when and where the danger kicks in during overshoot, nor which is more dangerous: spending a longer period above 1.5 degrees Celsius warming, or warming to levels much higher than 1.5.
The study found they would peak around 1.7 degrees Celsius (3.1 degrees Fahrenheit) and not fall back under until the 2060s.","Belem, Brazil — The world's climate leaders are conceding that Earth's warming will shoot past a hard limit they set a decade ago in hopes of keeping the planet out of a danger zone. But they're not conceding defeat.

United Nations officials, scientists, and analysts are pinning their hopes on eventually forcing global temperatures back below the red line they set in the 2015 Paris Agreement, which sought to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times.

Busting that limit and then coming back down is called “overshoot."" In the way climate science uses the term, it doesn't mean zooming by a red line and never looking back — it's all about seeing the line in the rear view mirror and making a U-turn to get back to lower temperatures.

After years of considering the 1.5 mark a strict no-go situation, officials have in the past few weeks started talking about limiting the time and magnitude of Earth's stay in the danger zone.

The 1.5 figure is based on temperatures averaged over a decade.

‘It’s not a target, it’s not a goal, it’s a limit’

Many scientists have said it's inevitable the 1.5 degree mark will be passed. The mark won't be considered breached until Earth goes beyond it over a 10-year average. It stands now at about 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit), and last year alone actually exceeded the 1.5 mark.

It may be inevitable, but it won't be pretty, they say.

“We have a real risk of triggering irreversible changes in Earth systems when we breach 1.5,’’ said Johan Rockstrom, director of Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Research and a science advisor to the U.N.'s annual climate conference currently being held in the Brazilian Amazon city of Belem.

Those risks include global extinction of coral reefs and exponential growth of killer heat waves. There's also a risk of triggering tipping points for irreversible changes, such as drying out the Amazon rainforest, melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica and maybe even shutting down the entire Atlantic ocean current system, said Rockstrom and Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare. Similar concerns were raised in a special 2018 U.N. report that showed how 1.5 starts the danger zone.

“In Belem, we have more scientific evidence than we had 10 years ago that 1.5 is a real limit. It’s not a target, it’s not a goal, it’s a limit, it’s a boundary,” Rockstrom told The Associated Press. “Go beyond it, we increase suffering of people, and we increase risk of crossing tipping points.”

Likely to be a breach

For the past few years, scientists have said while it's technically possible for the world to stay at or below 1.5, it's not realistic. They calculate the planet is on pace for 2.6 degrees Celsius (4.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since the mid-1800s, which ushered in the Industrial Revolution and a massive uptick in burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.

For years, U.N. officials have insisted that 1.5 is still alive. But now, even though they insist the goal is still pertinent, those same leaders in the last few weeks have acknowledged that it will likely be breached in coming years or decades.

“The science is clear: We can and must bring temperatures back down to 1.5 Celsius after any temporary overshoot,” U.N. climate chief Simon Stiell said as this year's conference began.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, speaking in Geneva last month, was even more blunt, though he added hope.

“Overshooting is now inevitable, which means that we are going to have a period, bigger or smaller, with higher or lower intensity, above 1.5 degrees in the years to come,” Guterres said. “Now, that doesn’t mean that we are condemned to live with 1.5 degrees lost. No.”

U.N. officials said the goal of the 1.5 mark should remain even after the world breaches that mark because it's a target worth keeping.

Overshoot is fallback position

The idea behind overshoot is that temperatures will push past the 1.5 mark, but will be reduced over time. The hope is that once the world stops putting heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere from burning coal, oil and natural gas, that natural carbon sinks such as trees and oceans that suck the carbon pollution out of the air will bring levels down. There's also hope that new technologies will pull carbon dioxide out of the air.

Once the concentration of carbon in the air goes down, so will temperatures — eventually. A lot depends on technology that isn't yet available at any scale large enough to help.

“Without carbon dioxide removal it is simply impossible to manage the overshoot scenario,"" said Ottmar Edenhofer, chief economist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research and chairman of the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change.

Scientists don't know exactly when and where the danger kicks in during overshoot, nor which is more dangerous: spending a longer period above 1.5 degrees Celsius warming, or warming to levels much higher than 1.5.

But they do know the world is likely to be in that zone for decades.

The latest analysis by scientists with Climate Action Tracker shows that if the world does everything possible to reduce emissions — something it has never done — global temperatures are likely to breach 1.5 degrees around 2030. The study found they would peak around 1.7 degrees Celsius (3.1 degrees Fahrenheit) and not fall back under until the 2060s.

But the world's present course is not for a small overshoot, but rather a complete miss, with temperatures still rising in 2100, Hare said.

“Ten years ago we had a more orderly pathway for staying away from 1.5 Celsius entirely, basically with low or no overshoot,"" Rockstrom said. “Now we are 10 years later, we have failed.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/26/PDTN/85831038007-ap-25229479934140.jpg?crop=5858,3298,x0,y299&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-14 16:02:09.407810

Changes in the Rule The primary focus of the changes in the rule is the inclusion of exceptions to reporting.

The action aligns with the general approach EPA has taken under President Trump, which includes rolling back other PFAS regulatory action.

Background

The initial regulation, which was issued by EPA under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), was finalized at the end of 2023, as we discussed here. As summarized on EPA’s website for these TSCA reporting requirements, both the Biden and Trump administrations pushed back the compliance deadlines from the initial regulation.

According to EPA’s press release, the edits in this proposed rule, which are the first substantive changes to the initial regulation, were “to make them more practical and implementable and reduce unnecessary, or potentially duplicative, reporting requirements for businesses.” The initial rule estimates that the changes will save roughly 10-11 million hours and therefore $786-$843 million, 9.3-9.9 hours of which and $703-$761 million of which will be saved by small businesses. [Note: the TSCA defines small manufacturers as those with (1) under $120 million in revenue and less than 100,000 pounds in production volume for a chemical substance or (2) revenues less than $12 million. It is unclear if that is how the rule is defining small businesses in terms of time and money saved.]

Changes in the Rule

The primary focus of the changes in the rule is the inclusion of exceptions to reporting. The proposed rule excepts the following categories:

De Minimis Concentrations – concentrations under 0.1%.

The proposed rule focuses on the mismatch between the backward-facing requirements of the regulation and the fact that companies generally were not required to keep this information, which could especially cause issues for imports.

However, the rule notes that there is no production volume limitation, which means that this exception could allow for large volumes of PFAS as long as they are part of very large quantities of base products (g., it would allow for 100 pounds of PFAS on a product that is greater than 100,000 pounds).

Imported Articles – PFAS imported as part of an article (a term defined in the TSCA).

The focus here again is on the mismatch between what was required to be provided at the time of receipt versus what would be required under this new rule.

However, given the international nature of the U.S. economy, this could exempt significant amounts of information.

Byproducts, Impurities, Non-Isolated Intermediaries, etc. – chemical mixtures that fit the definitions in 40 CFR 720.30(h), which are generally focused on subsidiary aspects of the manufacturing process and those that are not provided to the public.

The focus here is on an expected lack of value/relevance in the information related to these products.

However, the practical impact of this exception on the overall quantification and evaluation of PFAS is unclear.

Research and Development (R&D) Chemicals – PFAS manufactured or imported for R&D purposes.

The focus here again is that this information would provide minimal practical value.

However, there will be no limit to the quantity here that would be exempted (although regulations do limit the amount that could qualify for R&D as an amount “not greater than reasonably necessary for such purposes.”

The proposed rule also discusses clarifications and technical corrections.

Potential Other Changes – Requests for Comments

Although the changes proposed in this initial rule are limited in scope, EPA is also requesting comment on other related issues that could greatly expand the scope of the changes from the initial rule including:

Raising the de minimis threshold to 1.0% (instead of 0.1%).

Whether the National Defense Authorization Act (which edited the TSCA in 2020) should be read as excluding imports altogether (thus making an exception unnecessary and potentially impacting other regulations).

Amending the scope of PFAS covered under this rule.

Modifying any assumptions or cost savings calculations in its economic analysis.

Next Steps

Comments on the proposed rule must be received by December 29, 2025. They can be provided here and should include docket ID number EPA-HQ-OPPT-2020-0549.

The reporting period would then start 60 days after the effective date of the final rule and then last for three months.",https://www.californiawaterviews.com/assets/images-t1763147456/1941.png,N,,2025-11-14 15:00:50.531814

The manual ProZision models will go on sale in February 2026 and the autonomous model will follow in Summer 2026.
“Honda is unveiling the ProZision and ProZision Autonomous battery-powered ZTR lawn mowers as the industry navigates uncertainty in workforce stability, equipment investment returns, and operational cost controls—across short- and long-term horizons,” said Mark Kohls, VP of Honda Power Sports & Products, American Honda Motor.
“Honda ProZision lawn mowers provide zero-emission options that complement gasoline-powered fleets to reduce operating costs and enhance sustainability in landscape maintenance.”","Honda Power Sports & Products, a subsidiary of American Honda Motor, has launched a new lineup of battery-powered, zero-turn-radius (ZTR) lawnmowers branded under the ProZision name.

The ProZision range includes 54-inch and 60-inch manual models, as well as a 60-inch autonomous model. The lawnmowers further diversify the company’s outdoor power product portfolio for a variety of users, conditions and commercial applications.

The lawnmowers are powered by five 48 V brushless electric motors: three deck motors that rotate MicroCut Twin Blades and two drive wheel motors that maneuver the vehicle with precise control. The mowers are fitted with six lithium-ion batteries and a 4.3-inch touchscreen display panel that indicates operation status and battery state of charge. The motors and charging system incorporate electrical quick connectors for fast and easy connection and disconnection for service.

The models provide sufficient power to mow at higher speeds. Three different driving modes—Rapid, Normal and Precise—allow the operator to control mower speed to adjust to various turf conditions.

The chassis and main components are constructed from durable steel, with high-strength, low-alloy (HSLA) steel used strategically to provide strength while minimizing weight.

The manual HZ54SXB features a 54-inch cutting width and uses 19-inch MicroCut Twin Blades with a side-discharge deck. It charges in 16.5 hours at 120 V or 6.5 hours at 240 V. The mower offers a run time of 4.2-4.5 hours and can cover approximately 13-14 acres, depending on conditions.

The manual HZ60SXB has a 60-inch cutting width and a side-discharge deck equipped with 21-inch MicroCut Twin Blades. Charging takes 16.5 hours at 120 V or 6.5 hours at 240 V. It provides a run time of 4-4.3 hours, covering around 14-15 acres depending on conditions.

The autonomous HZA60RXB offers a 60-inch cutting width and a rear-discharge deck with 21-inch MicroCut Twin Blades. It charges in 16.5 hours at 120 V or 6.5 hours at 240 V. The mower can cover up to 15 acres, depending on operating conditions. It also features omnidirectional sensing, providing a full 360-degree view via radar and LiDAR sensors for obstacle detection. The rear-discharge deck directs debris backward rather than sideways, reducing the risk of hitting nearby objects or people during autonomous operation.

All three models are backed by a commercial limited warranty of three years or 2,000 hours, whichever comes first.

The ProZision model will be produced at the Honda manufacturing facility in Swepsonville, North Carolina, using globally made parts. The manual ProZision models will go on sale in February 2026 and the autonomous model will follow in Summer 2026.

We discussed what happens behind the scenes of an EV battery recall, how the process differs from traditional ICE vehicle recalls, and the safety protocols that determine where each battery ends up.
Bryce Cornet: The first thing that is considered is whether it is a safety recall or a traditional mechanical recall.
Customers get a letter in the mail saying the battery in their vehicle is affected by a safety recall.
Bryce Cornet: EV batteries are packaged more robustly if it is a safety recall.","As EV adoption accelerates, so does the frequency of battery recalls—and the operational expertise they require.

In recent months, a string of recalls from major automakers has underscored the complexities of EV battery systems. Hyundai recently pulled back a limited number of 2025 IONIQ 5s in the US after identifying a short-circuit risk linked to a faulty battery pack busbar. Ford has expanded its recall of 2022 Mustang Mach-E models with extended-range batteries owing to overheating contactors that could cause a sudden loss of drive power. And BMW has faced back-to-back recalls—one affecting more than 70,000 vehicles over a software issue that could cause the high-voltage system to shut down unexpectedly, and another targeting 136 EVs in the US for incorrectly assembled battery cell modules that could lead to power loss or fire.

In some cases, these issues can be remedied with software updates. In others, the battery needs to be removed entirely and replaced.

Unlike traditional vehicle recalls, which can often be resolved with a quick part swap, removing and replacing an EV battery can take hours and must be repeated across hundreds or thousands of vehicles—often under tight timelines. For a recent luxury EV model recall of more than 25,000 vehicles, the removal took nine hours per battery.

Once consumers are notified, an extensive technical response is mobilized. Teams of technicians, transport specialists and supply chain managers coordinate a complex operation to ensure that every recalled battery is safely handled, shipped, and then repaired, recycled or disposed of under strict protocols.

To understand the realities of this process, Charged spoke with Bryce Cornet, Senior Manager of Supply Chain Logistics at EV Battery Solutions by Cox Automotive.

We discussed what happens behind the scenes of an EV battery recall, how the process differs from traditional ICE vehicle recalls, and the safety protocols that determine where each battery ends up.

Charged: What are the first steps when a battery recall is announced?

Bryce Cornet: The first thing that is considered is whether it is a safety recall or a traditional mechanical recall.

When batteries have a safety recall applied to them, most of the time an OEM has had discussions with agencies like NHTSA and then released an announcement to customers. Customers get a letter in the mail saying the battery in their vehicle is affected by a safety recall. There could be instructions, depending on how severe the safety situation is, but for the most part it’s to explain to the customer that they need to bring their car in for battery replacement.

If the recall is large enough, it may be bucketed based on the criticality of potential failures. The OEM will have data around when the production failure happened. Some batteries may be more critical than others, and they have an idea of which Vehicle Identification Numbers, or VINs, have these batteries in them. That’s something we’re able to help with too, because we have a software system that ties into the vehicle.

Often dealers are doing these repairs for the OEM. Is the dealer prepared to take on a large number of recalled repairs? They may go from doing one repair a month to 20 repairs a month. Do they have the space to store battery packs? What are the ergonomics of moving a battery through a dealership network? Do they have the tools?

Another question is whether the recall is pack-level or cell-level. Primarily, what we deal with are module- and cell-level recalls. In that case, the whole battery pack is removed from the vehicle and shipped to us, either for module replacements—maybe we can find the critical module and replace it and certify it—or it could be that the full battery pack needs to be re-cycled, in which case we do disassembly operations to make it safe to recycle.

On top of disassembly and recycling, there is a storage component to consider. Some of these battery packs may be held for a certain amount of time, but they need to be held safely.

Our warehouses at EV Battery Solutions have high-pressure fire suppression systems. We support the dealer in getting batteries away from the dealership as quickly as possible, because they often don’t have a lot of extra storage for battery packs. The important thing is getting the pack and storing it if we have to, or getting it quickly to recycling, to get rid of any type of risk.

Charged: How is transportation handled, given the risks of shipping large lithium-ion batteries?

Bryce Cornet: EV batteries are packaged more robustly if it is a safety recall. A portion of this is planning, to safely transport a battery from a dealership or from distribution sites. That battery has to move through public ecosystems on trucks.

When a safety recall hits, the battery falls under a hazmat regulation in 49 CFR with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, PHMSA, which states if the battery is damaged, defective or recalled, it cannot be transported by air or other means. We’re passionate about making recycling as close to a dealership as possible, because you don’t want to transport batteries far that potentially could have safety recalls.

Charged: Can you walk us through the logistical process of removing and handling a recalled battery?

Bryce Cornet: The process varies based on the OEM, because every OEM has their secret sauce for how the battery fits into the vehicle. The form factor is different. You’re often dealing with high-voltage connections, and it may not be easy to get to them to pull them out.

One thing that we often run into, in addition to understanding how difficult it could be for dealers to remove that from the vehicle, is simply when we get it to our sites, there’s another layer of complexity, depending on how the battery shell mounts over the modules. Is it sealed with a glue? Is it bolted down and sealed?

We have to account for the time it takes to do the disassembly-to-recycling option, because often there’s a rush to get these batteries off the road and get them recycled quickly. That can be quite the undertaking, especially as it can take anywhere from four to nine hours to fully disassemble a battery pack.

Charged: What are the biggest safety risks technicians face during battery removal, and how are those managed?

Bryce Cornet: The biggest risk is that you’re dealing with something that has charge within it, which is somewhat different from pulling an engine out. You’re having to work around high-voltage cables. There is a process to limit the voltage on the pack before they work on it, which should be a part of training.

Personal protective equipment, PPE, while they’re doing the job is likely different from traditional repairs and is important. And then after you remove the pack you don’t want to store the battery pack outside.

Depending on what may be communicated by the OEM, if it is a safety recall and there are risks, you have to consider storage and packaging. You want to make sure that it’s packaged in compliant packaging and not left on a pallet outside. There are also requirements to protect the environment that the dealer would need to know.

Charged: Are there enough skilled technicians in the industry to manage the process?

Bryce Cornet: Part of the safety aspect is safe scaling. We often have to train, hire and rehire to stand up more disassembly base. The dealer may also have to dedicate more people and more bays to these repairs, because that’s the quickest way to address long repair times.

Every time we’ve done a recall, we’ve had to hire new people that may not have been involved with EV batteries before, and that’s a risk. You have to be on it with operating instructions, having safety meetings every morning, and training your team before turning them loose on potential repairs. Dealers face the same issues with getting new EV technicians.

The number is growing, but it’s not necessarily at the point where every OEM is happy with the number of EV-certified techs.

We have an initiative inside Cox that is training all of our Manheim Auction sites to be EV-certified. Dealers are doing the same thing and that’s getting better. But finding high-quality, good talent to work on EVs can be a challenge—it is a difference from ICE. You see a lot of ICE technicians moving over to EVs, because some OEMs are adding more EVs to their fleets.

Charged: How does an EV recall differ from an ICE recall?

Bryce Cornet: One thing is the size—the battery can be quite large. One of the recalls we supported was a battery pack that was about 1,000 pounds. It was about 1,800 pounds in a crate in total. You have a dealership inserting an item that may be five times the size of the engines and transmissions they’re used to dealing with.

And that leads into other factors that are different for EV batteries. It goes all the way down to logistics. Carriers are used to moving all kinds of cargo, not just batteries. We need to educate the carrier to take precautions when they’re handling a battery.

There are technical requirements when we take an order. A dealer will contact us to say they have a vehicle down and need a battery. There is specific information we need to take from the dealer about the battery that is different from a transmission.

On a transmission, you’re looking at mileage as an indicator of health. But for batteries, you are looking at mileage, but you’re also looking at state of charge, how much percentage charge is in the battery. That affects how the OEM and how we interact with the battery when it arrives.

When we get a battery in, we’re often assessing if it’s good enough to go back into a vehicle or not. Is it safe? Are there things we can do to repair it, or does it need to go to recycling? There are different technical requirements for EVs, for us to make a decision on its criticality.

Charged: How do you decide whether it’s repaired, recycled or scrapped?

Bryce Cornet: You wouldn’t want to find out that a vehicle that was once a part of a safety recall ever has a battery that is part of another recall. Most of the time these batteries—the full packs—are disassembled and recycled immediately.

When we take in a battery, we get a core of varying health. The dealer doesn’t know of its health, usually, and we transport it here to diagnose it. We run a series of resistance measurements and voltage checks to get a baseline of what we’re looking at. Those baseline measurements are often partnered with diagnostic trouble codes, or DTCs, that tell us if there’s a low cell, a dead cell, or something specific.

Enough of that data leads us to a direction to tell if it is a good repair. If it has this DTC and these readings, we can potentially repair it. If it falls outside that window, we may have to recycle it.

At one time, we were manufacturing our own second-life energy storage systems. We’ve since stopped, but we do support other entities and OEMs with finding and testing battery cores to potentially allow them to do second life.

What we’ve often found difficult is that, to be used for second life, a battery has to be in a sweet spot in between being good enough to go back into a car or bad enough that it needs to be recycled. And as profitable as recycling is becoming, for a lot of OEMs and for recyclers, there’s less of the second use happening.

Charged: What’s the biggest recall you’ve been involved in?

Bryce Cornet: The biggest recall affected about 150,000 vehicles in the US and Europe. My team had been doing 200-300 battery shipments a month, and at the peak of this recall we were doing about 600 battery shipments a day from a site in Detroit and a site in Oklahoma City.

We were shipping out new batteries and getting back the bad batteries. These batteries weighed 1,500 pounds, and there was a process in which we had to move each battery from one crate to another before we could ship it. We had workstations with cranes, and we built a whole process where it was like a pit stop for a battery. We had about four people under that crane and they all had their job. The same thing was done for the shipping process to speed up how many we were doing.

We had a timeline of how quickly this specific client wanted the recall completed. We reduced our fulfillment times from about 20 minutes per battery pack to about five minutes. There were software enhancements that we did to make it more automated. We developed a Quick Connect system to lift the battery pack out that saved five minutes alone. In these large peaks of volume, you start to see a lot of innovation happen.

Charged: Are you seeing innovations in robotics or AI that could be incorporated into the process?

Bryce Cornet: It could be valuable in assessing a battery for damage when it’s brought in. We’re also looking into robotic automation to limit the risk to technicians from having to pull modules out of the battery, and cut out any issues with human error that could happen with tedious tasks like replacing modules.

Charged: As commercial EV adoption increases, how does that potentially affect a big recall?

Bryce Cornet: We have a lot of partners where we deal with battery packs as large as 4,500 to 10,000 pounds, where you’re touching some of those commercial applications.

We have an efficient model to deal with scaling for a recall. But any time that happens we run into issues like truck availability. Moving these large battery packs requires specific types of logistics or carrier transport—specific trailers to move the battery on. That could strain the supply chain, because it’s not traditional for those trailers to be used in high volume.

We’re knowledgeable about that now, because we’ve faced it, but in a high volume we would have to work with our partners to make that change.

Charged: As EV adoption grows, do you expect recalls to become more frequent, or could the technology develop in a way that recalls become less likely?

Bryce Cornet: It’s hard to say. It is true that as the sample size grows, we could have more recalls just from having more EVs on the road, or OEMs trying more things.

But what’s interesting is the changing of chemistries. A lot of OEMs are talking about LFP. The term solid-state is thrown around a lot, and there are a lot of different potential chemistries and ideas. How does LFP affect potential recalls? Does it make it better or worse? Is it easier to handle LFP than the traditional NMC packs? We don’t have the answer yet, but as some of these OEMs change their chemistries, we’ll quickly find out.",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Inside-the-EV-battery-recall-process—the-complexity-of-safety-and-logistics-3.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 12:02:52.729621

The rains were very heavy and it was difficult to walk; the water on the roads was ankle-deep.
Slowly, the water came up to my waist, but I continued walking as if I wasn’t aware.
The water could not be pumped, so we had to carry water up from the ground floor.
I make it a point that my husband informs me that he has reached office safely and at what point he’s leaving the office.","It was raining that day, and very windy. I was in my office, and one of my colleagues said he had heard on the radio that the trains would stop very soon because the tracks had become flooded. He said, “Ruchira, why don’t you leave?” He knew that I had two daughters and had to relieve my childcare by 6pm.

Immediately, I collected my bag and umbrella and called my husband. I didn’t know what was happening. My colleague advised me not to sit in the ladies’ coach on the train (in Mumbai we have a separate coach for ladies). He said, “You’d better go in the general coach, because if something happens you will have the support of other people there.”

The station was about 10 minutes from my office. Rain was hitting my body. My umbrella was useless in that wind and rain. A lot of water was already on the road. I remember my lower legs, feet and shoes were wet by the time I reached the station.

There were a lot of people, a lot of noise, at Churchgate station; everyone wanted to catch a train and go home. There were public announcements about train services getting affected. I walked on board and sat down in the last train leaving the station. It was crowded and moved very slowly because of the water on the tracks. The roof of the coach was leaking, so we were all sitting with open umbrellas inside the coach. After five or six stations, the train stopped at Bandra, where it was announced that the train would not move further because of the flooding on the tracks.

There were still quite a few people at the station. I got out of the train and crossed the bridge, over the platform, to reach the road. It was raining very heavily, and on the bridge you could feel the rain and the wind more. I couldn’t open my eyes. I was not wearing a raincoat. I just had my bag, which I clung tightly to my body to give me some warmth. I was already almost all wet. There were still quite a few people at the station.

I crossed the bridge, thinking, “What should I do?” Home was still another four to five stations away, and then I would need to take a bus or taxi from the train station. My husband’s office, Bandra Kurla Complex, was in the vicinity, so I called him from a public phone. He said, “My office is closing early. People are scared about the floods. The buses will be leaving soon to take us home. Come to my office and we will go together.”

I started walking, hoping to find a taxi or an autorickshaw to take me to his office, but there were none. I continued walking, I don’t remember how far. I reached a big intersection going towards the Bandra Kurla Complex. The rains were very heavy and it was difficult to walk; the water on the roads was ankle-deep. I stopped a truck and told the driver I needed to go to Bandra Kurla Complex. There was a gas station nearby, and he said, “I can drop you there.”

From there I started walking towards my husband’s office, across the road. It was a considerable distance because the roads were very broad. The water there was about knee-deep, but I continued walking.

Slowly, the water came up to my waist, but I continued walking as if I wasn’t aware. I did not even think about if there were any loose electric wires or open drains in the middle of the road. I just continued walking.

Opposite my husband’s office there were cars floating in the water. I felt amused at first; then I felt fear. I reached my husband’s office, where the buses were parked, waiting to take people to their homes. Some buses which had left earlier started to come back. The roads were all flooded, so there was no way they could go further.

It was 5 or 6pm already. My daughters were alone at home with the caregiver. A friend of mine lived in another residence complex some distance away from mine. I could not connect to her, but I knew if I sent my daughters to her she would take care of them. But you had to walk up a small slope to reach her place. I told my helper to take the children to my friend’s place. She said there was no way they could, because the water was coming down from the slope at very high speed. They would have drowned in that water.

I called the wife of my husband’s colleague, who lived in the same complex. I don’t take favours easily from anyone. But I had no choice; I had to ask for a favour. I asked my helper, “Drop them to this madam’s place”. My oldest was six. My younger one was just three. I spoke with my daughters on the phone. I started crying. My oldest said, “Don’t worry, mama. We’ll be fine. I’ll take care of her.” Then I talked to my youngest. She was like, “No mama, I want you. Mama, come home. When will you come home?” That was very traumatic for me. I was relieved that they would not be alone at home and would be with family. I was praying that my daughters would remain safe. I am a strong believer in prayers.

After settling my daughters, I was OK. I felt very cold, because I was drenched and there was air conditioning in the office. There used to be a canteen there, so the staff broke open all the cupboards and whatever they could find, they tried to cook. Since food was limited, it was rationed out so that everyone could get something to eat, as we were not aware how long this would last. One spoon of rice, one spoon of dal.

We tried to make ourselves comfortable. There was a big hallway. There were some couches there and my husband and I sat on one couch; other people also sat on couches, or went back to their cubicles. The roads were still flooded the next day; no transportation was working. Some people went out and tried to reach home, but came back. There was muddy water everywhere. We were in the office the whole day.

My niece called me. She was living with us in Mumbai, interning with a law firm. I did not know whether she was in her office or out somewhere trying to reach home, stuck in the floods. She told me she had slept in the office the first night and then walked home. It took her two to three hours. I told her, “Please get my daughters home and keep them with you. Give them food.”

On the third day the rains stopped, but the water was still on the roads. There was no food and I needed my inhaler. I’m asthmatic, and was not carrying my inhaler in my bag. I was having difficulty breathing. There was a hospital just across the road. My husband could not walk in the water, because he had some injury on his foot. He said: “There’s no rain now. See if you can go to the hospital and get medicines from the pharmacy.”

Nothing had been done by the civic authorities to clean up the roads. It was all kichir (muddy slush). I managed to reach the hospital. Inside, there were a lot of staff, doctors and nurses. I went to the pharmacy, bought the medicines, and then saw the canteen.

Of course, I was hungry, and I knew there was no more food in the office. I asked if I could also get some food. I said, “I’ve come from this office. I’m hungry and I need to take my medicines, so please can I get some food?” I don’t think I can explain the emotions I went through. I started to cry.

I realised the humiliation and the helplessness of begging for food. They were considerate. I got some food from them. I came back to the office and told my husband, “I got food there. I’m glad that there’s one person less for the office to give food to.”

That evening it was decided: “Let us venture out and try to go back home.” The people who had cars made carpools. It was decided that my husband and I would travel in two different cars, because even if one car got stuck somewhere or something happened at least one of us would still be safe and could reach home. We did not know what to expect out on the roads. It was very scary. Would we encounter more water? The buses were stuck on the road. There were no lights on the streets. A lot of responsibility was on the driver. Filth and mess was everywhere.

I think I reached home first. I was relieved to have made it back safely, for my daughters. There was no electricity, no running water. As Mumbai had a regular electricity supply, we had no candles at home. The water could not be pumped, so we had to carry water up from the ground floor. We were living on the third or fourth floor.

Electricity was restored one or two days after I reached home. Then the newspapers started coming. The stories were so sad and so scary. People drowned in cars. People left home to bring their children from school and drowned in maintenance holes. Electric wires broke from the poles and fell into the water, so people were electrocuted.

For the next year I avoided going to work if it was raining heavily. I was scared of leaving my daughters alone at home again. I’m traumatised. I’m afraid to go out if it rains heavily. I had not realised it until recently. I make it a point that my husband informs me that he has reached office safely and at what point he’s leaving the office. Even small things worry me now.

At the time, there was no mention of climate change. Now, when I look back, I know this is the result of climate change. It has been creeping up on us slowly, and now it is there for everyone to realise. Climate change is happening around us. Each one of us has a role in it. The only hope we have is the youth and the children. They’re trying to bring more awareness, to pressurise governments to take positive action.

I haven’t seen much change since the floods. Life went on quite like normal after that. I feel sad about it. I feel sad about all the lives that were lost. I feel sorry. No one was willing to take responsibility. I felt we were completely deserted and left to our own fate. People have to take responsibility.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/483ce61bdd9d79060937ebe802d160431caba499/519_328_4372_3497/master/4372.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0894985b8621174ab196e91f52aa787a",N,,2025-11-14 15:01:14.016922

Compared to current flows, meeting the USD590bn annual net zero financing gap would require a nearly 22-fold increase in climate finance flows.","The net zero financing gap

The amount of money needed to deliver net zero still exceeds annual spending on emissions reductions, but achieving the required investment appears tantalizingly within reach. This is the headline finding from the third annual Climate Policy Initiative/A&O Shearman study ""How big is the net zero financing gap?"", which analyzes the differential between committed climate finance and the capital needed to decarbonize the global economy by 2050.

If the current trajectory of climate investment (26% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2020 and 2023) can be sustained in the coming years, annual climate finance flows could approach USD6.2 trillion by 2029, the lower bound of estimated needs for the period 2024 to 2030.

Having said that, mounting geopolitical headwinds threaten to slow momentum, underscoring the urgent need for targeted interventions to bridge the gap and keep global climate goals in sight.

The study reveals that:

Climate finance flows have hit new highs in recent years, with global investment in mitigation and adaptation measures reaching USD1.9tn in 2023, the last year for which full data is available. Based on our projections, this figure was expected to surpass USD2tn for the first time in 2024.

Across all major sectors, the average gap between investment in climate mitigation measures in 2023 and the sums required between 2024 and 2030 to align to a net zero pathway was USD5.9tn (a range of USD4.5tn to USD7.8tn).

For the first time, private climate finance contributions exceeded USD1tn in 2023, outpacing public investment.

As policy support for climate objectives and official development assistance decreases across the world, directing dwindling resources to where they are most needed is essential to support the energy transition. In the U.S., the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act has rolled back several provisions of the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), including eliminating a number of tax credits that had underpinned clean energy investment. In the European Union, fiscal pressures and shifting policy priorities pose a challenge to the implementation of environmental policies. At the same time, heightened geopolitical tensions and growing defense demands are intensifying competition for government spending, diverting resources that might otherwise have been directed toward climate and development goals.

This study highlights where policymakers, governments, and investors can focus their efforts to align capital flows with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Investment in physical assets is needed, as is continued support for enabling activities such as information-sharing and climate science research.

Failing to invest in climate mitigation and adaptation measures will exacerbate expected economic, social, and environmental damage from rising global temperatures and more extreme weather events. It will also mean communities will not gain from associated benefits such as enhanced food security, greater energy efficiency, and improved health outcomes.

Global trends

To keep the world on a net zero pathway, investment in climate mitigation measures must rise to between USD6.2tn and USD9.5tn (USD7.6tn on average) per year by 2030.

This leaves an annual gap of USD4.5tn to USD7.8tn (USD5.9tn on average) compared to 2023 climate mitigation investment of USD1.7tn . For the period 2031 to 50, this investment needs range increases to USD6.9tn to USD11.3tn (USD9tn on average).

Achieving the required investment levels appears increasingly within reach. If global climate finance flows continue to rise at the current five-year CAGR of 18% (2018 to 2023), investment could meet the lower boundary of estimated climate finance needs by 2032. At the faster three-year CAGR of 26% (2020 to 2023), this could be achieved by 2029. However, each year of delay causes the financing gap to grow.

This year's analysis, for the first time, breaks down the investment gap by the development status of nations across all major sectors. No region is currently achieving the climate investment required to stay on a net zero pathway. The gap is widest in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs, excluding China), where investment needs are 8.3 times higher than 2023 climate finance flows. This is approximately twice the gap that exists in advanced economies (4.8 times 2023 flows). However, in absolute terms, climate finance flows need to grow more in advanced economies, with an additional USD2.9tn required annually from 2024-2030 compared to 2023 investment levels.

Climate investment is highest in advanced economies and China, while EMDE regions such as the Middle East, North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa remain significantly underfunded. A handful of EMDEs (excluding China) are seeing an uptick in climate finance flows, driven by investment in clean energy (predominantly small-scale solar), as well as the transport and buildings sectors (CPI, 2025). EMDEs (excluding China) require an estimated USD2.3tn of climate finance annually between now and 2030, rising to USD2.8tn from 2031-2050. This constitutes 30% of global investment needs.

China accounts for 21% of global climate finance needs between 2024 and 2030, dropping slightly to 20% between 2031 and 2050. An average of USD1.6tn is required annually in China between 2024 and 2030, rising to USD1.7tn between 2031 and 2050.

Advanced economies account for roughly half of global climate finance needs (49% in 2024-2030 and 50% in 2031-2050), requiring USD3.7tn and USD4.5tn respectively.

Sectoral trends

Energy systems received more climate mitigation investment in 2023 (USD794bn, 45% of all climate finance flows) than any other sector, but interestingly, also have the highest financing gap of USD2.1tn per year between 2024 and 2030 compared to 2023 levels. This figure rises slightly to USD2.2tn per year between 2031 and 2050.

The second-highest climate finance flows in 2023 involved the transport sector, totaling USD540bn (30% of global climate mitigation investment). Like energy systems, the investment needed to transition transport is significant (USD1.9tn annually between 2024 and 2030), an almost 2.5-fold increase on current climate finance flows. However, this investment could help to realize the sector's mitigation potential of GtCO2e per year by 2030.

Climate investment priorities include electrification of private road transport, public transport expansion, and freight decarbonization. Estimates for investment needs in electrifying transport vary, but low-emission vehicles could require an average of USD2.4tn per year between 2024 and 2030.

More climate finance is required for transport in Western Europe than any other sector (37% of the region's needs between 2024 and 2030).

Regional investment gaps in transport show a higher variability than for energy systems. Global climate finance needs for the transport sector are 3.5 times current climate finance flows, but investment would need to increase by between 26 and 38 times in the Middle East and North Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Sub-Saharan Africa.

The transport sector will require USD2.6tn in annual climate mitigation investment between 2031 and 2050, a 41% increase from 2024-2030 levels. This represents the largest rise in investment needs for any sector.

The third-highest climate finance flows in 2023 (USD340bn) involved the buildings and infrastructure sector. However, the sector requires an average of USD1.1tn in climate investment between 2024 and 2030, meaning mitigation finance will need to rise more than threefold to close the gap and unlock its 3 GtCO2e mitigation potential.

Focus areas include scaling of low-carbon heating and cooking (which will require USD880bn annually between 2024 and 2030), and energy-efficient retrofits (USD630bn annually between 2024 and 2030).

Buildings and infrastructure require the most climate mitigation investment as a proportion of total climate finance in Central Asia and Eastern Europe (26% of regional needs), the Middle East and North Africa (23%), and Western Europe (22%).

The relative net zero financing gap is greatest in the Middle East and North Africa, where investment needs are 13 times greater than 2023 investment flows.

Overall, the sector will require USD1.4tn in climate finance on average between 2031 and 2050, an increase of 27% on 2024-2030 levels, driven primarily by the need for low-carbon heating and cooling systems.

The industry sector received USD27bn in climate mitigation investment in 2023, the second-lowest total in our study. Compared to current flows, meeting the USD590bn annual net zero financing gap would require a nearly 22-fold increase in climate finance flows. With the simultaneous decrease in high-carbon activities, this sectoral transformation could unlock 4 GtCO2e in annual abatement potential by 2030—higher than that of transport or buildings and infrastructure.

Key areas include low-emission production of aluminum, cement, steel, ammonia, and other chemicals, as well as carbon capture and storage.

Despite having the lowest investment needs across all regions, there are some geographic disparities. The industry sector requires around USD100bn in mitigation investment annually in China between 2024 and 2030 and USD122bn in South and Southeast Asia (16% of regional needs) over the same period.

The global net zero financing gap in the industry sector is 22 times 2023 climate finance flows. The gap varies from seven times current climate finance flows in Western Europe to 48 times in China.

Between 2031 and 2050, industry will require USD650bn in annual mitigation investment, a 10% increase on the period between 2024 and 2030.

The agriculture, forestry and other land uses (AFOLU) sector offers a climate mitigation potential second only to the energy sector (8 GtCO2e per year by 2030). However, to realize this, climate finance flows need to increase 60-fold from USD19bn in 2023 to an annual average of USD1.2tn in the period between 2024 and 2030.

Policy support and capacity building will be central to the sector's transition, accounting for 40% of climate finance needs between 2024 and 2030.The development of sustainable crops and livestock practices will also require substantial support (28%).

Forest and biodiversity conservation is crucial, with 74% of AFOLU's mitigation potential linked to transforming forest-related activities and developing carbon sinks.

AFOLU investment needs increase by a modest 7% between 2024 to 2030 and 2031 to 2050, demonstrating the urgent need for immediate investment. Delaying action until after 2030 will be insufficient to meet sectoral and climate goals.

Recent policy developments

2024

Preliminary estimates suggest that climate finance flows increased by around 8% in 2024, surpassing USD2tn for the first time. While these projections are encouraging, they are lower than the 15% increase recorded between 2022 and 2023. The transport sector remains the largest driver, buoyed by demand for EVs and supporting infrastructure.

This resilience is notable considering headwinds that likely slowed momentum.

Macroeconomic conditions: interest rates, which were raised sharply over the 2022-2023 period, and remained high for much of 2024, have raised the cost of capital. The effects were particularly pronounced in EMDEs due to their higher reliance on external borrowing and vulnerability to currency fluctuations. The increase in U.S. interest rates typically elevates debt servicing costs for EMDEs with dollar-denominated liabilities. This scenario exacerbates existing debt burdens, and discourages capital inflows.

Energy market dynamics: lower gas prices and higher electricity costs over the same period dampened heat pump sales in Europe.

Grid bottlenecks: rapid renewable deployment outpaced infrastructure capacity, leaving 1,650 GW of solar and wind awaiting connection worldwide.

Despite surpassing the USD2tn milestone, the slowdown in growth suggests that the net zero investment gap could widen further in the coming years unless immediate global action is taken to accelerate climate investments across all regions and sectors.

2025

Global clean energy investment in 2025 shows early signs of resilience to policy shifts and tighter market conditions, with offshore wind and small-scale solar driving an increase in renewables investment in the first half of the year.

In the United States, however, growth in renewable spending is set to level off as federal support eases, with knock-on effects for international capital flows to EMDEs.

At the same time, higher interest rates, supply chain pressures, and evolving regulatory frameworks are likely to heighten investor caution. With aid budgets under pressure and geopolitical priorities reshaping development policy, development finance institutions (DFIs) face growing pressure to ""do more with less"".

This is likely to accelerate the use of innovative financial instruments and catalytic approaches to maximize limited resources. The International Finance Corporation's recent inaugural securitization transaction exemplifies this approach, setting a new model for attracting institutional private capital into EMDEs.

Climate-related financial regulation and commitments are facing mounting legal and political challenges. In the United States, financial institutions have faced litigation over their participation in net-zero and ESG initiatives, prompting a wave of exits from voluntary climate alliances. The Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) has announced it will cease operations following a vote to dissolve the group, having already lost numerous members due to claims by some U.S. lawmakers that participation violated antitrust laws.

At the same time, global climate litigation risk continues to grow. While the full impact of these developments remains uncertain, they risk slowing the pace of portfolio decarbonization as financial institutions navigate conflicting regulatory pressures and political challenges.

Despite evolving federal policy frameworks, some U.S. states continue to advance climate agendas. Following California's 2023 model, New York and Colorado have adopted emissions disclosure requirements, alongside renewable energy targets and net zero commitments.

This state-level regulatory environment has helped maintain the attractiveness of net zero investments, even while some renewable infrastructure companies take legal action against the federal government over cancelled projects.

For example, Iberdrola allocated a significant portion of its three-year investment plan to the U.S. and UK markets, with executive chair Ignacio Galán citing state-regulated electricity networks as a key factor in the U.S. market's appeal. Additionally, focus on data center capacity—driven by the expansion of artificial intelligence—is accelerating investment in clean energy infrastructure, particularly geothermal and nuclear. Major technology companies are securing long-term renewable energy agreements, further reinforcing sector growth.

Outside the U.S., global climate policy momentum has shown resilience through multilateral initiatives and regulatory frameworks. In March, for example, Germany and Japan reinforced Indonesia's USD20bn Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) following the withdrawal of the U.S., ensuring the continuation of the coal-to-clean-energy transition plan. The proliferation of climate policies worldwide provides a buffer against individual country rollbacks. Even if regulatory requirements fluctuate in certain countries following political and business cycles, companies operating internationally are still likely to encounter increasing global climate disclosure obligations. Despite this progress, significant gaps remain between current ambition and policy implementation to meet global climate targets.

A slowdown in U.S. clean technology deployment could create opportunities for other major economies such as China, India, and Brazil, to capture greater market share in both production and investment. China already dominates the global manufacture of key technologies such as solar panels, batteries, and EVs, while Brazil and India are rapidly scaling renewable investment and could emerge as significant exporters by 2035. With clean technology accounting for 10% of global GDP growth in 2023, and the global clean tech market projected to exceed USD2tn by 2035, reduced U.S. leadership could accelerate the rise of alternative suppliers.

Conclusion

Climate finance has reached record levels, but slowing economic growth and rising geopolitical and economic headwinds risk widening the net zero investment gap. To meet global climate goals, recent momentum needs to be sustained and in certain sectors and scaled further. This will not happen without deliberate action.

This study identifies where action can deliver the greatest impact, offering guidance to policymakers, investors, and governments. By making this data and analysis publicly available, we aim to sharpen focus on both the urgency of the challenge and the scale of the opportunity, helping to guide decisions that will help keep net zero within reach.

A hiring drive was held earlier this year for the gigafactory, and continues to hire for positions, bringing a vast employment boost to St. Thomas, a town with just 43,000 residents.
""The excitement in St. Thomas is palpable, as we celebrate this monumental construction milestone,"" said Preston of the ground breaking last month.
""The St. Thomas gigafactory is rapidly coming to life and already delivering on its promise of prosperity — supporting hundreds of local jobs and providing a significant boost to our economy right here in our community.""
The outlook for the short term is pretty bleak, and the federal government's budget presented in November 2025 has already been met with criticism from the auto sector.","A gargantuan Volkswagen ""gigafactory"" recently kicked off construction in Ontario, throwing a potential lifeline to a regional auto industry pushed to the brink by U.S. trade tariffs.

Workers mobilized on the sprawling 350-acre site of the future $7 billion Volkswagen PowerCo facility in St. Thomas, Ont., in late October, launching construction work for the colossal new electric vehicle battery plant with an official ground breaking celebration.

The Oct. 28 ground breaking — which included the first concrete pours for the new facility — marked the first major step in the plant's journey towards a projected 2027 completion.

Frank Blome, CEO of PowerCo SE, called October's ground breaking ""a big milestone,"" and stated the project is ""positioning Canada at the forefront of innovative EV battery production.""

The plant was first announced back in March 2023, and is being billed as Canada's largest electric vehicle battery plant, as well as PowerCo's (a subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group) third-largest project globally.

The project's importance to Ontario's struggling auto sector is as immense as the building's footprint. That value has only grown since March 2025, when U.S. President Donald Trump began to roll out harsh tariffs on Canadian industries.

Much of the province's auto sector is built around manufacturing for U.S. car brands, though the construction of major infrastructure to support European car manufacturers allows Ontario to tap into a new tariff-exempt sector of the auto market.

And with a projected 3,000 workers to be employed directly by the plant — not even factoring in the construction jobs to build the new facility — the battery factory stands to be a huge contributor to manufacturing jobs in the region.

A hiring drive was held earlier this year for the gigafactory, and continues to hire for positions, bringing a vast employment boost to St. Thomas, a town with just 43,000 residents.

At the time of the hiring drive's launch earlier this year, St. Thomas Mayor Joe Preston said the investment ""isn't just an economic boost; it's a fundamental transformation for our community.""

""We're proud to be the home for this exciting new chapter in Canada's burgeoning EV battery manufacturing sector,"" said Preston back in August.

It was just over two months later that shovels would hit the ground for the new plant, ushering in a new era for the small Ontario town.

""The excitement in St. Thomas is palpable, as we celebrate this monumental construction milestone,"" said Preston of the ground breaking last month.

""The St. Thomas gigafactory is rapidly coming to life and already delivering on its promise of prosperity — supporting hundreds of local jobs and providing a significant boost to our economy right here in our community.""

And the timing really couldn't be better for an industry in a tough position. The outlook for the short term is pretty bleak, and the federal government's budget presented in November 2025 has already been met with criticism from the auto sector.

The completed facility — set to open in less than two years — will serve as the North American base for PowerCo's advanced battery technology, offering some balance to the job losses and factory closures that could be on the horizon for manufacturers working assembly lines for U.S. auto brands.",https://blogto-production2-baselayer-display.blogto.com/articles/20251114-gigafactory-ontario-volkswagen.jpg?w=1200&cmd=resize_then_crop&height=630&quality=70&format=jpeg,N,,2025-11-14 12:02:56.782628

Today, fossil fuel spending accounts for just over 55% of total energy investments, compared with nearly 65% a decade ago.
However, in the IEA’s Announced Policies Scenario (APS), annual clean energy investment in Latin America would exceed USD 200 billion, more than triple anticipated investment levels in 2025.
Policymakers in Latin America and the Caribbean have major opportunities to expand energy investment, especially due to the region’s vast renewable resources.
Additionally, the development of regulations for energy storage and flexibility allows renewable energy to be fully integrated into the system, providing firming, reserve and rapid demand-response services.","Globally, energy-related investments are set to reach USD 3.3 trillion in 2025, according to the IEA’s latest World Energy Investment 2025 report. Around USD 2.2 trillion is expected to go collectively towards renewables, nuclear, grids, storage, efficiency and the electrification of end-use sectors, with USD 1.1 trillion going to oil, gas and coal.

This analysis, prepared jointly by the IEA and the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE), dives further into the latest data. It examines energy investment trends in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) since 2015, highlighting investment opportunities for the region as countries look to support economic growth, enhance energy security and accelerate clean energy transitions while ensuring energy affordability and access.

Latin America has some of the world’s best solar, wind and hydro resources, and it is a pioneer in the development of biofuels and renewable power. Leveraging these assets, the region has seen clean energy investment grow by 25% since 2015. Spending on renewables, grids, energy efficiency and electrification are on course to increase to about USD 70 billion in 2025.

Fossil fuel resources are unevenly distributed across the region; some countries are heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels, while others are major exporters. Today, fossil fuel spending accounts for just over 55% of total energy investments, compared with nearly 65% a decade ago. This year’s fossil fuel investment is expected to be about 20% lower than in 2015.

Overall, energy investment in the region is projected to reach USD 160 billion in 2025. This would be around 7% lower than a decade earlier, though this can be explained in part by cost declines over this period, both for both for upstream oil and gas activities as well as for key clean energy technologies.

Fifteen countries1 in the region have pledged to reach net zero emissions by mid-century. Meanwhile, a slightly different group of 15 LAC countries2 have put forward new Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement with targets for 2035. Across the region, meeting announced energy and climate targets would require a significant acceleration in investment in low-emissions power generation, grids and storage, low-emissions fuels, energy efficiency and the electrification of end-uses. Based on today’s policy settings, annual clean energy investments would exceed USD 110 billion by 2035, rising by 60% from current levels. However, in the IEA’s Announced Policies Scenario (APS), annual clean energy investment in Latin America would exceed USD 200 billion, more than triple anticipated investment levels in 2025. Investments in EVs would need the largest amounts of additional capital, with investment needs for energy efficiency and electrification nearly quadrupling and accounting for about 45% of end-use investments in 2035.

Grids in particular will need a boost in spending; as with many other regions, spending on distribution and transmission have not kept up with the rapid growth in solar and wind capacity. Today, for each dollar spent on new power generation in the region, less than USD 0.50 is spent on grids and storage. By 2035, this needs to reach about USD 0.85, with total spending on grids and storage reaching nearly USD 50 billion under the APS.

As energy transitions in LAC accelerate under the APS, investments in fossil fuels decline, reaching about 50% of 2015 levels by 2035. Total spending on fossil fuels drops by over USD 30 billion by then, with much of this reduction offset by a sharp increase in investments in low-emissions fuels, which rise to nearly five times current levels.

Policymakers in Latin America and the Caribbean have major opportunities to expand energy investment, especially due to the region’s vast renewable resources. Northern Chile and Western Argentina have high-quality solar radiation, while the “Southern Cone”3 and Northern Colombia offer highly productive wind corridors. Brazil has well-established bioenergy and sustainable fuel industries, along with most of the continent’s installed capacity in distributed solar, utility-scale solar and wind generation. Capacity across these categories is also expanding in Argentina, Colombia and Paraguay. In the Caribbean, countries are exploring solar, storage and hybrid projects to reduce fossil fuel dependence and increase energy security. These are very much in line with the ambitious targets adopted in the region: Barbados seeks to establish a 100% renewable power mix by 2035, and Antigua and Barbuda aims to source one-third of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. And many other countries, including Trinidad and Tobago, Saint Lucia and Dominica, have policies in place to support significant decarbonisation efforts in the coming decade.

For the moment, the region receives only 5% of global private investment in clean energy, compared with 8% of private sector spending on fossil fuels. There are, however, multiple examples from across LAC that show how a clear vision for energy transitions and a willingness to engage with the private sector can produce results.

Across two auctions in 2024, Brazil raised nearly USD 4 billion to build almost 7 300 kilometres (km) of new transmission lines. In October 2025, another auction was successfully held for the construction and operation of more than 1 000 km of new lines. These investments, which aim to strengthen the grid, integrate more renewable energy and improve system reliability, show how competitive auctions can attract private capital for major infrastructure projects.

In Argentina, the first large-scale auction (AlmaGBA) for a battery energy storage system (BESS) targeted the installation of 500 megawatts (MW) of capacity in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area. The market responded strongly, with over 1 300 MW in bids and a final allocation of around 660 MW. The programme focused on congested areas and enabled greater renewable integration.

In Honduras, energy storage is being used to stabilise the electricity system in regions where renewable expansion is limited by transmission capacity and variability, showing that flexibility solutions are spreading across the region beyond large electricity markets. The National Electricity Company (ENEE) launched an international tender in 2025 to contract 1 500 MW of firm capacity to secure electricity supply through 2030. At least 65% of capacity must come from renewables with storage under a multi-round reverse auction and a Build-Operate-Transfer scheme with contracts of about 15 years.

This year, the Dominican Republic, through its National Energy Commission (CNE) and the Dominican Hydroelectric Generation Company (EGEHID), also launched an international tender for up to 600 MW of new renewable capacity with mandatory storage, with the aim of diversifying the country’s energy mix, reducing fossil fuel dependence and achieving 30% renewable generation by 2030 under long-term power purchase agreements spanning from 15 to 20 years.

In Chile, a strong regulatory framework is in place that encourages battery integration and transmission improvements as renewable penetration grows.

Overall, these initiatives show that countries across the region are actively fostering conditions for further growth in energy investment, particularly amid their shift toward more resilient, flexible and renewable energy-focused power systems.

Regional energy integration is a key tool to harmonise planning, facilitate decision-making and enable the development of larger-scale projects. In line with this objective, OLADE created in 2024 a Regional Energy Planning Council, whose goal is to act as a regional coordination platform that identifies opportunities for integration and promotes a common energy agenda by helping energy ministers share information, reach agreements and align national planning efforts. The broader aim is to speed up the energy transition in Latin America and the Caribbean by exchanging best practices and creating better conditions through coordinated sustainable energy policies and market integration across the region.

Another critical element is the implementation of stable frameworks for renewable energy auctions and contracts. Recent experiences in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, the Dominican Republic and Honduras show that competitive auctions and long-term contracts provide certainty to developers and reduce financial costs for investors. OLADE’s Regional Regulatory Convergence initiative reinforces this principle by promoting the harmonization of criteria and contracting practices that encourage cross-border and regional investment.

National incentives and regulations have an important role to play. For example, Brazil’s Fuel of the Future Law, passed in late 2024, could unlock around USD 4 billion per year in investments for sustainable fuels, including green diesel, biogas and sustainable aviation fuel. The law sets mandatory blending targets, carbon intensity mandates and incentives to expand biofuels, supporting the country’s energy transition and attracting private capital to the sector.

The availability of instruments to mitigate currency risk and public guarantees is another key factor in attracting foreign investment, while the expansion and digitalisation of electricity grids also serves as an essential enabler to unlock investments in distributed generation and large-scale renewables. Additionally, the development of regulations for energy storage and flexibility allows renewable energy to be fully integrated into the system, providing firming, reserve and rapid demand-response services. As elsewhere in the world, robust energy planning in LAC remains central to creating a strong enabling environment for investments in a secure, affordable and sustainable energy future.

The G20 Roadmap to Increase Investment in Clean Energy in Developing Countries, developed by the IEA for Brazil’s G20 Presidency in 2024, identifies opportunities and actions to help achieve a rapid scaling up of clean energy investments. The roadmap outlines specific, timebound steps for increasing private financing in order to mobilise the investments required across different regions and sectors to build modern, clean energy systems.

WV announces more than $4B in energy investments in past month

West Virginia Office of Governor – Patrick Morrisey

Governor Patrick Morrisey announced that West Virginia secured nearly $4.2 billion in private-sector energy investments and more than 4,200 new jobs in under a month, asserting the state as a dominant force in American energy. Key projects include a $2.5 billion natural gas power plant creating 3,200 construction jobs, $1.44 billion to extend the life of six coal-fired plants, and a $1.2 billion gas-fired plant in Harrison County. These announcements support the Governor’s “50 by 50” initiative, which aims to increase baseload generation to 50 GW by 2050. The nearly $4.2 billion secured required only a minimal $1 million, repayable state contribution, showcasing the state’s success in attracting investment without major taxpayer funding. [MDN: WV is making aggressive moves to expand energy production. Hats off to Gov. Morrisey for his leadership in making this happen.]

NY Climate Act fork in the road

Pragmatic Environmentalist of New York/Roger Caiazza

The article argues that New York’s Climate Act mandates have reached a “fork in the road,” demanding legislative revision due to issues of infeasibility, affordability, and grid reliability. This conclusion is primarily supported by a recent New York Supreme Court decision, which ordered the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) to either issue final greenhouse gas regulations or ask the Legislature to change the 2030 reduction mandate, as the State itself deemed compliance “currently infeasible.” State analyses, including the Draft Energy Plan and Comptroller Audit, further highlight critical deficiencies, escalating costs, and the likelihood of missing clean energy goals due to transmission inadequacies and other technical obstacles. The author urges the Legislature to modify the law, coupling a revised schedule with clearly defined, trackable standards for affordability and reliability. [MDN: How about the legislature canceling the idiotic Climate Act? That would be the smartest thing to do.]

Hochul enrages environmentalists with shift to ‘all of the above’ energy policy

POLITICO/Marie J. French, Mona Zhang

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has enacted a “monumental pivot” on energy policy, moving away from her previous climate-forward agenda, citing concerns over energy affordability and grid reliability ahead of a tough re-election bid. The governor recently approved a new gas pipeline and settled a lawsuit to keep the gas-fueled Greenidge cryptocurrency miner operating for five more years. This shift has ignited “outrage” from the progressive environmental wing of her party, leading three major climate groups to endorse her primary opponent, Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado. Hochul defends the “all-of-the-above” approach, claiming it is necessary to govern in reality amid rising costs and grid warnings, reflecting a national trend among moderate Democrats prioritizing near-term economic concerns over aggressive climate targets. [MDN: Hochul has always been and continues to be a sleazy leftist politician. But she’s not stupid. She sees that the policies she has created won’t work, and she wants to get reelected. Hence, this “monumental pivot” on energy policy. The best thing NY can do is elect Elise Stefanik next year as governor to replace the failed Hochul.]

Mike Kennealy calls for review of Massachusetts’ green energy programs

Boston (MA) Herald/Tim Dunn

Republican gubernatorial candidate Mike Kennealy has called for an independent review of all green energy programs and climate spending in Massachusetts, blaming Governor Maura Healey’s policies, such as blocking gas pipelines, for contributing to the state’s high energy costs. Kennealy argues that the pursuit of the 2050 net-zero emissions mandate is prioritizing ideology over affordability and reliability, urging cuts to policies driving up utility bills for families and businesses. Concurrently, legislation is moving on Beacon Hill to roll back green energy spending, including the net-zero mandate, and redirect the Mass Save program’s focus to cost-effectiveness, drawing support from small businesses but criticism from climate activists. Governor Healey has also filed her own legislation aiming to lower energy costs by reducing state mandates and strengthening energy independence. [MDN: Healey is the problem in Massachusetts. She must go. Mike Kennealy is the solution to lower energy prices in the Bay State.]

Natural gas prices hit highest level since invasion of Ukraine

Wall Street Journal/Ryan Dezember

The onset of cold weather and record-breaking Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) exports have driven U.S. natural-gas prices to their highest levels since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. This surge, with December futures hitting $4.646 per million British thermal units—up 67% from a year ago—benefits U.S. drillers who suffered from a supply glut last year. However, these higher costs threaten to increase heating bills for the roughly 61 million American homes warmed by natural gas, plus the many more powered by gas-generated electricity. The rise is largely attributed to a sustained, record pace of LNG export activity, primarily to European allies, which is more than offsetting the near-record domestic production pace, despite ample storage levels heading into the winter. [MDN: It certainly is a balancing act. We like a higher natgas price, but we don’t want it so high that consumers suffer and gas-fired power turns to coal-fired power.]

Six US states to watch as rising gas prices drive a coal comeback

Reuters/Gavin Maguire

A significant rise in U.S. natural gas costs in 2025 has spurred utilities to reverse the multi-year trend of declining coal use, opting to boost coal-fired electricity generation to curb consumer bills. Benchmark natural gas futures, up 44% from last year, averaged $3.57 per million British thermal units, making coal, which is approximately 20% cheaper, the preferred fuel. Through the first seven months of the year, national coal output rose by about 16%, while gas generation dropped by 4%. This cost-saving shift is most prominent in six states—Arkansas, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, South Carolina, and Wisconsin—which collectively saw a 26% increase in coal burning. Although this coal revival will lead to a short-term swell in power sector emissions, cost pressures and political support are expected to sustain the trend in the months ahead. [MDN: Electricity generation is very price sensitive. If natgas prices climb too high too fast, coal becomes the first choice for powergen.]

Chevron sees oil prices under ‘more pressure’ than LNG next year

Bloomberg/K. Crowley, K. Greifeld, R. Bostick

Chevron CEO Mike Wirth predicts that increased oil supply from OPEC+ nations will continue to pressure crude prices next year, making 2026 prices likely to feel more pressure than LNG. Following its correct prediction of this year’s oil price drop, Chevron unveiled a five-year plan prioritizing profitability over production growth through 2030, aiming for 14% annual free cash flow growth with $70/barrel crude. While Chevron expects strong global demand for liquefied natural gas, Wirth anticipates lower LNG spot prices at the end of the 2020s due to a supply surge from the Gulf Coast and Middle East, potentially exceeding demand. [MDN: We believe companies like Chevron any day of the week over corrupt NGOs like the IEA. Pay attention to what Chevron predicts.]

INTERNATIONAL

Crude settles higher

Bloomberg/M. Gindis, A. Longley, W. Kubzansky

Oil prices rebounded slightly, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for December rising 0.34% to settle at $58.69 a barrel and Brent for January rising 0.3% to settle at $63.01 a barrel, despite strong evidence of a looming record surplus. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projected supply will exceed demand by over four million barrels a day in 2026, a deteriorating outlook reinforced by a large 6.4 million barrel rise in US crude inventories. This oversupply concern, which has pushed a key price indicator into contango, contrasts with supply risks from new US sanctions on Russian energy firms like Rosneft and Lukoil. Prices also found support in signs of resilient global consumption, indicated by falling product inventories and rising exports. Even though OPEC+ plans to pause production hikes in early 2026, a significant market surplus is still widely expected. [MDN: Bloomberg is trying to scare the markets once again, but they can’t hide the fact that oil prices rose anyway.]

This year’s UN climate summit in Brazil, COP30, is a green flop

Legal Insurrection/Leslie Eastman

The recent COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil, hosted by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, was characterized as a “green flop” due to the lowest turnout of world leaders in four years, with only 31 heads of state attending. This poor attendance coincided with President Donald Trump’s declaration that the climate crisis is “dead” and his continued reversal of climate policies, which angered some participating leftist leaders. California Gov. Gavin Newsom attended to contrast with Trump’s absence and promote California’s (failed) efforts. The summit highlighted a clash of ideologies, with host Lula strongly condemning “climate denialism” and stressing the urgency of the crisis (and the need for you to give them your money), while the article asserts that these annual conferences are losing their luster and legitimacy. [MDN: COP30 was a big-time floparoono. Only “B” listers like Greasy Gavin attended. He makes your skin crawl. Nobody is buying the hoax anymore, which angers leftists.]

Paris Climate Accord’s demise—James Hansen was right

Institute for Energy Research/Robert L. Bradley, Jr.

The article asserts that the Paris Climate Agreement is a failure, evidenced by almost all major signatories being out of compliance with their emissions reduction pledges, including the U.S. and Russia. This demise was predicted by climate scientist James Hansen, who called the 2015 accord a “fraud” and “worthless words,” arguing that as long as fossil fuels remain the cheapest option, they will continue to be burned. Hansen also dismissed the idea that renewables could rapidly phase out fossil fuels. The commentary concludes it is time to repeal the agreement and Net Zero, advocating for adaptation and stating that a high-energy civilization, which relies on fossil fuels, is the true driver of climate livability. [MDN: More brilliant insights from Robert Bradley about the nonsensical Paris agreement. It was stupid then and it’s stupid now. We’re glad Trump has removed the U.S. from participating. Paris was always about a huge money grab from U.S. taxpayers to the rest of the world. The rest of the world can go pound frac sand.]",,N,,2025-11-14 12:05:58.735675

Utility-scale renewable projects are waiting years for approval to hook in, but distributed solar skips that step entirely.
Ron Celentano, president of the Pennsylvania Solar & Storage Industries Association, thinks it has high potential.
“I tend to push hard on [distributed solar], because it’s often a missed opportunity in a lot of areas,” Celentano said.
Solar advocates dispute that.","In Carlisle, a sleepy town in the heart of Pennsylvania Trump country, solar energy appears to have escaped the black hole of partisan politics. Or at least, that’s been the experience of Carlisle Area School District superintendent Colleen Friend, who has met little resistance spearheading a project to install a solar array about the size of a football field at a local elementary school.

The project is itself the beneficiary of a political anomaly, the $25 million “Solar for Schools” initiative. The bill that created it last year made it through Pennsylvania’s divided state government even though basically nothing else on energy policy has reached the governor’s desk in recent years.

It also remains one of the few policy bright spots for clean energy advocates in the state budget deal struck on Wednesday, which saw the program re-upped for another year, even as Democratic leadership agreed to exit a potentially paradigm-shifting regional carbon cap-and-trade program.

Friend isn’t surprised that Solar for Schools proved a survivor in a budget battle that dragged on for months. The bill signing ceremony in Harrisburg last year was “very bipartisan,” she said. Her school district received $252,000 in funding for the ongoing project, and Friend now plans to apply for more.

“We already know the next building we’re going to put a solar array at,” she said.

But does distributed solar—the diffuse installation of small-scale arrays on the roofs and lawns of homes, businesses and municipal buildings—present a wider bipartisan opportunity to move climate policy forward in the acrimonious world of Pennsylvania politics?

Long a fossil fuel juggernaut with bountiful reserves of coal and gas, Pennsylvania at one point was also considered an innovator on renewable energy. But it has since fallen into position as a national laggard. Fights over fracking and former Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s move to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the interstate cap-and-trade program known as RGGI, had ground down any progress in the space to next to nothing.

On paper, distributed solar appears to have breakthrough potential. Solar for Schools’ wide bipartisan support last year followed what advocates describe as a herculean effort by its sponsor, state Rep. Elizabeth Fiedler. The Philadelphia Democrat and chair of the House Energy Committee toured the state to discuss its opportunities, focusing on economic benefits and reaching across the aisle.

Flora Cardoni, deputy director of the nonprofit PennEnvironment, helped champion the program and said it proved to be a rousing success in its first year, with 88 applications requesting $88 million in funding, more than three times what the budget allowed. Ultimately, 73 schools were awarded a total of $22.6 million in May.

“There’s clear demand, that more schools applied for the Solar for Schools grants than were able to receive an award,” Cardoni said. “We would just love to see even more schools follow their lead.”

Distributed solar also stands to benefit from deregulatory policy, a potential attraction for conservatives. Among five energy-related statehouse bills packaged under Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s “Lightning Plan,” the one that promises to adjust regulations to facilitate “community energy” projects—picture neighbors subscribing to a local communal solar array—has garnered the most bipartisan support.

Distributed solar can also avoid perhaps the biggest hurdle to solar development in Pennsylvania at present: the backed-up queue of grid operator PJM Interconnection, which oversees large, utility-scale energy development. Utility-scale renewable projects are waiting years for approval to hook in, but distributed solar skips that step entirely.

Ron Celentano, president of the Pennsylvania Solar & Storage Industries Association, thinks it has high potential. He points to a 2018 analysis by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection that found rooftop solar could account for 10 percent to 35 percent of all solar power in the state by 2030, if lawmakers enact solar-friendly policies.

“I tend to push hard on [distributed solar], because it’s often a missed opportunity in a lot of areas,” Celentano said.

And yet, advocates wonder how much ground can be covered, especially in light of the new budget agreement. Cardoni believes that RGGI could have generated about $1 billion annually for Pennsylvania to invest in clean energy technologies while forcing a market shift toward renewables, an impact that dwarfs an additional $25 million slated for the second year of Solar for Schools.

In the lead-up to the budget breakthrough, advocates had also heard that Lightning Plan bills could be part of the negotiations. But in the end, there was nothing to suggest that any of them, including the community energy bill, would be brought up for a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate.

“We would need to get a lot of policies like that passed to make up for RGGI in terms of carbon reduction,” Cardoni said.

And even the calculus behind Solar for Schools is shifting. Advocates say that many school districts had planned to combine state grant money with federal financial incentives covering another 30 percent to 50 percent of costs, depending on demographic factors. But those credits are now scheduled to expire next year after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act rolled them back.

With a deadline to start construction looming next summer, Celentano said that timelines are getting tight for school districts to go through bidding and design, never mind finding a contractor in the midst of a rush.

Adding to the problem is what Celentano said are delays at Pennsylvania electric utilities such as PECO and PPL, which have their own waiting lines for applicants seeking to connect rooftop solar and other similarly sized ground arrays to the grid. PECO did not respond to requests for comment, but a spokesperson for PPL confirmed that approval for larger examples of such projects may take “one to three years, depending on complexity.”

“We remain committed to processing interconnection applications as quickly and efficiently as possible,” PPL spokesperson Dana Burns wrote in an email, adding that the utility is “actively working to minimize delays and prioritize transparency and communication with applicants.”

No schools districts have yet announced abandoning their plans, but Celentano said some clients have asked him to run new analyses on what costs will be without federal tax credits. He predicts many projects wouldn’t survive a scenario in which they lose up to half of their funding via federal incentives, and the impact on interest for a second year of funding remains unknown.

“There’s a little bit of concern to some of these schools: Are we going to make it?” Celentano said.

Bipartisan Opportunities

On paper, distributed solar has political potential across red and blue counties in Pennsylvania. In a September report analyzing the first year of Solar for Schools, PennEnvironment calculated that approximately 5,000 schools across the commonwealth have the physical capacity to install solar. Collectively, they would save a potential $342 million over the lifetime of the systems, while powering the equivalent of 187,000 homes and reducing carbon emissions by the equivalent of 300,000 cars.

“The rooftops of Pennsylvania’s roughly 5,000 schools are often flat and unshaded, making them excellent sites for solar panels,” the report noted.

What’s more, rural counties, with their often-abundant space, stand to benefit considerably. PennEnvironment calculated that Lancaster County, quintessential home of the Pennsylvania Dutch, had the second highest cost-savings potential, after Pittsburgh’s Allegheny County. And while the nonprofit found that the 20 counties that stand to save the most in total are the most populated, it is mostly rural counties that would save the most per school.

“That just speaks to the vast savings potential,” Cardoni said.

The 2018 Department of Environmental Protection solar potential report calculated that distributed solar would also employ more people than large “grid-scale” arrays, at about 3 to 5 jobs per megawatt hour installed, compared to less than 2.5 jobs.

In a high-end scenario where 35 percent of the state’s solar mix came from rooftop arrays, the analysis predicted the creation of more than 32,000 total jobs. That’s about triple the current number employed in Pennsylvania’s waning coal industry.

Fiedler, the Solar for Schools sponsor, said she leaned into the economic benefits of solar and sought the support of labor unions as she traveled across the commonwealth stumping for the program. It worked: In final votes on the legislation last year, 10 of 101 House Republicans and 21 of 28 Republican senators joined all Democrats in voting yes.

“We think as individual households the bills that we get are high,” Fiedler said. “And they are, they’re going up. But for school districts it’s even more—add a couple of zeros on the end.”

Jim Gregory, a former three-term Republican state representative who is now executive director of the Pennsylvania Conservative Energy Network, said he also makes economic and reliability arguments when lobbying his former colleagues on supporting renewable energy. He believes the political gridlock on energy will have to give way soon, given dramatically escalating electricity rates for consumers in the state. He’s pitching solar as an important and quickly scalable option within an “all of the above” energy strategy, with the ability to take “pressure” off fossil fuel supplies.

“We can’t continue to do nothing. … The pain is going to overcome the fear that people have of a pipeline in their backyard on the Left, or a solar field on the farmer’s property next to theirs in rural Pennsylvania,” Gregory said.

But it’s not clear how much wider bipartisan support for solar truly exists in the legislature. Some efforts this year seem to have stalled out.

Democratic State Rep. Peter Schweyer’s community energy bill passed the House in May by a 114-89 margin, with more Republican support than Solar for Schools received. But the bill has remained in a Senate committee ever since, with no signs of movement even in the wake of a budget deal.

Democratic State Rep. Robert Merski, meanwhile, introduced a measure to put solar on municipal buildings like firehouses. But that legislation has remained stuck in a House committee since January.

And the cross-party coalition on these issues appears somewhat fragile.

State Rep. Craig Williams, a Republican from Delaware County in the Philadelphia suburbs, voted for both Solar for Schools and the community energy bill and said he believes there is a dire need to adjust state energy policy in the midst of rapidly rising costs.

“I’m trying to work across the aisle to get any form of generation online that’s clean and sustainable,” Williams said, adding he finds geothermal and nuclear particularly promising.

But Williams, a former PECO assistant general counsel, has also at times proved a thorn in the side of solar advocates, introducing amendments to legislation that they fear could negatively impact net metering, the way that owners of distributed solar panels receive financial compensation from utilities.

Williams said he thinks the current compensation system unfairly increases costs for non-solar owners, an issue utilities have also raised to state regulators. Solar advocates dispute that. Celentano said he’s pressed for evidence of such a cost shift, “and they can never show us the data.”

For Williams, discussions about advancing solar and community-generation policies are also part of an all-of-the-above strategy. He wants to see Democrats move off long-held positions against bringing new fossil fuel power plants online, citing concerns about power demand outstripping supply.

“There is a tremendous opportunity if we can get out of our own way,” Williams said.

What Next?

Numerous advocates said they believe Fiedler’s Solar for Schools program has benefited from a unique combination of her persistent efforts, fortunate timing and the non-controversial nature of saving school districts money. One former clean energy lobbyist, speaking on the condition of anonymity after taking a job with a public entity, said a one-off program with $25 million in the bank is more politically palatable than something with wider ramifications, like a community energy bill that could shift how electricity is generated and distributed in Pennsylvania.

“It’s a little bit of an easier selling point than saying, ‘Hey let’s create a whole new system of microgrids that the utilities see as an existential threat,’” the former lobbyist said, adding that he thinks supporters would be wise to focus on rising consumer costs. “I think that argument has not been made. And into that vacuum have come the utilities that quietly whispered in the ears of the Pennsylvania Senate to say, ‘Hey, this could hurt us.’”

The recent budget deal did little to boost hopes. Advocates note that a House vote on H.B. 501, the so-called PRESS bill that would elevate renewables in the state’s energy mix, has now been set for Monday, an apparent consolation prize to climate advocates upset about RGGI. But there’s no indication Senate Republican leadership will also bring it up in their chamber.

Similarly, the budget includes language that would clear the way for the state to use $156 million in federal “Solar for All” funding, which would install rooftop solar in low-income areas in Pennsylvania. But the fate of that Biden-era federal appropriation remains tied up in the court system after the Trump administration attempted to cancel it.

Sharon Pillar, executive director of the nonprofit Pennsylvania Solar Center, suggests that solar supporters may have better luck focusing not on the legislature but on the state Public Utility Commission, which has the power to draft new rules for utilities. In early November, the advocacy group Vote Solar launched a petition asking the commission to require more transparency on utilities’ solar connection queues and also create “clear, enforceable timelines” for applications.

“If the state can fix those things—if they’re willing to—then we can be moving this forward without a lot of other action,” Pillar said.

In an email, PUC spokesperson Nils Hagen-Frederiksen said the commission has “not been made aware” of any backlogs for small-scale projects like residential rooftop solar, which he said are often given same-day, automatic approval for standard designs.

More recently, in October 2025, Tesla's sales in China dropped to 26,006 vehicles.
What this has meant for the bottom line is Tesla's revenue and income have been stagnant to declining.","Opinion At Tesla's annual shareholder meeting in Austin, Texas, more than 75 percent of voting shares backed a compensation deal for CEO Elon Musk that would make him history's first trillionaire.

I've read that his record-shattering deal had the stockholders up on their feet dancing, chanting his name, and applauding.

To make Musk a trillionaire, over the next decade he must:

Raise Tesla's market cap from $1.5 trillion to at least $8.5 trillion. At the time of writing, Nvidia, with a market cap of $4.8 trillion, is the world's most valuable company.

Generate at least $400 billion in profits (presumably cumulative EBITDA or similar metric) over the target period of ten years.​ To put this into perspective, Tesla's total EBITDA from inception through 2025 is estimated to be just over $85 billion.

Deliver a total of 20 million vehicles, which is more than double what it has historically produced.​

Sell a million ""Optimus"" humanoid robots. To date there are no production Optimus robots, let alone any walking around in the real world.

Roll out at least a million commercially operational self-driving robotaxi units. Today, there are approximately 1,500 driving around Austin and the Bay Area.

Last but not least, Tesla must have 10 million Full Self-Driving (FSD) subscribers. Fully autonomous FSD doesn't exist today. Only 12 percent of the total Tesla fleet has paid for the current FSD (Supervised) offering.

This deal comes after Musk has already been awarded the largest compensation package, $56 billion, in corporate history. Courts have challenged this award, but even if Tesla loses its appeal, Musk will still get tens of billions.

Of course, this is all chump change if Musk succeeds in his new deal's goals. But can he do all this? Let's look at the tape. Tesla's financial performance over the last three years has shown slowing growth, with declining profits and only modest increases in revenue. From 2023 through 2025, the company has faced rising costs, margin pressure, and growing competition in the electric vehicle (EV) market.

In the United States, Tesla sold approximately 578,644 vehicles in 2024. This helped Musk maintain Tesla's dominance, with nearly 50 percent of the US EV market. However, US sales overall are estimated to have fallen 11 percent year-over-year for 2025. Musk blames, with reason, President Donald Trump for ending EV tax credits and imposing tariffs.​ Looking ahead, Musk said in July: ""We probably could have a few rough quarters.""

The rest of the world is far less rosy for Tesla. In China, Tesla's sales fell 8.4 percent from 2023 to 2024. More recently, in October 2025, Tesla's sales in China dropped to 26,006 vehicles. That's the lowest monthly total in three years. Across the pond, Tesla has fallen like a brick. In Germany, for instance, sales have dropped by more than half year-over-year.

In the EU and UK, European luxury cars, unbound by US tariffs, and Chinese EV manufacturers, such as BYD, which is blocked from the American market, are surpassing Tesla. BYD, in particular, with its cheaper prices, fast charging, and good range, has seen explosive growth.

What this has meant for the bottom line is Tesla's revenue and income have been stagnant to declining. In 2024, the company's annual revenue increased to $97.69 billion, but that's less than 1 percent growth from 2023. Simultaneously, net income declined to $7.15 billion from $14.97 billion.

2025 looks far worse. Tesla saw its revenue for the trailing 12 months down about 1.5 percent year-over-year. Net profits continued to fall, with Q3 2025 reporting a 37 percent drop in profit compared to the previous year, namely $1.37 billion, down from $2.17 billion.

You may have noticed I haven't said a thing about Musk's volatile online personality, his politics, or his constant bouncing from one project to another. That's because, love him or hate him, from a purely business perspective, Tesla is no longer the bright, shining star of electric cars. Under Musk's distracted leadership, Tesla has been in decline.

The hope is that a trillion-dollar carrot will keep Musk's attention focused on Tesla rather than playing with politics or any of his many other companies such as SpaceX, X, or xAI. The only way Musk will get his trillion is if he achieves all his compensation plan's moonshot goals. It's not quite an all-or-nothing contract, but it's not too far from that either.

The cold hard numbers, though, tell me he can't do it. I don't think anyone could.

Tesla's stockholders are delusional. No one is worth a trillion dollars, certainly not someone whose corporate results in the last few years have been mediocre.

AI, cryptocurrency, gold, and Tesla. Way too many of the one percent, and those who desperately want to be in the one percent, think that all they need is to plant some magic crypto beans or follow the right leader, and they'll become high-figure millionaires or billionaires. Some day soon, and it won't be long, the money merry-go-around will stop spinning and all those dreams will come crashing to a halt. ®",https://regmedia.co.uk/2024/05/30/musk_shutterstock.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 12:03:07.015999

Two recently introduced initiatives at Tesla caught my eye in the past week, and got me wondering again. First of all, Tesla has started offering rental cars, which brings all kinds of questions. Secondly, right before launching the rental program, the company started engaging in an interesting new marketing push.

Tesla Rentals? Tax Loophole?

So, the core news on the consumer or public end is that Tesla is now offering the option to rent its cars. In certain locations, you can rent a Tesla from Tesla for $60/day for 3–7 days. And if you decide to buy a Tesla within those 7 days, you can get a credit of up to $250 on the purchase.

Naturally, this is an easy new way for Tesla to market its cars and find more buyers. And maybe that’s all it is. However, it also got me thinking….

As the $7,500 US EV tax credit came to an end, we got news that Ford & GM had found a loophole to push a few more electric cars out the door. They essentially sold a bunch of EVs to themselves, or to dealers, logged the tax credit for themselves, and then those dealers could pass on those savings to customers via leases.

At the time, I wondered if Tesla could find a way to take advantage of that loophole as well. I wrote the following: “Now, what about Tesla? Tesla doesn’t have separate dealers. So, presumably, Tesla couldn’t take advantage of this loophole. There’s no clear network of dealers who are independent partners to the EV company and can engage in a written binding contract with the company. Unless I’m missing something, it seems that Tesla will lose out here and suffer competitively from the loophole, despite initial reporting seeming to indicate that the change/clarification to the terms of the EV tax credit expiration would benefit Tesla and was perhaps made to benefit Tesla.”

Is it possible this rental program was created by selling vehicles to itself and logging the $7,500 tax credit? And now it is renting those cars as a somewhat separate business?

To be honest, I think this is unlikely, since it just seems like Tesla shouldn’t have been able to sell cars to itself, and the rental program is clearly linked to normal marketing efforts, but I have to think in modern America that there’s a 30–40% chance Tesla did find a way to get tax credits by doing this.

That brings me to the second news item.

Tesla Will Come To Your House

Tesla marketing emails used to be almost nonexistent, but they’ve grown and grown and now feel comparable to a local auto dealer’s emails once they get you on their list, but there was one email in particular that caught my attention recently.

The title of the email, send two weeks ago, was “Try Full Self-Driving (Supervised) With a Tesla Ride.” Here was the core text of the email, with emphasis (bolding) added by me:

Experience our latest Full Self-Driving (Supervised) technology on a Tesla Ride.* Run errands, get a ride to work or visit a friend and let your Tesla take the wheel. We’ll come to you and take you where you want to go.

So, Tesla has gotten to the point of driving to your house to give you a test drive.

That sounds nice and exciting from a consumer end. Great! Convenient! But it clearly means we are very far from consumer demand exceeding Tesla’s supply! Not to mention its production capacity, which has been about 30%+ higher than its production and sales for a couple of years.

Frankly, if I was a Tesla shareholder, this would make me very nervous. Tesla seems to be getting desperate. You can argue that the company is just so proud of its tech and its cars that it wants to show people how good they are. But why do they need to leave the Tesla store and come to your house to make that happen? Because not enough customers are coming in the door.

There’s the possibility that Tesla FSD will soon be at a level where you will be allowed to text or do other things while the car drives itself, but in the meantime, it seems like Tesla is struggling to find customers and is in a race against time to crack that magic nut in order to juice sales again. If sales drop enough, of course, Tesla will go from having profitable quarters to having unprofitable quarters.

When it came time for Nathan Shaffer to replace his roof this year, he knew he wanted to keep solar panels like the ones he installed in 2017 on top of his Decatur home.

Hooked on the magic of watching the mini-power plant on his roof charge his electric vehicles, Shaffer this summer priced out what it would cost to upgrade to more efficient, modern panels. As he did, Republicans in Congress made a big change in July to federal solar incentives when they passed President Donald Trump’s signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The sprawling law extended corporate and individual tax cuts and boosted defense spending. But it also took an ax to a host of clean energy incentives, including a 30% federal tax break for residential rooftop solar systems. Instead of starting to phase out at the end of 2032, the tax credit — known as 25D — will now go away Dec. 31.

With $6,000 to $7,000 in potential savings set to vanish next year, Shaffer decided to install new panels before the credits expired.

He is not alone.

Residential solar installers say they’re seeing a crush of customers trying to cash in on savings before time runs out, with some companies hiring and boosting hours for a sprint they expect to last through the final hours of this year.

“The rest of the year is, ‘Who can work Saturdays?’” said Russell Seifert, president and founder of Creative Solar USA, a Georgia-based residential and commercial solar installer.

The surge has been good for business, but rooftop solar’s long-term outlook in Georgia is cloudy.

The cost of labor and materials, like the metal racks solar panels are mounted on, have all gone up thanks to stubborn inflation and Trump’s tariffs, installers say. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency also canceled $7 billion in grants meant to help low-income residents install rooftop solar at no cost, including $156 million for a program in Georgia. Several groups and states have sued to claw back that money.

Still, some like Pearson Kilgore, president of Suncatcher of Atlanta, the oldest solar company in Georgia founded in 1983, believe the industry will manage to adapt.

“I think we might have a couple of bumpy years but in the long run, I think we’ll be OK,” he said.

Riding the ‘solarcoaster’

Rooftop solar companies are no strangers to disruption. In fact, the industry has a name for the changes in policy they’ve long faced: the “solarcoaster.”

Shifting incentives and billing rules from the federal government down to local utilities have at times led solar demand to rise and fall. And though domestic manufacturing is growing, businesses have for years relied heavily on imported panels — whose availability and cost are subject to the whims of the party in power in Washington.

If there’s been one relative constant, it’s been the tax breaks offered by the federal government for residential solar systems.

The first tax credits were created in 1978, when then-President Jimmy Carter was in the White House. Those expired in the mid-1980s, only to be brought back in 2005 under then-President George W. Bush. Their value has gone up and down at times, but the savings have remained in some form since then — until now.

The “one big, beautiful bill” moved the expiration date of the full, 30% tax credit up to Dec. 31, seven years earlier than previously scheduled.

“It’s definitely a new era for the rooftop solar industry, and we’re working hard to help that sector and those businesses transition into the post-25D (tax credit) world,” Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said.

Until then, installers and utilities say they are slammed with customers acting now to realize their solar dreams before the tax savings disappear.

Kilgore from Suncatcher says his office‘s whiteboard for scheduling installations is packed “top to bottom” through the end of the year.

“It’s almost like a jigsaw puzzle, trying to figure out how we can fit everything in,” he said.

Georgia Power, which must tie new solar systems into its electric grid, also said it has seen a near doubling of residential solar interconnection requests since July 4, when the new law was signed. The company says it’s processing applications as “quickly as possible … given the time constraints on the tax credit expiration.”

Guidance from the Internal Revenue Service indicates solar systems must be installed by Dec. 31 to be eligible for the tax savings. At this point, Kilgore and Seifert from Creative Solar USA say they are having to tell some customers they might not be able to get their panels in place before the deadline.

Silver linings?

What will the rooftop solar market look like next year? Most in and around the industry expect there will be a dip in demand.

Gallagher from SEIA said the industry trade group expects residential solar installations in 2030 will be 33% lower than they would have been with the tax credits in place. Seifert said he expects even more of a drop off, more like 60% to 70%.

Workers install solar panels on Nathan Shaffer’s roof in Decatur. Though domestic manufacturing is growing, businesses have for years relied heavily on imported panels. (Ben Gray for the AJC)

That type of a slowdown could put some installers out of business, Gallagher said.

Still, those in the industry believe rooftop solar will survive and that there could be silver linings from the phase out.

Depending on the size of the installation, a rooftop solar system can cost $20,000 or more, the type of upfront investment most households can’t make. Without thousands in tax savings available, Gallagher said companies will have to find ways to improve efficiency and lower costs, which could be good for the industry in the long run.

Other inherent benefits of solar aren’t going away.

Solar generates electricity without producing any greenhouse gas emissions. In an era of rising global temperatures, that positive climate impact of appeals to customers like Shaffer.

Paired with an on-site battery storage system, solar can provide households resilience to power outages. And with power bills rising in Georgia and beyond, solar offers customers a way to rein in those costs, Gallagher said.

“Putting solar on the roof is one way to take some meaningful control over that,” Gallagher said.

Instead, the 25-year Oregon Energy Strategy published by the state’s energy department on Wednesday focuses on policy recommendations that will by 2050 increase energy efficiency in buildings and in the industrial and transportation sectors and grow existing clean energy infrastructure. That means the state will rely on more solar, more wind and more alternative energy sources such as thermal and wave energy than fossil fuels.

Nuclear shows up just six times in the 150-page report as something that the state should study for developments and opportunities.

Max Woods, assistant director of nuclear safety and emergency preparedness at the Oregon Department of Energy, said the state is “nuclear curious,” but “taking a more cautious approach that is based on its history and tradition.”

New nuclear plants have been outlawed in Oregon since a voter-approved ballot measure passed in 1980. In 1993, the state’s only nuclear plant closed down. Although the state gets about 3% of its energy annually from a nuclear plant, it’s in Washington and run by the federal Bonneville Power Administration.

“Even if nuclear power were to come to Oregon, it takes a long time to get it through permitting — there’s a lot of security and safety review that has to happen, and for good reason, and they’re (reactors) expensive,” Woods said. “Put those factors together, and that’s a long time to come before any such facility might be built.”

Growing energy demand from data centers in Washington spurred lawmakers there recently to invest $25 million in nuclear energy project development, and Idaho has passed policies meant to clear regulatory hurdles and court private nuclear companies. California lawmakers in 2022 voted to delay closing the state’s only nuclear plant by at least five years while they evaluate potentially reversing course. These decisions are almost entirely being driven by expected demand from data centers in the next few years.

Oregon officials acknowledge in the state’s 25-year plan that the largest driver of energy demand in Oregon in at least the next five years will be from data centers. In future years, they expect electrification in other sectors to meet and eventually outpace demand from data centers. Oregon has among the largest data center markets in the world, which drove electricity consumption in the state up 20% between 2013 and 2023.

“Whether the nuclear power is built in Oregon or not — that’s the question we’re kind of grappling with right now: What the value proposition is for our state,” said Woods. “Our neighbors aren’t really wrestling with that same question.”

But in their 25-year energy planning, state officials found there were faster and more cost-effective ways to meet growing electricity demand than trying to open the state to new nuclear development.

The Oregon Legislature this year considered two proposals that would have opened the door to nuclear development in the state for the first time in decades. One would have allowed voters in Umatilla County to exempt the county from a statewide ban on new nuclear energy facilities.

Amazon data centers in eastern Oregon have caused 554% load growth at the Umatilla Electric Cooperative in just the last ten years, according to a Sightline Institute analysis of US Energy Information Administration data.

Another proposal would have directed the state energy department to study what it would take and whether it was worth developing a nuclear sector in Oregon to meet the state’s needs.

Both died in committees before receiving larger votes.

Nuclear energy does not directly produce carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases contributing to climate change, and it can produce more energy with less fuel than any other individual source of existing power, according to MIT. But in the absence of any federally designated and regulated site where spent nuclear waste can be deposited, industry growth has raised concerns for environmental and public health advocates. Most nuclear facilities store radioactive waste in lined underground storage tanks onsite.

To overrule Oregon’s nuclear ban, voters would have to repeal it or the federal government would need to create a national repository for nuclear waste.

The broader energy plan

Developing the Oregon Energy Strategy took two years, according to a news release from the state energy department. It included modeling scenarios that would prioritize affordability and reliability in the state’s energy sector while meeting demand and energy policy and climate change objectives.

Officials made adjustments to changes in federal policy under President Donald Trump, who has in the first ten months of his second term attempted to claw back billions of congressionally approved federal clean energy investments.

Policy recommendations include imposing new reporting requirements for large electricity users, such as data centers, to understand the role such users play in the state’s greenhouse gas pollution, and whether regulations are needed to bring them in line with state climate policies.

Officials recommend establishing a fund to help provide low- and no-cost loans for clean energy projects to support a transition away from fossil fuels, and to establish a state-sponsored block grant program for tribal clean energy projects. Officials also recommend implementing a road use charge for all light duty passenger vehicles, such as Amazon delivery vans, to fund programs that promote electric vehicle adoption.

The plan calls for funding incentive programs for electric bikes and electric vehicles, as well as Safe Routes to School and Great Streets initiatives that encourage bike transportation over cars. It also recommends major overhauls to transmission regulations, including a state-level commission tasked with speeding up new connections to Oregon’s grid.

Key strategy takeaways are that the most cost effective way to reduce energy demand and costs in Oregon is for lawmakers to continue to prioritize policies that accelerate building and transportation electrification. That includes cash incentives that make it more affordable to replace gas cars, gas buses, gas furnaces and appliances with electric ones, to electrify heating and cooling systems and to weatherize homes and businesses.

Models show if this continues, the state’s overall energy demand in 2050 could be 22% lower than it was in 2024, even if there is more demand for electricity in 2050 than currently exists.

Modeling also revealed that delaying policies that accelerate energy efficiency will lead to higher costs down the line given the volatility of fossil fuels markets and climate change. Officials project that in the next few decades, the costs of climate change — such as billion-dollar wildfires, droughts, floods and other extreme weather — could cost the average Oregonian about $12,000 of annual income.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3a06513/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F76%2F22%2F8a9eebee4625b270a2a97954da31%2Fboardman-coal-plant-seen-from-crow-butte-1024x683-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 12:04:14.680182

Public Service: James Ferguson – James Ferguson II, an Asheville native, was a trailblazing civil rights attorney, best known for his involvement in a landmark Supreme Court ruling in 1970 that required school districts to desegregate their schools. Ferguson earned his undergraduate degree at North Carolina Central University and received his Juris Doctor degree from Columbia University in 1967. He co-founded North Carolina's first interracial law firm with Julius Chambers, James Lanning, and Adam Stein, father of North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein. In 1972, Ferguson defended the Wilmington 10, a group of Black men wrongfully charged with arson and conspiracy, and 40 years later, he successfully gained pardons of innocence for them. Throughout his career, Ferguson used his legal skills to desegregate schools, police departments, and countless other public and private agencies. Ferguson passed away in Charlotte on July 21, 2025, at age 82.

Public Service: Roy Williams – Roy Williams retired in 2021 with the third-most wins by a Division I head coach (903) and the sixth-highest winning percentage (.774) in college basketball history. The Asheville native was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2007, where he is one of 14 Tar Heels enshrined. Williams won 418 games in 15 seasons at Kansas from 1988 to 2003 and 485 games in 18 seasons at UNC, his alma mater, from 2003 to 2021. He is the second-winningest coach all-time at Carolina, is third at KU and is the only coach in college basketball history to win 400 games at two schools. Williams is a member of the NABC College Basketball, North Carolina Sports, and Kansas Sports Halls of Fame. In 2024, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper awarded Williams the Order of the Long Leaf Pine, the Governor’s highest honor, which is presented to North Carolinians who have made significant contributions to the state and their communities through their exemplary service and exceptional accomplishments. Williams grew up in the Biltmore neighborhood in Asheville. He attended Roberson High, where he played for Coach Buddy Baldwin. He played on Carolina’s freshman team in 1968-69, earned a bachelor’s degree in education in 1972, and earned a master’s degree in teaching in 1973. After five seasons as the head coach at Owen High School in Black Mountain, Williams joined Dean Smith’s staff at UNC, where he served as an assistant coach from 1978 to 1988. Williams led UNC to NCAA championships as a head coach in 2005, 2009, and 2017 and was an assistant coach when the Tar Heels won the title in 1982. He is the only head coach to win three national championships at his alma mater. In addition to his remarkable basketball accomplishments, Coach Williams is known for his commitment to his players, not only when they are in school, but for many years after they graduate. He has also dedicated himself to charity. Williams has been a major supporter of the Carolina Covenant, a scholarship program at UNC-Chapel Hill, and helped to raise funds for cancer research while he was head coach at UNC. Most recently, he partnered with Verizon to help erase millions of dollars of debt facing North Carolinians who were affected by Hurricane Helene.

The ceremony also honored eight Helene Heroes. Click here to learn more about these Heroes.

The North Carolina Award was created by the General Assembly in 1961 to recognize significant contributions to the state and nation in the fields of fine arts, literature, public service, and science. Since the award’s inception, more than 300 people have been honored by the state of North Carolina, including James Taylor, Etta Baker, Maya Angelou, and Selma Burke. Awards recipients are chosen by the North Carolina Awards Committee, a selection committee appointed by the Governor.

Since Hurricane Helene swept through western North Carolina, Governor Josh Stein has been committed to the long-term recovery of the region through investing in western North Carolinians and rebuilding critical infrastructure lost to the storm. The Stein Administration has recently distributed new funding for the Hurricane Helene Dislocated Worker Grant, announced $9 million in grants to Volunteer Organizations Active in Disasters (VOADs) that are supporting Helene recovery, awarded $50 million in broadband recovery grants and nearly $14 million to 19 new small business recovery projects in the region through the Department of Commerce’s Small Business Infrastructure Grant Program. Governor Stein also welcomed applications for the state’s Renew NC Single-Family Housing Program to recover and rebuild home lost to the hurricane. Governor Stein continues to urge the federal government to deliver for western North Carolina by passing $13.5 billion in new appropriations to get people back into their homes, support small businesses, and rebuild critical infrastructure.

US President Donald Trump has been waging war on electric vehicles all year with some notable success, but his inevitable loss is already in the cards. Exhibit A is the Volkswagen offshoot Scout Motors, which is still on track to launch its first EVs into the US market in 2027.

Since When Does Scout Make EVs?

If the Scout name sounds familiar, that’s not an accident. International Scout was a suite of 20th century, jeep-adjacent off road vehicles manufactured by the US firm International Harvester between 1960 and 1980. IH subsequently sold off its agriculture division and emerged from a soup-to-nuts rebrand in 1986 as the commercial vehicle and engine manufacturer Navistar, later to be absorbed by Volkswagen’s heavy-duty truck subsidiary TRATON Group in 2021.

The chain of transactions provided Volkwagen with the Scout name along with the brand’s jaunty retro profile and its DIY, work-to-play cultural identity, of which Volkswagen took full advantage when it launched Scout Auto in 2022.

“Just as the first Scout vehicles appealed to the bold and pioneering, our growing community is composed of kindred spirits, and today adventure means a lot of things to a lot of people,” Scout proclaims on its website. “Our community is filled with climbers, campers, foragers, and explorers.”

“They’re cooks, builders, athletes, and DIY experts. They’re thrill-seekers, city dwellers, adventure seekers, and modern makers. But the thing they all have in common is their connection to the land around them, their desire to create and support community, and an unyielding will to do the next good thing,” the company emphasizes.

Scout Is Still Determined To Make & Sell EVs In The US

That’s laying it on rather thickly, but this is no time for shilly-shally. The premature death of the federal tax credit on September 30 was expected to send EV sales into a spiral, and it did. However, the recent misfortunes of industry leader Tesla have left a gaping hole in the US market. As Tesla CEO Elon Musk piles one unforced error on top of another, now is the time for competitors like Scout to fill the breach — tax credit or not.

The low hanging fruit is particularly evident in the electric pickup truck area, where Musk’s pet Cybertruck project has gone down in automotive history as an Edsel-worthy flop. That explains why a pickup is one of Scout’s first two offerings, in step with at least three other EV startups: Rivian, the Jeff Bezos-backed automaker Slate Auto, and the kei car stylings of TELO Trucks.

Scout re-affirmed its production timeline yesterday, in a press release announcing the selection of Charlotte, North Carolina, as its new corporate headquarters. The city is within convenient reach of Scout’s forthcoming headquarters, located about an hour south in Blythewood, South Carolina.

“Construction is progressing rapidly at Scout Motors’ Production Center in Blythewood, with initial production targeted to begin in 2027,” Scout noted. “Once it reaches full capacity, the Production Center is expected to create more than 4,000 jobs in South Carolina and attract additional suppliers and economic opportunities to the region.”

Scout also expects to bring more than 1,200 jobs into its new headquarters, indicating it intends to stay for the long haul. “Charlotte offers the momentum we need to scale quickly and sustainably. We’ll build a headquarters that reflects our culture, empowers our teams, and connects us to a region that’s fast becoming a national hub for mobility and manufacturing,” Scout stated, drawing attention to the Southeast’s emerging status as a hotspot for the vehicle electrification movement.

Nevertheless, They Persisted

This all sounds rather over-ambitious in a day and age when the political knives are out for EVs moreso than ever before. That remains to be seen, but Scout is among the zero emission stakeholders to play the long game. In mid-September, just days before the federal tax credit was set to expire, Scout announced that it put up an additional $300 million to build a facility for its suppliers on the site of its new Blythewood factory.

“This initiative, which does not come with any new government incentives, is expected to support approximately 1,000 additional supplier jobs and represents a critical expansion of the company’s existing investment of more than $2 billion in the state,” Scout explained.

The new Supplier Park facility is no small potatoes. It will take up more than 200 acres and host more than 2.3 million square feet of Scout-supporting suppliers in three areas of focus:

• Just in Time (JIT) Facility dedicated to sequencing parts for final vehicle assembly

• Battery Assembly Building designed for high-volume battery assembly

• Accessories Building to support upfitting and installation of vehicle accessories

“The size and scope of the park reflect Scout Motors’ strategy to build a fully integrated, domestic supply chain for its trucks and SUVs,” Scout emphasized.

Who’s Gonna Pay For All This?

Don’t get too excited just yet. Although Scout’s persona is that of a pure play EV maker with its Terra pickup truck and Traveler SUV, the company is also pitching a Harvester version with a gas-powered range extender, an idea that harkens back to GM’s short-lived Chevy Volt. Word has it that many of the Scout fans pre-ordering vehicles have opted for the range extender option.

Range extender and all, last month Scout received a big thumbs-up from Consumer Reports, partly on account of its refusal to align itself with touch-screen culture promoted by Tesla. “Scout owners will find real buttons and knobs for infotainment and climate control, traditional exterior door handles, and even an optional three-person front bench seat,” wrote the organization’s Senior Autos Reporter, Keith Barry.

“After our experiences futzing around with confusing and unreliable electronic door handles on newer vehicles, we’re especially excited that both the Terra and Traveler feature traditional exterior door handles. What a concept!” Barry added for good measure.

Cutting to the mustard, Barry also took note of the cost of the cars. “As with rival off-roaders, customizability is a key selling point, including off-road accessories such as front and rear skid plates, an off-road winch, auxiliary lighting, and an exterior spare tire carrier on the Traveler,” he wrote. “We expect prices to climb well above $60,000 as buyers add these extras.”

Despite the affordability crisis besetting the nation, $60,000 sounds about right for a versatile EV that can hit the mark for use in work and commercial spaces as well as recreation, complete with bidirectional charging.

Now, Duke and other companies want to build two massive methane gas power plants and a pipeline in Person County to feed them. There’s a mysterious Microsoft project that many assume will be a large data center with its own insatiable energy demands. On top of all of that, Enbridge has proposed and begun construction on a liquefied methane gas storage facility called the Moriah Energy Center.

But many residents are fighting back, strategizing together, speaking out at public meetings and hearings, attending rallies, monitoring construction sites and telling decision-makers that their health and safety cannot be sacrificed.

This mobilization has been inspiring and can inform how residents of other North Carolina counties can take on similar situations. Billions of dollars of pipelines, power plants, compressor stations and other methane gas infrastructure are at various stages of development across our state. We can rise up against this irresponsible surge of new fossil fuels that would increase electric bills while damaging public health and our land, air and water.

The proposed projects include two new gas power plants at Hyco Lake in Person County and the T-15 pipeline to supply them, new gas plants in Catawba and Rowan counties, and the multi-state Mountain Valley Pipeline Southgate and Southeast Supply Enhancement Project. These represent billions of dollars worth of unnecessary fossil fuel infrastructure that will lead to increased air pollution, water pollution and carbon and methane emissions, as well a massive potential increase in electric bills for North Carolina residents.

Why all this new fossil fuel infrastructure, even though state law calls for achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 — and even though studies suggest renewable energy combined with battery storage would be a cheaper and more reliable method to meet increased demands for electricity?

Guaranteed returns on investment

Much of it comes down to the greed of monopoly utilities — which get guaranteed rates of return on these kinds of investments. Duke Energy, the major driver of many of these projects, is guaranteed a 10.1% rate of return on investments like gas power plants. The more it spends, the more the power company earns — and the higher your electric bills go!

In addition, Duke gets to pass along fuel cost increases to its customers — and methane gas is known for its volatile cost swings.

Renewable energy projects don’t cost as much and don’t have the same kind of associated fuel costs (wind and sun power is abundant and free). Plus, Duke gets to be the sole builder and owner of gas plants but has to let other developers build at least 45% of solar infrastructure in the state and buy the electricity from them. This doesn’t return as much cash to shareholders’ pockets.

Duke and other utilities are regulated by state agencies — but they spend a lot of money lobbying state legislators to weaken those regulations. (Yes, your electric bills pay for that, too.)

For instance, the North Carolina General Assembly recently passed Senate Bill 266, the ironically named “Power Bill Reduction Act.” That bill, passed over Gov. Josh Stein’s veto, will:

Eliminate interim carbon emissions reduction targets (Duke was supposed to lower emissions by 70% by 2030)

Allow Duke to ask regulators to let it charge you as a customer for the costs of these massive fossil fuel infrastructure projects before they’re even completed or even if the project never finishes.

Shift more of the burden of paying for fuel to you as a residential customer.

(You can see how your state House members and state senators voted. Even though the bill has passed, you can still contact them to express your disappointment or to thank them for voting in customers’ best interest!)

Data centers drive demand — but projections may be overblown

Of course, utilities don’t say this buildout is about increasing shareholder profits. They say increased power generation is needed for economic growth and to meet the anticipated demand for new data centers. But it’s unlikely that such anticipated demand will ever fully materialize. In fact, one study found that the global semiconductor industry doesn’t have the capacity to make enough chips to supply the number of data centers that utilities around the nation are projecting.

And data center developers are also shopping their potential projects to multiple electric utilities — so the same data center is showing up in the demand forecasts for multiple utilities, even though it would only be built once.

Imagine you’re ordering pizza for a party. You might decide that the best way to get a good deal is to call every pizza place in the county and ask for the price. Adding a hyper-scale data center to the electric grid is more complicated, but essentially, it’s as if the data center developer orders a pizza from every restaurant, even though they will only purchase one pizza. But each restaurant (in this case, the electric utility), still must start making the pizza, to have it ready just in case. In the power sector scenario under the new North Carolina law, regular people (not the utility and not the data center developer) would have to pay for the cost of building unnecessary, polluting infrastructure, even if the data center’s power demand never materializes.

It’s irresponsible and unfair to saddle residential customers with huge electric bill increases to build polluting infrastructure that may never be needed.

As the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy noted in a recent paper, utility customers may end up footing the bill for infrastructure that will end up being used by pipeline companies to export gas to foreign countries, NOT to power the grid. If power companies’ forecasts for the gas they need end up being wildly inflated, utilities can sell excess pipeline capacity to companies that will use it for liquefied natural gas exports — but their customers will still be paying for the projects!

The power companies have nothing to lose, but we do. Everyone who pays a power bill has a stake in this, as does everyone who breathes air and wants a stable climate — methane gas has a devastating climate-altering impact.

There are better ways. Clean, renewable energy and battery storage could meet much, if not all of the actual demand. If utilities still proceed with fossil fuel infrastructure to meet projected data center demand, states could put responsible regulations in place to ensure that the data centers and other high-use industrial customers pay the cost, not residential customers.

Even better, data centers could be required to be powered by renewable energy produced and stored on-site.

We need a fair system with more transparency and less risk — one where regular people do not subsidize shareholder profits and large tech companies through our unaffordable electric bills. We need a system that protects our health and our land, air and water. Currently, North Carolina utility regulators are reviewing Duke’s proposals as part of the state’s Carbon Plan proceedings — decisions that will have a real impact on our bills and our climate.

Firms should profit from the country’s planned “industry electricity price” and from the existing power price compensation mechanism, which provides relief from emission trading costs, finance minister Lars Klingbeil, a Social Democrat (SPD), said at a press conference. “Both instruments should work in concert, which would be an important signal, for example for the steel industry,” Klingbeil said.

Energy-intensive sectors, such as steel, chemicals and glass, are coming under international competitive pressure due to Germany’s comparatively high electricity prices. A subsidised industrial electricity price is a core element of the government’s strategy to halt industrial decline and boost the country’s weak economic growth.

But implementation has run into delays, as the EU must agree to the scheme under state aid rules. Industry representatives have questioned whether the EU would allow companies to benefit from several power price subsidies at the same time. The EU had already set general conditions for the subsidies, for example limiting it to at most half of a company's annual electricity consumption.

Klingbeil said in parliament it was key that both instruments could apply simultaneously without companies having to choose. “Brussels must not refuse to do this. They must come to terms with industrial policy realities,” reported energy and climate newsletter Tagesspiegel Background

The coalition confirmed its intention to introduce an industry electricity price of five cents per kilowatt-hour for parts of the electricity consumed by energy-intensive companies, which is set to remain in place from 2026 until 2028. Chancellor Friedrich Merz from the conservative CDU said the corresponding talks with the European Commission were nearing conclusion.

Klingbeil said the industry electricity price would cost the state three to five billion euros, to be financed from the country’s Climate and Transformation Fund. In addition, the finance ministry plans to top up next year’s funds for the power price compensation by one billion euros, compared to the original cabinet draft, to allow more companies to benefit.

While energy-intensive companies in the country already enjoy exemptions from certain taxes and levies, the wholesale price of electricity continues to be much higher than before the energy crisis.

Industry association BDI called on the EU to give the German government “sufficient leeway” in setting the industrial electricity price so that it actually reduces costs for as many energy-intensive companies as possible. “At the same time, other companies should also be given access to power price compensation,” the lobby group said.

Texas startup Janta Power has secured $5.5 million in seed funding to expand its next-generation solar power towers, a vertical alternative to flat solar farms. The funding round was led by MaC Venture Capital with support from Collab Capital. The investment shows strong confidence in 3D solar systems that can reshape renewable energy worldwide.

Why flat solar panels are no longer enough

Traditional solar panels cover large flat areas on rooftops or open fields. This approach uses a lot of land and misses much of the day's available sunlight. The sun moves across the sky, but flat panels capture energy best only when it is directly overhead.

Janta Power takes a different approach. The company's pivoting solar towers stack panels vertically to create a compact three-dimensional structure that captures more sunlight throughout the day. Think of it as the solar version of a skyscraper: more power from less ground space.

NEVER NEED AN EV CHARGING STATION AGAIN WITH THESE ROOFTOP SOLAR POWER PANELS

How Janta's solar towers work

Each tower uses smart tracking software that follows the sun's path from sunrise to sunset. By adjusting its position throughout the day, the system collects more sunlight than traditional fixed panels. This design allows the towers to produce about 50% more energy while using only one-third of the land required by flat-panel systems.

Because of their vertical orientation, the towers can capture sunlight during early morning and late afternoon when flat arrays are least efficient. The result is a steadier flow of electricity across the entire day, reducing stress on power grids and lowering the need for short-term backup plants.

Stronger, smarter and more efficient

Janta's towers are also built for strength. Each structure can withstand winds up to 170 miles per hour. The towers feature durable steel frames and modular foundations that simplify installation in a wide range of environments.

Pilot programs are already operating at Munich International Airport, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and facilities managed by Aena, which oversees more than 70 airports worldwide.

A game-changer for energy economics

The company's 3D geometry gives each site a capacity factor of around 32%, compared to roughly 22% for flat panels. This greater efficiency lowers the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) to about $0.05 per kilowatt-hour, well below the global average of $0.15.

That advantage can make renewable power more accessible for industries such as data centers, universities and telecom operations that need reliable and consistent energy.

What this means for you

For businesses and communities, Janta Power's technology could mean smaller solar installations that deliver more energy for less money. Because the towers need less land, they can fit into urban areas, airports or industrial zones that could not host traditional solar farms.

For everyday consumers, these innovations can bring cleaner, more stable and more affordable power to local grids while supporting a greener energy future.

Overall U.S. wholesale electricity prices are expected to continue rising next year, the Energy Information Administration said in its latest short-term energy outlook, published Wednesday.

The agency forecast the load-weighted average of the 11 regional wholesale prices it tracks to be $47/MWh in 2025 — 23% higher than the 2024 average — and to reach $51/MWh in 2026, another 8.5% increase.

Driving the rise in wholesale prices next year is primarily a projected 45% increase at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas-North pricing hub. “Natural gas prices tend to be the biggest determinant of power prices,” the EIA said. “But in 2026, the increase in power prices in ERCOT tends to reflect large hourly spikes in the summer months due to high demand combined with relatively low supply in this region.”

Dive Insight:

As prices go up, demand is also rising, EIA said, with much of it concentrated in the West South Central region that includes Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas, as a result of “data centers and cryptocurrency mining facilities,” it said.

Electricity sales are set to increase across the U.S. by 2.4% in 2025 and 2.6% in 2026. But in the West South Central region, sales will grow 4.4% in 2025 and 9.2% in 2026, due in large part to commercial customers.

The increases in Texas and nearby states “contribute 34% of the growth in U.S. electricity sales in 2025 and 66% of the growth in U.S. electricity sales in 2026,” the report said.

Some price increases can be attributed to fuel costs. Natural gas prices are forecast to rise to an average of almost $3.90/MMBtu this winter and an average of $4/MMBtu in 2026, “primarily due to increased liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports amid flat production growth.”

The EIA forecasts U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide emissions to increase by 1.8% in 2025, followed by a decrease of 0.7% in 2026.

“The largest changes in emissions for both years are attributable to shifting coal consumption for power generation,” it said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/-IptqRhrKcXsFjUyORmVSEjFKTIb4oZhxE6balPVTgo/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Ob3ZlbWJlcl9zaG9ydC10ZXJtX2VuZXJneV9vdXRsb29rX0VJQS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-11-14 12:04:18.729728

NASDAQ:USEG

READ THE FULL USEG RESEARCH REPORT

U.S. Energy (NASDAQ:USEG) continues to achieve major milestones while advancing the full-cycle development of its industrial gas assets across the Kevin Dome structure in Montana.

Upstream Development

During the quarter, two additional industrial gas wells were drilled, bringing the total to three high-deliverability wells in the CO₂ and helium-rich Duperow Formation with each positioned to deliver strong economic returns. The three wells achieved a combined peak rate of 12.2 MMcf/d, with a high-value composition of approximately 0.5% helium and 85% CO₂.

Following testing, flows were restricted to about 8.0 MMcf/d and subsequently shut in to preserve reservoir value until the plant infrastructure is online which sets the stage for an efficient production ramp-up. The company is planning one additional industrial gas well in the Spring of 2026 in the same formation. The company is also advancing enhanced oil recovery (EOR) opportunities using recycled CO₂ on nearby company-owned oil assets in Montana. In addition, the company is conducting helium offtake negotiations with third-party end users to support commercialization.

Infrastructure Development

The design for the initial gas processing facility was finalized, targeting high-purity recovery of helium and recycled CO₂. An 80-acre site in Toole County, MT, was acquired for $240,000 to host the facility.

The infill gathering system (pipelines) design was also completed, with construction planned for early 2026 to directly connect wells to processing and sequestration operations. Permitting, land access, and utility connections are advancing in parallel to enable a timely startup. Initial construction of the plant is expected to begin in the 3rd quarter of 2026. We believe the cost of the plant would be in the $20-$30 million range. Once operational, the facilities are expected to generate diversified cash flow from helium sales, incremental oil through enhanced oil recovery, and carbon management.

Carbon Management Initiatives

The EPA Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) plan was submitted in October 2025, with approval expected by spring or summer 2026. This would make the company eligible for federal carbon credits. A second MRV plan for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations is being prepared, with submission planned for December 2025. The company continues sustained injection of 17.0 MMcf/d across two company-owned wells, equivalent to approximately 240,000 metric tons of CO₂ sequestered annually, while advancing near-term EOR projects utilizing recycled CO₂ on legacy oil assets in Montana. Additionally, a second Class II injection well was approved by Montana regulators in August 2025.

Well Summary

The company has three active industrial gas wells currently with another one planned to be drilled in the spring of 2026. The company also owns two CO2 injection wells.

Industrial Gas

#1) In January 2025, the company acquired 24,000 net acres across the Kevin Dome which included the already drilled Kiefer Farms well targeting the CO2 rich Duperow formation. CO2 wells are drilled at a shallower formation than nitrogen wells at approximately 3,000 feet. This well is expected to become a near-term economic contributor to the industrial gas processing facility that is being developed.

#2) and #3) In July 2025, the company drilled and completed two producing wells in CO2 zones with helium concentrations in the 0.4%-0.5% range. These wells, located within 1-2 miles of the Keifer Farms well (#1 well), together with the Keifer well make three productive wells.

#4) A 4th producing well may be drilled in Spring 2026. This is expected to be located in the same area as wells #1, #2 and #3. This will be an industrial gas well similar to the three active wells described above.

Carbon Sequestration

#1) This was the company’s first well of its industrial gas program and was completed in October 2024. It was drilled to the nitrogen rich Precambrian formation at approximately 5,000 feet and produced helium concentrations of 1.5%. However, the volumetric flow was not sufficient to make this a viable well to develop required helium extraction at the processing plant. This well is being converted to a CO2 injector well has been approved for Class II status. The MRV has been filed on this well with approval expected in the summer of 2026.

#2) In April 2025, the company acquired approximately 2,300 net acres with CO2 rights that are contiguous to its existing positions across Montana’s Kevin Dome structure. This acquisition includes an active Class II injection well to sequester CO2 captured from the company’s industrial gas processing facility (see below for more details).

Potential Opportunities in Gas Liquification Markets

There are only eight helium liquefiers in the U.S. with some being out of commission or not accepting third-party gas. None of these operating plants are currently geographically located to service helium production in the northern U.S. or Canada, so small operators face significant barriers to liquefaction, creating a unique opportunity for the company. USEG is well-positioned to capitalize on the helium liquefaction market, where limited capacity restricts third-party processing and transportation.

Strategically located in Montana, USEG’s operations are ideally suited for a West of the Rockies helium liquefier, enhancing internal economics by producing liquefied helium, which commands a 25-50% premium over gaseous form, and attracting strategic capital by serving West Coast and export markets.

The company sees significant potential to support emerging helium producers in the Rocky Mountain region, many lacking processing infrastructure, by offering third-party tolling services that diversify plant revenues through gaseous helium trucked to the facility, independent of throughput volumes. Acquiring iso-container helium trucks would enable downstream transportation, further expanding access to domestic and international buyers. By targeting smaller, early-stage producers, the company can integrate valuable assets, achieve economies of scale, and leverage untapped industrial gas streams for diversified growth.

3rd Quarter 2025 Financial and Operating Results

On November 12, 2025, U.S. Energy reported 3rd quarter 2025 financial and operating results. The year over year revenue comparisons were mostly irrelevant due to the oil & gas divestitures that occurred in 2024. Total oil and gas revenue in the 3rd quarter was approximately $1.74 million, of which $1.59 million was oil and $151,000 was natural gas and liquids.

In the 3rd quarter, lease operating expenses (LOE) were approximately $1.04 million, or $29.36 per Boe, compared to $3.1 million, or $28.95 per Boe, in the prior year period. The reduction in LOE is primarily due to fewer producing wells as a result of recent asset divestitures..

Cash general and administrative expenses in the 3rd quarter of 2025 were approximately $1.5 million compared to $2.0 million in the 3rd quarter of 2024. This primarily reflects lower acquisition related costs.

The company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $0.87 million related to lower oil & gas prices.

The company generated an adjusted EBITDA loss of ($1.2) million in the 3rd quarter of 2025. The reported net loss was ($3.3) million, or ($0.10) per diluted share.

As of 9/30/25, the company had no outstanding debt, cash balances of $1.4 million, and $10.0 million of availability on its bank line of credit. In January 2025, the company raised approximately $10.5 million in net proceeds from an equity offering. In October 2025, the company filed for an equity line of credit for up to $25.0 million in gross proceeds.

Oil & Gas Business

In the 3rd quarter of 2025, the company produced 35,326 BOE, or an average of 384 BOE per day, as compared to 105,699 BOE or an average of 1,149 BOE per day during the prior year period. The decrease in production quantities primarily relates to the divestitures of properties in the Karnes County, East Texas and Mid-con regions which occurred in the second half of 2024 and the natural decline in production in remaining producing assets. During the 3rd quarter of 2025, production was 91% oil and 9% natural gas and liquids.

The company’s proved developed producing oil and gas reserve base as of October 1, 2025 consisted of approximately 1.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (“BOE”) comprised of approximately 75% oil. The PV-10 value of the company’s reserves was approximately $20.5 million at SEC pricing, with assumed pricing of $67.45/bbl, $3.10/mcf, and $33.01/boe for oil, gas, and natural gas liquids, respectively.

Valuation & Estimates

We maintain our price target of $3.00 per share.

We utilize multiple valuation methodologies to arrive at our target price of $3.00 for USEG stock. These include Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) calculations, peer multiples, price to book value, price to asset value and others.

Our DCF calculation assumes monetization of helium extraction begins in the 4th quarter of 2026. For calendar year 2026, we believe that helium revenues could total approximately $4.0 million, and EBITDA generation would be in the range of $1.0 to $2.0 million. We assume the oil and gas properties produce steady state revenues in the $7.0-$8.0 million range with EBITDA generation of approximately $1.0 million. Under this scenario, our DCF calculation is approximately $3.00 per share. This may prove to be conservative as we utilize a high discount rate of 12.5%. In addition, we do not incorporate any other industrial gas revenues or carbon sequestration related benefits into our model at this time.

On the tech giant’s 500-acre campus in Redmond, Washington, teams began holding regular “triage” meetings to confront serious questions posed by the artificial intelligence boom: Where would the company find the gigawatts — just one gigawatt can power nearly 750,000 US homes — needed for data centers? And how could Microsoft possibly secure that extra energy while still making progress toward a long-standing goal of going carbon-negative?

The AI discussions were “interesting and terrifying all at the same time,” said Brian Janous, who served until August 2023 as Microsoft’s vice president of energy. Microsoft and other major tech companies, he said, had to “look at the climate commitments they set and say, ‘Can I still do this?’”

Nearly three years later, Microsoft and rivals including Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are still struggling to answer that question. On one hand, they’re trying to obtain every electron possible to power their trillion-dollar bet on AI. On the other, they're trying to stay true to a goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 or sooner.

“There’s no question that the current push to develop AI infrastructure is putting a strain on the climate commitments of the big tech companies, all of which were made prior to the advent of AI,” Janous said in an interview. After leaving Microsoft, he co-founded Cloverleaf Infrastructure, which partners with utilities to develop clean-powered sites that supply the largest data-center providers.

US President Donald Trump isn’t making this challenge any easier. Since taking office, he’s slashed federal funding for green initiatives, such as wind and solar, and signaled his support for powering AI with generators that use fossil fuels, including aging coal-fired plants. Wary of irritating their biggest ally in Washington, tech leaders so far have refrained from publicly challenging the president over his campaign against renewables.

For now, the so-called hyperscalers continue to buy clean energy at a record pace, with Meta, Amazon, Google and Microsoft ranking as the biggest corporate signers of power purchase agreements with renewable suppliers. Together they accounted for 9.6 gigawatts of US clean energy purchases in the first half of 2025, amounting to 40% of the global total, according to the latest BloombergNEF data.

That number falls woefully short of the 362 gigawatts of additional power the industry is projected to need worldwide by 2035 to sustain its growing data center fleet, according to BNEF. With enormous pressure from Wall Street to deliver on AI investments, companies can’t afford to let energy be a limiting factor and are pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy on electricity sources.

AI’s impact is already showing up in sustainability reports. Meta, Google, Amazon and Microsoft disclosed that their carbon emissions went up 64%, 51%, 33% and 23% respectively in their latest climate filings compared to their benchmarks from before ChatGPT’s release. Microsoft explicitly blamed “growth-related factors such as AI and cloud expansion.”

Inside Microsoft, tension between longstanding climate pledges and the insatiable energy needs of AI left the sustainability teams mired in uncertainty, according to two former managers who left the company earlier this year. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the former managers described Microsoft’s climate priorities as constantly shifting in the face of its appetite for electricity.

A key source of strain was over concerns that Microsoft risked a public backlash if it appeared to be abandoning its climate goals in any way, creating a “suffocating level of control” that paralyzed staff, one of the former managers said. Reports were dissected to ensure they adhered to an evolving company line, with individual words in memos and other documents turning into landmines that could “blow up” conversations, the person said.

Adding to the stress, the other former manager said, were industry-wide workforce reductions in 2023 that cut nearly 200,000 jobs, which destabilized climate teams as they worked on one of the toughest problems in tech: how to procure enough energy, sustainably.

In a statement, Microsoft’s chief sustainability officer, Melanie Nakagawa, said the company “remains committed to meeting our climate goals of being carbon negative, water positive and zero waste by 2030 while protecting ecosystems. As we learn and adapt, we’re continuing to expand our global clean energy portfolio, building markets by investing in new climate technology solutions, and empowering others with technology to build a more sustainable future.”

Biggest Bottleneck

On a recent podcast, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said the supply of power, rather than the availability of semiconductors, accounted for the biggest bottleneck in data center capacity. By some estimates, the energy needs of existing and planned AI infrastructure in the US can’t be met with current supply.

Dave Stangis, a senior executive at Apollo Global Management who has led the firm’s sustainability strategy for the past four years, said last month that the amount of energy required to power AI data centers is so vast that meeting that need may be more than a lifetime away.

As a result, big tech companies have been buying more nuclear and geothermal energy to satisfy the needs of their expanding AI infrastructure, according to BNEF data. At the same time, haunted by the risk of losing power for even a minute and driven by the desire to win the AI race, some companies are also exploring what’s known as behind-the-meter power, where a generation plant sits in the data center’s backyard.

“They want a new resource, something that’s not already on the grid, that’s not already spoken for,” said Elaine Walsh, who leads the power group for the law firm Baker Botts. She added that “almost all” of the new development work she does is for gas power.

Meta’s Hyperion Project

That’s the strategy Meta is using as it attempts to get its massive data center in Louisiana up and running as quickly as possible.

The project, dubbed Hyperion, is a 4 million-square-foot complex on 2,250 acres in rural Louisiana that’s expected to consume as much as five gigawatts of electricity. This summer, Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg posted a graphic depicting Hyperion engulfing most of Manhattan — an image that Trump later displayed at a White House Cabinet meeting, saying the facility would cost $50 billion.

To support the Meta site, Entergy Corp. received regulatory approval in August to construct three gas plants capable of producing about 2.3 gigawatts. Last month, in addition to those three plants, the utility applied to tie new natural gas generation to the grid in Louisiana to meet increasing demand from data centers and industrial projects, including from Meta and other hyperscalers.

“From the moment that the Richland Parish data center came onto the picture, we’ve been planning for and executing to secure clean energy to support that site,” Urvi Parekh, Meta’s head of global energy, said in an interview. “What we measure is what is the carbon intensity of the electricity that is serving our data center and then working through the greenhouse gas protocol rules.”

Meta also said in a statement that it plans to add enough clean and renewable energy to match the total electricity use at Richland. To do so, the company said it’s working with Entergy to bring 1.5 gigawatts of renewable energy to the Louisiana grid and that it’s launched other clean and renewable energy projects across the state, including three focused on solar.

Companies like Meta often buy carbon offsets and renewable energy certificates to balance the emissions tied to their operations, but both of those practices have been decried over the years for varying reasons. Offsets can be notoriously difficult to verify, and renewable energy certificates have been assailed for failing to achieve real emissions reduction or drive renewable energy generation.

Meta has maintained that the majority of its renewable energy portfolio actually comes in the form of real, long-term contracts such as power purchase agreements and that “only a small percentage” — less than 5% of its reported renewable energy purchases in 2023, for example — were tied to short-term, unbundled renewable energy certificates.

Nuclear Option

Meta’s use of gas to power its new data center while still purchasing huge amounts of clean energy reflects a balancing act across the industry. Last month, Google announced a first-of-its kind agreement to buy almost all of the electricity from a gas plant in Illinois while supplying the facility with carbon capture and storage equipment.

The technology will capture and store around 90% of the CO2 emissions from the plant, according to a Google release. But some skeptics have cautioned that emissions capture is neither economical nor feasible at scale, and a nationwide carbon storage network would require as many as 96,000 miles of new pipelines, according to Energy Department estimates.

Another option on the table is nuclear energy, which can provide huge amounts of round-the-clock power, free of carbon emissions. Google agreed last month to buy nuclear power from a plant that NextEra Energy Inc. plans to restart in Iowa.

But nuclear power is also expensive, and supply chain issues mean that new nuclear plants will take years to build and bring online. Even though the NextEra generator is already built — and was only shuttered in 2020 — the company won’t start delivering power to Google’s data centers until 2029.

To link data centers to power sources faster, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last month to expedite reviews for grid connections, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg News. As part of a draft rule Wright sent to the agency, those reviews would shrink to 60 days, a seismic shift for a process that currently can take years.

Under the proposal, data centers could win a speedy review if they include new power plants or agree to curtail usage in response to grid strains during high-demand periods such as heatwaves. However, a data center vying to locate next to an existing power plant would require a study to determine if that generation capacity is needed to maintain grid reliability.

Trump Headwinds

Complicating matters is Trump, who has made the industry’s AI ambitions central to his second-term economic agenda. In September, he welcomed leaders including Nadella and Zuckerberg for a White House dinner where he hailed tech companies’ far-reaching infrastructure spending plans and promised help with permitting for energy projects.

At the same time, Trump has roiled the tech companies’ quest for electricity by attacking green energy with a vengeance and assailing global warming as “the greatest con job ever” during a United Nations speech. The administration has stopped or delayed wind and solar initiatives — some of which were near completion — and declined to send delegates to the COP30 climate conference in Brazil.

One of Trump’s biggest moves against renewables was to use the massive tax bill he signed in July to strip away clean energy incentives created through his predecessor Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Total annual deployment of new solar, wind and energy storage facilities in 2035 will be 21% lower — or 227 gigawatts less — than it would have been without the Trump tax law, according to BNEF forecasts.

Backing out of wind and solar projects as Trump envisions is problematic because doing so would force companies to use other power sources, like natural gas, that are not necessarily cheaper or faster to get into service, said Janous. He disputed the narrative that renewables can’t sufficiently power data centers, arguing that the grid should be made more flexible to better use what solar and wind can offer.

Big tech companies likewise can’t simply discard clean energy commitments that have been a decade in the making for some firms, which have put time and money into reaching them, said BNEF analyst Nayel Brihi.

“Dropping out now would first of all hurt their branding a lot, but also would just not make a lot of business sense for them because of all the time and effort that’s been put in already,” he said.

Reports have surfaced that Ford may end production of its electric F-150 Lightning, the most popular EV pickup truck in the U.S.

The rumors come just two months after Ford announced an upcoming EV platform for new models.

Ford is betting on EVs at a time of slowing demand and the absence of federal tax credit incentives for buyers.

10 stocks we like better than Ford Motor Company ›

Just two months ago, Ford (NYSE: F) announced a new electric vehicle platform that it will build future EVs on. Ford CEO Jim Farley said that we've all lived through automakers giving EVs too many ""good college tries"" without any success.

Now, just two months later, there are reports that Ford is about to end production of its F-150 Lightning -- the best-selling EV pickup truck in the U.S.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »

At best, ending production of the electric F-150 is sending mixed signals to buyers and investors. At worst, it's an admission that selling EVs isn't working for Ford. Is Ford already shifting its EV strategy following its doubling down on EVs just two months ago? Not exactly, but it's undoubtedly not instilling confidence that the company can succeed with EVs.

Even the Lightning can't brighten dark times in the EV industry

The F-150 Lightning was intended to be a big win for Ford's EV pursuits, as the company would tap into America's love of pickup trucks and leverage its very successful F-150 brand.

At first, it seemed to work. Interest in the truck was high when it first launched, and the Lightning has become the best-selling EV pickup truck in the U.S. But electric vehicles are costly to develop and produce, and -- just like traditional vehicles -- companies need to sell them in mass volumes for them to be worth making. Instead, Ford sold just 1,500 of its Lightning trucks in October.

One of the most significant problems for Ford's electric truck and the rest of the U.S. EV industry is that federal tax credits -- which were worth up to $7,500 off a new purchase -- disappeared at the end of September. That was several years earlier than originally scheduled, because the Trump administration decided to end their funding early.

Ford lost $1.4 billion from its Model-e electric vehicle segment in the third quarter, on an earnings before interest and taxes basis (EBIT). With EV tax credits entirely gone now, it will be harder than ever for Ford to turn a profit from EV sales.

Ford probably isn't shifting its EV strategy just yet

Ford announced in September that its future electric vehicle model will be built on a new platform, called the Universal EV Platform. Farley said automakers have made too many attempts at EVs that have ended in layoffs and uncertainty. So the goal, as Farley stated, is to create a ""strong, sustainable and profitable business"" for its EVs.

The first model built on the platform is a yet-to-be-named mid-sized pickup truck that is expected to cost approximately $30,000, with deliveries scheduled to begin in 2027. It's notable that this price tag is considerably lower than the F-150 Lightning's starting price of around $55,000.

Most importantly, the new platform will enable Ford to implement manufacturing cost efficiencies by reducing parts by 20% compared to a typical vehicle and reducing assembly times by 15%.

With slow F-150 Lightning sales and mounting losses, Ford is likely launching the new platform because its current strategy isn't working. In short, Ford potentially axing the Lightning isn't a strategy shift as much as an admission that trying to sell expensive EV pickup trucks isn't a good strategy for the automaker.

But if the Lightning goes away, it's still not a good sign

Ford has yet to succeed with its EV plans. The company's not alone in this. Some automakers have completely abandoned their previous EV goals and scrapped models. But if the Lightning goes away, it'll mean Ford is essentially starting from scratch with its electric vehicle goals.

What concerns me about Ford's plans is that there appears to be a softening of demand for EVs in America right now. J.D. Power reported that EVs made up just over 5% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. in October, down from 8.5% about a year ago.

Ford will invest billions of dollars in its new platform amid slowing demand and the absence of federal EV tax credits. It's also starting from scratch with an unknown platform. All this means that while Ford may be shifting to lower-priced electric vehicles, its EV strategy remains a gamble.

During its Q3 earnings call, CEO Marty Neese confirmed the company “will not pursue” the 3GW facility.

The decision follows earlier uncertainty over whether the project would secure Department of Energy (DOE) funding, after the US government cut 223 clean energy projects totalling $7.5bn across its grant programmes.

Neese, who was appointed CEO in July, explained, “Our analysis shows our existing global manufacturing capacity, with minor adjustments, will meet forecasted volumes.

“This decision underscores our commitment to capital discipline and focus on efficient execution.”

Ballard secured $94m in federal funding for the plant under the Biden Administration in 2024. However, sluggish demand led to Ballard postponing investment in the site, but it was able to “preserve” the grants.

The project had “remained on amber” until October, as the company shifted focus toward cost efficiency and optimisation within its existing footprint under a wider restructuring programme.

That process has seen Ballard cut operating expenses by 36% year-on-year and reduce cash operating costs by 40%.

Financially, the quarter showed the early effects of that restructuring.

During the quarter, the Canadian technology firm saw its revenue rise 120% year-on-year to $32.5m, with the bus and rail sector accounting for 70% of that income. It also recorded a net order intake of $19m.

Speaking to H2 View, Neese confirmed that the strongest near-term traction continues to come from the bus and rail segments in Europe and North America. He said that “hydrogen has a very strong role to play here” during its Q2 results.

Nevertheless, gross margin was only positive due to one-time benefits, while multiple customer orders have been pushed into late 2025 and early 2026, as Ballard seeks more sustainable contract terms.

Neese admitted there is much more to do to “further transform the company” towards cash flow positivity. “We are committed to this overarching goal,” he reiterated.","https://www.h2-view.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.h2-view.com/wp-content/files/shutterstock_2248418429-e1754033387666.jpg",N,,2025-11-14 12:04:55.828724

The proposed 7.96% residential rate increase is roughly 3 1/2 times larger than the 2.28% bump approved by the MPSC one year ago as part of DTE’s $113 million 2024 gas rate increase.
When DTE announced its intention to file a gas rate hike request in September, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement she would intervene to protect Michigan ratepayers.
Past rate hike requests included millions in “wasteful and inefficient spending” such as the cost of private jet travel, Nessel said.
The commission has 10 months to decide on the proposed rate increase.","This article first appeared on Planet Detroit and is republished here under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.

DTE Energy is seeking a $163 million gas rate hike that could raise residential rates by roughly 8% beginning next fall.

The increase would add $6.16 to the average customer’s monthly utility bill, DTE spokesperson Ryan Lowry told Planet Detroit. The details are outlined in the rate case the company filed Thursday with the Michigan Public Service Commission.

For ratepayers, DTE’s request comes just after a government shutdown that held up federal heating assistance funding for states.

The proposed 7.96% residential rate increase is roughly 3 1/2 times larger than the 2.28% bump approved by the MPSC one year ago as part of DTE’s $113 million 2024 gas rate increase.

Amy Bandyk, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan advocacy group, said a significant chunk of this funding would go toward increasing DTE’s return on equity from 9.8% to 10.25%, which she said is “essentially, the amount (DTE) can bill ratepayers for shareholder profit.” The MPSC lowered DTE’s return on equity from 9.9% to 9.8% in the last gas rate case.

“There is nothing that has changed since that case to justify going the other direction and massively increasing the shareholder return all the way to 10.25%,” Bandyk said.

Bob Richard, president and chief operating officer of DTE Gas, said in a statement that the request will allow the company to “continue investing in the safety and reliability of our system, while keeping costs low for the customers who depend on us for generations to come.”

Gas rate hike proposal arrives during energy assistance ‘crisis’

An increase in DTE’s gas rates would come as the Trump administration throws the future of federal energy assistance programs into doubt.

The administration eliminated the entire staff for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, in the spring, raising questions about the future of the program that helps over 400,000 Michigan residents pay their energy bills.

“LIHEAP is in a crisis due to staff cuts and proposed budget cuts, and those problems very well may not be resolved a year from now,” said ratepayer advocate Bandyk. “They could even be worse.”

Vulnerable utility customers often have to choose between covering their energy bills or paying for other essentials like medicine, Bandyk said, adding that DTE’s proposed hike could exacerbate the problem. She cited CUB’s October report on energy insecurity in Michigan.

LIHEAP payments to states were blocked during the federal government shutdown.

Michigan’s LIHEAP funding, which supports assistance programs like the State Emergency Relief program, will last until the fourth week of November using funds carried over from the last fiscal year, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Lynn Sutfin told Planet Detroit Thursday.

DTE’s Lowry said the utility advocated for the expansion of the Michigan Energy Assistance Program, or MEAP, which provides utility bill assistance to eligible households through a monthly surcharge on electric bills.

Legislation signed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer increased MEAP’s income eligibility threshold. The surcharge increased to $1.25 this year and can be raised by 25 cents a year until it hits $2.

DTE also offers assistance through the Low-Income Self-Sufficiency Plan, which offers eligible customers shutoff protection, fixed monthly payments, and up to $3,000 in past due balance forgiveness.

When DTE announced its intention to file a gas rate hike request in September, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement she would intervene to protect Michigan ratepayers.

Past rate hike requests included millions in “wasteful and inefficient spending” such as the cost of private jet travel, Nessel said.

DTE did not comment on Nessel’s allegations.

The MPSC has not decided if it will hold a hearing on the rate case, according to MPSC spokesperson Matt Helms. The commission has 10 months to decide on the proposed rate increase.",https://www.bridgedetroit.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/DTE-shutterstock-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 11:02:20.423625

On paper, the deal makes sense.
If the brand’s going to carry on, it makes sense for the company to play it safe.
TVR previously announced an electric Griffith, but it didn’t release technical information or a launch date.","England-based boutique carmaker Charge Holdings has purchased TVR, saving the famed British brand from a grim fate yet again. The takeover should finally bring the Ford V-8-powered Griffith, which was unveiled in 2017, to production, and Charge announced it will steer TVR toward electrification in the coming years.

Charge has big plans for TVR; It aims to implement a multi-phase restructuring plan and ultimately create a low-volume automotive group. On paper, the deal makes sense. While TVR isn’t a household name, it’s a respected brand among enthusiasts. It lacks the resources to capitalize on its heritage, however. Charge is relatively unknown, but it’s seemingly better-funded than TVR. The two brands will leverage economies of scale by sharing technical capabilities, facilities, and funding, but they’ll keep their respective identities.

What this means for the future isn’t entirely clear yet. Charge specializes in making electric cars, including a battery-powered, resto-modded first-generation Mustang called ’67, but it’s not going to push TVR into EV territory right away. In a statement, the firm explained that TVR will remain focused on delivering the new Griffith to customers and “continue its legacy of high-performance, internal-combustion sports cars.”

Unveiled in 2017 as a close-to-production prototype, the born-again Griffith (pictured) featured a Ford-sourced 5.0-liter V-8 tuned by Cosworth to about 500 horsepower, a six-speed manual transmission, and rear-wheel drive. Gordon Murray engineered it, and it was initially scheduled to enter production in 2019. The brand missed that deadline for a variety of reasons, including a lack of funding, and the car looked dead until the takeover was announced. There’s no word on whether the Griffith will be updated, or if what we saw in 2017 is what we’ll see when production starts. We asked, and a spokesperson replied that more information about the new coupe will be revealed soon. No timeline has been provided.

Looking ahead, Charge said that TVR will expand into electrified platforms without providing additional details. The move makes sense from a regulatory standpoint: England will ban the sale of new gasoline- and diesel-powered cars in 2030, while hybrids will be allowed to stay on the market until 2035. Beyond that, every car sold new in the United Kingdom will have to be electric, though government officials could make an exemption for low-volume brands, like TVR. If the brand’s going to carry on, it makes sense for the company to play it safe.

TVR previously announced an electric Griffith, but it didn’t release technical information or a launch date. It published a sketch that suggests the EV will look a lot like the V-8-powered model without an exhaust.

Trump, urging the administration to finalize key biofuel policies that strengthen domestic energy production, promote the use of U.S.-grown soybean oil, and ensure that federal programs prioritize American feedstocks over imports.

In the letter, the groups commended the President’s leadership in restoring access to the China market and expanding global export opportunities for U.S. soybeans and soybean meal, while emphasizing that strong domestic market growth is critical. The organizations called on the administration to finalize policies that expand domestic biofuel production, include strong volumes for biomass-based diesel (BBD) in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), and limit the generation of RFS credits for foreign feedstocks and biofuels.

The U.S. soybean processing industry has invested more than $6 billion over the past four years to increase capacity by over 25 percent and today crushes more than half of all soybeans grown by U.S. farmers. To maximize their impact, these investments depend on stable federal policy frameworks that provide certainty for biofuel producers and preserve the economic value of U.S. soybeans here at home.

The organizations also highlighted the importance of the U.S. Department of the Treasury finalizing guidance for the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit without delay. Timely and clear implementation is essential to providing market certainty for ongoing biofuel investment and ensuring that the benefits of the 45Z credit flow to fuels produced from North American feedstocks, as directed by Congress in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

“We greatly appreciate the President’s efforts to restore export markets and expand opportunities for American soy and meal,” said Devin Mogler, President and CEO of NOPA. “Reducing credits for imported feedstocks is an America First policy that ensures U.S. farmers and processors, not foreign competitors, are the first to benefit from America’s growing biofuel production.

The skunk cabbage has achieved its goal, as the fly carries its pollen when it departs.","Mimicry is a survival adaptation where one species evolves to resemble another, differing from camouflage which involves blending into the environment.

Some species, such as the skunk cabbage, use rewarding mimicry to deceive others for benefits like pollination.

With Halloween behind us, we take off the costumes and go about the rest of the year as ourselves. For us, it is only a holiday, but for other living things, it’s a way of survival and life.

Mimicry is the ability of one species to resemble another in nature. It is not the same as camouflage, which is focused on blending in with your surroundings.

This adaptation has evolved over millennia for various reasons across many species. There are many different types of mimicry, but some are more common than others in Indiana.

Batesian mimicry is when a harmless animal mimics a dangerous model species. The mimic takes on the same colors and patterns that signify a warning. A good example of this is how hoverflies copy bees and wasps. They are mimicking the black and yellow stripes that scream “I can defend myself."" Hover flies use this to scare species away from them.

Müllerian mimicry is when well-defended species share traits to deter predators. People thought the viceroy butterfly was mimicking the monarch butterfly through Batesian mimicry. But it actually is toxic in a different way than the monarch. This means these two toxic species use the same colors to warn predators: “I will make you sick.”

This type of mimicry is a mutualistic relationship. It helps predators catch on fast to what colors and patterns are dangerous. This allows the model and mimic species to die less often than Batesian mimicry.

Rewarding mimicry is when the mimic tricks another species so the mimic can gain a benefit. Skunk cabbage, while smelling bad to us, smells great to flies. Flies approach the plant, believing it is a prime location for reproduction. Instead, they're greeted with disappointment once they realize the deception. The skunk cabbage has achieved its goal, as the fly carries its pollen when it departs.

This type of mimicry allows the mimic to have better fitness. Fitness is the ability to survive and reproduce in an environment.

Nature doesn’t seek perfection, and mimicry is no exception. Perfect mimicry can be disadvantageous. It would be hard to reproduce if you can't tell the difference between your species and a mimic. This opens the door to a wide range of diversity in the world of mimics. Different mimic species all have different variations from the model they're copying.

There is a lot we need to learn about mimicry. While we know the basics, we are still learning about the complex reasons for mimicry. Interactions between mimics and other species have been revealing more to us every day.

It is important we get outside and observe these species to learn more. Observations rooted in documenting and better understanding mimicry will help us protect them.

Halloween might be one day for us, but dressing up as someone else is a way of life for some species.

Getting outside is the best way to connect with these copycats. Watch mimics in action to better understand mimicry in nature.

The company has three active industrial gas wells currently with another one planned to be drilled in the spring of 2026. The company also owns two CO2 injection wells.

Industrial Gas

#1) In January 2025, the company acquired 24,000 net acres across the Kevin Dome which included the already drilled Kiefer Farms well targeting the CO2 rich Duperow formation. CO2 wells are drilled at a shallower formation than nitrogen wells at approximately 3,000 feet. This well is expected to become a near-term economic contributor to the industrial gas processing facility that is being developed.

#2) and #3) In July 2025, the company drilled and completed two producing wells in CO2 zones with helium concentrations in the 0.4%-0.5% range. These wells, located within 1-2 miles of the Keifer Farms well (#1 well), together with the Keifer well make three productive wells.

#4) A 4th producing well may be drilled in Spring 2026. This is expected to be located in the same area as wells #1, #2 and #3. This will be an industrial gas well similar to the three active wells described above.

Carbon Sequestration

#1) This was the company’s first well of its industrial gas program and was completed in October 2024. It was drilled to the nitrogen rich Precambrian formation at approximately 5,000 feet and produced helium concentrations of 1.5%. However, the volumetric flow was not sufficient to make this a viable well to develop required helium extraction at the processing plant. This well is being converted to a CO2 injector well has been approved for Class II status. The MRV has been filed on this well with approval expected in the summer of 2026.

#2) In April 2025, the company acquired approximately 2,300 net acres with CO2 rights that are contiguous to its existing positions across Montana’s Kevin Dome structure. This acquisition includes an active Class II injection well to sequester CO2 captured from the company’s industrial gas processing facility (see below for more details).

Potential Opportunities in Gas Liquification Markets

There are only eight helium liquefiers in the U.S. with some being out of commission or not accepting third-party gas. None of these operating plants are currently geographically located to service helium production in the northern U.S. or Canada, so small operators face significant barriers to liquefaction, creating a unique opportunity for the company. USEG is well-positioned to capitalize on the helium liquefaction market, where limited capacity restricts third-party processing and transportation.

Strategically located in Montana, USEG’s operations are ideally suited for a West of the Rockies helium liquefier, enhancing internal economics by producing liquefied helium, which commands a 25-50% premium over gaseous form, and attracting strategic capital by serving West Coast and export markets.

The company sees significant potential to support emerging helium producers in the Rocky Mountain region, many lacking processing infrastructure, by offering third-party tolling services that diversify plant revenues through gaseous helium trucked to the facility, independent of throughput volumes. Acquiring iso-container helium trucks would enable downstream transportation, further expanding access to domestic and international buyers. By targeting smaller, early-stage producers, the company can integrate valuable assets, achieve economies of scale, and leverage untapped industrial gas streams for diversified growth.

3rd Quarter 2025 Financial and Operating Results

On November 12, 2025, U.S. Energy reported 3rd quarter 2025 financial and operating results. The year over year revenue comparisons were mostly irrelevant due to the oil & gas divestitures that occurred in 2024. Total oil and gas revenue in the 3rd quarter was approximately $1.74 million, of which $1.59 million was oil and $151,000 was natural gas and liquids.

In the 3rd quarter, lease operating expenses (LOE) were approximately $1.04 million, or $29.36 per Boe, compared to $3.1 million, or $28.95 per Boe, in the prior year period. The reduction in LOE is primarily due to fewer producing wells as a result of recent asset divestitures..

Cash general and administrative expenses in the 3rd quarter of 2025 were approximately $1.5 million compared to $2.0 million in the 3rd quarter of 2024. This primarily reflects lower acquisition related costs.

The company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $0.87 million related to lower oil & gas prices.

The company generated an adjusted EBITDA loss of ($1.2) million in the 3rd quarter of 2025. The reported net loss was ($3.3) million, or ($0.10) per diluted share.

As of 9/30/25, the company had no outstanding debt, cash balances of $1.4 million, and $10.0 million of availability on its bank line of credit. In January 2025, the company raised approximately $10.5 million in net proceeds from an equity offering. In October 2025, the company filed for an equity line of credit for up to $25.0 million in gross proceeds.

Oil & Gas Business

In the 3rd quarter of 2025, the company produced 35,326 BOE, or an average of 384 BOE per day, as compared to 105,699 BOE or an average of 1,149 BOE per day during the prior year period. The decrease in production quantities primarily relates to the divestitures of properties in the Karnes County, East Texas and Mid-con regions which occurred in the second half of 2024 and the natural decline in production in remaining producing assets. During the 3rd quarter of 2025, production was 91% oil and 9% natural gas and liquids.

The company’s proved developed producing oil and gas reserve base as of October 1, 2025 consisted of approximately 1.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (“BOE”) comprised of approximately 75% oil. The PV-10 value of the company’s reserves was approximately $20.5 million at SEC pricing, with assumed pricing of $67.45/bbl, $3.10/mcf, and $33.01/boe for oil, gas, and natural gas liquids, respectively.

Valuation & Estimates

We maintain our price target of $3.00 per share.

We utilize multiple valuation methodologies to arrive at our target price of $3.00 for USEG stock. These include Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) calculations, peer multiples, price to book value, price to asset value and others.

Our DCF calculation assumes monetization of helium extraction begins in the 4th quarter of 2026. For calendar year 2026, we believe that helium revenues could total approximately $4.0 million, and EBITDA generation would be in the range of $1.0 to $2.0 million. We assume the oil and gas properties produce steady state revenues in the $7.0-$8.0 million range with EBITDA generation of approximately $1.0 million. Under this scenario, our DCF calculation is approximately $3.00 per share. This may prove to be conservative as we utilize a high discount rate of 12.5%. In addition, we do not incorporate any other industrial gas revenues or carbon sequestration related benefits into our model at this time.

The United States has long been an at-best-unreliable presence in global climate negotiations.
The likely 2028 presidential hopeful drew big crowds at COP, where he encouraged climate advocates to reframe climate issues in terms of affordability.
By 2025 global climate diplomacy standards, it is a bold idea, and will undoubtedly face opposition from some countries.
Still, by now it’s clear that mainstream corporate America is not rushing to position itself as the antidote to U.S. climate retrenchment.","In the weeks following President Trump’s re-election, there was a lot of talk about who would fill the global climate leadership vacuum left behind by the Biden administration.

Some would argue this was a flawed premise. The United States has long been an at-best-unreliable presence in global climate negotiations. It is the only country to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, in which 194 other governments pledged to keep global warming to relatively safe levels. The U.S. left the agreement in President Trump’s first term, only to rejoin under President Biden and it is now in the process of withdrawing again.

Regardless, as international negotiators gather in Belém, Brazil, for this year’s U.N. climate talks, known as COP30, there are a few early indicators about who’s stepping up on the global stage and who’s stepping back.

Here’s where things stand.

Next up: China

Cheap green tech exports out of China are starting to substantially change the economic development trajectory of some countries, Somini Sengupta and Brad Plumer report from Belém.

“China has sought to cast itself as a pillar of global stability,” they write, “particularly after the Trump administration said it would withdraw the United States from the annual climate talks.”

The result is that drivers in countries like Vietnam, Nepal and Ethiopia are opting for electric vehicles over combustion engines, and places all over the world have begun installing solar arrays made with Chinese equipment.

(We’ve been reporting all year about China’s clean energy boom, including how it’s leaving the U.S. behind in nuclear development, clean energy patents and building out ultra high-voltage power lines. Read more from our series.)

Yet much of China’s clean tech manufacturing boom has been powered by a parallel expansion in coal, so its emissions have continued to increase.

But the rapid pace of China’s clean energy installations may be flattening that curve: its emissions are projected to rise by just 0.4 percent this year, or even fall slightly, Plumer reports.

The newcomer: Gavin Newsom

Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, a Democrat, has seized on the Trump administration’s absence at the conference to show up at U.N. climate talks in person for the first time, pitching himself as a “stable and reliable” partner to the world, Somini Sengupta reports.

“Donald Trump didn’t show up at COP30 but California did,” Newsom said.

The likely 2028 presidential hopeful drew big crowds at COP, where he encouraged climate advocates to reframe climate issues in terms of affordability.

As Sengupta pointed out, though he was a strong critic of the oil and gas industry just a few years ago, Newsom this year made it easier to drill for oil in California, a move he defended as “pragmatic” when pressed about it at COP.

The pragmatist: Brazil

Another government that has tried to balance promises to slash emissions with its sizable fossil fuel revenue is Brazil, the host of this year’s talks.

President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva called for leaders at COP to build a road map to overcome dependence on fossil fuels, building on promises made in previous years. By 2025 global climate diplomacy standards, it is a bold idea, and will undoubtedly face opposition from some countries.

In recent years, Brazil has significantly reduced deforestation, Ana Ionova reported. But just weeks before the summit began, Brazil paved the way to allow oil drilling near the mouth of the Amazon River.

This decision drew blowback. Dozens of Indigenous protesters burst into the conference venue on Tuesday, demanding preservation of their land and criticizing the oil exploration plan.

Not in the room: U.S. Corporations

It wasn’t so long ago that leaders of America’s biggest companies were proclaiming their commitments to climate issues.

That’s not the case anymore, Ivan Penn and David Gelles report. Whereas past COPs have drawn top executives from Apple, Exxon and Bank of America, this year’s summit has drawn no prominent American leaders.

Some of what’s driving the corporate absence at COP is fear of retribution from the Trump administration, experts told Penn and Gelles.

Under the surface, the picture is a little more complicated. Some companies are proceeding with business as usual, pursuing the same climate commitments as ever minus the flashy marketing push, Harvard researchers Neil Hawkins and Kelly Cooper found in a paper published in June. A smaller number are walking back their sustainability goals.

Still, by now it’s clear that mainstream corporate America is not rushing to position itself as the antidote to U.S. climate retrenchment. As one expert told my colleagues, the risk of drawing the ire of the Trump administration seems to outweigh the benefit of trumpeting climate progress on the global stage.

Who gets to use the Colorado River’s water? It’s complicated.

Years ago, as a young environmental reporter, when I first learned that the Colorado River’s water is divvied up based on a century-old agreement, I was astonished. So much in the American West has changed over that time — the engineering feat of the Hoover Dam, the birth of entire cities and of suburbs, the dawn of air-conditioning.

All of that, plus climate change.

Over the past quarter century, steady downward trends in precipitation and rising temperatures across the Southwest have fueled the longest period of drought the region has experienced since at least the year 800. (That’s not a typo. It’s been that long.)

It is therefore no surprise that renegotiating use of the waterway has proved incredibly difficult. Some 40 million people across seven states and parts of Mexico rely on the river’s water. And there’s been an ongoing battle over water usage between states in the lower river basin — Nevada, Arizona and California — and in the upper river basin — Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico.

So no one paying attention was surprised when those states and the federal government missed their latest deadline to agree upon a new, sustainable plan for the coming decades, as I reported Tuesday.

What comes next? The talks have dragged on for years, only now with heightening stakes. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation had set a Nov. 11 deadline to give a cushion of time before the water usage rules, which date to 1922 and were last tweaked in 2007, expire at the end of this year.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/13/multimedia/13cli-newsletter-COP30-gtqj/13cli-newsletter-COP30-gtqj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 12:03:44.876455

While clean energy was helping win elections in New Jersey, New York, Virginia, and Georgia, Illinois just showed us what’s possible when you elect clean energy leaders and work in coalition to pass bold, people-centered policies.

In a historic, down-to-the-wire victory, Illinois lawmakers passed two pieces of legislation: the Clean and Reliable Grid Act (CRWA) and Northern Illinois Transit Authority Act (NITA)—game-changers for affordability, improving public transit, and lowering energy bills.

These two bills include exciting, creative solutions to challenges being faced by communities across the country:

How do we fund public transportation, as states deal with budget crunches and shortfalls?

How can states stay on track for 100 percent clean energy targets while the Trump administration is greedily propping up coal, fossil fuel CEOs, and tech oligarchs?

What pro-affordability policies can states implement today to help households save money on energy bills, transportation, and housing for years to come?

Our Conversation with Kady and Amy

For answers to these questions and more, we spoke to Kady McFadden, the lead lobbyist and strategist with the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition, and Amy Rynell, who co-leads the Clean and Equitable Transportation Campaign. These two advocates were instrumental in the passage of Illinois’ latest policies and expertly break down the bills, why they matter, and what the rest of us can learn from their successes.

Are you a policymaker or advocate? It’s time to take notes, and as Kady aptly advises, “strap in!” You can find the transcript of our conversation below, edited for brevity and clarity.

How Do CRWA and NITA Make Energy and Transportation More Affordable?

Evergreen: A lot of folks are thinking about rising energy costs and affordability right now. Could you share how Illinois' new bills will make a difference for households dealing with these challenges? And before fully diving in, can you give a brief overview of what’s in these bills?

Kady McFadden: Absolutely. We're really excited to have been able to pass the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act. In developing this legislation with a coalition of climate advocates, but also consumer advocates, ratepayer advocates, environmental justice communities, and faith communities, we were really recognizing the threat of rising utility bills years ago, especially because of high capacity payments.

We need to make sure that we're building enough clean energy because we have a supply and demand problem. We need more supply of clean energy on the grid, and that's the best way to combat these rising energy prices.

Energy policies in the package, first off, include a huge investment in battery storage, which is not something that Illinois had targets around to date. This bill is going to procure three gigawatts of battery storage by 2030. And maybe you and I understand how that is a ratepayer concept and directly gets to the heart of the capacity shortfalls. But it does take some explaining to lawmakers to really understand that! Battery storage is a huge step in making sure rates don't rise any further and in having a cleaner energy grid.

It is a thousand-page bill, so I won't go through everything, I promise, but something we're really excited to shout from the rooftops is the state Integrated Resource Planning Process (IRP), which sounds kind of nerdy but is extremely important.

We're going to be the first deregulated market to have this state IRP process, so that we don't have to wait until people's bills go up to figure out what is the most cost-effective way to bring energy to the state. And we believe that is always going to be clean energy investments. Having this IRP process is going to help us reach our 100 percent clean energy future through regulatory processes.

In general, all of this is going to address a supply and demand problem. We need to build more clean energy. This bill is projected to build at least 17 GW of clean energy, more clean energy on top of our existing clean energy commitments. To bring down costs, that's just what we need. We need to build.

The estimates from the Illinois Power Agency are that in northern Illinois, folks will start saving $2/month on their bills starting in 2030, and in central and southern Illinois, that will be $10/month. That's in 2030, and it goes up from there.

Amy Rynell: If you look at the data in Illinois, in large part because of the progress we've made on clean energy in Illinois, greenhouse gas pollution from transportation is our number one source of pollution. It is the only sector that's getting worse in Illinois. Since COVID, especially, we've seen people relying on vehicular travel a lot more. And that's been hurting our communities in different ways.

When we looked at the climate impacts of transportation and the suite of policy solutions available, a cornerstone of that is public transportation. So we began working with the coalition and many others to look at what's possible. At the same time, our transit system was heading towards a fiscal cliff [a budget shortfall that could have caused service cuts and fare hikes], not unlike that of other urban areas, what they're calling “legacy transit systems.” So, we worked with many different types of stakeholders over the last three years to build a plan of action for transit.

It had a tremendous amount of input and a tremendous amount of good policy thought to it. For our state's well-being and our community's well-being, we need more transportation options that are climate-friendly and robust.

The [$1.5 billion] funding investment addresses the transit fiscal cliff, but it then makes really critical investments in the things we need to be doing to get more riders and to build the system of the future and make it more resilient. From the perspective of riders and especially people who don't drive, who can't afford a car, our youth, our seniors, households with low incomes, people with a disability, this is their transportation mode, and we have just made it exponentially better. And that keeps our city affordable. It is just tremendous what it does to folks’ pocketbooks.

How Did Illinois Pass and Fund These Policies?

Evergreen: These are huge wins, and a lot of other states are in similar situations. For others looking to follow your lead, what went on behind the scenes that you think allowed you to be successful?

Amy Rynell: It was a very robust inside game and outside game. The coalition is really strong. We had to make a lot of hard decisions together in the final days of session. We meet all the time to keep everybody abreast of the moving parts. And as a result, everyone was really bought in. People contributed in ways that I don't even have words for. It was really tremendous.

We met with our legislative champions every week for a couple of years. Because this is complex policy, we needed to be working from the same playbook, understand why decisions were being made, and help them make the case better. That's a lot of meetings and conversations to stay on the same page, moving something so complex.

Maybe the biggest win on the climate side, in addition to being able to grow and improve transit, is the way we're funding it. It’s by taking the sales tax from motor fuel purchases and directing that into transit operations. And that's just a tremendous climate shift. That will have lasting impacts in other ways and begins to recognize the impact of driving in the role that transit plays. So, we're really excited about that move and hope that other states can follow.

Kady McFadden: I think one thing our coalition did that I'm really proud of is we had teams of experts for each of those topics—everything from battery storage policy to property evaluation to siting to integrated resource planning to energy efficiency. Sure, I'm the one interfacing with the legislators in the working group, but depending on the topic, I'm bringing in amazing experts.

It also grew and diversified our movement. It wasn't only me or a couple of us in the negotiations. It was so many of us from the team, and for some of them, this was their first bill, or they were younger and newer to this policy space. It helped us grow the bench in a place that I know we're going to see results for years to come. There was also some unique lawmaker education that needed to happen. These things can be complicated, and so ensuring that we had the ramp to explain how capacity markets work to over 100 legislators is a big task. But you need to understand the basics to understand why we were proposing certain policies.

The final piece I'll say is that organized labor, especially in a blue state like Illinois, on an energy bill, is a really important stakeholder. Sometimes we agree, and sometimes we don't. I think a key piece of making that work and ensuring that we get both parties to be supporters of the bill, so that we can ultimately pass it, is to really deeply understand what their interests are and what they're trying to do.

Sometimes, it's not always what you might guess, but if you can spend enough time establishing relationships and understanding the problems and underlying interests, you can unlock a door and move forward.

It's hard to talk about these achievements without talking about the significance of our governor. Governor J.B. Pritzker, his office, and his staff are pretty directly involved in these negotiations and this policy development. It is really just tremendous to get to work in a state where you know that the governor has your back, is ready to fight for the same policies that you want to see, and is going to be on your side even if there might be more powerful special interests on the other side. Amy and I couldn't do what we do in quite the same way without having that leadership.

What Are Creative Policy Solutions Other States Can Learn From?

Evergreen: Is there a part of these bills that you’re really proud of or stand out to you that folks might not know about, or that you don’t think is getting enough attention?

Amy Rynell: There are a couple of things in there that are really important for getting at the intersection of climate and transportation. And a key piece of that is something called transit-oriented development, or enabling development around transit stations and bus hubs so more affordable housing, walkable businesses, and community amenities can be built.

We've unlocked potential across our state for development around transit that is high value and high return, so we're really excited about that. Included in that—and it’s the wonkiest thing, but it's really, really important—is that we're removing parking minimum mandates around transit stations and routes that have held developers back from being able to develop things because they have to build so much parking. It's really important to make the ripple-effect benefits of transit realized.

The other things we're doing are making our system easier to use, unifying the fares, and using one app. It's a mess. And if you come to Chicago and want to only use transit, and you need to go farther out than the city center, it gets complicated fast. And it shouldn't. So, fixing these problems is something people are really excited about.

Kady McFadden: I have a couple of small things hidden in our thousand-page bill that I'd love to quickly tell you.

Municipal utilities and co-ops have been largely excluded from our energy policy in Illinois, and that is no longer the case. They are also going to have to do their own Integrated Resource Plans that actually model out how they'd hit our clean energy goals—which is just huge. Huge swaths of the state may now be open to clean energy development. We're really excited about that.

We're going to be piloting thermal energy networks in this state, as well as a new geothermal program for homes and businesses. Residential and business geothermal has not been as big a market in Illinois, but now we're going to be prioritizing that, which I think is going to deliver savings across the state.

What Advice Do Amy and Kady Have for Advocates in Other States Eager to Follow Suit?

Evergreen: Lastly, do you have words of advice to fellow climate, clean energy, and transportation advocates to keep them hopeful in their own work?

Amy Rynell: In the words of a famous Chicagoan, an architect named Daniel Burnham, who has an imprint around our city, “Make no little plans.” You have to make a decision to go all in.

We were holding breakfast briefings three years ago, handing out cookies with bus stop signs that said “save transit.” And we ended with buttons for everyone voting yes. I love transit, and that's a three-year journey from saving something to making it great. We used a policy window to do that, but that's a long time to keep a policy window alive.

Kady McFadden: Our fight to pass CRGA was many years long. We wrote it in response to capacity market spikes in one ISO [Independent System Operator] and then ended up passing it in response to capacity market spikes in another three years later.

To my fellow activists, I would say, strap in! Some of these fights take a while, but you're building each year even when it maybe doesn't feel like it. Lawmaker education builds on itself, and then when there's a window to get it done, you can run right through it!

Evergreen: What I'm hearing is circular objects, in particular, make for very good strategy—whether that’s cookies or buttons! Thanks again for your time and insights, and congratulations again on this huge achievement!

Disclosure: Texas Oil & Gas Association has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.","The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday granted Texas permission to authorize companies to capture and store carbon dioxide underground, fulfilling a key wish for the state's oil and gas industry.

The approval comes after a two-year federal review of the Railroad Commission of Texas, the agency regulating oil and gas. The agency needed to prove it could enforce federal rules, a requirement that supporters of the effort said it could do better than the EPA. Critics have said that state regulators have a history of being too lax on the oil and gas industry.

In a statement, the Texas Oil and Gas Association, which represents the industry's political interests, lauded the approval.

""Today's approval is a watershed moment that launches the next chapter of Texas energy leadership,"" said Todd Staples, the association’s president. ""Texas is now poised to lead the world in (carbon capture and sequestration), which means more investment and more jobs for Texans.""

There are more than 60 pending applications for carbon dioxide injection wells before the EPA. The Railroad Commission is expected to review those applications.

Carbon capture and sequestration is the process of trapping carbon dioxide molecules, which contribute most to climate change. Oil companies ordinarily retrofit their field equipment, such as pipes, with technology to prevent gas leaks. The technology has been around for decades.

But in recent years, oil companies in Texas began building facilities dedicated solely to absorbing ambient carbon dioxide, known as direct air capture facilities. Inspiring this effort were generous tax credits offered under President Joe Biden, which continue under his successor, President Donald Trump.

Oil companies capturing the gas had nowhere to put it. The permit required to store it underground, known as a Class VI permit, is notoriously hard to obtain, with yearslong review periods. Advocates of the oil and gas industry said the lengthy review kept oil companies from expanding their efforts, which they say are aimed at combating climate change. Some scientists researching carbon capture and sequestration said the Permian Basin, the oil-rich desert in West Texas, has the right geology for permanently injecting carbon.

Industry observers are skeptical. State regulators, eager to take over the permitting process, could rubber-stamp permits much more quickly, said Virginia Palacios, executive director of Commission Shift, an oil and gas watchdog group. Palacios added that the commission has not set a strong example with saltwater disposal wells, built to store industry wastewater underground, some of which have ruptured through abandoned wells, sending torrents of water above ground.

""The Railroad Commission is getting this new authority that is just another form of injection in overpressured formations,"" Palacios said. ""We're looking at an agency that handles bad actor companies with kid gloves.""

In a news release, an agency commissioner said in matters of oil and gas, the state is best positioned to make decisions.

""Obtaining Class VI primacy marks an important step forward for our state's energy sector and our citizens by recognizing the Railroad Commission's unmatched expertise when it comes to matters of energy production, geological knowledge, and safety,"" said Railroad Commission of Texas Chairman Jim Wright.

I love trees, and I love electricity.• __________ Shella hosted WFYI’s “Indiana Week in Review” for 25 years and covered Indiana politics for WISH-TV for more than three decades.","I love trees. I also love electricity. Those two things sometimes come into conflict.

Let me explain.

My home is on a lot that is one-third of an acre. When I bought it, there were 10 or 11 trees in the yard. It now has 25. And I have removed several of them over the years. So, you see, I like trees and have planted a few.

I have a crab apple, several maples, a clump birch, two cherries, multiple redbuds, three dogwoods, a Japanese maple, and, well, you get it.

Some of those trees are tall enough to pose a threat to power lines. And that is where conflict comes in. My neighborhood has experienced frequent power outages prompted by storms that cause tree damage. I have endured an outage caused by trees belonging to my neighbor directly to the north and by trees belonging to my neighbor directly to the south. My trees and I have not been the cause of any outages.

Story Continues Below

However, my fear of joining that club is one reason why I spent $2,000 on a tree service this spring so that three of my tallest trees were trimmed—or, in one case, removed. See, I am the guy who complains about neighbors waiting for the power company to trim trees for them. My dad owned a small power company, and in high school and college, I worked on a tree-trimming crew at times. One day, I witnessed a fellow worker getting shocked when a branch fell on a high voltage line. I get the big picture.

Yet, as fate would have it, several weeks after I paid to have my trees trimmed, I got word that the power company had targeted several of my trees, anyway. Wright Tree Service, a contractor for electric utility AES, sent people to mark some of my trees and let me know that tree trimmers were on

the way.

They gave me a month to object, and I saw on social media that many people in this part of town were complaining both about the idea that their trees were a problem and about the quality of the work being done by the tree trimmers.

I also caught news reports that spelled out how AES blamed tree-trimming costs in part for a rate increase request that would hike the average residential electric bill by $21 a month.

I’m not going to defend that request, but I will say that when the tree trimmers showed up, they did a lot of work. Over the course of two days, they trimmed six of my trees. They took out a lot of lumber and did nothing to alter the shape of the trees. They did a lot more work in the surrounding neighborhood.

If all that means that power outages will be less frequent, I might be willing to pay more for electricity. Twenty-one dollars a month sounds high, especially after a rate increase last year, but I’m going to let the Utility Regulatory Commission figure that out. Still, for the first time in years, I get the feeling that AES is trying.

I want to be able to enjoy the blossoms, the shade and the fall leaves in my backyard. And I want to be able to watch TV when I go inside.

I love trees, and I love electricity.•

Spanish Minister for Ecological Transition Sara Aagesen has unveiled a €2 billion aid package aimed at strengthening Spain’s industrial value chain and accelerating the nation’s energy transition.

Primarily funded through the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Facility (RTRF) and partially aligned with the European Clean Industry State Aid Framework (CISAF), the program builds on PERTE ERHA, a state strategic initiative focused on renewable energy, renewable hydrogen, and storage.

The package extends implementation deadlines beyond the previous target of Aug. 31, 2026, with some measures now running to 2028, designed to improve absorption of European funds.

The program targets four strategic areas: industrial value chain development, renewable energy integration, electric mobility, and innovative thermal solutions for industrial and residential applications. According to Aagesen, the program is expected to launch before the end of the year.

In June, the ministry awarded €300 million to support 33 projects across 12 autonomous communities. The new package will add €300 million to €350 million for proposals focused on manufacturing renewable energy equipment, including photovoltaics, wind turbines, electrolyzers, and heat pumps, alongside clean industrial technologies. About €300 million to €450 million of funds will support renewable hydrogen initiatives, covering capital and operational costs, while €200 million is earmarked to modernize port infrastructure for offshore wind development.

Renewable energy integration and storage form a central pillar. The program will provide €300 v to €350 million for wind turbine repowering and hybrid projects with storage, and €100 million for pumped-storage hydroelectric plants. Innovative storage-integrated projects, including agrivoltaics, floating solar, and urban integration, will receive €150-200 million. Implementation deadlines for geothermal, marine, and biogas projects are also being extended, building on €120 million already allocated to geothermal initiatives.

Electric mobility is another priority. Moves Corredores will receive €150 million to €200 million to expand charging points along major road networks, while Moves Flotas will allocate €50 million for electrifying delivery vehicle fleets.

The program emphasizes innovative thermal solutions. Between €40 million and €75 million will support electrification of fossil fuel cogeneration plants, with a similar sum directed to district heating and cooling networks to improve energy efficiency in industrial and residential sectors.

By targeting these four areas, the ministry said it aims to advance Spain’s transition to a resilient, sustainable, and technologically advanced energy landscape, reinforcing the country’s commitment to European energy and industrial objectives.

Gaffney, South Carolina, selected for new 3.7 GW facility; expected to create over 600 new jobs

Facility expands First Solar’s US capital investment to approximately $4.5 billion

Largest American solar manufacturer expects almost 18 GW of domestic production capacity in 2027

TEMPE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) (the “Company” or “First Solar”) today announced that it will establish a new facility in Gaffney, Cherokee County, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 Plus modules initiated by the Company’s international fleet. The Company expects to spend approximately $330 million to establish the new facility, which is scheduled to commence commercial operations in the second half of 2026. The facility is forecast to create over 600 new jobs with an average manufacturing salary of $74,000 per year, approximately twice the per capita income in Cherokee County.

The South Carolina facility — which will directly support American energy dominance and affordability goals — was catalyzed by demand for domestically-produced energy technology created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Donald J. Trump in July 2025. The facility is expected to increase First Solar’s capacity to produce American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance, by 3.7 gigawatts (GW), reaching 17.7 GW of annual nameplate capacity in 2027.

“South Carolina is proud to be a destination for innovative energy companies that are powering our country with American technology,” said Governor Henry McMaster of South Carolina. “First Solar's investment will create 600 new jobs in Cherokee County, which will greatly strengthen the local economy and help advance America's energy independence. Their expanded presence in our state will provide even more opportunities for hardworking South Carolinians.”

The onshored processes will transform thin film solar cells produced by First Solar’s international fleet into fully completed modules. The new facility expands First Solar’s footprint in South Carolina, which currently includes a distribution center in Duncan, Spartanburg County, and a longstanding partnership with Inland Port Greer. The Gaffney plant will be part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one each in Alabama and Louisiana, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. Altogether, the Company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the US market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives.”

Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country’s leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company. It is the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the US. By 2027, the Company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.

Its solar manufacturing subsidiary, CSI Solar, shipped 5.1GW of modules in Q3 2025, down notably from 7.9GW in Q2 this year.
The US was the top country for CSI Solar shipments in Q3 2025, followed by China Spain, Pakistan, and South Africa.
It made no mention of these plans in the Q3 results, though the ongoing low margins in the solar manufacturing sector have continued to push a greater focus on energy storage manufacturing.
Yan Zhuang, CSI Solar president, said: “We delivered a sequentially higher share of module shipments to the profitable North American market.","The company said the sequential decrease in margin was due to the absence of profit released from the sales-type leasing of a US-based project in Q2, and the YoY increase was down to increased BESS sales, which have had a better margin than solar PV modules.

Simultaneously, earnings per share recorded a loss of US$0.58 per share, equating to a net loss attributable to Canadian Solar of US$26 million. Losses increased slightly from US$23 million (US$0.53 per share) in Q2 2025.

Net income was US$9 million in Q3, and net revenues reached US$1.5 billion, at the high end of the company’s guidance for the period but down both sequentially and YoY. Canadian Solar ended September 2025 with net cash flow of US$112 million, driven by decreases in inventory from the prior quarter. Total debt was US$6.4 billion, an increase from US$6.3 billion in Q2.

Solar sales slump, storage surges

CEO Shawn Qu said: “We are managing the business with discipline, prioritising profitability and investing strategically to ensure the resilience of our operations. I am pleased to share that our residential energy storage business is on track to become profitable in 2025.”

Canadian Solar’s lowered net revenue was due to decreased solar module sales, partially offset by increases in the battery storage sector. Its solar manufacturing subsidiary, CSI Solar, shipped 5.1GW of modules in Q3 2025, down notably from 7.9GW in Q2 this year.

Its e-Storage arm shipped a “record” 2.7GWh of BESS in Q3, above its guidance of 2.1GWh – 2.3GWh.

The US was the top country for CSI Solar shipments in Q3 2025, followed by China Spain, Pakistan, and South Africa. Qu said the firm would “continue to focus on profitable solar markets and to manage volumes in less profitable regions. In contrast, demand for energy storage remains robust, supported by healthy market fundamentals and growing applications.”

US manufacturing plans

By the end of 2026, the company expects to be producing solar cells and lithium batteries in the US. Phase one of its Indiana cell facility is expected to begin production in March 2026, and its Kentucky lithium battery factory is slated to start production in December next year. The company already operates a 5GW module production facility in Mesquite, Texas.

Back in its Q1 2025 results, CSI Solar said it was considering relocating “certain” manufacturing operations as a result of US president Donald Trump’s global tariff regime. It said it might move some operations to “low-tariff regions” in addition to leaning into its US-based manufacturing plans, given the pressure that Trump’s tariffs and other solar import restrictions have put on upstream supply components for US production.

In the company’s earnings call, Qu said Canadian Solar expected to be able to meet the Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) requirements for solar shipments to the US, which limit exposure from China-based or Chinese-backed companies.

It made no mention of these plans in the Q3 results, though the ongoing low margins in the solar manufacturing sector have continued to push a greater focus on energy storage manufacturing.

Yan Zhuang, CSI Solar president, said: “We delivered a sequentially higher share of module shipments to the profitable North American market. Our Mesquite factory, which has now successfully ramped up, contributed meaningfully to both shipment volume and profitability.”

He continued: “While our US$3.1 billion utility-scale storage backlog provides line of sight to future growth, we also continue to develop our offerings and capabilities in C&I and residential storage, segments which we expect will contribute more meaningfully to profitability next year. Looking ahead, we expect further profitability improvements, as we begin production of solar cells and lithium battery energy storage products in the US.”

In Q4, the company expects PV module shipments between 4.6GW and 4.8GW, with between 2.1GWh and 2.3GWh of BESS shipments. CSI Solar forecasts 25-30GW of module shipments for all of 2025.

Barry MacLeod, chief executive of Flotation Energy, said the tax was wiping out 1,000 oil and gas jobs a month – losing many of the workers whose skills were needed for renewable projects like floating wind farms.

Mr MacLeod’s firm is planning to construct two large floating wind farms near Scotland, with the project relying on a steady supply of skilled energy workers.

He called on Ms Reeves to “make a change” to the tax, warning it was also driving away the oil and gas companies who may one day become users of energy generated by offshore floating wind.

“There’s a huge skills capability in offshore energy already here in Scotland,” Mr MacLeod told the Energy Voice trade journal.

“If we’re going to capitalise on that and have the benefits of that, and for the transition to work, you need those jobs and those skills to be here.

“What we’re seeing at the moment is 1,000 job losses every month, so we’ve got a bit of a crisis going on.”

Floating wind farms like the ones planned by Flotation Energy will be reliant on offshore oil and gas companies for skilled workers because of their complex engineering.

The wind farms are designed to operate in water depths over 60 metres – which are too deep for “fixed-bottom” machines – and can be connected to offshore oil and gas platforms.

Mr MacLeod’s warning follows other calls to slash the headline 78pc rate of tax paid by North Sea operators.

Louise Gilmour, the GMB union’s Scotland secretary, has written to Ms Reeves urging her to cut the levy – which was placed on the industry by the last government and extended by Labour – saying that every day an oil and gas worker is out of a job is a “government failure”.

Earlier this month, Offshore Energies UK, the oil and gas trade body, also joined forces with Scottish Renewables, representing the wind industry, to call for the end or reform of the windfall tax.

The tax has already hit Flotation Energy’s planned Green Volt wind farm, which was designed to power the Buzzard offshore platform situated in the North Sea.

Its owners, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, pulled out of the project in August, warning it had been “unable to find an investible solution in the current economic climate” – a reference to the windfall tax.

Flotation Energy is thought to be looking for a new site.

There, he wrote a thesis on the then-burgeoning technology of anti-lock brakes for motorcycles and spent time researching the also then-burgeoning use of water tunnels for aerodynamic testing.

Experience

After three years writing for Cycle Canada magazine and another three working for the then oldest magazine in Canada, Canadian Automotive Trade, Booth, along with current Driving writer Brian Harper and then Toronto Star contributor Alex Law, created an automotive editorial services group that supplied road tests, news, and service bulletins to what was then called Southam newspapers.

When Southam became Postmedia with its purchase by Conrad Black and the subsequent introduction of the National Post, Booth was asked to start up the then Driver’s Edge section, which became Driving.ca when Postmedia moved into the digital age. In the past 41 years, Booth has tested well over 500 motorcycles, 1,500 passenger cars, and nearly every significant supercar of the last 30 years. His passion — and proudest achievement — is Motor Mouth, his weekly column that, after some 30 years, remains as incisive and opinionated as ever.

Personal

Booth remains an avid sports enthusiast — read: fitness freak — whose favorite activities include punching boxing bags until his hands bleed and running ski hills with as little respect for the medial meniscus as 65-year-old knees can bear. His true passion, however, remains motorcycles. If he’s not in his garage tinkering with his prized 1983 CB1100RC — or resurrecting another one — he’s riding Italy’s famed Stelvio Pass with his beloved — and much-modified — Suzuki V-Strom 1000.",https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/driving/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-Chrysler-Pacifica-Windsor-Assembly.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 11:02:37.276542

This move comes as part of President Donald Trump's directive to cut the federal budget.

Michael Ottlinger, the union president for the National Treasury Employees representing Cincinnati, expressed concern for the affected workers.

""We have many, many employees in the building right now who have families, and they're worried about how they're going to support those families,"" said Ottlinger.

Between 300 and 600 workers, primarily from the Office of Research and Development, could lose their positions. The EPA plans to relocate these workers to new offices as part of the reorganization. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin addressed the layoffs in a video on the agency's YouTube page.

""With these organizational improvements, we can assure the American people that we are dedicated to EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment,"" said Zeldin.

He noted that the agency spent over $63 billion in 2024, significantly exceeding its typical annual budget of $8 to $10 billion. The reorganization plan is expected to save taxpayers $300 million annually.

Ottlinger expressed concerns about the impact on Cincinnati's environmental projects, such as research on water, pollution, and hazardous waste.

""I don't understand how, with all this reorganization and lots of people, research in this agency will be continued,"" said Ottlinger.

In response, Ottlinger is working with employees to determine their next steps.

""The union is doing everything it can to assist employees, to preserve their livelihood, and to protect their rights in the courts because we have several legal challenges to the administration that I think are on very solid ground,"" said Ottlinger.

In addition to the potential job losses in Cincinnati, more than 1,500 positions are at risk nationwide."".",Not Available,https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.75761-15/496925161_18508310182005866_2136283115625518522_n.jpg?stp=c162.0.486.486a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_tt6&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=18de74&efg=eyJlZmdfdGFnIjoiRkVFRC5iZXN0X2ltYWdlX3VybGdlbi5DMyJ9&_nc_ohc=WunKxkfFYakQ7kNvwGVDcId&_nc_oc=AdkhDs6NAQPvcKY3tgxpQuQQqUw0olqRVYrn4gqIbKxhm3yi8DbuYtiNn5uGOfxQTTPoHXUXHJuJRfao176SdMd2&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_gid=puBNP14rQGH23lLn-1YZjA&oh=00_AfiFMPbPoZ-wa3aoDd36dRZ8NvATMbLmJ54Bixo0JggmCQ&oe=691D3D34,N,,2025-11-14 12:04:34.312523

These funds will be allocated to projects that strengthen the industrial value chain and promote the energy transition in general, with support for electric mobility, innovative renewable solutions, repowering, and energy storage, among others. Furthermore, many of the eligible projects can be implemented after August 31, 2026, the deadline for justifying the aid received under the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan (RTRP).

“With just one month to go before the fourth anniversary of the PERTE ERHA (Strategic Plan for the Renewable Energy of the Habitat), half a million actions of all kinds have been implemented, and now we are continuing this work with this new package of measures aimed at further leveraging decarbonization to boost competitiveness in four key areas: the industrial value chain, the integration of renewable solutions into the economic fabric, a renewed push for electric mobility, and innovative thermal solutions in the industrial and residential sectors. In short, this package will allow us to advance the model that has enabled us to become a benchmark for economic and environmental progress, industrial modernization, and the fight against climate change,” stated Vice President Aagesen during her address, which can be viewed here .

The new package draws on funds from the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Facility (RRF), and some of its most important lines of action fall under the European framework for state aid for clean industry (CISAF), approved last June. CISAF allows aid to be allocated until December 31, 2028—and distributed beyond that date in some cases—thus providing greater security for initiatives related to the industrial value chain.

The Commission has already approved a €700 million aid scheme under the CISAF and it is expected that other PRTR-funded but particularly complex projects, such as geothermal ones, may be implemented after the PRTR deadline of 31 August 2026.

INDUSTRIAL VALUE CHAIN

In June, €300 million was awarded for 33 value chain projects across 12 autonomous communities, focusing on photovoltaics, wind power, heat pumps, electrolyzers, and related components. New calls for proposals are now planned—one is already underway—with funding of €300 to €350 million, which will also cover the manufacture of other equipment covered by the CISAF (Spanish Association of Energy Efficiency and Manufacturing), related to energy efficiency, the electrical grid, and transformative industrial technologies, such as electric arc furnaces.

This same chapter includes a new line of funding aimed at adapting port infrastructure to develop renewable technologies such as offshore wind power, with approximately 200 million euros, the processing of which began last July.

And the promotion of renewable hydrogen will continue, for which more than €3 billion has already been allocated through numerous support programs. The new aid will provide funding for both the initial investment in projects (Capex) and hydrogen production (Opex), with a budget of €300 to €450 million.

INTEGRATION OF RENEWABLES

The first call for proposals for the repowering aid program awarded €186 million in October 2023. Now, in accordance with initiatives such as the future National Roadmap for Boosting Repowering, a second call will be launched, focused on wind power, which will also promote the hybridization of facilities with storage, with a budget of €300 to €350 million.

Likewise, there will be a second call for aid for pumped hydroelectric plants, essential for having more energy storage, with an allocation of 100 million, identical to the first call, decided in July 2024.

There will also be a new call for proposals for innovative renewables with storage, following the allocation of €148.5 million to the first round in July. The positive reception and transformative potential of agrivoltaic, floating photovoltaic, and infrastructure integration projects have led to the allocation of between €150 and €200 million.

On the other hand, a ministerial order is already being processed to allow renewable energy projects financed under the PRTR, but particularly complex ones, such as geothermal –120 million euros were awarded in February 2024–, marine energy or biogas, to extend their execution period until beyond August 2026. The order will be approved after receiving the European Commission’s confirmation that they fit within the new aid scheme established to improve the absorption of EU funds from the Recovery and Resilience Facility.

BOOST TO ELECTRIC MOBILITY

Regarding electric mobility, the package includes two calls for proposals to boost areas that require support, after the various calls for proposals of the Moves programs have had 2.735 billion available in recent years.

The first initiative focuses on installing charging points along major roads, with a new Moves Corridors program, which will receive between €150 and €200 million. The second initiative will address the consolidation of electrified delivery fleets, with a new Moves Fleets program that will receive €50 million.

THERMAL SOLUTIONS

The fourth axis of the Package includes two lines to promote the use of heat and cold, both in the industrial and residential sectors.

Thus, a new call for proposals will be launched to help fossil fuel cogeneration plants transition to electrification. The first call, awarded in December 2023, granted €46 million, and this new call proposes a budget of €40 to €75 million.

This same range of funds is planned for a new line of aid for heating and cooling networks, which received 35 million in the first call, in July 2023.",https://strategicenergy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sara-Aagesen-anuncia-un-paquete-de-impulso-a-la-transicion-energetica-de-unos-2.000-millones.png,N,,2025-11-14 12:03:59.533465

With winter approaching, it’s a good time to check how your home is holding up against the elements.

Protecting your home from cold, heat, water, or wind, can greatly increase comfort while lowering your energy bills and reducing your energy consumption. At Garfield Clean Energy (GCE), we provide home energy assessments and coordinate weatherization services, including discounted programs and rebates for income-qualifying residents.

But if you’re interested in a few quick DIY fixes, here are some tips for staying warm and saving money this winter.

Find where your home is losing energy

You probably already have a sense of where major drafts are coming into your home based on areas that you or your pets avoid as it gets cold. But smaller leaks can add up and really make a difference on moving the needle on your energy bill.

Before beginning your weatherization journey, assess where air leaks are occurring. Inspect exterior corners and locations where the foundation and siding meet. Inside, check for cracks and gaps at electrical outlets and switch plates, door and window frames, baseboards, window-mounted air conditioners, where your dryer vent passes to the wall, and vents. A good test for windows and doors is the daylight test: if you can see sunlight coming through the edges of a door or window, there are leaks that can be addressed.

While checking for drafts, also look at where your heating system is producing heat. Move furniture or window coverings out of the way to improve heat distribution.

Use the time of day to your advantage

Heating your home can make up nearly a third of your energy bill, so we suggest you take advantage of naturally occurring heat when you can get it. The sun at our higher altitude can provide significant warmth, so make sure your window coverings aren’t blocking Mother Nature. One way to save easy money is by thinking through when you need the heat at an optimal temperature. When away at work or sleeping, lower your thermostat. Smart thermostats are an easy way to optimize heating and cooling without having to think about it day-to-day. GCE is offering these for free to income-qualified residents with a home energy assessment as well.

Replace your furnace filter

Perhaps one of the most overlooked quick wins for energy efficiency is your furnace’s filter. Simply put, an old or dirty filter restricts airflow and makes your HVAC system work harder. Servicing them can also improve the air quality in your home. It’s recommended you check the status of your filter once a month. Filters typically range from under $10 to more than $50, depending on quality. And this is one DIY project almost anyone can do: turn off your furnace, take out the old filter, replace it with a new one, and turn the furnace back on.

Give your windows a makeover

Windows account for 20 to 30 percent of heat gain or loss in a home. Unfortunately, windows can cost a small fortune to replace and for renters, the options are limited. Instead, give your windows a fit check with heavier fabric curtains or blinds that can keep you and your family cozy and warm at night. Alternatively, cost-effective window insulation film can preserve the light and view from your windows 24 hours a day.

Block unwanted drafts

The Department of Energy estimates that 20% of airflow into the home comes from openings in windows, doors, and skylights . Addressing these air leaks, could result in energy savings of up to30% each year.

For smaller gaps, you can caulk gaps around windows, baseboards, or corners. If the gaps are large, hire a professional to block drafts with spray foam. Another simple DIY weatherstripping fix is adding a door sweep or draft stoppers. These attach to the bottom of your entry door to prevent drafts from coming through, with the added bonus of blocking noise and unwanted insects.

Safety should always come first when taking on major weatherization projects. The Department of Energy has a handy list of weatherstripping ideas , including the cost and advantages and disadvantages of each. ENERGY STAR also offers a DIY sealing and insulation guide to help ensure improvements are done safely.

It is not only insurance costs that are going up. Climate change is also causing higher food costs, higher construction costs, and more out-of-pocket disaster damage.

We must slow down, stop, and reverse the buildup of climate pollution in the atmosphere.

Instead, Iowa's Republican members of Congress including Ashley Hinson and Randy Feenstra voted to take away federal incentives for wind and solar in the omnibus budget bill passed earlier this year. President Trump has also canceled clean energy projects, even ones that were already under construction.

That is not only bad for the environment, it is bad for consumers and jobs. Clean renewable energy creates jobs right here in Iowa for manufacturing and installing renewable projects. Consumers save money because renewable energy projects have no fuel costs and lower operational costs.

As the Iowa scientists said about homeowners insurance, individual action only goes so far in reducing costs. We need governmental action to cut climate pollution and reduce the growing costs of climate change.

Indiana exploring how to extract rare earth elements from coal byproducts,"Leslie Bonilla Muñiz, Casey Smith",,,,,https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2025/11/14/waste-to-wealth-indiana-exploring-how-to-extract-rare-earth-elements-from-coal-byproducts/,"He directed its 13 members to help develop a coal waste-based rare earths industry.
Despite their name, the elements aren’t actually rare — they’re just typically “finely dispersed,” rarely found concentrated enough to easily extract.
“Indiana does not have traditional sources” of rare earths, Mastalerz said.
Tapping coal “Every point” of mining, processing and using coal presents “special” opportunities to recover rare earths, according to Mastalerz.
However, these materials are “low-grade,” with lower concentrations of rare earths, she repeatedly cautioned.","Indiana leaders gathered Thursday to consider how the state could mine its ample coal waste for the rare earth elements key to modern technology — in a bid to boost domestic production and break China’s dominance.

“I want all these liabilities that we’ve got to turn into resources,” Kit Turpin, director of the state’s Abandoned Mine Land Program, told the Indiana Rare Earth Recovery Council at its first meeting.

Gov. Mike Braun created the group in an April executive order. He directed its 13 members to help develop a coal waste-based rare earths industry.

The 17 metallic elements are critical to defense, health care, power generation, transportation and other industries. They’re also in widely used consumer products, like iPhones and LED lights.

Despite their name, the elements aren’t actually rare — they’re just typically “finely dispersed,” rarely found concentrated enough to easily extract.

Major deposits are found in China — the world’s leading rare earths producer — as well as Brazil, Russia, and elsewhere, said Maria Mastalerz, a research geologist for the Indiana Geological and Water Survey.

Federal estimates place the U.S. at just 1 million metric tons of reserves, compared to global reserves of about 120 million metric tons.

“Indiana does not have traditional sources” of rare earths, Mastalerz said.

But coal and its production byproducts — gob, slurry, spent substrate, acid drainage and sludge, and more — could be “unconventional” sources.

Tapping coal

“Every point” of mining, processing and using coal presents “special” opportunities to recover rare earths, according to Mastalerz.

However, these materials are “low-grade,” with lower concentrations of rare earths, she repeatedly cautioned.

That makes extraction more difficult and expensive.

Mastalerz — who specializes in coal geology, organic petrology and geochemistry — is testing ways to find rare earth “sweet spots” and “optimize” their recovery.

The materials are plentiful, though.

Turpin, whose Department of Natural Resources program rehabilitates abandoned mine lands, said Indiana has more than 1,900 sites. The program has almost $80 million worth of projects in the pipeline, but there’s an estimated $400 million worth of unfunded inventory, he said.

“The economics don’t look good” for rare earths recovery, he said, “but if you already have a problem (in abandoned mine lands) that needs addressed, maybe you can find efficiencies.”

The program tested a gob pile and found dozens of elements, including rare earths and other critical minerals, per Turpin.

“Every cubic yard of coal refuse out there contains about 10 grams of yttrium — what’s in your hand there,” Turpin said, as council members passed around a small case with chunks of lustrous metal.

“The problem with it is … you’re talking about processing a ton of this material for that 10 grams,” he told them.

The gob pile has an estimated $10 billion worth of rubidium in it, he added, but it’s stuck in 2 million yards of material.

The program must use its largely federal funding on mine land reclamation, however. Rare earths recovery has to be “incidental” — another challenge.

‘Your test state’

Federal officials called in from Washington, D.C., to praise Indiana.

“The things that you’re doing are the same things that we would like to do,” said Lanny Erdos, director of the U.S. Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement.

“We really are with you in your efforts here,” said Ned Mamula, director of the U.S. Geological Survey. “… We want to change our thinking about this. Pile of waste? No. … There’s products in there. We’ve got to find a way to get them out.”

Indiana Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources Suzanne Jaworowski thanked the pair, telling them, “Keep in mind, we’d like to be your test state — a beta — and definitely your partner here. So we’ll keep you updated on our activities.”

Braun’s order includes several directives for the council: advance a coal site cleanup program, collaborate with industry on extraction and processing technology, establish Indiana-based supply and refinery operations, and work with educational institutions to create an extraction and processing workforce program.

The group has to provide annual updates to the governor, and a final report is due before the end of 2026.

The next meeting date hasn’t yet been set. Council members suggested bringing in industry representatives, like those interested in processing rare earths out of coal waste or those who’d use the elements in their products.

Others recommended calling on more academics, since the technology might not be advanced enough for industry, and to consider recovering the elements from recycled technology.

Indiana has an estimated 57 billion tons of unmined coal but only 17 billion tons are recoverable using current technology, said Tommy Sutton, vice president of surface operations at Hallador Energy’s Sunrise Coal.

Of that recoverable amount, 88% would require underground mining and just 12% could be extracted via surface mining.

“I think we’ve got several years,” Sutton said of the industry, but companies are “competing for the same coal reserves.” He said coal companies are turning to byproducts like methane, sulphur and possibly rare earths.

“What was refuse at one point is now something you can actually use,” he told the council.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_6704-2048x1536.jpeg,N,,2025-11-14 08:59:19.270972

Earlier this year, the EPA said in a news release that cuts across the agency had already saved $748.8 million.
Reductions to federal-level environmental research make it more difficult to systematically collect and analyze national data on pollution, climate-warming gases, and air and water quality.
Taking after their model, we could form an internationally funded climate initiative that brings together NGOs, research institutes, governments, and foundations to preserve environmental research.
Whether through state-led coalitions or partnerships with nonprofit organizations, we can ensure that critical environmental research continues.","Like many communities along the East Coast, the town of Crisfield, Maryland, has a flooding problem. As the climate changes, storms are growing more intense, and rising ocean waters are increasingly pushing into low-lying areas, causing chronic flooding.

Residents have been working on plans to address the problem, and starting in 2022, they received a boost from researchers at the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Research and Development, E&E News reported.

“EPA’s research project in Crisfield identified marshes and other natural buffers that would help reduce storm surge and flood damages,” the outlet reported. “The work was critical, city officials said, as the city government has no engineer on staff and a limited budget.”

But the Trump administration halted EPA support for Crisfield and many other communities when it began eliminating the Office of Research and Development, or ORD, this summer, and launching a new environmental research arm in the Office of the Administrator. The reorganization was completed last month, an EPA spokeswoman told E&E News.

In its previous form, ORD employed more than 1,000 people and ran 10 national laboratories across the country that researched air pollution and other environmental threats. During the reorganization, many ORD scientists accepted early retirement, while others were reassigned to positions elsewhere across the agency.

Earlier this year, the EPA said in a news release that cuts across the agency had already saved $748.8 million.

However, these short-term savings come at far greater long-term costs, both financially and in terms of human health, infrastructure, and national security. Reductions to federal-level environmental research make it more difficult to systematically collect and analyze national data on pollution, climate-warming gases, and air and water quality. With fewer researchers, it becomes harder to justify or enforce regulations on major polluters. And without a robust scientific workforce, the U.S. will struggle to respond quickly and effectively to emergencies like wildfires, chemical spills, or extreme weather, putting more lives at risk.

“This is total victory for the polluters right now,” Thomas Burke, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University and former EPA science adviser, told ScienceInsider.

Solution: Establish an independent environmental science institute

One solution would be for a coalition of states, universities, and philanthropies to establish a nonpartisan scientific institution. Such a body could conduct independent climate and environmental research better insulated from political swings, and ensure that critical data and analysis remain available to protect public health and the environment.

This model is not unique. Canada’s experience shows how regional governments and independent institutions can step up when federal leadership falters. In 2012, Prime Minister Stephen Harper cut funding for the Experimental Lakes Area, a globally recognized freshwater research site. Rather than let the facility close, the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba partnered with the International Institute for Sustainable Development to take over funding and operations, keeping vital research on water pollution, climate change, and ecosystem health alive.

We may also take inspiration from an organization that was formed in response to an immunization crisis. When they realized that nearly 30 million children lacked proper vaccination in developing countries, a group of people (among them Bill Gates) decided to found the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, an internationally funded organization that researches vaccines and improves access to immunization around the world. In the past 25 years, they have helped vaccinate 1.1 billion children. Taking after their model, we could form an internationally funded climate initiative that brings together NGOs, research institutes, governments, and foundations to preserve environmental research.

Without the EPA’s research arm, we will be flying blind as we face threats from toxic hazards to rising seas. Whether through state-led coalitions or partnerships with nonprofit organizations, we can ensure that critical environmental research continues. In an era of proliferating climate threats, we have a moral obligation to preserve this scientific capacity.

Returning profit rates to those lower levels can also more than offset any increases in borrowing costs that might result from impacts to credit ratings.
State legislators can act now to align utility profit motives with performance, or at least efficient investment, and lower electricity bills in the process.","Electricity is getting more expensive — and Americans are getting worried.

Just look at last week’s election, when Democratic candidates who put a spotlight on energy affordability won key races in Virginia, New Jersey, and Georgia.

Fortunately, state and local lawmakers, including those just elected, have the authority to do something about this increasingly urgent problem. Here are three immediate steps they can take to save consumers money on their power bills.

Cut runaway utility profit rates

State regulators can lower skyrocketing electric bills practically overnight by reducing utility profit rates. Investor-owned utilities earn a guaranteed profit on every dollar they spend. State public utilities commissions set these profit rates, and right now they’re way higher than they used to be.

Former utility executive Mark Ellis estimates the average American household overpays utilities by $300 per year, because the companies extract 3 to 7 cents more on every dollar of investment than they ought to.

Utilities consistently try to scare regulators off from lowering their excessive profits, claiming service quality will decrease or costs will actually rise — but there’s little evidence that doing so will negatively impact consumers.

We know that utilities can maintain high-quality service with lower profit rates because they’ve done it before. Recent research by RMI shows that utilities still received enough capital to build new infrastructure when profits were more reasonable in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Returning profit rates to those lower levels can also more than offset any increases in borrowing costs that might result from impacts to credit ratings.

Pay utilities for performance

Lawmakers can save consumers billions by adjusting incentives to pay utilities for performance rather than construction.

Under current rules, utilities profit significantly more from building new infrastructure than from investing in energy efficiency or cheaper upgrades to existing poles and wires. Most analyses of high electricity prices find that utility spending on transmission and distribution infrastructure is a main or major culprit.

The more utilities build, the more they profit, so they build a lot. Every grid problem looks like a nail to a utility that can use a gold-plated hammer to ​“solve” it — and consumers get bent out of shape as a result.

Customers in New York saved big when, in 2013, the state directed utility Con Edison to prioritize reducing energy demand via efficiency initiatives and solar panel installations. The investment successfully put off a $1 billion substation upgrade, saving New Yorkers $500 million in profits not paid to utility shareholders on top of $800 million in avoided hardware upgrades.

We could significantly reduce electricity use with energy-efficiency investments that routinely cost less than the fossil-fuel power generation favored by most utilities.

Instead, utility grid spending has exploded in recent years, outpacing inflation and electricity sales combined, according to the Energy Information Administration. And for each dollar of capital utilities invest in infrastructure, they’ll extract as much as 50 cents back in profits from customers over the life of the pole, transformer, or equipment.

A few states have comprehensive programs requiring utilities to prioritize cost-effectiveness rather than construction, but only Hawaii has discarded the conventional wisdom connecting utility profits to spending. State legislators can act now to align utility profit motives with performance, or at least efficient investment, and lower electricity bills in the process.

Unblock local power and storage

Local solar and batteries make electricity right where people use it, and more of each saves everyone money. Models suggest that dramatically scaling up energy resources like rooftop solar and batteries, and coordinating them with tools like smart thermostats, could cut future grid costs by half a trillion dollars.

But state and local laws, and utilities’ own policies around crucial processes like connecting to the grid, are mostly written to block and slow down small-scale clean energy.

It’s up to lawmakers to enact policies that remove those barriers by, for example, simplifying and automating permitting and zoning requirements, allowing non-utility ownership of solar projects, and fairly compensating solar owners through net metering. They’ll have to overcome vehement opposition from utilities, which see these kinds of policies as endangering their profits and allocate their lobbying dollars accordingly.

Addressing affordability

Electricity prices are rising at more than twice the rate of inflation. The Trump administration’s obstruction of clean energy and commitment to fossil fuels, particularly coal, are expected to make bills climb even further. Data-center development won’t help either. Most Americans feel this trend happening, and they are concerned.

We’re all tired of paying more for electricity. We can pay less if state legislators and utility regulators seize the moment and act in the interest of consumers — rather than the shareholders of utility companies.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2213793348.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=8f3d37b267c246f05de3d80957c31199,N,,2025-11-14 12:04:21.798025

Meaningful ramp in G1_Dallas production, sales, and EBITDA expected in Q4 2025. T1 expects that module sales in the fourth quarter will exceed the total sales during the first three quarters of 2025. In Q4 2025, G1_Dallas production is expected to achieve a 4.5 GW annualized run rate, more than twice the rate averaged in the first three quarters of 2025. This increased activity underpins unchanged 2025 EBITDA guidance of $25 - $50 million.

T1 received $50 million from Encompass Capital Advisors LLC (“Encompass”). The Company entered into an Amended and Restated Stock Purchase Agreement with Encompass, and in partial consideration for the cancellation of all the outstanding shares of the Series A preferred stock, which were previously issued for $50 million, Encompass purchased (i) 21.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock, and (ii) 1.6 million shares of the Company’s Series B preferred stock through a registered direct offering. Additionally, as part of this offering, T1 received $50 million from Encompass in exchange for the issuance of the Company’s Series B-1 preferred stock. This agreement amended and restated the previous Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Encompass.

G2_Austin progressing towards expected start of construction in Q4 2025. T1’s development team and contractors have been advancing detailed design and engineering of its planned state-of-the-art U.S. solar cell fab in Rockdale, Texas. An extended 30% design package was completed in September which encompasses early procurement packages for long lead time equipment and materials, early construction packages for mobilization, civil works, and structural steel as well as design specifications for major scope areas including the cleanroom, electrical and mechanical equipment, and process equipment for utility distribution. T1 expects to achieve the 60% engineering completion milestone for the two-phase development plan in November ahead of the expected start of construction in Q4 2025. This timeline is driven by customer demand for domestic cells in order to maximize PTC realizations.

“The T1 team continued to advance our mission to build an integrated U.S. polysilicon solar supply chain in the third quarter,” commented Dan Barcelo, T1’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. “With the expected start of construction at G2_Austin and our continued progress on commercial discussions, capital formation, and policy compliance initiatives, we are positioning T1 as a domestic content leader with an expanding network of U.S. partners committed to powering America.”

Highlights of Third Quarter 2025 and Subsequent Events

Nextpower and T1 sign multi-year U.S. frame supply agreement. In October, Nextpower (NASDAQ: NXT) and T1 announced a strategic framework agreement to use Nextpower’s patented steel module frame technology for G1_Dallas modules. The agreement advances T1’s mission to establish an integrated U.S. solar supply chain and is expected to accelerate the industry’s transition away from imported aluminum frames towards made-in-the-USA frames using locally manufactured specialty steel.

T1 makes strategic investment in Talon. In October, T1 announced that the Company had entered into a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (“SAFE”) to acquire a minority equity stake in Talon PV LLC, which is developing a 4.8 GW solar cell fab in Baytown, Texas. Independent of the Talon investment, T1 is advancing its own solar cell fab, the 5 GW G2_Austin project in Rockdale, Texas. The first phase is expected to come online in the fourth quarter of 2026. Both Texas-based companies plan to utilize advanced manufacturing to produce the most globally advanced commercially available TOPCon solar cells in the U.S.

T1 advances G2_Austin development with capital formation progress. Proceeds from T1’s $72 million registered direct equity offering coupled with a $50 million registered direct convertible preferred offering have positioned T1 to move forward with plans to start construction of its G2_Austin U.S. solar cell fab in Q4 2025. The offerings closed in October, providing T1 with a meaningful portion of the capital required to finance the first 2.1 GW phase of G2_Austin, with the remainder expected to be comprised of debt and anticipated customer offtake deposits.

Business Update and Guidance

Commercial discussions for G2_Austin offtake contracts progressing. T1 is in advanced negotiations with multiple potential offtake customers for G1_Dallas modules made with G2_Austin cells for deliveries starting in 2027. The Company expects to sign at least one contract before year-end 2025, which is consistent with timelines of T1’s ongoing G2_Austin capital formation initiatives.

Maintaining 2025 EBITDA guidance range of $25 - $50 million. In Q4 2025, T1 expects a significant increase in sales related to the highest expected production year-to-date at G1_Dallas, as well as sales of module inventory to retain Section 45X credits prior to year-end policy changes. T1 expects to finish 2025 with limited finished goods inventory in advance of new supply chain regulations.

Summary of G2_Austin phased development plan and G2 Phase 1 EBITDA guidance. As mentioned in T1’s Q3 2025 preliminary earnings release on October 22nd, the company has decided to develop its planned G2_Austin U.S. PV solar cell manufacturing facility in two phases. Each phase is a standalone development with limited shared infrastructure; T1 is positioned to flex capacity to develop up to three phases potentially totaling as many as 8 GW on T1’s existing leasehold. The rationale behind the phased development approach is to match planned capacity with long-term offtake contracts, advance capital formation initiatives, and start production in Q4 2026 to address robust customer demand. Following the initial completion of detailed project engineering, the first phase of G2_Austin is expected to total 2.1 GW of annual production capacity with an estimated capital expenditure of $400 - $425 million. The estimated annual run-rate EBITDA with G1_Dallas operating at 5 GW capacity and the first 2.1 GW phase of G2_Austin fully online is $375 - $450 million. T1 expects to start G2 Phase 1 construction in Q4 2025 with planned start of production in Q4 2026.

Section 232 and U.S. policy summary. T1 supports the U.S. Commerce Department investigation under Section 232 into the use of foreign-sourced polysilicon and polysilicon derivatives. T1 Energy’s contract to purchase hyper-pure, U.S.-origin polysilicon would likely be advantaged by any potential tariffs or import restrictions that result from this case. In addition, T1 continues to advance its near-term priority of ensuring eligibility for section 45X tax credits in 2026 and beyond. The Company continues to make progress and expects to be compliant by year-end.

Offtake contract negotiation. T1 is involved in a potential dispute with one of its long-term supply offtake customers that reduced expected sales volumes in Q3 2025. The Company expects that the deferred third quarter sales volumes under this contract will be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2025. While T1 continues to negotiate with the counterparty to achieve a resolution, the Company believes it has a strong position under the contract and will evaluate all options. As a result of the potential dispute, T1 is recording a non-cash impairment to intangible assets of $53.2 million.

T1 is advancing European portfolio optimization initiatives. The Company continues to execute workstreams and discussions to generate value for shareholders from assets in the Company’s discontinued operations and will provide updates in accordance with progress.

Q3 2025 Results Overview

T1 Energy reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2025 of $140.8 million, or $0.87 per share compared to a net loss of $27.5 million, or $0.20 per share for the third quarter of 2024. Net loss from continuing operations was $127.6 million, or $0.85 per share for the third quarter of 2025 compared to $14.2 million, or $0.10 per share for the third quarter of 2024. Net loss from discontinued operations was $3.0 million, or $0.02 per share for the third quarter of 2025 compared to $13.4 million, or $0.10 per share for the third quarter of 2024.

As of September 30, 2025, T1 had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $86.7 million, of which $34.1 million was unrestricted cash. In addition, T1 has accrued $93.1 million of Section 45X credits as of September 30, 2025, that the Company expects to monetize.

The Japanese automaker first announced the plan in December 2021 to produce batteries for its hybrid and electric vehicles. Batteries from the plant are set to power hybrid versions of the Camry, Corolla Cross, RAV4 and a yet-to-be-announced all-electric three-row battery electric vehicle. The plant is producing hybrid batteries for factories in Kentucky and a Mazda Toyota joint venture in Alabama.

“Over the next five years, we are planning an additional investment of $10 billion in the US to further grow our manufacturing capabilities, bringing our total investment in this country to over $60 billion,” said Toyota Motor North America president Ted Ogawa.

Toyota’s 11th US factory, on a 1,850-acre (749-hectare) site, will be able to produce 30 GWh annually at full capacity and house 14 battery production lines for plug-in hybrids and full EVs. It will eventually employ 5,000 workers.

Last month in Japan, US President Donald Trump said Toyota planned a $10 billion investment in the United States. “Go out and buy a Toyota,” Trump said. He has been critical of Japanese and other auto imports and imposed hefty tariffs on imported vehicles.

Toyota has been one of the slowest automakers to move to full EVs but has rapidly moved to convert its best-selling vehicles to hybrids.

“We know there is no single path to progress,” Ogawa said on Wednesday. “That’s why we remain committed to our multi-pathway approach, offering fuel-efficient gas engines, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery electronics and fuel cell electronics.”

Other automakers like Volkswagen have said they will add more hybrids as the Trump administration has rescinded EV tax credits and eliminated penalties that incentivized EV sales.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at the event the administration plans to soon propose to ease fuel economy standards, saying prior rules were too aggressive.

Duffy in January signed an order to direct the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to rescind fuel economy standards issued under President Joe Biden for the 2022-2031 model years that had aimed to drastically reduce fuel use for cars and trucks.

What's changed in the bloc's emissions targets?
The hard-fought compromise is still more ambitious than the stated targets of other major economic powers like China or the US.
Lawmakers also rejected a proposal from the far-right bloc Patriots for Europe calling for the goal to be scrapped entirely.
Patriots for Europe, meanwhile, celebrated their rare involvement in proposed legislation that actually cleared the European Parliament.","Members of the European Parliament on Thursday approved plans to slightly reduce the bloc's 2040 greenhouse gas emissions targets and to alter rules aiming to make large companies address the human rights and environmental impacts of their supply chains.

While the votes passed with comfortable majorities, one was contentious as it involved the center-right EPP bloc in parliament allying with populist right-wing factions to push the changes through.

What's changed in the bloc's emissions targets?

The plan to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 90% compared to 1990 levels by 2040 now allows EU member states to outsource 5% of that target to countries outside the bloc via so-called carbon credits. These involve paying third parties for their reduction of harmful emissions rather than reducing them in-house.

Scientific advisers to the EU had said reductions of 90% without offsets were necessary to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to nominal pre-industrial levels, the non-binding global goal voiced in the Paris Agreement of 2015 that various reports now warn will soon be exceeded.

The hard-fought compromise is still more ambitious than the stated targets of other major economic powers like China or the US.

The adjusted target passed with a majority of 379 in favor, 248 against and 10 abstentions. Lawmakers also rejected a proposal from the far-right bloc Patriots for Europe calling for the goal to be scrapped entirely.

The parliament supported delaying the inclusion of fuels like natural gas and petroleum in the EU's trading system by one year until 2028, in an effort to limit increases in heating and fuel prices.

The environment ministers of the 27 member states already backed the tweaked targets last week, narrowly avoiding heading to the global COP30 climate summit currently taking place in Brazil empty handed.

What's changed in the corporate sustainability plans for big business?

Thursday's more contentious vote was on softening the provisions of the EU's environmental and human rights rules for big business.

Known as the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), and hailed as groundbreaking when first agreed, it calls on large companies to address the ""adverse human rights and environmental impacts"" of their supply chains worldwide.

Perhaps the biggest change was on the qualifying criteria. Companies will now need at least 5,000 employees, rather than 1,000, and an annual turnover of at least €1.5 billion (roughly $1.7 billion) to be subject to the directive.

The proposal also moves to do away with harmonized European penalties for those in breach, instead referring to national legislation.

Far-right backing needed for CSDDD changes

The CSDDD changes passed with a comfortable majority, 382 for and 248 against, but, contentiously, they required the support of the right-wing populist bloc known as Patriots for Europe (PfE).

This followed an impasse between more centrist and center-right groups in parliament, seeking to dilute the plans in a bid to help European industry amid pressure from US sanctions and other factors, and more center-left and environmentalist groups that wanted to retain the plans as they were.

Rene Repasi, a German MEP from the center-left Socialist & Democrats (S&D) bloc accused the center-right European People's Party, the largest bloc in parliament, of having ""torpedoed any middle-ground compromise.""

""The conservatives marched ahead with a red pen — striking away the firewall and redrawing their self-made majority together with the anti-democratic forces on the fringes,"" Repasi said after the vote.

Jorgen Warborn, an EPP lawmaker who sponsored the revisions, said the changes would bring greater ""predictability"" and boost competitiveness for companies while still keeping ""Europe's green transition on track.""

Patriots for Europe, meanwhile, celebrated their rare involvement in proposed legislation that actually cleared the European Parliament.

""A major victory for workers, farmers and industry,"" the group wrote online. ""Today, Patriots for Europe broke the old coalition's deadlock and opened the path to replace the Green Deal straitjacket with a competitiveness-driven agenda. We proved that another majority — and another policy for Europe — is possible. This is only the beginning.""

Thursday's changes still represented tougher standards than many major players had advocated. Both German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron had floated the idea of scrapping the plans altogether. Gas importers to Europe like the US and Qatar had warned that the legislation could threaten future energy imports.

The new system significantly improves the hospital’s ability to deliver uninterrupted care during hurricanes, grid disruptions and other outage emergencies.

With the addition of the Power Through service, BRG can now maintain all operations on both campuses, including emergency rooms, intensive care units, surgical suites and inpatient services, during long outages or major storms. Enchanted Rock’s natural gas-powered generators are far more dependable in emergencies than diesel systems, which are susceptible to fuel constraints when supply chains are disrupted.

Unlike traditional generators that only support limited operations in a healthcare facility, BRG’s microgrid system delivers power to the entire campus. The full-facility power provided by the system includes lifesaving equipment, HVAC systems, lighting, and chilled water plants that support essential care, allowing patients to remain comfortably in their rooms and departments fully operational during an outage. The microgrid can also provide power to the grid when needed, supporting surrounding areas and further strengthening community readiness.

Severe weather often increases demand for medical services, and the need for resilient power at hospitals is well documented. During Hurricane Ida, BRG cared for ICU patients evacuated from Port Fourchon and provided emergency care to displaced residents from across the region.

The project, which was supported by State Capital Outlay funding, was completed in partnership with Entergy Louisiana’s Power Through program and utility-grade microgrid provider Enchanted Rock.

BRG President and CEO Edgardo Tenreiro said the moment has been decades in the making.

“For more than two decades, whole-facility generators have been our goal, and for a couple of years now Baton Rouge General, the State of Louisiana and Entergy have worked together to make this a reality,” Tenreiro said. “Bringing these generators online is not just an investment in infrastructure but in peace of mind, ensuring that our team can continue delivering safe, uninterrupted care to our patients no matter the circumstances.”

Entergy Louisiana leadership said the BRG project reflects the purpose of the Power Through program.

“This project showcases the best of what we aim to do at Entergy: provide solutions that strengthen critical infrastructure and support the well-being of our communities,” said Jody Montelaro, vice president of public affairs at Entergy Louisiana.

Louisiana leaders praised the collaboration behind BRG’s new backup power system, highlighting the project as an example of innovation, reliability and resilience in action.

“This project is a great example of what can happen when public funding and private innovation work together,” said Sen. Franklin Foil of Louisiana’s 16th District. “These new generators help ensure Baton Rouge General can provide continuous care for our community no matter what storms come our way. Reliable backup power at our hospitals means safety and peace of mind for families across Baton Rouge and the region.”

Louisiana public service commissioners also applauded the collaboration.

“Baton Rouge General’s participation in Entergy’s Power Through program is a great example of innovation and reliability working hand in hand,” said Commissioner Jean-Paul Coussan of District 2. “By investing in backup power solutions, Entergy is helping critical facilities like hospitals stay prepared, protect patients and keep essential services running when our communities need them most.”

Commissioner Davante Lewis of District 3 added that the project strengthens both resilience and equity.

“Reliable energy isn’t a luxury. It’s a lifeline, especially for patients who depend on life-saving medical devices or refrigerated medication,” Lewis said. “Baton Rouge General’s Power Through project is a vital investment in both resilience and equity.”

Enchanted Rock supplied the generators that power BRG’s upgraded energy system. The two BRG sites feature 3.6 MW and 5.8 MW microgrids that provide resiliency for the two healthcare campuses. The systems, which are integrated into the existing natural gas pipeline network, can seamlessly disconnect from the grid and operate autonomously to ensure clean, continuous power.

“Reliable power means hospitals can focus on patients, not outages, and we are honored to play a part in keeping care continuous when it matters most,” said Jim Barbour, regional vice president of utilities at Enchanted Rock.

Natural gas microgrids are becoming a national model for critical facilities seeking stronger reliability without depending on diesel, and this project places BRG among the leaders in healthcare energy resilience.

With the new generators online, Baton Rouge General is better prepared than ever to deliver lifesaving care in any circumstance.

That’s because building an EV charging station is utterly unlike what DOTs usually do.
Industry veterans know that standing up an EV charging plaza is so complex that it often takes 18 months.","But when the election rolled around three years later, NEVI appeared to have accomplished little. A built-out federal network would have included thousands of charging plazas, but Biden had opened only 25 locations by the time he left office. (Buttigieg declined comment for this story. A spokesperson for Biden did not respond to a request for comment.)

Biden created the impression that federal efforts would yield swift results. But he also handed NEVI a heavy rucksack of secondary goals — like boosting union labor standards and competing with China — and let it loose into a maze of federal and state bureaucracy that drastically slowed construction.

But there’s more to it. Despite the obvious failures, NEVI is, in a sense, succeeding.

Beyond the raw number of chargers they wanted to build, Biden’s people had an overriding goal: to take the glitchy, frustrating experience of EV charging and transform it into a smooth operation that could supersize across the nation’s highways. To do that, they sought to establish a common set of rules and requirements that would spur the many actors of the charging world to coordinate so that all drivers — not just Tesla owners — could count on a charging experience that, well, works.

By that goal, NEVI is working.

Biden didn’t get to campaign on the success of shiny new chargers at highway exits. But by insisting that EV drivers get the same plug-in and payment experience regardless of where they go, his administration did lay the groundwork for the EV revolution of tomorrow — even if he won’t get credit for it.

NEVI “forced the entire industry to raise its game around reliability, redundancy and performance that will be remembered as an important legacy,” said Nick Nigro, the founder of Atlas Public Policy, which studies the EV charging network.

It’s a political failure that morphed into a policy success. This curious path holds intriguing lessons for a Democratic Party that just won a series of promising elections and is contemplating how to govern on its next turn in power.

Within the party, there’s a debate over the so-called “abundance” agenda offered by liberal journalists Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson in their much-talk-about book. Their thesis, in a nutshell, is that Democrats admirably care about all sorts of things — but that often prevents them from getting results on anything. They can’t build high-speed rail in California, for example, because they need years of environmental studies and community-impact statements. If they want to win, abundance-advocates say, Democrats need to cut the red tape and stick a shovel in the ground.

NEVI in particular became a target of the abundance crowd. On comedian Jon Stewart’s podcast, Klein bemoaned the fact that, despite billions of dollars passed for EV chargers, “by the end of the administration, they just have not happened.” For Klein, the question facing Democrats is whether they can shake off their affinity for bureaucracy and persuade the American people that they can actually get things done — and NEVI is a clear example of their failure to do so.

But it’s not quite so simple. In fact, NEVI has endured where so many other Biden policies have met their end in the Trump administration in part because of the bureaucratic arcana that made it a political loser.

On Inauguration Day, Trump announced that he would freeze NEVI, as he did with a host of programs dear to Democrats. But it turns out that Congress had written out the program in such specific detail — and had thrust it so deeply into Washington’s core spending programs — that Trump had little room to flout the legislative branch. NEVI not only survived a court challenge but was reluctantly adopted by the administration. While Trump has relaxed some of its most burdensome requirements, the core mission of constructing a federal charging network has endured, shielded by pages upon pages of Democratic legalisms and technicalities. In other words, NEVI survived because it was the wonky if ungainly child of bureaucracy that Democrats are so good at creating.

In June, I arrived at RS Automotive to meet David Moon, the Democratic majority leader of the Maryland State Assembly. He showed up in his first all-electric ride, a black Kia EV.

Moon got interested in EV policy when he took a road trip to Florida with his wife. Like so many others, he was dismayed by how many highway chargers simply didn’t work. It was, he said, “really eye opening.”

When he got back home to Maryland, he drove around to see what electric stations were available, especially in more remote areas like Western Maryland and the Eastern Shore. Within an hour’s drive from Washington, he found that most hotels, even the new ones, didn’t have a charger on site. The cities frequented by EV-driving tourists had few stations, and many were broken.

“Our state was nowhere near … the charging infrastructure to sustain the lofty policy goals we had installed elsewhere,” he told me.

Those goals are mostly about climate change, a threat that concerns many of Moon’s constituents. Cars and trucks are one of the largest sources of carbon emissions contributing to climate change, and scientists predict that, as the atmosphere warms and glaciers melt, rising sea levels will one day inundate Maryland’s Chesapeake Bay shoreline.

For a decade now, the threats of climate change have led Maryland and other liberal states to subsidize charging stations. These unglamorous plug points are a weak spot in any EV transition. Charging stations are necessary to give potential EV buyers confidence that they can energize their vehicles on the go. But since they are at first little-used and generate low revenue, it’s been hard for station builders to thrive while they wait for more customers. Governments have tried to propel charging stations across this valley of death by covering all or part of a station’s construction costs.

The biggest recipient of such aid in Maryland is the Electric Vehicle Institute (EV Institute), which operates the charging station at RS Automotive that Moon and I were about to use. Between 2015 and 2022, this home-grown Maryland EV-charging company received almost $6.3 million of aid from the Maryland Energy Administration, which runs several programs to subsidize charging stations, according to a tally by E&E News. In all, state money bankrolled more than 300 EV Institute locations. That includes $958,000 that in 2017 helped construct fast chargers at two state-owned rest stops, Maryland House and Chesapeake House, that capture the traffic on Interstate 95 — the highway backbone between New York and Washington.

Today, those chargers along I-95 are leaving drivers frustrated. On review sites, users say that EV Institute’s chargers are often down. When they do work, they provide only 50 kilowatts of power, which could take more than an hour to charge a modern EV.

“Please boot these clowns outta here and install some modern charging infrastructure, MD!” a user named Adam posted this summer on Plugshare, an EV-charger review site. On a reporter’s visit to Maryland House this summer, one of EV Institute’s six stations was broken. None allowed for payment by smartphone app, since EV Institute has no app.

This experience is common at publicly funded charging stations across the country. Most charging stations funded by government grants haven’t been required to keep up to date with new technology — or even to keep functioning.

Back at the RS Automotive site, Moon and I were having little luck. Several cars were able to charge, but not mine. I plugged one connector into my rented Ford Mustang Mach-E, and then another. Neither of them worked, and there were no attendants around to ask for help.

Moon remembered a different EV Institute charger on a curb nearby. When we pulled up, we found it covered with graffiti, a piece of paper taped to its screen that said OUT OF ORDER. Moon apologized profusely and pointed me to another EV Institute charger at Takoma Park’s city hall. I futzed with each of the cables. Each box eventually delivered the screen message CHARGING FAILED. Moon shook his head.

“It’s a wild thing, how this is so typical,” he said. “Prime locations are being occupied by non-functioning charging.”

I would have liked to ask Matthew Wade, the EV Institute’s top executive, about these problems — but he didn’t reply to interview requests. More ominously, the customer-support phone number posted at every station is now disconnected. When I interviewed Wade two years ago at RS Automotive, my notes gave one reason the stations are so glitchy: They are difficult to repair. Wade told me that when an irate customer reports a failed session, the reason isn’t obvious. The culprit could be the hardware, the software, even the credit-card reader. Technicians with the skills to rebuild a high-voltage charging station were so rare that Wade had to fly them in from California.

“It’s far more complicated than just replacing some charging,” Wade said at the time.

The mediocre sessions at EV Institute’s stations on I-95 have a stark counterpoint. Just steps away are banks of Supercharger stations run by Tesla, the country’s leading EV automaker. The Tesla network is the country’s largest and fastest growing, but it isn’t everywhere, and is closed to most non-Tesla EVs on the road today. Unlike other EV owners, Tesla drivers can easily pay for sessions using an app, and chargers deliver 150 kilowatts in ideal conditions — three times as much as EV Institute’s. Users report they are almost always working.

Electrifying the Nation

Bringing Tesla-like efficiency to the country’s EV-charging system is what Andrew Wishnia had in mind in 2021 when he wrote the rules for what turned out to be NEVI.

As a senior policy adviser to the U.S. Senate’s Environment and Public Works Committee, Wishnia drafted the climate-transportation portion of the bipartisan infrastructure law, one of Biden’s first big legislative accomplishments. Previously, he had been a climate adviser in the Obama White House, where he handled an effort to convert the nation’s 600,000-vehicle fleet to electric.

“Why can’t we do the same thing for our national highway system?” he asked.

The idea was to use federal money to form a backbone of charging stations along major highways. Chargers are proliferating in cities, where most EV drivers live, and are steadily starting to appear in more far-flung locations. But many gaps still exist on the rural stretches that make up the great American road trip. Charging providers avoid those lonely places because the customers are few.

Enter NEVI: The government would focus “on building where the private sector wouldn’t,” said Andrew Rogers, an official at the Federal Highway Administration who oversaw the program’s implementation.

That goal was concrete, easily understandable. But behind it stood a second one, harder for the public to grasp.

America’s artisanal EV charging system — calling it a ‘network’ is a stretch — had no national standards. Take Maryland as an example: EV Institute’s chargers were struggling because the company had to figure out big, systemic problems on its own. It couldn’t find repair workers because such workers barely existed, and few new recruits were on the horizon because no nationally recognized curriculum existed to train them. No payment system connected EV Institute’s chargers to other networks. Charging sessions often failed because the software and hardware that connected the car, the charger and the electric grid didn’t converse fluently; no industry-wide protocols gave them a common language.

“It was the wild, wild West,” said Loren McDonald, an independent analyst who studies the charging network. “No one was holding the industry accountable.”

Meanwhile, one part of the U.S. charging system was demonstrating the possible. Tesla’s Supercharger network was fast and reliable — but closed to non-Teslas.

The chance to tap funds from the bipartisan infrastructure law, in fact, is part of what spurred CEO Elon Musk to open Tesla chargers to others, and led to one of NEVI’s most wrenching mid-course corrections. In mid-2023, automakers stampeded to adopt Tesla’s charging standard, known as NACS, and that threw NEVI’s rules into confusion. While NEVI doesn’t require NACS, many non-Tesla EV drivers can now use Tesla’s network.

NEVI would use the lure of $5 billion from the federal government to spur other players to collectively achieve the same performance. It would bind the motley, disjointed parts of the EV ecosystem — its dozens of providers, its Frankenstein mix of hardware and software — into an interoperable whole. Operators could get billions of dollars of free money, but first, everyone would have to agree to certain rules.

Lots of rules.

‘They Were in Over Their Heads’

In Abundance, Klein and Thompson made the argument that Democrats can’t get things done because, over the decades, they have developed a knee-jerk belief that solutions lie in the elaborate machinery of government. As Thompson put it, they spend “too much time thinking about process and too little time thinking about outcomes.”

The outcome of NEVI — the part the public was supposed see — is easy enough to understand: a station every 50 miles along major highways, and no more than a mile from an offramp. They would work with any model of EV. Each location would have four dispensers, with minimum power of 150 kilowatts — three times faster than EV Institute’s stations in Maryland. In the end, America’s drivers would have an electric safety net that anyone could rely on.

But underneath that straightforward vision was a second aim that the public barely knew about: Wishnia’s ambition to remake the ramshackle system into an efficient, unified network. And that would involve a lot of process.

How would the government provide its $5 billion? The fast way would have been grants. But that risked the government creating yet another wave of orphaned and poorly maintained stations, like EV Institute’s. Instead, the infrastructure law took a different — but much slower — course.

The dollars would flow through the Federal-aid Highway Program, the big and lazy Mississippi River of federal transportation dollars. Uncle Sam bankrolls roughly a quarter of road and bridge work along 3.9 million miles of state and federal highways. The funds are doled out to state departments of transportation, which decide how to oversee the work according to their particular rules.

Wishnia said this was strategic: The feds would lend a guiding hand whilethe states got flexibility. Taxpayer dollars wouldn’t repeat the mistakes of the past. For example, Wishnia’s bill insisted that stations operate for at least five years. The vigil would be kept by state DOTs, which, after all, have kept the federal highway system running for nearly 70 years.

“We wanted EV charging infrastructure to be an integrated part of the broader transportation system,” Wishnia said. After all, this was the same funding formula that created the interstate highway system in the 1950s. He added, “It really had to go to state departments of transportation, so they had skin in the game.”

But there was a problem: State DOTs knew next to nothing about EV charging stations. The federal government would fill that gap too, by trying something never attempted in the republic’s two centuries. Every agency in the U.S. government is run by a single federal department. Congress would break that precedent by creating a new unit with two parents.

An electric vehicle is two things. One is transportation, which is a complex system. The other is electricity, which is a complex system of a very different kind — one that until recently has not provided power for millions of vehicles. So Congress created the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, or JOET. The Transportation Department would oversee the funding. The Energy Department, with its bench of experts at the national labs, would provide the electrical expertise.

But Wishnia left one rule out: a deadline for states to finish the job. And that would prove politically disastrous for the Biden administration.

‘Nobody Seemed to Understand the Timeline’

Gabe Klein, the founding executive director of JOET, remembers a meeting he had with the White House soon after he took his job in late 2022. He was worried about expectations.

“Nobody seemed to understand the timeline to build heavy infrastructure like DC fast chargers,” he told me. (Fast chargers, like those on highways, use DC, or direct current.) As for NEVI’s timeline, he told the White House, “We’re going to see sort of the pinnacle of chargers going in, we hope, 2027, ’28” — long after the end of Biden’s first term.

Klein saw that NEVI had taken something already time-consuming — the building of a fast-charging station — and baked it into an intricate bureaucratic layer cake.

The process started with the states. Knowing the amount of money they would get, they had to submit to the Federal Highway Administration a detailed annual plan

Those plans then needed federal review, which was completed in late 2022. With plans in hand, states were free to get started — or at least to start getting started. States typically plan for big projects in stages. It’s a slow process that in this case would be even slower. That’s because building an EV charging station is utterly unlike what DOTs usually do.

“We’re good at building roads, we’re good at building bridges, we’re good at maintenance and things like that,” said Lyle McMillan, a technology director with the Utah Department of Transportation, at a meeting of state officials last year in Detroit. With NEVI, he said, “We’ve been basically tasked with creating a new product, a new something, and doing it on the fly — and still meeting 2,000 different rules that are in place to do it.”

The first weird thing for state DOTs to wrap their heads around was that the stations were located not on the highway, but off it, on private land they didn’t control. No one even knew what land it would be. First the DOT or its private partners had to find a “site host” that met the feds’ strict rule of being no more than a mile from the highway — think of a restaurant or gas station. But to complicate things, these retail outlets often had no skills or interest in building or operating the charger itself. That would fall to a third entity, the charging provider.

These sites would need a startling 600 kilowatts of power to charge cars quickly — far more than what is often available on the roadside. New and stronger wires needed to be built by the electric utility — an entity that can rival a state DOT for its ponderous, bureaucratic ways.

Industry veterans know that standing up an EV charging plaza is so complex that it often takes 18 months. Even Tesla, the industry leader, can take two years. And a special circumstance made the timeline even longer: The snarled supply chains during the recovery from the pandemic meant that getting an electrical transformer, key to supplying the station’s power, could take three years.

It all would have been challenging enough without the stacks of rules that vexed McMillan of the Utah DOT.

He referred to Title 23, the 818-page regulatory bible that dictates how states can spend federal transportation dollars — and overlays with other federal rules and regulations that Congress passed in bygone eras.

For example, companies doing the work must meet minimum wage rules created in the 1930s to yank the country out of the Great Depression. Another Depression-era proviso requires contractors to audit their financial statements and post bonds to ensure their work. And don’t forget the National Environmental Policy Act, passed in the smog-filled year of 1969, that includes lengthy checklists to ensure a project causes minimum harm to land, water and air.

These rules, though burdensome, are a well-worn groove for the handful of engineering firms and general contractors that are big and deep-pocketed enough to build a highway or bridge. But none of this describes the motley scrum of companies that approached states hoping to build the NEVI charging stations. They were mostly startups with short histories and unaudited books.

The charging industry was as frustrated as McMillan and his DOT peers. In addition to navigating the regulatory mazes of Title 23, they found that every state had its own unique practices for digesting federal dollars.

“You’re starting over every time in learning a state’s procurement process,” said Andrew Dick, a business development manager at Electrify America, one of the country’s largest charging networks.

“The industry general perception is that they were in over their heads, moving too slowly, and requiring things that didn’t need to be required,” said one charging-company official granted anonymity to speak candidly about industry-related matters.

‘Do You Want Ribbons Cut or Not?’

As states and industry swam through the molasses of Title 23, they had an urgent question for the federal government: What are the details of this new and improved network you want us to build?

Those details would form a second set of slowing agents, in part because the answers wandered beyond NEVI’s infrastructure mandate and into a controversy between union labor and climate advocates. New rules would only deepen the quicksand builders needed to trudge through — until the White House realized, too late, that it hadn’t delivered the charging network that America expected.

Every federal NEVI guideline would benefit or inconvenience someone. The referee would be JOET, charged with creating a network that would be both cutting-edge and reasonable.

But JOET presented a different kind of obstacle to the quick progress Biden promised for NEVI: It was so brand-new that it barely existed. Klein, a former head of transportation departments in Chicago and Washington, wasn’t hired until almost a year after the infrastructure law passed. Dick, of Electrify America, described JOET’s ascent as “building the plane as you fly it.”

Bureaucratic infighting was inevitable. JOET and its experts sat in the Department of Energy. But the states’ marching orders came from the Federal Highway Administration, part of the Department of Transportation. State officials interviewed for this story gave JOET high marks for its expertise but said FHWA’s management of charging-station dollars was slow and inconsistent.

By early 2023, JOET had its final rules ready. In a 35,000-word document, it explained how software and hardware systems would interoperate, harmonized pricing and payment systems, and set standards for cybersecurity and reliability.

By early 2023, a year and a half after the bill was passed, the NEVI program had become a maelstrom of process, with little in the way of outcomes. The 2024 election was heating up, and officials had only a handful of EV-station openings to celebrate.

Jonathan Levy, the former chief commercial officer at EVgo, a provider of charging stations, remembers going to the White House to meet with Biden’s infrastructure team and asking, “Do you want ribbons cut or not? Because at the pace you’re going, nothing is going to get cut.”

It was a deficiency that Klein, at the Joint Office, knew too well. He was getting an earful from states and industry about how hard it was to meet the labyrinth challenges of Title 23.

“We were constantly kicking everybody in the ass, escalating things to the secretaries and deputies at the White House,” he said. “We were sounding alarms that things weren’t going well.”

‘A Vast Administrative Failure’

In late 2023, POLITICO was the first media outlet to note that NEVI had not opened a single charging station. Other media picked up on the story, and by June, Trump started putting criticism of NEVI into rotation at his rallies, suggesting that the program’s slow pace called Biden’s competence into question. It also boiled up in Congress, where Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), a Biden ally, labeled NEVI a “vast administrative failure.”

The White House at last realized it had a crisis in the making. Administration officials started hitting the phones, pleading for speed.

“Because it was in the press so often, it had higher visibility, so we were pushing our cabinet members and governors pretty hard,” said Samantha Silverberg, a top Biden infrastructure adviser.

States’ progress on NEVI did not follow a neat red-blue divide. Ohio, a Republican-led state, was the fastest to open stations, as the administration of Gov. Mike DeWine (R) made it a high priority. Other red states moved slowly, if at all: Wyoming flatly refused to build stations in its big empty spaces, while Florida’s governor, then-presidential candidate Ron DeSantis (R), proudly did nothing with the NEVI money. His transportation secretary, Jared Perdue, said that Biden’s EV plans “politicize the nation’s transportation infrastructure.”

The deep-blue states of Washington state and Oregon were standing still, and other blue states were slogging. But the White House had little leverage. As it turns out, handing decision-making power to the states to get their buy-in had a downside. “The control is almost entirely in the hands of the states,” said Silverberg, and they “were not under the gun to spend that money quickly.”

The White House did prod Maryland, which like most states didn’t open a single NEVI station during Biden’s term. Joe McAndrew, the state’s assistant Transportation secretary, said the state barely budged on the program under former Republican Gov. Larry Hogan. The governor’s attitude on NEVI, McAndrew said, was, “if we never spend the dollars, can we just give it back?” (Hogan said through a spokesperson that his administration worked hard to get the infrastructure law passed and “followed all procedures in the law.”) Under Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat who took office in 2023, NEVI plans started moving.

When Washington asked for speed, however, even Maryland had to shrug. It was wending through the many rules that slow down any federal transportation project, like approvals through the National Environmental Protection Act. To name one example, Maryland had to demonstrate that its stations’ lights, meant for user safety, didn’t shine into any nearby forests.

“We unfortunately were not in position,” McAndrew said, “that we could accelerate to meet any type of November schedule.”

Trump Takes Over

Last summer, nine months after defeating Biden in the presidential election and six months after freezing the NEVI program, the Trump administration did something rare: It relented, re-opening the funding spigots and reluctantly making the program its own, while relaxing some of the Biden-era rules.

“While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently,” said Sean Duffy, Trump’s Transportation secretary.

Duffy threw out the Biden administration’s 35,000 words of NEVI guidance and replaced them with a brief, 2,500-word document “to allow states to actually build EV chargers.” Gone was the dictum to build stations every 50 miles. States, not the feds, would declare when their charging network is finished. Money could be used to charge not just cars, but big trucks, too.

Some EV advocates who typically criticized the Trump administration found themselves praising it. They were relieved, not just that the administration’s long NEVI freeze was over, but that a looser regime could get NEVI moving. “We appreciate the Department’s efforts to streamline the program,” said the Electrification Coalition, a nonprofit that promotes EVs.

Even Wishnia, the author of NEVI, said he approved of Trump relaxing some of the voluminous guidance that the Biden administration had written.

“We’re now in a position where we can give states more latitude,” he said.

Success at Last

After a torturous birth under Biden and a near-death experience under Trump, NEVI is starting to hit its stride.

State departments of transportation have wrapped their heads around charging infrastructure; money is flowing, and stations are under construction. Analysts expect that thousands of NEVI-funded chargers may be online, as JOET director Klein predicted, by 2027 or 2028. In Maryland, DOT officials say the first wave of 22 stations will be online by this time next year.

NEVI runs out of funding next year, and it’s unknown if the next big transportation bill will include money for EV charging. But whether it does or not, NEVI’s less publicized goal — that of spurring a well-functioning charging system with common standards — is becoming a commercial reality.

In Maryland, at least four large charging plazas are under construction near highways. None rely on federal aid. The scale of new, privately funded stations makes NEVI’s footprint seem quaint. They have more ports and refill batteries faster. Stations are being used more frequently, and reliability is improving. An October study by Paren, an EV-charging consultancy, projected that the U.S. will open almost 17,000 fast-charging ports this year.

“They’re not waiting for NEVI,” said Lanny Hartmann, a charging advocate in Maryland. “They’re just going to build them.”

Despite their initial resistance to NEVI’s rules, some industry leaders now credit it for bringing them together.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fce%2F0b%2Fe53982da491d9ead51c05cfd122d%2Fmag-ferris-evwins-override.png,N,,2025-11-14 06:59:15.858394

Thirteen community members attended the meeting to discuss emerging opportunities for student engagement and workforce development.

School administrators across the county have actively promoted the upcoming Youth Business Showcase, scheduled for Nov. 22, encouraging student participation and entrepreneurial engagement. Seven youth businesses are currently registered to attend and present. The showcase offers a platform for students to share business ideas, demonstrate innovation, and connect with local professionals.

Additionally, the county schools are ramping up efforts to connect students with career exploration tools and real-world experiences, thanks to a coordinated push involving the YouScience aptitude data, and regional partnerships.

To support individualized career pathways, schools are using the data to help students identify strengths, aptitudes, and potential career matches. These insights are guiding conversations around course selection, post-secondary planning, and career readiness.

Missy McClurg, superintendent at the Western Buckeye Educational Service Center (ESC), is facilitating outreach to all three county school districts — Paulding, Antwerp, and Wayne Trace — ensuring administrators are informed and supported in trialing and implementing these initiatives.

Paulding School reported grades 7-12 are set to host a career exploration event next week, bringing together students and local employers. In addition, the after-school welding cohort, which was not offered last year, is coming back to Paulding High School following the holidays.

Participating students will receive certificates of completion in blueprint reading, basic welding, and yellow belt safety training.

Antwerp Junior High School is planning a similar event in February for middle school students.

This first-time opportunity will also allow students to interact with businesses from around the region.

Wayne Trace Local School continues to analyze how the new STEAM Center will be developed there, whether that will be implemented into the current building, or if there will be additional space built to house the tools used in the programming. Students participating in the STEAM program will be presenting at the Paulding County Business & Industry Recognition Banquet on Nov. 18.

All three county schools participated in the “Build Your Future” event held in Van Wert. Vantage Career Center program directors and students, along with regional businesses, offered hands-on skill opportunities for students to attempt in health care, safety, electricity, HVAC, welding, drywall, heavy equipment, masonry and other programs. Partnered with Paulding and Van Wert Economic Development offices, the scheduling and improvements are already being determined for the 2026 event.

Michael Burkholder, workforce specialist with the office of Ohio Workforce Development, shared information on Ohio TechCred, a state program that reimburses employers for upskilling their workforce through short-term, technology-focused credentials. Schools were encouraged to explore how TechCred tools can benefit teachers and administrative staff, further aligning education with evolving workforce needs.

Rhodes State and Northwest State Colleges were on hand to share updates in regard to their respective colleges for both high school student and adult learners.

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

The Japanese automaker also confirmed an additional $10 billion investment over the next five years, taking its total commitment in the United States to more than $60 billion.

The facility, Toyota’s eleventh in the country, spans 1,850 acres and will eventually employ 5,000 people. At full capacity, it will produce 30 gigawatt-hours of batteries annually, supporting hybrid versions of the Camry, RAV4, and Corolla Cross, as well as an upcoming all-electric, three-row SUV.

The approach, he said, allows the automaker to stay flexible as consumer demand and policy incentives for electric vehicles fluctuate.

Toyota’s renewed push comes as the broader EV market faces slower growth and regulatory uncertainty. With the rollback of U.S. fuel-economy standards and the removal of several EV tax incentives, hybrids have regained favor among buyers.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on Monday that most of the Department of Energy’s loan program funding will be directed toward nuclear power projects — part of a broader effort to meet growing electricity demands and drive down energy costs.

President Donald Trump, who campaigned on expanding U.S. energy production, has made nuclear a centerpiece of his “all-of-the-above” energy strategy. “We will embrace all forms of energy, including nuclear,” the president said earlier this year. “Nuclear’s a great energy.”

In May, Trump signed an executive order calling on the U.S. to break ground on 10 new large-scale nuclear reactors by 2030 — the first such expansion effort in decades. Currently, the United States operates 94 nuclear reactors, which provide roughly 19 percent of the country’s electricity, a share that has remained steady since the 1980s.

Wright said the administration is now reviewing potential reactor sites, with announcements expected in the coming months. “We’re looking at locations very carefully,” he said.

Last month, the administration finalized an $80 billion agreement with Westinghouse to build new reactors as part of that expansion.

Wright said the biggest challenges ahead are logistical.

“We have President Trump all in. We’re reforming the regulatory regime. We have lots of private capital and government capital to match it,” Wright said. “The problem right now is just execution — having enough workers and supply chain capacity to build these plants as quickly as we’d like.”

When you’re one of the biggest polluters, you have a vested interest in how pollution is counted. That is why ExxonMobil has joined an industry effort to create a new carbon-accounting system, which it claims could enable more accurate calculations of emissions-intensity at a product level. Climate advocates say it’s yet another delay tactic.

But Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods says it’s not. “If you want to eliminate all the emissions, you damn well better be able to account for all of them,” he said in an interview for the Zero podcast, speaking last week from the sidelines of preliminary events tied to the COP30 climate summit in Brazil. It’s his third consecutive trip linked to the United Nations-sponsored global climate meeting, and he’s putting the oil and gas giant’s weight behind what he thinks is a necessary climate solution.

“I’m a big believer,” Woods said, “that 20% of products or services are causing 80% of the emissions. Let’s start by focusing on those.” The new accounting mechanism is a “critical first step” that would shift responsibility onto the person or business who burns a fuel such as gasoline, rather than the company that produces it.

Exxon’s willingness to engage in ideas to reduce emissions is a departure from its historical stance, which has included advertorials sowing doubt about climate science that ran in the 1980s and 1990s. Under Woods, the company has been trying to change its image and is investing billions of dollars in low-carbon technologies. That process continues, albeit a little slowly, even as US President Donald Trump’s all-out attack on renewables and promotion of fossil fuels has made some question the transition to clean energy.

While Woods praised Trump for changing the “paradigms” of the energy transition, he insisted Exxon still has a role to play in lowering emissions. “We need a broader aperture. That set of solutions is more focused on the opportunity to address the real challenge here, which is emissions,” he said in São Paulo the week before climate diplomats and tens of thousands of participants arrived in the rainforest city of Belém for COP30.

Exxon, along with its allies in the Middle East and now the White House, is increasingly trying to redefine the energy transition to include a long-term future for oil and gas and a market-led approach to low carbon. Under political pressure from the US, the world’s foremost energy forecaster, the Paris-based International Energy Agency has re-introduced a scenario that assumes a slower roll out of clean-energy technologies and thus rising demand for fossil fuels for decades to come. That’s a radically different world than what happens if governments adopt the policies they’ve stated in their climate plans under the Paris Agreement — a world where oil and gas consumption would peak around 2030.

Most of Woods’ CEO peers in the oil and gas industry have stopped making the annual trip to climate summits, but Woods has become a veteran by now after trips COP28 in Dubai and COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan. It raises the question of what he wants to accomplish by engaging the climate world.

As the poster-child of climate obstruction for nearly two decades, Exxon lost a high-profile activist campaign at the height of the environmental, social and governance movement in 2021. Woods, who was forced to replace a quarter of his board after the proxy battle, now engages willingly in climate debates to elevate his views, even if that means facing a skeptical, even hostile audience. The company plans to invest $30 billion in low-carbon technologies through 2030 but with a focus on businesses like carbon capture and hydrogen that can sit alongside fossil fuels rather than replace them.

Exxon’s record profits in 2022, less than a year after the acrimonious proxy battle, only hardened his resolve to defend fossil fuels not only in today’s energy system but for decades into the future. Woods insists Exxon can help to cut emissions but only if it can do so by reducing the carbon intensity of the overall energy system while continuing to grow oil and gas production.

Criticizing ideologues “on both sides,” Woods said he wants a clean break from government-led accords that mandate emissions reductions by banning or restricting fossil fuels, which are responsible for most human-made global warming. That position can be seen as self-serving — Exxon is developing enormous new sources of offshore oil in Guyana, whose production will continue for decades — but it’s also influential. The Texas-based company’s vision of the future now has loud supporters in the White House, who are attempting to pin the blame for rising energy costs on low-carbon power in an effort to erode a long-held global consensus on climate action.

The battle is likely to become increasingly fraught during Trump’s remaining three years in office as the price at the plug replaces the price at the pump as a growing pain point in household budgets. “You see even in Europe that the cost of energy has gotten so high that they’re stepping back and rethinking what needs to happen in order to achieve their emissions reductions while continuing to provide affordable energy and reliably available energy,” Woods said.

Many at COP, who supported climate action when Exxon was against it, have reasons to be skeptical of the company now. Apart from activities to sow doubt about climate science, Exxon was also an outspoken critic of the Kyoto protocol in the late 1990s and the cap-and-trade effort to reduce emissions a decade later.

And today, there’s an increasing likelihood that Exxon’s recent low-carbon efforts may fall short. Woods plans to “pace” his low-carbon hydrogen project in Baytown, Texas, that was announced with much fanfare two years ago under former US President Joe Biden. Analysts are speculating that the company may even reduce its spending plans on green energy at its annual investor day next month.

Woods said the project is being held back by a lack of customer demand rather than Trump’s shortening of subsidies for hydrogen. “One of the big challenges there is customers buying the product,” he said.

Exxon thinks the solution is an accounting system that can be used to sell products of lower carbon intensity. But climate science is clear that lowering the amount of carbon emitted per unit, rather than the absolute volume of emissions, won’t achieve reductions quickly enough to arrest global warming. A dramatic phase-down of fossil fuels, and substitution for renewable energy, is needed to avoid catastrophic climate impacts.

Carbon Measures, the new carbon accounting system Exxon is backing alongside BlackRock Inc.’s Global Infrastructure Partners and chemicals giant BASF SE and Banco Santander SA, aims to provide more accurate assessments of direct emissions. That category includes all energy used across a company’s assets. The methodology would do away with indirect emissions, known in the current measurement system as Scope 3, which include those that come from customers using a company’s products. It’s a big change when one of your major products is fuel burned inside automobiles.

The main goal is to avoid double-counting of emissions, which is baked into the current corporate carbon accounting system called the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. While Woods says customers’ emissions are not Exxon’s responsibility, the backers of GHG Protocol say double-counting is a feature not a bug. When multiple entities take responsibility for the same emissions, there’s a greater chance of them working together to cut those emissions.

“When Exxon is out front pushing for ‘better’ disclosure, we should honestly reflect,” said Lisa Sachs, director of the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment. “We know exactly where emissions come from and, in fact, Exxon has been the single largest investor-owned emitter in the world.”

The other issue with Carbon Measures is that reaching accurate product-level emissions would need all players in the supply chain of production to report emissions. That could take years or even decades. The GHG Protocol is nearly 25 years old and already counts more than 20,000 companies reporting under its guidance.

Woods wants Exxon to play a role in the climate fight regardless. “There’s something that needs to be done in this space,” Woods said. “We have a role to play and can contribute and we will work with whatever administration comes in and continue to drive an agenda that we think makes sense that doesn’t compromise economic growth or people’s standards of living.”

Welcome to Zero, I’m Akshat Rathi. Today: Exxon at COP30

It’s been a year of bad news for climate policies. The biggest force has been Donald Trump, who, in his second term as US president, has systematically dismantled climate action at home and made concerted efforts to attack climate initiatives abroad. He has championed fossil fuels, and single-handedly slowed down the energy transition… at least in the US.

Trump’s actions have given license to many to ignore and deny climate change. But the CEO of ExxonMobil Darren Woods isn’t quite following suit.

Darren’s peers, the CEOs of other international oil companies, have stopped coming to COP climate summits. But Darren came to a side event at COP30 – his third COP in a row.

For context, Exxon is one of the world’s largest oil and gas companies. And Darren is in charge of overseeing its operations, and what areas of the energy transition the company pursues, or ignores.

Last year at COP29 in Baku, I got a chance to ask him questions about how Exxon – which has a long history of sowing doubt about climate science – can be trusted to now be acting in good faith to tackle climate change.

I quizzed him on Exxon’s lobbying efforts and on the oil industry’s favorite climate solution: carbon capture. I also talked to him about the millions of dollars Exxon spent advertising algae biofuels, without ever scaling up the technology for commercial use.

If you haven’t listened, I recommend you do, and we’ll link the episode in the show notes. Because this year I wanted to ask him different questions, and follow up on some of the questions I had last year.

Why is Exxon backing a new carbon accounting idea, which many climate advocates worry is yet another delay tactic? What is his plan now that many of the tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act for low-carbon solutions have been gutted? And how is he planning to deal with the tactics that Trump is using to go after businesses… that could be weaponized against his industry by a future administration?

As you will hear, it was a good conversation with a healthy amount of disagreement. These are the kinds of conversations I’d like to see happen more often, where we aren’t questioning the accepted science of climate change, but debating the ways in which we should act quickly.

Akshat Rathi 2:50

Welcome back to Zero, Darren.

Darren Woods 2:52

It’s good to be back.

Akshat Rathi 2:54

So I know your schedule is always very tight, but you are in Brazil. Have you ever been to the Amazon before? Have you been to a rainforest before?

Darren Woods 3:00

I’ve been to a rainforest before, but not the Amazon.

Akshat Rathi 3:02

Maybe next time.

Darren Woods 3:03

Maybe next time. Yeah, I’d like that.

Akshat Rathi 3:07

So it’s been a year since Donald Trump’s election. He’s been in office for 10 months, and there’s been a radical shift in policies, obviously, in the US, away from climate action and in favor of fossil fuels. What changes have you liked?

Darren Woods 3:23

Well, I think to me, what I focus on is the dialog that’s occurring and the fact that there’s a debate, and I’d say a challenge to some of the paradigms that have been established as to how best to accomplish this objective. If you think about the whole effort in this space, it’s been defined, frankly, by a set of solutions that have been proposed by a lot of ideologues, primarily on the left, that this is the way we’re going to solve the problem with this set of solutions. And I think unfortunately, the problem and the challenge of climate change has then been defined by this solution set in either you’re for these solutions or against them. And I think what we need to do is focus less on the proposed solutions. Some of them are valid and have merit, and they’re necessary, but they’re not sufficient. We need a broader aperture. And so less focus on that set of solutions, more focused on the opportunity to address the real challenge here, which is emissions. And so I actually like the fact there’s a debate going on, both sides of the argument. And I think generally speaking, when you have people debating about how best to achieve an outcome or to balance one challenge or issue with the other challenges and issues, that’s an important dialog and debate to have. And I feel more of that’s happening today in the US than in the past.

Akshat Rathi 4:41

Well, there are ideologues on the left, but there are ideologues on the right too.

Darren Woods 4:45

Ideologues on both sides, absolutely, yeah.

Akshat Rathi 4:48

Many of the things that have happened under the Trump administration are things that the oil and gas industry as a whole doesn’t like. The API (American Petroleum Institute) came out in support of keeping the greenhouse gas reporting, which the EPA wants to get rid of, for example. But you told me last year that you liked a lot of what was there in the Inflation Reduction Act, and obviously under the Trump administration, that’s been gutted. Almost all of the incentives that were there are gone. Does that change your thesis on the investments that you were looking forward to making in all sorts of low carbon solutions, like carbon capture, like hydrogen?

Darren Woods 5:22

So I think what we talked about last year, what we’ve been very focused on, is how can we contribute to the challenge of emissions and reducing emissions based on our capabilities and our core competitive advantages. And that’s very much focused on the molecule side of the equation: So carbon capture and storage, low-carbon or virtually carbon-free hydrogen, biofuels. We ended up moving into lithium based on our ability to process produced water, brine water. All those frankly, if you look at the changes the Trump administration has made to the IRA, have not reduced the incentives for those. But I will tell you that as you look at those different areas that were focused on, we always said that our investment in this space was a function of good policy, policy that incentivizes that in the short term, but very importantly, for markets developing and for there to be a customer demand. Because ultimately, any of these policies, to be successful, are going to have to evolve into market driven forces. Government can’t afford to subsidize these solutions in perpetuity, and so markets have to develop, and technology needs to evolve so that we can get the cost down. Because today, in some of these areas, the costs are too high for the long term. And so those three things have to happen. They have to improve. And we’re going to pace the investments associated with what we see in the development there. Frankly, with our largest project, the Baytown blue hydrogen project, one of the big challenges there is customers buying the product, and so we are potentially going to pace that based on our ability to sign customers up, much less a policy issue in that case.

Akshat Rathi 6:54

But you started by saying, in terms of getting climate solutions, or solutions that would reduce emissions, being technology neutral, the starting point, having policies, is helpful. In the US, you get the swing to the left and to the right. How much does that worry you?

Darren Woods 7:11

Well, your point about there being ideologues on either side of the aisle, I definitely agree with that. That’s why we shouldn’t be trying to solve this problem through ideology. I mean, ideology only takes you so far, and then you hit the reality of the real world, you know the practical constraints and how you manage through those. And I think from our perspective, we’re trying to keep a very clear view on what is the problem statement, which is trying to find ways to productively reduce emissions that don’t slow economic growth, that don’t impact people’s standards of living. Find ways to do that based on what we’re good at, and achieve both. We refer to it as the ‘and equation’, and we’re absolutely convinced that we can do that. And that dialogue that I have and the work that we’re doing is consistent, whether it’s a left administration or a right administration, or whether it’s an ideologue or somebody who’s center, the foundational fundamentals of how we address this issue over time do not change with political cycles or who gets elected.

Akshat Rathi 8:06

You told me last year that, given the scale of the energy transition, no single president in any country can do much to derail or to accelerate the energy transition. Do you still feel the same, given how effective Trump has been at stifling clean energy projects? This is not just clean hydrogen projects, but also carbon capture projects, obviously, lots and lots of offshore wind projects that were canceled. Are you still of the same view that one president cannot shift the pace of the energy transition?

Darren Woods 8:42

What I would say is: the energy industry, the basis on which we make decisions, the timeframe that those decisions play themselves out, and the duration of those investments exceed any political cycle. So my point is that we have to look beyond the political cycle in terms of making these decisions. I think one of the things the Trump administration is challenging is a parameter that, frankly, has not been given the attention it needs, which is the affordability of these things. And you know, is it a productive use of money? The challenge today is there’s not a policy maker around that can tell you what is the cost for the benefit of a ton of carbon removed. And every government has its constraints and limits. Every organization has its constraints. We don’t have unlimited budgets. And so I think every government around the world should be focused on, how do you get the biggest bang for the buck? How do I remove the most emissions for the least spend? You can’t do that today because we have no carbon accounting mechanism, no mechanism to understand the benefits of the policy. So as a result, we get very expensive solution sets that, frankly, aren’t sustainable. And so I think stepping back and trying to understand what are the economics, the underlying cost and the affordability of some of these solutions, is a critical part to laying the right foundation for the future. And I think challenging that today to try to get to better solutions is appropriate.

Akshat Rathi 10:06

Specifically, though, how do you feel about Trump canceling offshore wind permits? Projects that were fully permitted, some were under construction. There’s a risk another president comes in, who’s left leaning, who’s for clean energy, and uses the kind of policy and weaponizes it against oil and gas projects.

Darren Woods 10:29

Well, we’ve certainly seen that with Biden. He came in and canceled the pipeline coming from Canada. So you’re absolutely right. That challenge sits on both sides of the aisle. And I think, frankly, for businesses to be successful, particularly businesses like ours that invest very large sums of money over a very long horizon, you need stability. You need predictability. And so I think that’s one of the challenges that we have today with permitting, is the way it can be challenged, the way it can be changed, challenged through the legal system. And so I think a reform in that whole area is very appropriately focused. As you advance these things, you advance projects, you get the permit, you have to have confidence that those permits are going to continue to exist and allow you to make those investments. I think that’s critical for every industry, every business and for every government.

Akshat Rathi 11:12

You had also told me last year that if the energy transition provides opportunities outside the US, you will pursue those in the US. It’s pretty clear the energy transition is going to slow down. It’s not going to stop. We know that electric car sales are going to rise, just not as much as was predicted. Solar and wind projects will get deployed, but if you look outside the US, even there, the Trump administration is having an impact. So one thing that Exxon has long supported is carbon pricing. Ideally, you would want a global carbon price that would be a level playing field for everybody. We were about to get that. The politics have been very difficult around carbon pricing, but at the International Maritime Organization, there was a vote to have a global carbon tax on shipping. Were you supportive of the net zero framework there?

Darren Woods 12:01

So just to the first point that you made around things have slowed down, if you actually look at what the Trump administration did with the bill and legislation, incentives for carbon capture and storage remain. In fact, they increased them for enhanced oil recovery. And so there is a scenario that says more carbon is captured and sequestered through enhanced oil recovery as well as sequestration under the Trump administration, because the incentive for that has gone up. And for low-carbon hydrogen, the incentive remains there, it’s just a shorter time horizon. So I don’t think you can jump immediately to ‘there’s going to be less investments made in low carbon.’ I think it’ll be a question of where that low carbon sits. So keep an open mind with respect to where the opportunities present themselves. It’s not as, I think, black and white as you point out.

Akshat Rathi 12:41

On carbon capture, specifically, the environmental protection agency wants to get rid of the greenhouse gas reporting at the asset level, which is crucial to get your 45Q tax credit that would enable carbon capture projects to go forward. Doesn’t that change your investment thesis if you’re not able to tap into the 45Q tax credit, even if it’s available to you, because you can’t do the carbon accounting?

Darren Woods 13:03

Yeah, I think that’s right, but I think also the Trump administration is supportive of 45Q. And so I think the question is: what mechanism gets put in place to allow that to happen? And that story hasn’t been written yet, but we’re very actively involved in terms of, how can we do this. We were supportive of continuing to report emissions. We think it’s important that that happens, and so we’ve got to find an alternative, if not that, to ensure that we can report on those emissions. So yeah, that is critical.

Akshat Rathi 13:30

And on the energy transition slowing down, this is not my analysis. This is analysis done by different groups, Rhodium Group, BloombergNEF. It’s more to do with the speed at which low carbon stuff will get deployed. And so emissions reductions, which is what matters, which is what you know, a lot of the low carbon work that you do is aimed at is going to slow down as a result of the policies that have been brought in. So maybe carbon capture doesn’t get affected, because 45Q will be sorted out, but so many solar and wind projects have been canceled. So the energy transition does slow down in the US.

Darren Woods 14:02

I think it slows down in Europe as well. I think actually what you see happening around the world is that the incentives that people have put in place, and frankly, some of the impractical aspects of the policy that have been put in place and have been rolling out, is starting to manifest itself. And so you see, even in Europe, that the cost of energy has gotten so high that they’re stepping back and rethinking what needs to happen in order to achieve their emissions reductions while continuing to provide affordable energy and reliably available energy. So there’s a broader recognition that’s needed that these solution sets that are out there today have their limits. And to blindly follow those and to assume that that is the only solution, and not step back and think more broadly about what else can be done to address the issue, is going to slow it down. Everywhere in the world, the practical aspects of the problems associated with some of the solutions being proposed, the deeper you penetrate it, the more manifest those become. That’s going to slow things down.

Akshat Rathi 15:01

But one of those was having a global carbon price, at least on shipping, which the International Maritime Organization and the countries in it were going to vote for. Were you supportive of that?

Darren Woods 15:12

Yeah, actually, as a concept having a price on carbon, we’ve always thought that a global price on carbon is an effective way to control emissions. To the extent that governments around the world want to control those emissions, I think with climate change in particular, as you think back, governments are put in place, are elected, to represent their people, and so that’s what you see happening around the world. I don’t have a perspective on what government should or shouldn’t be doing, their obligation is to their people. What I focus on is not the what, but the how best to achieve it.

Akshat Rathi 15:43

But as part of the industry, which is not just you, ExxonMobil, but you support a lot of lobbying organizations that speak the voice of the industry as a whole, was the industry supportive of the carbon tax on shipping, because…

Darren Woods 15:56

We were not advocating against it.

Akshat Rathi 16:01

What we saw was an extraordinary attempt by the US administration. This is, again, not my words, but we’ve spoken to lots of diplomats who were there in the room who said that those activities were extraordinary, that there were not just threats made at the country level, which were public and were published on the White House website, but also personal threats, visa restrictions or individual sanctions, which caused many of them to then really rethink whether they would go forward with the vote. If you get another chance to have a global carbon price, how would you speak to the Trump administration, and how would you get them to change their mind on something that they currently aren’t supportive of?

Darren Woods 16:40

Yeah, I’m not familiar with all the things you talked about, so I don’t know if that happened or not, and I certainly wasn’t involved in the Trump administration and their dialog on this. So I can’t pretend to know the complexity of the discussions that were happening. What I would tell you is what we have consistently advocated for — with the Biden administration, with the Trump administration — is what thoughtful policies can be put in place to help reduce emissions that don’t compromise economic growth, that don’t penalize people’s standards of living. We’ve been very consistent with that, and there are opportunities to go do that. In fact, today, at this action agenda, there is a drive for carbon accounting, that is a critical first step in establishing a more uniform approach to how we address emissions and getting from carbon accounting to carbon intensity standards. So you can start specifying that on products and letting every government around the world establish what those specs should be. It’s a very flexible approach that allows every government to tailor that to the needs of their constituency and to their specific economic conditions. That’s an approach that I think has very broad application and can be very effective.

Akshat Rathi 17:51

I’m definitely coming to carbon accounting, because that’s an interesting change since we last talked about it. But before we get there, you told me last year that you wanted the Trump administration to stay in the Paris Agreement. I understand that you’ve even delivered that message directly to the President. Why did he not listen to you?

Darren Woods 18:09

You’ll have to ask President Trump that. There are a lot of people that don’t listen to me.

Akshat Rathi 18:16

So now that the US is officially going to be out of the Paris Agreement by January, what kind of harm does that do to the US? It’s the only country that is leaving.

Darren Woods 18:26

You know, I look at the challenge here over a very long horizon, and again, our action here, the work that we do, the engagements that we have with governments all around, remains consistent. We’re going to continue trying to do that, because our view is there’s something that needs to be done in this space and that we have a role to play and can contribute. And we will work with whatever administration comes in and continue to drive an agenda that we think makes sense, that doesn’t compromise economic growth or people’s standards of living. We think there’s an option to do that and open the aperture to the solution set. You’re framing all of this as a US-Trump issue. I think you should frame it more as an opportunity to open the aperture for a broader set of solutions to achieve the real objective, which is lowering emissions, versus the objective that people have been working to, which is getting rid of oil and gas. And I think that is one of the big challenges, that we’ve gotten the objective statement wrong, or the problem statement wrong, and we’ve got to go back to how do we best reduce emissions? And the approach being taken today is essentially controlled by governments dictating what the solutions need to be, and then trying to force companies to implement their solutions. We’ve seen how controlled economies work. The Soviet Union, North Korea, Cuba, East Germany — planned, centralized government control does not work. You need the markets to be engaged. There hasn’t been a solution set out there that engages the markets. That’s absolutely needed. Ideology only takes you so far, and then you need practical systems that deal with the real market constraints and the challenges of making things happen. That’s what we’ve got to get to.

Akshat Rathi 20:01

You didn’t raise the exception: China, where things are working.

Darren Woods 20:06

I would tell you that that’s a mix of things. You do need some… but government has a role, don’t get me wrong. I’m not suggesting government doesn’t have a role. But picking the solutions as a function of ideology versus a function of, say, strategy, are two very different sets of circumstances. I think the Chinese government operates a little differently than some of the democratically elected governments around the world. So it’s a different decision making process.

Akshat Rathi 20:28

So one way in which you think you can address that is through carbon accounting. Last year you talked about the idea, but today you have the initiative in front of you. It’s called carbon measures. It’s based on a concept that’s been developed by academics at Harvard University and Oxford University. The goal is to make carbon emissions work almost like financial liabilities. That once you sell the goods, you pass on the liabilities, emissions, liabilities that come with it. And you wanted that system so that you could get carbon accounting at a product level. The trouble is that the only way it’s going to work is if you have all parts of the supply chain of that product also reporting under that framework.

Darren Woods 21:15

Yeah, this is… but to be clear, this is not a reporting framework. This is not accounting in the pure sense of a financial accounting. This is an accounting analog. So there’s a financial model that we think makes a lot of sense in terms of how to think about accounting, but it’s also anchored in chemistry, and frankly, a molecule of emissions, or CO2, is created once. And so accounting for where in that value chain that emission is generated is critically important. So I don’t think of it as a financial, you know, an asset register in terms of liabilities or assets. I think of it as understanding where in a value chain for a product or a service is the emissions generated, and that’s critically important. If you want to eliminate all emissions, you damn well better be able to account for all of them.

Akshat Rathi 22:04

Conceptually what you’re saying is right, and the way the academics have put it is that once you have the concept in place, the way it will work is through reporting emissions at a product level through the supply chain, and having these liabilities be passed on from company to company as the product moves through the supply chain before it’s delivered to an end customer.

Darren Woods 22:26

Yeah, but I would keep… I mean, you refer to it as a liability being passed on, and then almost talk about it from a reporting standpoint. The opportunity here is to be able to understand what is the carbon intensity of a service or of a product. And when you have a standard that uniformly calculates that, there is an opportunity then to begin to regulate the carbon intensity of products that, in my mind, will bring in market forces. That’s the element that’s of interest to me, that I view would make carbon and carbon emissions, just like every other parameter that we control in the products that we sell, sulfur and lead and other things that we control in our products.

Akshat Rathi 23:07

Liabilities is the word that academics use. They call it…

Darren Woods 23:11

I’m not an academic, Akshat. I’m a realist. I mean, I’m the guy who’s making this stuff, and so I think that’s how we think about it.

Akshat Rathi 23:16

Yeah, I mean, they call it e-liabilities. It went nowhere, and then it got rebranded as carbon measures, and I think it’s now getting momentum. So from a conceptual perspective, I’m on your side here. What I wanted to get to, though, was that to get it to work, you need the entire supply chain to be able to agree on this framework.

Darren Woods 23:33

Yes.

Akshat Rathi 23:34

And that means it’s going to take years, decades. The greenhouse gas protocol that you don’t like, which has scope one, two and three emissions, it’s been in place for 25 years now. So there are climate advocates who are worried that climate measures is just another delay tactic. How do you address that?

Darren Woods 23:52

Well, first, I’d say you don’t have to get rid of the GHG Protocol. You can do this in addition to that. So I’m not sure… You know, I think there’s always this view that it’s an ‘either-or’ option, I keep coming back to this as an ‘and’ option. But I would also tell you the GHG Protocol, first of all, it’s not an accounting system. It’s a reporting system. And the other issue with this is, if you only use it to count, it double and triple counts, which means it doesn’t add up to the total planet’s emissions. That’s a problem. It also attempts to assign accountability where it doesn’t belong. And I make the point with scope three all the time. To ask me, as a company that produces products that are in demand and that are desperately needed by communities all around the world, that I can’t sell that to them because I need to reduce their emissions, I think is unreasonable. It’s an unreasonable request, and it ends up with an outcome that nobody wants. We’ve got 4 billion people on the planet living in energy poverty that desperately need reliable, affordable sources of energy today. Those sources have emissions associated with them. Okay, we need to address that, but we can’t do that by robbing them of the tools and the leverage enabling them to grow economically and to improve their lifestyle. And so we’ve got to figure out how we do both. I don’t know how long it takes. You know, you can start. This doesn’t have to be a big bang from my perspective. I’m a big believer in Pareto, that 20% of the products or services are causing 80% of the emissions. Let’s start by focusing on those. And by the way, you don’t get it perfect. Get 80% of the 20% and start there, and then evolve that and get better as you go. There are lots of ways to address this in a thoughtful, objective way, but we’ve got to do it in that way, thoughtfully and objectively, based on the science of CO2 emissions and generation of CO2 and then accounting philosophy for how best you do that. Get started.

Akshat Rathi 25:41

I think people who are worried about the delay tactic would welcome the view that you can have both the greenhouse gas protocol and the carbon measures accounting system, because that would allow you, in a market of ideas, competition to see which works.

Darren Woods 25:53

I don’t think anybody’s suggesting you get… Yeah, that’s exactly right. A market is a competition of ideas. And if you got a good product, if you’ve got a good idea, you shouldn’t be afraid of competition.

Akshat Rathi 26:09

Join me after the break for more of my conversation with Darren Woods, CEO of ExxonMobil. And if you’d like more from Bloomberg Green at COP30, sign up to our newsletter for daily coverage from me and the rest of my colleagues on the ground. Sing up at bloomberg.com/newsletters.

Akshat Rathi 26:29

So let’s come to the low-carbon side of the ideas that you are funding. You have been clear in multiple forums that Exxon’s strength is in the molecules business. And that’s why you haven’t really made a play in solar or wind deployment. But what we’ve seen over the past few decades is that the demand for electricity has been typically at double the pace of energy from molecules with AI. That’s a more recent phenomenon. We are seeing the gap grow between the demand for electricity and rest of energy. Are you reconsidering getting into the electricity business as a result?

Darren Woods 27:09

I would start by reminding you that electricity is generated from molecules.

Akshat Rathi 27:11

Not always, but sometimes

Darren Woods 27:14

The majority of them. A majority of them.

Akshat Rathi 27:17

Yes

Darren Woods 27:18

And if you go well into the future to 2050, you’re still going to see the majority of power being generated by molecules. So no, I’m not reconsidering that. I think there is a capability that we bring there. And I would also strongly make the point that hydrogen and carbon molecules go into a lot more products — that society needs, that enable modern living — than just combustion products. And so I’m perfectly comfortable with the idea that over time, there will be elements of the products that I make which are no longer needed by society because we found better alternatives with less emissions, maybe other benefits. I’m okay with that. We have historically evolved as a company on that basis. That doesn’t change, though, the fundamental need for our ability to transform these molecules into products that society needs. I’ll just very quickly give you two examples. One of them is that we recognize that: one, carbon molecules are in low-demand, high supply, and so my business drives a low cost. What can we make with low-cost carbon molecules? Our organizations invented a unique carbon molecule that has properties that lend themselves to anodes and batteries. And we’re seeing, through third party testing, that our carbon that’s used in anodes gives 30% faster charging times, 30% further range and over four times the battery life. So there’s a huge improvement in lithium-ion batteries with a product that I’m making out of a molecule.

Akshat Rathi 28:41

Let’s come to that battery breakthrough, because that’s recent, the announcement at least. And batteries are something that the world wants a lot of right now, and so having new materials is good. There’s lots of innovation that’s happening in that space. But with any technology breakthrough, and this is not just a battery problem, with any technology breakthrough, there tends to be a certain amount of hype that comes with it, before we can see it in action, including with this company. We can take the example of algae fuels that Exxon was supportive of, thought there was a breakthrough, but now that doesn’t become a practical solution. So how…

Darren Woods 29:18

We should make the distinction between pursuing a technology breakthrough and announcing one. And what we talked about with biofuels was the need to produce the productivity of algae to generate the amount of oil to make it economically viable. That’s what we were working on, and we saw the potential there. We never announced a breakthrough that said we were there. I would contrast that with what we’re saying with this carbon material, which is to say we had a view and an idea. We’ve developed the molecule, we’ve graphitized it, we put it into application, and we’ve had third parties testing it, and those results are what we’re reporting on. That’s a very different construct.

Akshat Rathi 29:53

So when might we see that carbon molecule in an actual battery in a commercial product.

Darren Woods 30:00

When will we see that? We’re working really hard to get that commercialized by the end of this decade. But I think, you know, again, in my mind, we don’t over promise and under deliver, and what we’ve tried to do: is to report on what we’re trying to do and accomplish. We’ve got to commercialize that. We have gone from the lab to a demo unit, and we have to commercialize that. So that will take time. These are large scale, and by the way, we’re only going to pursue the things that are large and make a material difference to ExxonMobil. I can’t have a bunch of nickel and dime businesses. So it doesn’t bother me, and it should not suggest that, because it’s going to take time, that it’s not real. I think the difference may be in your mindset versus ours. We think in terms of decades, because we understand what it takes to make these very large scale investments, and the time that it will take to bring them online and then penetrate the markets. And that’s true with all products.

Akshat Rathi 30:47

Let’s talk about some of the other low-carbon solutions that you’ve worked on. You have a lithium-extraction idea that you are working on now, lithium prices, as you well know, are even more volatile than fossil fuel prices. Does that make the investment thesis less attractive?

Darren Woods 31:08

No, because we look at lithium no differently than we look at any other product that we make, which is, where does our production sit on the cost of supply curve? So you know, if I am dependent upon a commodity, if I’m in a commodity business where prices are set by supply and demand, I do not control the supply and I do not control the demand. So I’m a price taker. Across the majority of my businesses, I’m a price taker. And so I will never know where prices are going to be, and I know that they will fluctuate based on where demand goes and how much supply comes on. So our strategy for being successful in a volatile market is to bring production on. That’s the low cost of supply, because I know in these markets that the least efficient supplier required to meet the demand is going to set the price. I’ve got to be better than that producer to get a margin, and that’s what we’re working on. And in lithium, that’s exactly the approach that we’re taking. And I would tell you, with respect to that, we’re still working to convince ourselves that we can get on the low end of the cost of supply curve. So we’re building small units to test that, to drive the technology. Whether that will be successful, we don’t know yet, but what I’ll tell you is we know we have a concept. We’re demonstrating the ability to do that. We’ve made lithium. Now the question is, can we commercialize it at scale, at a cost that’s competitive with Chinese cash cost? That’s a question that’s yet to be answered.

Akshat Rathi 32:27

And would that be the same answer for direct air capture technology?

Darren Woods 32:32

Direct air capture the same thing, everything that we’re doing, it’s a little different in that it’s a cost of abatement, but it’s the same principle, we have to be on the low end of the cost of abatement curve, because if it can’t compete economically, then we’re not interested. And I would tell you that’s true, even for the businesses today that are being subsidized by policy. What I tell the organization is we can begin the business based on that, but we’re not going to end up there. And so anything that we’re doing, we have to convince ourselves that over time, we’ll find a way to get on the far left hand side of the cost of supply curve, so that when market forces take over, and by the way, they have to, if we’re going to be successful as a society, that I better be advantaged with respect to that production. And if I can’t clear that hurdle and convince myself of it, we won’t go in on that business or make those investments.

Akshat Rathi 33:18

Another low-carbon commitment you have is to reduce the methane intensity of natural gas so the amount of methane that you leak as a result of the processes that are involved in extracting and delivering natural gas to customers. You have a goal for 2030 to try and be near-zero methane leaks, and that’s crucial here at COP30, where there’s going to be a big discussion around methane, and maybe even a methane deal of some sort. There’s already a target, but how do you actually get to that target? Lots of countries are talking about that. Now, the Inflation Reduction Act would have benefited companies like yours who are starting to work on reducing methane intensity, because it was going to put a methane fee on those who leak a lot. That’s gone now. Do you stop investing in methane reductions as a result of the incentive going away?

Darren Woods 34:11

We were driving methane intensity reductions before the IRA came along, and we’ll continue to do it long after the IRA has expired. So our commitment to reduce emissions, CO2 emissions, methane emissions, isn’t a function of policy being put in place or being incentivized by penalties. Our objective is to be a responsible operator. And from my perspective, from the day I got in this job, it was, if we’re producing something, it’s our responsibility and obligation to keep it in the pipe, and we need to work to do that. And we’ve made huge progress in that, irrespective of the commitments that we’ve made publicly. That was, if you go back in time before methane had the profile that it has today, we began reducing our methane emissions intensity before even this became a very public issue or a high-profile issue, and we’re going to continue to do that. We made great progress with it.

Akshat Rathi 35:01

One of the things that has happened over the last few years, which has been exceptional relative to other oil and gas companies, is that Exxon has signed lots and lots of permitting deals around the world. So recently Greece, but also you’re re-entering Iraq, Trinidad, Libya. Given where we are in oil and gas markets generally, there’s lots of oversupply right now. Prices have been falling. Why are you expanding your permitting regime so aggressively?

Darren Woods 35:32

This is a depletion business. The bigger you are, the more production you have, the bigger the hole you dig through depletion. So every barrel we produce is a barrel that’s not available to us. So you can think of it like having a bottle of water. Every sip you take, there’s less water in the bottle. Eventually the bottle runs out of water, and you need to find a new bottle. So that’s the job that we have. As we continue to produce as a large producer, we have to find ways to replace the barrels that we’ve put on the marketplace. That’s a huge challenge. And given that if you go out to 2050, and beyond, that oil and gas will continue to play an important role in the energy mix and in providing products that the world needs, we know those barrels are going to be needed. And so finding opportunities to bring more production on, to fill the depletion curve, is a critical part of the job. There’s only really three levers that we have to pull there. One is for the resources that we already have today. How do we recover more? That’s a technology challenge that we’re working very hard on. The other is, you can go out and bring a technology advantage or a production advantage or operating advantage to buy somebody else’s assets and produce those more effectively, get better recovery, do it at a lower cost. And then the third is you’ve got to find new things, and explorations are a critical part of that.

Akshat Rathi 36:49

In getting those permits, how much has the Trump administration been helpful?

Darren Woods 36:54

We don’t work through the US government on those.

Akshat Rathi 36:58

Would you be interested in oil and gas assets in Venezuela if they were to open up?

Darren Woods 37:01

So, you know, we’ve been expropriated from Venezuela two different times. And so I think we have our history there. We have an experience set. And so certainly looking at what follows and what’s in place, and how comfortable and confident are we that if we made investments, that we’d see the return on those investments? It would be a critical part to evaluating that, and then we’d have to see what the economics look like. So I wouldn’t put it on the list or take it off the list. We’d have to see what the circumstances are at the time, which today, I don’t know what they’re going to be, if they’re even different.

Akshat Rathi 37:31

You said previously that you don’t work with the Trump administration on permitting deals abroad, but there is a clear indication from the Trump administration that they would like more oil and gas production globally. Has there been any support to help you figure out where that might be?

Darren Woods 37:45

We don’t need any help in that area.

Akshat Rathi 37:48

Now, key to your efforts to turn around performance at ExxonMobil, a 150 year old company, has been what you’ve classed as your focus on winning. Some of that, though, has included layoffs and cost cutting internally. It’s also included suing activist shareholders and even taking a rival to arbitration court. Can you define what winning means to you?

Darren Woods 38:11

Yeah, you’ve mixed a lot of things up in that. That question that, frankly, don’t… are you’ve got apples, oranges, bananas and pears in there. I think first of all, what I would tell you is, what we’ve been very focused on winning is bringing a unique set of capabilities and competitive advantages to the marketplace and realizing those advantages on the bottom line. And so if you look at the transformation the company’s been making, the changes that we’ve made in our organization, it has been restructuring to more effectively bring the advantages of scale, bring the advantages of the integrated businesses that we have, and the synergies that exist between those businesses to the bottom line. Taking advantage of and driving technology and technology benefits to the bottom line. It’s a focus on execution excellence, to drive capital efficiency, to drive reliability, to drive lower maintenance, higher safety, better environmental performance. And then it’s been about unlocking the potential of our people. That’s what the changes that we’ve been driving to unlock this advantage we’ve been very focused on. We’ve made great progress. And the layoffs that came from that is a function of the restructuring and better organizing our people in a way that they can work more productively and take advantage of everything ExxonMobil has to offer. It was more about effectiveness, less about efficiency. But like everything, when you focus on being more effective, you find efficiencies. And so that’s what’s driving that. With respect to the lawsuits, this is really around protecting the value that we’re creating for our shareholders and importantly, defending ourselves against activist attacks, which are generated by an agenda that’s not aligned with the value of the company or the value that we create for our shareholders. And unfortunately, we’ve gotten to a place in society where the courts are being used frequently to bring challenges to some of these activities, and we’re going to use the same tools that our antagonists use to defend the value that we’re creating for our shareholders.

Akshat Rathi 40:06

Sticking to layoffs, Exxon currently has 14,000 fewer employees than in 2019, and there are plans to lose another 2000 jobs. And Exxon isn’t the only company doing this. We’ve seen jobs in Conoco Phillips being cut 20-25%. Chevron has said it would cut about 20% of its workforce. Do you think it’s a sign of the industry shrinking, that its social license is eroding?

Darren Woods 40:32

I can’t speak for Conoco and Chevron. I can speak for ourselves, and it’s not… If you look at the layoffs that you’re talking about, for us, it’s like 3% of the workforce, global workforce. So again, we’ve been very focused on changing how we work, as I mentioned, the transformation that we’re trying to make, to unlock our competitive advantages. What we’ve shifted to as we’ve changed the how, is to focus on the where. And if you look at our global footprint and where we were located, it is based on an operating model, a construct that was developed decades ago. And so we’re bringing our operational footprint, our facility footprint, in line with how we work today. That is, with my mind, an optimization step. It is not a deep cut to drive. And again, it wasn’t driven, wasn’t focused, on cost cutting. It was focused on taking advantage of our people and the teamwork and the collaboration and the innovation that comes from that, that we have unlocked with these changes, and we can only do that when people are in the same location. I’m a big believer in working together, not working remotely.

Akshat Rathi 41:34

Well, the 2000 are, yes, 3%. But since 2019, it’s more than 25%, because you have 63,000 employees now.

Darren Woods 41:42

Which comes from the transformation in the organization. We had, I think, 11 independent, unique companies, siloed in our organization. We’ve gotten rid of the silos today and reorganized. We have a one team-one goal mentality. People are working collaboratively together, and so you just need less people when you take away the artificial construct that exists. That’s a function of improving your effectiveness, getting better at what we do, and you see that in the results that we have. If this was a pure cost-cutting exercise, you wouldn’t see the improvement that we’re getting in safety — personnel safety and process safety. You wouldn’t see the improvement that we’re getting in our reliability. And we now have record reliability with our operations. You wouldn’t see that in the projects that we’re delivering, which today are industry leading, both in cost and schedule. And so there’s a lot of benefits that you can see that’s happening in the company because of this effectiveness thing.

Akshat Rathi 42:33

If we take that five year period, the stock price has certainly done wonders for Exxon. But if you just take the last 12 months since Donald Trump’s election, since all these regulatory rollbacks, since the push to try and get more fossil fuels, the stock price hasn’t done all that well. It’s a little bit lower now than it was exactly one year ago.

Darren Woods 42:54

Very much, you have to… I think anytime you look at the stock price of the company, you have to look at the commodity price market that we’re in. Our stock price is highly correlated with commodity prices, and so it will move up and down. So the absolute number is less important than the relative number over time, and the things that you’re doing to improve that. So I don’t have any concerns in that space.

Akshat Rathi 43:13

You’ve been in the role for nine years. How long do you plan to stay on?

Darren Woods 43:17

Well, the board gets to decide that, not me.

Akshat Rathi 43:22

And what would you like to get done before you step away?

Darren Woods 43:24

We’ve made a lot of changes, as you’ve talked about, many of those have been recent. In fact, we just announced this week the formation of a global operations organization, and we’ve got to bed those in. And I think we’re only beginning to see the benefits of that change. And I would like to have time to really focus the organization on improving the effectiveness of the changes that we’ve made. We are rolling out, I think, the largest instance of SAP where today, under our corporation, for the first time in our history, we will have a system that spans the entire corporation and a data structure that’s consistent for every business we do everywhere around the world. So it unlocks huge opportunities. Think about that in conjunction with AI, where data and data consistency and integrity is so critical to the benefits of AI. We will have an unmatched platform with more data than anybody else in our industry. And so I think I’d like to see that through. We’ve got a program where we’re developing that through the next several years. So there’s still a lot to be done in the company that’s going to keep me busy, and I’d like to see some of that land and begin to produce the results that we’re counting on.

Akshat Rathi 44:28

Goldman projects that by 2030, the country's effective spare power capacity will reach around 400 gigawatts — more than three times the world's total expected data center power demand.
""We expect China's spare capacity to remain sufficient to accommodate data center power demand growth while supporting demand in other industries,"" Goldman's analysts wrote.
Other issues that could limit data center growth in the US include lengthy project timelines and a global shortage of gas-powered turbines.
By contrast, he said China's government energy subsidies make it cheaper for local tech firms to power homegrown AI chips, as ""power is free.""","The US is racing ahead in artificial intelligence, but its biggest obstacle is more than chips, rare earths, or talent — it's electricity, according to a new report from Goldman Sachs.

The US power grid is already straining under the surge of data centers fueling AI models, with these massive facilities now accounting for about 6% of total US electricity demand.

That share is expected to nearly double to 11% by 2030, pushing parts of the country's grid past critical limits, Goldman's analysts estimate.

""As AI demands massive power, a reliable and ample power supply is likely to be a key factor shaping this race, especially because power infrastructure bottlenecks can be slow to solve,"" wrote Goldman's analysts.

The issue could slow the US's pace in the AI tech race, where it is a frontrunner.

The US leads the world in AI infrastructure, with 44% of global data center capacity — about as much as China, the EU, Japan, Korea, and India put together.

However, the US power market has been tightening, with US peak summer spare power generation capacity decreasing from 26% five years ago to 19% as demand from data centers rose.

By the end of the decade, this spare capacity could fall below the ""critically tight"" 15% level if AI growth continues at its current pace, Goldman's analysts estimate.

China powers ahead

While the US grid tightens, China has been quietly stockpiling energy.

Goldman projects that by 2030, the country's effective spare power capacity will reach around 400 gigawatts — more than three times the world's total expected data center power demand.

""We expect China's spare capacity to remain sufficient to accommodate data center power demand growth while supporting demand in other industries,"" Goldman's analysts wrote.

China's buildup follows an energy crunch in 2021 that led Beijing to ramp up power generation across renewables, natural gas, nuclear, and coal to ensure energy security.

The US, by contrast, is retiring coal plants faster than it's adding new natural gas or renewable capacity. Other issues that could limit data center growth in the US include lengthy project timelines and a global shortage of gas-powered turbines.

""Reliable and ample power supply is likely to be a key factor shaping this race,"" the analysts wrote, ""especially because power infrastructure bottlenecks can be slow to solve.""

Goldman's report came amid an intensifying race for artificial intelligence between the US and China.

Earlier this month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also mentioned energy as an issue that could hinder the US's AI development.

Speaking to the Financial Times, Huang noted a growing wave of AI regulations emerging across US states and warned that too many new rules could stifle innovation.

By contrast, he said China's government energy subsidies make it cheaper for local tech firms to power homegrown AI chips, as ""power is free.""",https://i.insider.com/6916ae6ee1a9cbb014de3327?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-11-14 08:58:27.655661

A house constructed from red “smart bricks” charged to provide electricity. A hospital operating room built with self-cleaning tiles that kill superbugs. Semiconductor nanoparticles to improve MRIs or generate clean water. Micro-batteries embedded in clothing to monitor your health.

These are a few of the applications that could emerge from the foundational research occurring in the lab of Professor Julio D’Arcy, the Carl J. and Anna Carlson Endowed Chair of Chemistry and Biochemistry.

His research could be used to lower costs for energy storage in devices or enable development of lightweight batteries for transportation applications.

“Everyone’s probably heard stories about how everything ‘nano’ is better,” he says. “Physics change at that smaller scale, and things behave better. Ion transport is facilitated at this scale, enabling rapid charging.”

Many days, D’Arcy’s lab is abuzz with the activities of 17 undergraduate and graduate students who work with iron oxide, or rust, which makes bricks red. They develop and study synthetic polymers — complex, chemically bonded chains of large molecules — used to produce materials for energy storage devices, atmospheric water harvesting, pH and temperature sensors, and other applications, including those in medicine.

“We’re always after the same goal,” D’Arcy says. “We want to make a polymer that conducts electricity. The more it conducts, the better.”

From the lab to publication to industrial applications

After his brick research was published by Nature Communications in 2020, D’Arcy heard from hundreds of private companies, global investors, and journalists interested in his work. As he told Scientific American, “We’re trying to make specialized plastics that are only used on the nanoscale — where we use very little of the plastic, and we can actually embed that plastic inside construction materials.”

His research team didn’t expect such worldwide attention. “We got a little taste of what can happen if you publish in a field where people care about the intersection of this research,” recalls D’Arcy, who joined Clark’s Gustav H. Carlson School of Chemistry and Biochemistry in 2022. “They’re all after the same idea: adding sustainability into construction materials. It’s not just the architecture they’re interested in. It’s the idea that construction materials are going to make you live longer, or the idea that you’re going to be able to store energy in bricks, steel, or concrete.”

D’Arcy’s synthesis of organic semiconductor nanoparticles would fill a commercial and societal need. “It’s something that manufacturers want,” he says. “We propose a method that produces nanoparticles very fast, using aerosols. It’s hard to do, but it’s doable.”

Meanwhile, his research on developing smooth polymers to create antibacterial coatings also holds much promise.

“You could use this masonry material in operating rooms or kitchens,” D’Arcy says, “anyplace where you have people with compromised immune systems or where you prepare food.”

To form nanoparticles of a polymer called PEDOT — short for Poly(3,4-Ethylenedioxythiophene) — D’Arcy’s students design and build glass-and-metal, box-shaped reactors in which they place 1-centimeter-square brick samples. They fill the reactors with ferric chloride, an acid in water.

“We’re heating the sample and exposing it to vapors or reactants,” D’Arcy explains. “The monomer, or simple molecule, gets polymerized on the surface of the brick once it’s been activated by the acid.”

The shape of the polymer determines its application. “We make nanotubes, nanofibers, and smooth films,” he says.

Applying art history to polymer research

Besides contributing to foundational research that could result in wide-ranging applications, students in D’Arcy’s lab are gaining hands-on, career-ready experience and preparing to publish journal articles.

They include two undergraduate students, Avery Schwartz ’26 and Ella Traynor ’26, who have studied chemical reactions that produce polymers and their semiconductor nanoparticles.

A double major in chemistry and art history, Schwartz has worked in the lab for more than a year, funded last summer by a Weiller Research Fellowship. She has presented twice at ClarkFEST, the biannual undergraduate research and scholarship event.

Schwartz’s research examines the chemical reaction that occurs when nanotube structures — which can attract, absorb, and hold atmospheric water — are formed during the “vapor phase” of polymerization. She studies nanotube “films” of polypyrrole, a type of polymer that has applications for energy storage, water purification, and water storage.

Although Schwartz investigated the formation of polymer films on glass, “you can apply the polymer film to any substrate, like a brick, and collect even more water,” she says, benefiting areas of the world that need clean drinking water.

In the lab, Schwartz’s two academic majors “play off of each other in an interesting way,” she says. “Art history is a lot about noticing things and taking the time to craft and engineer an argument about whatever work you’re talking about or evidence you’re seeing in the history. And I think that’s what makes for a successful chemist as well — deeply analyzing a lot of the work that you’re doing and the observations you’re making.”

‘You must be decisive, and you must have a plan’

Funded over two summers — a Murdock Research Fellowship in 2025 and a Penn Family Research Fellowship in 2024 — Traynor has worked in D’Arcy’s lab for nearly three years, “doing a little bit of everything.” Traynor’s main focus, however, is studying how and why the introduction of a power source during the vapor phase synthesis of PEDOT results in a chemical reaction that forms a germ-killing peroxide.

The research could be applied to developing self-sterilizing brick tiles for hospital operating rooms.

“There’s the water-splitting reaction caused by the battery and our polymer, and then there’s the iron oxide in the bricks, which results in a chemical, or Fenton, reaction,” they explain, “and that’s what results in those peroxide radicals that are so good at killing organisms like bacteria.”

A chemistry major who also enjoys and hopes to minor in physics, Traynor now is mentoring another undergraduate student, Beckham Ward ’28, who just joined D’Arcy’s lab. “I was showing him how to do stuff with my project. That was cool — it’s like my research has come full circle.”

A catcher and infielder for women’s softball, Traynor made the 2025 Softball Academic All-Conference Team last spring. They plan to continue their research next year as part of Clark’s 4+1 Accelerated Master’s Degree in chemistry.

Juggling academics, softball practices, and games as a student-athlete has forced them to “stay organized. It’s given me a lot of time-management skills,” says Traynor, who also applies their coach’s advice to apply a “growth mindset” to build her softball skills. “It makes me a little more focused on moving forward or what I need to do next.”

Playing catcher behind home plate also has provided Traynor with additional skills they can apply to chemistry research.

“You’re thinking through plays. You’re the only one who sees the whole field,” Traynor says. “People are listening to you because you’re the only one who has eyes on all the runners and all the fielders. I think that helps you be a little more assertive. You must be a quick thinker, you must be decisive, and you must have a plan. And I think that applies to real life and the lab as well.”

Carbon fiber paper for smart wearables

Both Schwartz and Traynor have benefited from mentoring by graduate students in the lab, including current master’s student Yiming Qin and Ph.D. students Umama Akther and Ye Chen.

Qin’s research and master’s thesis focus on micro-supercapacitors, the conducting polymers that can serve as tiny batteries to store energy.

“I’m working with carbon fiber paper,” he says. “Carbon fiber paper is a substrate, and we grow our conducting polymer PEDOT nanofibers on it.”

Although carbon fiber is fragile, it can become stronger when woven together to cover a larger area, according to Qin.

“It could be used like a wearable, like energy storage devices in smart clothes, smart shoes, or smart watches,” he says.

Qin is working with D’Arcy to publish his research, then hopes to return to China to work in industry and care for his parents.

When Akther was applying to chemistry Ph.D. programs in the United States, her mentors and peers from Bangladesh urged her to apply to Clark, she says.

As an undergraduate student in chemistry at Jashore University of Science and Technology, Akther had had worked in a research lab on a project to improve food safety. She studied the computational chemistry behind using simple salt or vinegar solutions to remove heavy metals from vegetables grown in Jashore for sales and export. The research resulted in a recent article published in the Journal of Food Composition and Analysis.

Akther wanted a similarly robust research experience in a Ph.D. program. When D’Arcy offered her a position in his lab, her supervisor in Bangladesh suggested she take it.

“She said, ‘This project is really, really good. This is a promising field for industry and jobs, and you can work in the field — polymer chemistry, nano chemistry, and also engineering,’ ” Akther recalls.

‘This is the research that companies are interested in’

Now Akther is in her second year at Clark, leading her own research project and mentoring undergraduate students in D’Arcy’s lab. With assistance from undergraduate students Katelynn Humphrey ’25 last year and Emme Salisbury ’28 and Emma St. Louis ’28 this year, Akther has sought to develop and build a reactor that uses aerosol vapor polymerization. The goal, she says, is to more rapidly — and easily — produce smaller organic semiconductor nanoparticles of PEDOT, shaped like spheres for easier delivery.

Her research has potential biomedical applications. “If we make this particle at the nanometer-size scale,” she says, “then it can be inserted into our bodies because it’s safe — it has no side effects. It can be used in MRI imaging.”

Yet, the work can be slow and tedious at times. “Over a year, I have tried eight to nine times to change my reactor. I need a more advanced reactor so it can handle more nanoparticles,” she says.

Akther uses imaging software to examine the microscopic nanoparticles. “If I’m getting 9-micrometer particles, but my goal is 5 micrometers,” she explains, “then I think, ‘OK, what can I change to make my particle smaller? Also, how many am I making? Are the particles attached to each other? What is the problem within my reactor?’ ”

She is overseeing another undergraduate student, Tatsuya Peralta ’27, a chemistry major who is helping her build more powerful nebulizers to produce aerosolized droplets of ferric chloride, which are carried into her reactors. They will replace the store-bought household humidifier she has been using.

“I can produce a hundred particles in one run now,” she explains. “But if my humidifier is more powerful, then I can make 200 or 300.”

In the field, research exploring aerosol polymerization has not been widely explored, Akther says, “so we would like to introduce this process to others.”

Even more, D’Arcy says, if he and his research team make inroads in their polymer studies, “we expect this to have a significant societal impact.

“I am doing the research that I am interested in, but this is the research that companies are interested in as well,” he says. “And if it’s successful, it would come from us. It would come from Clark.”

The identical facilities, planned for Haugaland, Trøndelag and Innlandet, are scheduled to come online in 2027–28.

Each plant will use locally sourced agricultural and aquaculture waste - including manure and fish waste - to produce biogas, which will then be purified and liquefied using Nordsol’s LBG technology.

Once operational, each site is expected to generate around 100 GWh of LBG annually.

The combined output will play a significant role in Havila Biogass’s strategy to expand zero-emission energy solutions through circular resource use, supporting the decarbonisation of Norway’s heavy industry and transport sectors.

Kjell Evensgård, CEO of Havila Biogass, said the company selected Nordsol not only for its “proven, reliable and cost-efficient technology”, but also for its expertise and project approach.

“Together, we are accelerating the scale-up of sustainable energy systems and taking another major step toward a circular, carbon-negative energy future,” he said.

Alongside the three new plants, the companies have signed a Partnership Agreement to jointly develop more than 400 GWh of additional LBG capacity in the coming years.

The expansion would lift total output above 700 GWh and more than double Norway’s current biomethane supply.

Nordsol CEO Léon van Bossum said Havila Biogass was acting with the “decisiveness that our time demands”.

Amrize, the nation’s largest cement producer, is making a $700-million investment in its U.S. facilities and betting a new “Made in America” label can do more than stir patriotic appeal.

Launching Nov. 13 at flagship plants from Missouri to Texas, the company says the certification ensures domestic manufacturing and expands U.S. capacity. An ancillary benefit of domestically sourced materials is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in one of construction’s most emission-intensive materials.

“Our new ‘Made in America’ label offers our customers the confidence that their product complies with U.S. standards for quality, performance and reliability, with local-to-local service,” Jaime Hill, president of Amrize Building Materials, said in a statement.

“We are proud of the role our solutions play in building America and are committed to advancing the U.S. building industry, supporting American jobs and serving as the partner of choice for the professional builders of America,” he added.

Amrize plans to extend the label across five of its U.S. plants, starting with facilities in Ste. Genevieve, Mo.; Midlothian, Texas; Devil’s Slide, Utah; Holly Hill, S.C.; and Portland, Colo.

The rollout coincides with upgrades that add approximately 760,000 tons of annual production, including a 660,000-ton expansion at Ste. Genevieve—North America’s largest cement plant—and $50 million in modernization work at Midlothian.

Patrick Cleary, Amrize’s senior vice president for U.S. commercial cement, said the Made in America label is meant to instill confidence and support economic growth. “We see a clear opportunity to strengthen partnerships that value verified domestic content,” he said.

The U.S. cement and concrete sector contributes more than $130 billion annually to the economy and supports about 600,000 jobs, according to the American Cement Association. National shipments reached roughly 105 million metric tons in 2024, with imports supplying about 23% of total demand—valued at nearly $16 billion.

Although the new label echoes “Buy America” sentiment, cement itself remains outside Federal Highway Administration domestic-content mandates.

FHWA rules that took effect Oct. 1 begin phasing in U.S. manufacturing and component thresholds for manufactured products under federally funded projects, but cement is not yet covered.

“For the five flagship plants where we’re launching the label, we’ve verified the origin of all raw materials through a full supply review,” the company said in an email.

""We see a clear opportunity to strengthen our partnerships that value verified domestic content with customers seeking to specify and promote Made in America solutions,"" Patrick Cleary, Amrize senior vice president of Commercial Cement for the U.S., said in an email to ENR.

""Success will be measured not only in market performance, but also by our customers’ trust,"" he added.

An additional advantage of using domestically sourced materials is reducing ecological impact. Local procurement, by definition, will lower the amount of energy needed to obtain raw materials compared to non-domestic sources. The result is a reduction in net greenhouse gas emissions.

Several states, including California and Colorado, have adopted Buy Clean standards that factor carbon emissions into material procurement. That convergence between sourcing policy and emissions disclosure could give Amrize’s label additional traction.

New White House Buy America Guidance Draws Scrutiny

Material Sourcing and Carbon Footprint

Amrize’s “local-to-local” logistics model reduces delivery distances, a growing factor in embodied-carbon accounting. That connection between local production and emissions drew cautious endorsement from Kari Yuers, chair of the American Concrete Institute’s Chemical Admixtures Committee and president of Kryton International.

“If you lower transportation distances, you naturally lower embodied carbon,” Yuers told ENR. “But it’s only one piece of the puzzle. We need parallel moves—electrification of transport, alternative-fuel kilns, 1L cements, carbon-capture pilots—to actually move the needle.”

She added that verification matters as much as intent. “Labels are valuable if they’re verifiable,” she said. “Without transparent data on embodied-carbon intensity, a domestic-content label risks becoming just another marketing claim.”

Producing cement clinker by heating limestone and clay in kilns is the most energy-intensive aspect of creating Portland cement. Clinker is the key product where the chemical reaction takes place and is responsible for the majority of the environmental emissions associated with producing cement, which is eventually used in concrete.

Contractors and state transportation agencies can verify domestic-content claims and environmental disclosures through Federal Trade Commission labeling rules and ASTM-compliant Environmental Product Declarations.

Such documentation is increasingly required in material procurement scoring and Buy Clean reporting frameworks from federal authorities, ACI and other standards-making bodies.

Decarbonization and Industry Outlook

The company’s investment push includes process efficiency upgrades, as well as breaking ground this year on a new fly-ash beneficiation plant in Virginia, aiming to reclaim landfilled ash as a supplementary cementitious material—a key step in offsetting clinker emissions.

Many U.S. concrete producers currently import fly ash from overseas due to the lack of coal-fired power plants in the U.S., making procurement from Europe or coal-friendly nations necessary. That supply chain was disrupted not only during the pandemic but also during more recent shortages of the coal byproduct due to heavy demand for mission-critical facilities.

“Beneficiated fly ash and calcined clay can make a real dent in carbon, but access and permitting are limiting factors,” Yuers said. “We need regional supply solutions so contractors aren’t waiting months for alternative materials.”

Yuers added that Portland-limestone cement, known in industry standards as Type 1L, can lower CO2 intensity by 10–15% without compromising structural performance when mix designs are properly adjusted. “They’re the fastest near-term win,” she said. “They’re proven and ready if the market demands them.”

Cement manufacturing accounts for roughly 71 million metric tons of CO2 a year—about 4.4% of U.S. industrial greenhouse-gas output, according to EPA and Clean Air Task Force data.

With construction activity expected to rise through 2030, producers are facing increasing pressure from owners and transportation departments to document life-cycle carbon reductions through Environmental Product Declarations.

“Domestic production and low-carbon production don’t have to be separate goals,” Yuers said. “If companies like Amrize align both, they’ll redefine what ‘Made in America’ means for the next generation of infrastructure.”

For Amrize, the label positions the company where domestic sourcing and carbon reduction goals converge.

""The label reinforces Amrize’s role as the local partner helping states, builders, and contractors source materials produced in their own communities,"" the company said. ""It provides a clear signal to customers and public agencies that working with a labeled Amrize cement product directly supports American manufacturing, American jobs and local economic growth.""

Whether the initiative becomes a verified competitive standard—or simply savvy branding—will depend on data the industry has only begun to measure.

The City of Austin is preparing for a bond election in 2026 to pay for infrastructure projects.

(Note: This is an entirely separate effort from the recent Prop Q tax rate election, which was about paying for the city’s operating costs.)

The City Council-appointed Bond Election Advisory Task Force (BEATF) has met for a year and is deep in the process of evaluating requests for funding from various city departments. The BEATF is seeking public input as part of this process. In addition to inviting public comments, the task force is hosting three public input sessions over the next couple of weeks.

Here is the listening session schedule:

WHEN: November 15, 6-8 p.m.

This bond process was preceded by an effort to initiate an Environmental Investment Plan, which would have provided funding for climate and environmental projects. The Austin City Council ultimately expanded the scope to include an evaluation of all bond needs for the city, but retained climate change as a key factor to be addressed by the bond package. However, the list of projects proposed by city staff has mostly been routine projects – not climate or environmentally focused specifically.

The task force will have to decide how much to prioritize climate action and sustainability in the projects we recommend to Council. Will this bond be an opportunity for the city to catch up on its climate goals, or will it be standard infrastructure projects delivered in the standard fashion? Construction generally increases greenhouse gas emissions, but there are some projects – building electric vehicle charging infrastructure, preserving land for carbon sequestration, and expanding sidewalks and bike lanes – that can help meet climate goals. Projects like libraries and health centers can be designed to have net-zero greenhouse gas emissions over time by using low-carbon building materials and including on-site solar installations.

According to the DENR, only 11 out of more than 700 trees remained in 2022 after a tree-cutting permit was issued for the project. The agency said this violated Section 77 of Presidential Decree 705 or the Revised Forestry Code of 1975, as well as Presidential Decree 1586 on the Environmental Impact Statement System.

The DENR also found that the developer failed to obtain a discharge permit required under the Philippine Clean Water Act of 2004.

The planned centralized retention pond and 15 other structures intended to hold runoff were deemed inadequate. The pond was designed to hold the equivalent of seven Olympic-size swimming pools once completed.

“Ang analysis is itong 18,500 cubic meters or itong mga na-establish or to be established pa na mga retention pond that would somehow catch 'yung mga water para ma-eliminate or ma-prevent 'yung run-off going down. Ang nakita lang namin is only 12 retention pond, sapat ba 'yun? Parang hindi siya sapat. Dapat i-upgrade,” said DENR Region 7 assistant director Eddie Llamedo.

The agency added that Monterrazas had violated 10 out of 33 conditions under its Environmental Compliance Certificates, exposing those behind the development to possible administrative and criminal charges.",https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/582758807_1260714886085292_1529237572049277313_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_tt6&cstp=mx1200x1200&ctp=s600x600&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=cae128&_nc_ohc=ntyPDN40sSUQ7kNvwECwYIH&_nc_oc=AdkqTBu_SfMmULlj0EHHaN27kZAtswL-GdwhPN-en1cn2weGIuN5v233J7WSXGU3WuNVshE3nqMlwS7DcQzv19uC&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.xx&_nc_gid=8iakCQ_w2zp05ZP03RJMwQ&oh=00_AfjUxtyrn12rYY-X07un5wiFlKjqOPZ0xDx5OT7So_1QBA&oe=691D118A,N,,2025-11-14 08:59:24.222882

“Samarium is the most critical rare earth or the most critical critical mineral,” said Ryan, CEO and Chairman of Ucore Rare Metals Inc. (TSXV: UCU | OTCQX: UURAF), in an interview with Tracy Hughes, host of InvestorNews.com.
“You can pursue that specific group of at-risk rare earth minerals and make them available to someone like Vacuumschmelze.” For Ryan, it’s not about incremental progress, but about strategic autonomy.
“So, yes, we are very pleased with that.” While Washington and Ottawa divide responsibilities – Louisiana focusing on heavy rare earths, Canada on samarium-gadolinium – Ucore is also solidifying its upstream alliances.

(TSXV: UCU | OTCQX: UURAF), in an interview with Tracy Hughes, host of InvestorNews.com. “That’s important for the relationship with Vacuumschmelze.”

At a time when global supply chains are being reshaped by Chinese export bans, Ucore has positioned itself as a linchpin in the West’s pursuit of rare earth independence. The recently signed Memorandum of Understanding with Germany’s Vacuumschmelze GmbH & Co. KG (VAC) and eVAC Magnetics LLC represents, according to Ryan, “an alliance between Canada, the US, and Germany – three countries connecting.” The partnership, timed to coincide with the G7 summit, links Ucore’s rare earth refining technology with one of the world’s most established magnet manufacturers, which supplies critical materials for defense systems, electric vehicles, and renewable energy applications.

VAC’s US subsidiary, eVAC Magnetics, has just completed construction of a permanent magnet facility in Sumter County, South Carolina, supported by the US Department of Defense and a $111.9 million advanced energy project tax credit program. Ucore’s task is to supply these facilities with high-purity rare earth oxides – materials separated using the proprietary RapidSX™ technology, which, according to Ryan, “is 70% faster than solvent extraction and requires 60% less space.” Thanks to the system’s flexibility, Ucore can adjust its production targets within hours instead of weeks. “If you’re targeting something specific like samarium or gadolinium, you can actually do that economically,” he said. “You can pursue that specific group of at-risk rare earth minerals and make them available to someone like Vacuumschmelze.”

For Ryan, it’s not about incremental progress, but about strategic autonomy. “We are funded by the Department of Defense, and so are they – so that’s a good connection,” he explained. “It’s about rebuilding the Western supply network.”

This network is also supported by Canada. Following China’s April export restrictions on rare earths like samarium and gadolinium – elements essential for high-temperature magnets in F-35 fighter jets and Virginia-class submarines – the Canadian federal government announced CAD 36.3 million in funding for Ucore. “This culminated in a program announced at the G7 summit,” Ryan said. “Minister Hodgson signed the agreement with Ucore right on stage.” The funds – CAD 26 million from Natural Resources Canada and CAD 10 million from FedDev Ontario – will support a samarium-gadolinium production line in Canada. “It’s a full grant, not a loan,” Ryan emphasized. “So, yes, we are very pleased with that.”

While Washington and Ottawa divide responsibilities – Louisiana focusing on heavy rare earths, Canada on samarium-gadolinium – Ucore is also solidifying its upstream alliances. The company has once again partnered with Hastings Technology Metals Ltd. (ASX: HAS), an Australian rare earth producer now free from previous entanglements with China. “The collaboration between Hastings and Ucore brings Canadian technology and US manufacturing together in Louisiana,” Ryan said. “We are working quickly to be ready by 2027.”

Ryan’s tone is calm, but unmistakably strategic. “To build a supply chain, you need interconnected nodes,” he said. “You can’t just sign one-off MOUs that don’t offer a complete solution.” With advancing facilities in Alexandria, Louisiana, and Kingston, Ontario, as well as downstream partners like VAC and eVAC, Ryan sees Ucore’s role as more than just a participant. “If ‘command center’ means delivering products and addressing supply chain deficiencies to rebuild the Western supply network,” he said, “then we gladly accept that title.”

The statement hangs in the air – a reminder that the race for rare earths is no longer about who can dig the deepest, but who can connect the dots the fastest.

First promulgated in 2023, the PFAS Reporting Rule in its current form is wide-sweeping, applying to all companies that domestically manufactured PFAS or imported PFAS-containing items during 2011-2022. The current rule includes essentially no exemptions, and now EPA is proposing to change that.

EPA’s proposal would incorporate exemptions for imported articles; de minimis concentrations of PFAS at 0.1% or lower; byproducts, impurities, and non-isolated intermediates; and for research and development (R&D). EPA is also proposing certain clarifications, technical corrections, and to key the submission period to the effective date of the finalized revisions. The most prominent of these proposed revisions is the imported articles exemption, which would remove from the rule’s scope the large majority of companies subject to the regulation in its current form. Affected stakeholders should consider submitting public comments on the proposed revisions, and these comments will be due 45 days after the proposed revisions are published in the Federal Register.

Background

EPA first finalized the PFAS Reporting Rule (40 C.F.R. Part 705) in October 2023 pursuant to Section 8(a)(7) of TSCA, which was added to TSCA by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020. Section 8(a)(7) requires EPA to promulgate a reporting rule applicable to “each person who has manufactured a chemical substance that is a [PFAS] in any year since January 1, 2011.” EPA applied Section 8(a)(7) through the October 2023 rule to impose a one-time reporting requirement on all companies that manufactured PFAS between 2011 and 2022 or that imported PFAS in any amount during that period (even in articles). EPA has since delayed the submission period for this rule twice, and that submission period is currently set to open on April 13, 2026, and close (for most manufacturers) on October 13, 2026.

As explained in our previous alert, EPA’s proposed revisions to this rule are not completely unexpected. EPA under the Trump administration has previously indicated that revisions were on the horizon, including through an April 28, 2025 press release where EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin committed the agency to implementing TSCA section 8(a)(7) “to smartly collect necessary information, as Congress envisioned and consistent with TSCA, without overburdening small businesses and article importers.”

The Proposed Exemptions

EPA is proposing to add exemptions to the rule for the following:

Imported articles. “Article” is defined in the rule at 40 C.F.R. § 705.3 and can generally be described as a finished good or component thereof with a definitive shape or design. EPA justified this exemption in the preamble by explaining that article importers are unlikely to have known or reasonably ascertainable information about the PFAS in the articles they imported during the lookback period. EPA also reasoned that Congress did not intend Section 8(a)(7) to apply to article importers and that the agency will nevertheless receive information on PFAS in articles by upstream PFAS manufacturers who will still be required to report under the rule.

De minimis PFAS concentrations. EPA explained in the preamble that the agency is “proposing a de minimis concentration exemption for reportable PFAS in mixtures or articles under which PFAS concentrations below 0.1% would be exempt from reporting.” EPA reasoned in the preamble that this exemption is justified in part because, during the lookback period, “reporters are unlikely to have records of PFAS amounts below 0.1% due to U.S. and international requirements at the time.” EPA also noted that the agency is interested in comments on whether a 1.0% de minimis exemption or another de minimis level would be more appropriate.

Byproducts, impurities, and non-isolated intermediates. EPA explained in the preamble that these exemptions would “align with existing exemptions under TSCA for substances not manufactured and used for a separate commercial purpose and is consistent with the approach taken in EPA’s [Chemical Data Reporting] rule.”

R&D chemicals. This exemption would apply to PFAS manufactured solely for R&D purposes. EPA explained in the preamble that this exemption is justified since “information on PFAS manufactured solely for R&D purposes would be limited and would provide minimal information regarding PFAS exposures and quantities in commerce.”

EPA also offered other justifications for the revisions in the preamble, including how TSCA Section 8(a)(5)(A)-(C) directs EPA, to the extent feasible, to not require unnecessary or duplicative reporting, minimize compliance costs on small manufacturers, and apply reporting obligations only to companies likely to have information relevant to the effective implementation of TSCA. EPA likewise pointed to TSCA Section 2(c), which directs EPA to carry out TSCA “in a reasonable and prudent manner” and to “consider the environmental, economic, and social impact of any action.”

Proposed Revision to the Submission Period, Clarifications and Technical Corrections

EPA is proposing that the submission period begin 60 days after the effective date of the finalized revisions and then last for three months. As EPA explained in the preamble, this revision to the submission period will “allow[] reporters to familiarize themselves with the amended rule and ensure their data are responsive to the amended rule and EPA to modify the reporting application as needed.”

EPA is also proposing a few clarifications and technical corrections to the rule, including for the scope of environmental health effects information that must be reported and the consumer and commercial product categories to be used for reporting purposes.

EPA Requests for Comment

In addition to public comments on the revisions mentioned above, EPA is soliciting comments on the following questions:

Should EPA amend the scope of reportable chemicals? For instance, EPA indicated in the preamble that the agency is receptive to feedback on the possibility of limiting reporting to PFAS with Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Numbers (CASRNs) and adding a production-volume threshold to the rule.

Should EPA modify any assumptions or cost savings calculations in its Economic Analysis? For instance, in the preamble, EPA estimated that a certain percentage of industry costs has already been accrued in preparation for reporting under the October 2023 rule. EPA is seeking comments on these types of assumptions, including sunk cost estimates.

Upon publication of the proposed revisions in the Federal Register, EPA will accept comments on the proposed changes for 45 days. Given that the impact of the proposed revisions will span across industries – especially for article importers – all affected stakeholders are encouraged to comment.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15478_5804.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 08:58:33.527951

For years, millions of Americans have watched their energy bills tick upward. (TNND)

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on Monday that most of the Department of Energy’s loan program funding will be directed toward nuclear power projects — part of a broader effort to meet growing electricity demands and drive down energy costs.

For years, millions of Americans have watched their energy bills tick upward.

From wildfires to natural gas prices, the causes behind rising energy costs vary across states. Inflation has added pressure, and now artificial intelligence is demanding a huge amount of energy. Data centers powering AI models from companies like Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft require enormous amounts of energy — prompting many of those firms to invest directly in nuclear power.

""Big tech is a key part of the piece that's going to relaunch American nuclear power,"" Wright told The National News Desk. ""They have a huge appetite for power. They want as much as they can get, not just hundreds of megawatts, but gigawatts...They're willing to sign power purchase agreements. That's the thing. You need to build a nuclear power plant. They're willing to put equity capital in front of debt from the loan program office. They're going to be absolutely essential to relaunching the nuclear renaissance.""

President Donald Trump, who campaigned on expanding U.S. energy production, has made nuclear a centerpiece of his “all-of-the-above” energy strategy. “We will embrace all forms of energy, including nuclear,” the president said earlier this year. “Nuclear’s a great energy.”

In May, Trump signed an executive order calling on the U.S. to break ground on 10 new large-scale nuclear reactors by 2030 — the first such expansion effort in decades. Currently, the United States operates 94 nuclear reactors, which provide roughly 19 percent of the country’s electricity, a share that has remained steady since the 1980s.

Wright said the administration is now reviewing potential reactor sites, with announcements expected in the coming months. “We’re looking at locations very carefully,” he said.

Last month, the administration finalized an $80 billion agreement with Westinghouse to build new reactors as part of that expansion.

Wright said the biggest challenges ahead are logistical.

“We have President Trump all in. We’re reforming the regulatory regime. We have lots of private capital and government capital to match it,” Wright said. “The problem right now is just execution — having enough workers and supply chain capacity to build these plants as quickly as we’d like.”

Trump has set a long-term goal of quadrupling U.S. nuclear capacity by 2050, a move his administration argues is essential to maintaining the country’s energy independence and supporting the rapid rise of artificial intelligence.",https://fox4beaumont.com/resources/media/c04050b9-6cb7-486d-9024-9a660179619f-Screenshot20251113at3.54.00PM.png,N,,2025-11-14 01:59:38.493848

What percentage of electric cars are on U.S. roads?

2024, 9.2% of new car registrations were for electric vehicles, according to an Experian Automotive report. This is an increase of 1.2 percentage points from 2023. If we fly higher to a bird's eye view of the roughly 292.3 million cars on the road in 2024, 1.4% of those were electric vehicles.

What is each company's EV market share?

Here are the latest EV market share percentages, from 2024 and through February 2025, according to Edmunds data. Tesla has enjoyed a comfortable lead with the highest market share over the past five years. In recent years, however, Tesla's market share has dwindled from nearly 80% in 2019 to 45.2% in February 2025 as other automakers entered the playing field and introduced more rivals for customers to choose from. Ford maintains a distant second place in market share (7%), while Chevrolet (5.5%) is in third but has made significant progress in just a few years. Volkswagen (4.2%) and Hyundai (3.8%) round out the top five currently, but these automakers could easily switch places as the year goes on.

What are the best-selling electric cars in the U.S. by percentage?

Although Tesla's market share has been falling, the electric carmaker still dominates the market. According to Experian Automotive, the Tesla Model Y was the best-selling electric car in the fourth quarter of 2024, making up 26.1% of new EVs sold. The Model 3 was second with 15%. The Honda Prologue came in third with 5.3%, and the Chevrolet Equinox EV and Ford Mustang Mach-E held fourth and fifth place with 4.7% and 4.4% market share, respectively.

Last year, Texas, as the No. 1 team, lost to Georgia at home during conference play and again in the Southeastern Conference championship. Now the two teams reunite as the No. 10 Longhorns travel to take on the No. 5 Bulldogs.

Here are the keys to the game as Texas comes off beating then-No. 9 Vanderbilt two weeks ago and after Georgia’s convincing 41-21 win against Mississippi State.

Handle the away crowd

This season, the Longhorns have only lost away games, dropping matchups against then-No. 3 Ohio State to start the year and to an unranked Florida to start conference play.

However, the Longhorns have managed to win away from home in overtime periods against Kentucky and Mississippi State and a neutral-site victory against Oklahoma in Dallas. Against the Bulldogs, the Longhorns pulled off a 17-point comeback in Starkville — known to have an intense environment with its fans ringing cowbells all game long.

If Texas is to win in Athens, Georgia, it will have to quickly adapt to the environment at Sanford Stadium.

“Obviously, this week is a heck of a challenge,” Sarkisian said. “They are a very tough team to play at home. They are 51-2 in their last 53 games at home.”

Contain the Georgia offense

The Texas defense has been one of the best in the country, ranked 22nd for yards allowed per game and 11th for points per game. On Saturday, though, they will be tasked with containing the Bulldog offense.

“They (have) a very balanced offense and attack,” Sarkisian said. “(Redshirt junior quarterback) Gunner Stockton has done a fantastic job of running that offense, creating explosive plays with his arm, with his legs. They’re running the ball effectively.”

While the Longhorn defense only allows 16.4 points per game, Stockton leads a Bulldog offense that scores 33.4 points per game. Stockton has produced 15 passing touchdowns, with only two interceptions this season, while the Texas defense has nine interceptions on the year.

Break down the rushing defense

When Sarkisian calls rushing plays on Saturday, he will have to be wary of Georgia’s 12th ranked rush defense, only allowing 100.2 rushing yards per game. It will be key for the Longhorns to open up the defense to unlock play-action and other passing plays.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on Monday that most of the Department of Energy’s loan program funding will be directed toward nuclear power projects — part of a broader effort to meet growing electricity demands and drive down energy costs.

For years, millions of Americans have watched their energy bills tick upward.

From wildfires to natural gas prices, the causes behind rising energy costs vary across states. Inflation has added pressure, and now artificial intelligence is demanding a huge amount of energy.

President Donald Trump, who campaigned on expanding U.S. energy production, has made nuclear a centerpiece of his “all-of-the-above” energy strategy. “We will embrace all forms of energy, including nuclear,” the president said earlier this year. “Nuclear’s a great energy.”

In May, Trump signed an executive order calling on the U.S. to break ground on 10 new large-scale nuclear reactors by 2030 — the first such expansion effort in decades. Currently, the United States operates 94 nuclear reactors, which provide roughly 19 percent of the country’s electricity, a share that has remained steady since the 1980s.

Wright said the administration is now reviewing potential reactor sites, with announcements expected in the coming months. “We’re looking at locations very carefully,” he said.

Last month, the administration finalized an $80 billion agreement with Westinghouse to build new reactors as part of that expansion.

Wright said the biggest challenges ahead are logistical.

“We have President Trump all in. We’re reforming the regulatory regime. We have lots of private capital and government capital to match it,” Wright said. “The problem right now is just execution — having enough workers and supply chain capacity to build these plants as quickly as we’d like.”

Trump has set a long-term goal of quadrupling U.S. nuclear capacity by 2050, a move his administration argues is essential to maintaining the country’s energy independence and supporting the rapid rise of artificial intelligence.",https://wpde.com/resources/media/c04050b9-6cb7-486d-9024-9a660179619f-Screenshot20251113at3.54.00PM.png,N,,2025-11-14 11:04:21.595351

Oregon officials acknowledge in the state’s 25-year plan that the largest driver of energy demand in Oregon in at least the next five years will be from data centers.
In future years, they expect electrification in other sectors to meet and eventually outpace demand from data centers.
One would have allowed voters in Umatilla County to exempt the county from a statewide ban on new nuclear energy facilities.
The broader energy plan Developing the Oregon Energy Strategy took two years, according to a news release from the state energy department.","As neighboring states clamor to build up or revive dormant nuclear energy sectors to meet rising demand for electricity from data centers in the next few years, Oregon’s energy future includes no such plans.

Instead, the 25-year Oregon Energy Strategy published by the state’s energy department on Wednesday focuses on policy recommendations that will by 2050 increase energy efficiency in buildings and in the industrial and transportation sectors and grow existing clean energy infrastructure. That means the state will rely on more solar, more wind and more alternative energy sources such as thermal and wave energy than fossil fuels.

Nuclear shows up just six times in the 150-page report as something that the state should study for developments and opportunities.

Max Woods, assistant director of nuclear safety and emergency preparedness at the Oregon Department of Energy, said the state is “nuclear curious,” but “taking a more cautious approach that is based on its history and tradition.”

New nuclear plants have been outlawed in Oregon since a voter-approved ballot measure passed in 1980. In 1993, the state’s only nuclear plant closed down. Although the state gets about 3% of its energy annually from a nuclear plant, it’s in Washington and run by the federal Bonneville Power Administration.

“Even if nuclear power were to come to Oregon, it takes a long time to get it through permitting — there’s a lot of security and safety review that has to happen, and for good reason, and they’re (reactors) expensive,” Woods said. “Put those factors together, and that’s a long time to come before any such facility might be built.”

Growing energy demand from data centers in Washington spurred lawmakers there recently to invest $25 million in nuclear energy project development, and Idaho has passed policies meant to clear regulatory hurdles and court private nuclear companies. California lawmakers in 2022 voted to delay closing the state’s only nuclear plant by at least five years while they evaluate potentially reversing course. These decisions are almost entirely being driven by expected demand from data centers in the next few years.

Oregon officials acknowledge in the state’s 25-year plan that the largest driver of energy demand in Oregon in at least the next five years will be from data centers. In future years, they expect electrification in other sectors to meet and eventually outpace demand from data centers. Oregon has among the largest data center markets in the world, which drove electricity consumption in the state up 20% between 2013 and 2023.

“Whether the nuclear power is built in Oregon or not — that’s the question we’re kind of grappling with right now: What the value proposition is for our state,” said Woods. “Our neighbors aren’t really wrestling with that same question.”

But in their 25-year energy planning, state officials found there were faster and more cost-effective ways to meet growing electricity demand than trying to open the state to new nuclear development.

The Oregon Legislature this year considered two proposals that would have opened the door to nuclear development in the state for the first time in decades. One would have allowed voters in Umatilla County to exempt the county from a statewide ban on new nuclear energy facilities.

Amazon data centers in eastern Oregon have caused 554% load growth at the Umatilla Electric Cooperative in just the last ten years, according to a Sightline Institute analysis of US Energy Information Administration data.

Another proposal would have directed the state energy department to study what it would take and whether it was worth developing a nuclear sector in Oregon to meet the state’s needs.

Both died in committees before receiving larger votes.

Nuclear energy does not directly produce carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases contributing to climate change, and it can produce more energy with less fuel than any other individual source of existing power, according to MIT. But in the absence of any federally designated and regulated site where spent nuclear waste can be deposited, industry growth has raised concerns for environmental and public health advocates. Most nuclear facilities store radioactive waste in lined underground storage tanks onsite.

To overrule Oregon’s nuclear ban, voters would have to repeal it or the federal government would need to create a national repository for nuclear waste.

The broader energy plan

Developing the Oregon Energy Strategy took two years, according to a news release from the state energy department. It included modeling scenarios that would prioritize affordability and reliability in the state’s energy sector while meeting demand and energy policy and climate change objectives.

Officials made adjustments to changes in federal policy under President Donald Trump, who has in the first ten months of his second term attempted to claw back billions of congressionally approved federal clean energy investments.

Policy recommendations include imposing new reporting requirements for large electricity users, such as data centers, to understand the role such users play in the state’s greenhouse gas pollution, and whether regulations are needed to bring them in line with state climate policies.

Officials recommend establishing a fund to help provide low- and no-cost loans for clean energy projects to support a transition away from fossil fuels, and to establish a state-sponsored block grant program for tribal clean energy projects. Officials also recommend implementing a road use charge for all light duty passenger vehicles, such as Amazon delivery vans, to fund programs that promote electric vehicle adoption.

The plan calls for funding incentive programs for electric bikes and electric vehicles, as well as Safe Routes to School and Great Streets initiatives that encourage bike transportation over cars. It also recommends major overhauls to transmission regulations, including a state-level commission tasked with speeding up new connections to Oregon’s grid.

Key strategy takeaways are that the most cost effective way to reduce energy demand and costs in Oregon is for lawmakers to continue to prioritize policies that accelerate building and transportation electrification. That includes cash incentives that make it more affordable to replace gas cars, gas buses, gas furnaces and appliances with electric ones, to electrify heating and cooling systems and to weatherize homes and businesses.

Models show if this continues, the state’s overall energy demand in 2050 could be 22% lower than it was in 2024, even if there is more demand for electricity in 2050 than currently exists.

Modeling also revealed that delaying policies that accelerate energy efficiency will lead to higher costs down the line given the volatility of fossil fuels markets and climate change. Officials project that in the next few decades, the costs of climate change — such as billion-dollar wildfires, droughts, floods and other extreme weather — could cost the average Oregonian about $12,000 of annual income.

“A key backdrop to this discussion is the growing cost of climate change in Oregon,” they wrote. “Even as energy costs are rising, climate change is driving additional costs for Oregon households, businesses, industries, and government.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-95/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/boardman-coal-plant-seen-from-crow-butte-1024x683-11763080227.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=kdHeT9b0,N,,2025-11-14 01:59:42.930689

Data centers powering AI models from companies like Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft require enormous amounts of energy — prompting many of those firms to invest directly in nuclear power.

""Big tech is a key part of the piece that's going to relaunch American nuclear power,"" Wright told The National News Desk. ""They have a huge appetite for power. They want as much as they can get, not just hundreds of megawatts, but gigawatts...They're willing to sign power purchase agreements. That's the thing. You need to build a nuclear power plant. They're willing to put equity capital in front of debt from the loan program office. They're going to be absolutely essential to relaunching the nuclear renaissance.""

President Donald Trump, who campaigned on expanding U.S. energy production, has made nuclear a centerpiece of his “all-of-the-above” energy strategy. “We will embrace all forms of energy, including nuclear,” the president said earlier this year. “Nuclear’s a great energy.”

In May, Trump signed an executive order calling on the U.S. to break ground on 10 new large-scale nuclear reactors by 2030 — the first such expansion effort in decades. Currently, the United States operates 94 nuclear reactors, which provide roughly 19 percent of the country’s electricity, a share that has remained steady since the 1980s.

Wright said the administration is now reviewing potential reactor sites, with announcements expected in the coming months. “We’re looking at locations very carefully,” he said.

Last month, the administration finalized an $80 billion agreement with Westinghouse to build new reactors as part of that expansion.

Wright said the biggest challenges ahead are logistical.

“We have President Trump all in. We’re reforming the regulatory regime. We have lots of private capital and government capital to match it,” Wright said. “The problem right now is just execution — having enough workers and supply chain capacity to build these plants as quickly as we’d like.”

Trump has set a long-term goal of quadrupling U.S. nuclear capacity by 2050, a move his administration argues is essential to maintaining the country’s energy independence and supporting the rapid rise of artificial intelligence.",https://wlos.com/resources/media/c04050b9-6cb7-486d-9024-9a660179619f-Screenshot20251113at3.54.00PM.png,N,,2025-11-13 23:58:54.105091

The Bank’s delegation is advocating for a pan-African climate narrative that builds on the outcomes of the African Climate Summits and previous COPs. Afreximbank’s engagements are anchored on the core principles of the AU Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want, and emphasizes the critical role of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) in building climate-resilient economies.

A central pillar of the Bank’s advocacy involves mobilising climate finance primarily to support adaptation aspirations of its member countries and ensuring the swift and effective operationalisation of the Loss and Damage Fund. The Bank is also pushing for African countries, who are disproportionately affected by climate events despite contributing less than 4% of global emissions, to receive adequate compensation and to develop the necessary domestic structures to access these funds.

Aligned with President Dr. George Elombi’s vision, Afreximbank is spotlighting the continent’s immense potential in value addition and strategic minerals processing. Instead of exporting raw materials, the Bank is championing financing for entire value chains, such as transforming the Democratic Republic of Congo’s lithium into batteries, to position Africa as a hub for clean technology and create high-skilled jobs.

The Bank is also urging for a just and equitable energy transition that recognizes Africa’s right to address its energy poverty, which leaves over 600 million people without electricity. This includes a balanced approach that integrates renewable energy sources while responsibly utilising transitional fuels like natural gas to power industrialisation.

The Bank also seeks to draw attention to Africa’s biodiversity which is a key source of climate resilience absorbing harmful emissions. Afreximbank is committed to helping its member countries to monetise their biodiversity to further help its fight against the debilitating impact of climate change.

Furthermore, Afreximbank is showcasing its financial initiatives, such as the Afreximbank Trade Transformation Fund (ATTF) as one of its key vehicles for de-risking and financing green projects across the continent.

At COP30, the Bank’s participation includes high-level dialogues, thematic panels, and side events, including activities at the African Pavilion and a planned session with Liberia on establishing a carbon markets authority.

Commenting on Afreximbank’s participation at COP30, Mrs. Kanayo Awani, Executive Vice President, Intra-African Trade and Export Development Bank at Afreximbank, stated:

“Our mission at COP30 is clear: to ensure that Africa’s voice is not only heard but heeded. Our approach is one of proactive transformation, adding value to our abundant minerals, powering our industries with a sustainable energy mix, and leveraging the AfCFTA to build resilient, integrated economies. We are leveraging our influence to mobilise Global African capital and demand a globally recognised and supported framework for our continent’s just energy transition that ensures comprehensive climate action actively serves and reinforces Africa’s ambitions for development and industrialisation.”

Summary

Article Date = 2025-11-13T09:39:00-05:00

Article URL = https://www.supplychain247.com/article/toyota-north-carolina-battery-plant-10b-us-investment

Article Image = https://www.supplychain247.com/images/2025_article/toyota-north-carolina-graphic.jpg

Toyota has begun production at its new $13.9 billion battery plant in Liberty, North Carolina — the company’s first in-house battery facility outside Japan. The site will make batteries for hybrid versions of the Camry, Corolla Cross and RAV4, and a not-yet-announced three-row electric vehicle. Toyota says the plant will eventually house 14 production lines and employ about 5,000 people.

Alongside the plant launch, Toyota confirmed plans to invest up to $10 billion in U.S. operations over the next five years, a figure previously referenced by President Trump but not formally confirmed until now. Toyota frames the move as part of a “multi-pathway” strategy that keeps hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery-electric and fuel-cell options on the table as demand patterns evolve.

Key Points

Toyota opened a $13.9bn battery plant in Liberty, North Carolina — its first in-house battery facility outside Japan.

The plant will supply batteries for hybrid Camry, Corolla Cross and RAV4 models and a future three-row EV.

Planned capacity: 14 production lines and roughly 5,000 jobs when fully ramped.

Toyota confirmed up to $10bn more investment in U.S. manufacturing over the next five years.

The announcement follows shifts in the market: EV demand has cooled while hybrid demand has risen, playing to Toyota’s strengths.

Policy context matters: the move comes amid changing U.S. rules on fuel economy and EV tax credits and has received government praise.

Toyota emphasises a multi-pathway approach (gas, hybrids, plug-ins, battery and fuel-cell tech) rather than an all-in EV bet.

Context and relevance

This is significant for several reasons. Reshoring battery manufacturing strengthens the U.S. supply chain for electrified vehicles and reduces reliance on overseas suppliers. The plant creates thousands of local jobs and will ripple out to parts suppliers, logistics providers and regional infrastructure. For the automotive market, Toyota’s bet on hybrids — backed by new domestic battery capacity — signals that the transition to all-electric vehicles may be more gradual and varied than some forecasts assume.

For procurement, manufacturing and supply-chain teams, this means planning for increased domestic battery component demand, potential shifts in supplier relationships, and nearer-term capacity for hybrid powertrains. For policy watchers, the timing highlights how regulation and tax incentives influence corporate investment choices.

Why should I read this?

Short answer: because this is where the jobs, factories and battery cells are actually being built — not just promised. Big cash, thousands of jobs, and a strategic signal from Toyota that hybrids still matter. If you work in automotive, supply chain, regional economic development or logistics, this move will affect supplier networks, hiring and investment decisions. We’ve skimmed the detail so you don’t have to — but it pays to know the specifics.

Bergeson,,,,,https://natlawreview.com/article/epa-proposes-narrow-scope-tsca-section-8a7-pfas-reporting-rule-exemptions-would,"Requests for Comment EPA requests comment on the content of this proposed rule and the Economic Analysis prepared in support of the proposed rule that will be available in the docket when the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register.
Commentary Revisions to EPA’s TSCA PFAS reporting rule were both widely expected and hotly anticipated.
Not surprisingly, the proposed rule announced Monday would exempt article importers — a savings to small businesses estimated to exceed $700 million.
Recall, however, that this is a proposed rule; time will tell what comments EPA receives and what sticks in the final rule.
EPA’s proposed rule does not appear to account for burden already incurred in its calculations of burden reduction.","On November 13, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a proposed rule to amend the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Section 8(a)(7) regulation for reporting and recordkeeping requirements for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). 90 Fed. Reg. 50923. As reported in our October 3, 2023, memorandum, the final rule requires manufacturers (including importers) of PFAS and PFAS-containing articles in any year since 2011 through 2022 to report information related to chemical identity, uses, volumes made and processed, byproducts, environmental and health effects, worker exposure, and disposal to EPA. The proposed rule would incorporate exemptions to the scope of reportable manufacturing activities for a de minimis exemption of 0.1 percent; imported articles; byproducts; impurities; research and development (R&D); and non-isolated intermediates. According to EPA’s proposed rule, these exemptions “would maintain important reporting on PFAS, consistent with statutory requirements, while exempting reporting on activities about which manufacturers are least likely to know or reasonably ascertain.” Comments are due December 29, 2025. According to the proposed rule, comments on the information collection provisions of this proposed rule under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) must be received by the Office of Management and Budget’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) on or before December 15, 2025.

Proposed Exemptions to the Scope of Reportable Manufacturing Activities

EPA proposes to add certain exemptions to the scope of reportable PFAS manufacturing activities under 40 C.F.R. Part 705. EPA states that it intends these exemptions to be similar to the TSCA Chemical Data Reporting (CDR) rule (40 C.F.R. Part 711) and, in addition, proposes to include a de minimis exemption. EPA notes that in some scenarios, more than one of the proposed exemptions may provide the same regulatory relief from reporting. For example, an importer of articles that contain low levels of PFAS may be exempt from reporting by both the imported articles and de minimis exemptions. EPA “is interested in public comments on potential means to consolidate the proposed exemptions, while providing the same regulatory relief and in public comments on the potential benefits and drawbacks of finalizing all proposed exemptions or a subset of proposed exemptions when viewed in combination.”

De Minimis

EPA proposes a de minimis concentration exemption for reportable PFAS in mixtures or articles under which PFAS concentrations below 0.1 percent would be exempt from reporting. EPA notes that this exemption would apply regardless of total production volume of the mixture or article. According to EPA, the proposed de minimis level of 0.1 percent is appropriate because of the retrospective nature of the reporting and contemporary recordkeeping practices. During the lookback period for reporting, reporters are unlikely to have records of PFAS amounts below 0.1 percent due to the U.S. and international requirements at the time for labeling and recordkeeping.

EPA states that it also proposes to exempt these de minimis concentrations of PFAS in mixtures and articles from the scope of the rule based on the Agency’s information needs under TSCA Section 8(a)(5)(A). According to EPA, it “has determined that information about such PFAS in mixtures is unnecessary, in part because EPA does not anticipate publishing an ‘inventory’ of all PFAS manufactured since 2011 such that EPA would need a complete reporting of all PFAS in U.S. markets.” EPA additionally notes that it does not anticipate evaluating PFAS that may only be manufactured in de minimis levels in the near future under TSCA.

Imported Articles

EPA proposes to exempt PFAS imported as part of an article from the scope of reportable activities. EPA states that it recognizes that importing PFAS in articles between 2011 and 2022 is an activity about which manufacturers are unlikely to have known or reasonably ascertainable information. As EPA noted in its discussion of the de minimis exemption, safety data sheet (SDS) and European Union (EU) Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation notification requirements “are not likely to have revealed the content of PFAS in imported articles during the time span covered by this retroactive reporting rule, which is a perspective shared widely by commenters and the small entity representatives to the [Small Business Advocacy Review (SBAR)] Panel.” According to EPA, it “has now reconsidered the weight of that input and now proposes to exempt importing articles in an effort to apply reporting obligations, to the extent feasible, to those persons likely to have information (TSCA section 8(a)(5)(C)).”

EPA also proposes the imported articles exemption under TSCA Section 8(a)(5)(A), “as the Agency finds that requiring retroactive reporting on importing articles with PFAS is unnecessary.” EPA states that, on balance, it “finds it unnecessary to require reporting for this activity and impose related non-reporting burden activities such as rule compliance determination and due diligence record searches when such importers are unlikely to have relevant information.”

In addition, EPA proposes that requiring reporting from importers of articles containing PFAS exceeded its authority under TSCA Section 8(a)(7). In the fiscal year (FY) 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Congress directed EPA to require reporting from “each person who has manufactured a chemical substance that is a [PFAS].” (Emphasis in original.) EPA notes that “Congress chose to target manufacturers (including importers) of the PFAS themselves, as indicated by the specific phrase ‘that is a’ (instead of a more inclusive term such as ‘contains’).”

Byproducts, Impurities, and Non-Isolated Intermediates

EPA proposes to exempt the manufacture of PFAS as byproducts, impurities, nonisolated intermediates, or upon incidental exposure, or end use of another substance or mixture from the scope of reportable activities when such substances are manufactured under conditions described in 40 C.F.R. Section 720.30(h). EPA notes that these proposed exemptions align with existing exemptions under TSCA for substances not manufactured and used for a separate commercial purpose and is consistent with the approach taken in EPA’s CDR rule. EPA states that “[o]verall, the exemptions reflect a practical application of TSCA section 8(a)(5)(C), under which EPA shall, to the extent feasible, apply reporting obligations only to those persons likely to have relevant information.” According to EPA, as proposed, the exemptions “would ensure that manufacturers remain focused on reporting PFAS with greater commercial relevance and potential exposure pathways while relieving industry of disproportionately burdensome reporting.”

Byproducts

The regulation currently requires a manufacturer of PFAS to report in separate chemical reports each PFAS that is manufactured, without exception. EPA proposes to exempt any byproduct not used for commercial purposes. “Byproduct” is defined in 40 C.F.R. Section 704.3 to mean “a chemical substance produced without a separate commercial intent during the manufacture, processing, use, or disposal of another chemical substance(s) or mixture(s).” EPA states that it proposes this exemption “because it now believes this information is unnecessary to implement its statutory obligations and potentially duplicative.” Consistent with TSCA Section 8(a)(5)(A), EPA believes it is appropriate to exempt manufacturers of PFAS as a byproduct when they are not used for a commercial purpose. EPA notes that it is interested in learning about the intended commercial uses of PFAS, including PFAS manufactured as a byproduct, and thus is not proposing to exempt manufacture of PFAS as a byproduct if it is used for a commercial purpose. According to EPA, the exemption would not apply to component substances extracted from a byproduct when the extracted substances are reportable PFAS.

Impurities

EPA proposes to exempt the manufacture of PFAS as impurities from the scope of reportable activities. EPA notes that this exemption is also incorporated in the CDR regulation. EPA states that as defined at 40 C.F.R. Section 704.3, an impurity is a chemical substance unintentionally present with another chemical substance. An impurity is not manufactured for distribution in commerce as a chemical substance per se, and it has no distinct commercial purpose apart from the substance, mixture, or article in which it is contained.

EPA proposes that, consistent with TSCA Section 8(a)(5)(A), requiring this information is unnecessary. As explained in CDR guidance, in evaluating whether a PFAS is an impurity, EPA considers the source of the substance in the manufacturing process. According to EPA, a substance arising unintentionally in a final product because it was introduced unintentionally as a component of a raw material may be considered an impurity. EPA notes that this is distinguishable from a byproduct, which is a substance formed as part of the intended chemical reaction or byproduct stream, and if intentionally retained, would not meet the definition of an impurity and may be subject to reporting.

According to EPA, there are likely no PFAS manufactured as impurities domestically, as PFAS are not likely to be unintentionally present in raw materials introduced into a process. Thus, the manufacture of PFAS as impurities would only derive from the import of materials with PFAS as impurities. EPA notes that such importers are unlikely to know about the presence of PFAS, let alone any reportable information under TSCA Section 8(a)(7). EPA states that such an exemption would therefore be consistent with TSCA Section 8(a)(5)(C), which requires EPA to, to the extent feasible, extend reporting obligations to those likely to have relevant information.

Non-Isolated Intermediates

Consistent with the proposed exemptions to align with 40 C.F.R. Section 720.30(h), EPA proposes to exempt otherwise-reportable PFAS that are non-isolated intermediates. Non-isolated intermediates, as defined at 40 C.F.R. Section 704.3, are substances manufactured and consumed within a closed system during the production of another chemical substance. These intermediates are not intentionally removed from process equipment and are not stored, packaged, or transported. EPA states that because these substances remain confined within closed systems and are not expected to be released in the environment or handled by workers, it “has determined that reporting on non-isolated intermediates is unnecessary because these intermediates do not result in meaningful human or environmental exposure.” EPA proposes this exemption consistent with TSCA Section 8(a)(5)(A). EPA notes additionally that manufacturers have generally not been required to submit reports related to the manufacture of non-isolated intermediates under TSCA. According to EPA, it has exempted non-isolated intermediates in the past, in part because such substances often are extremely difficult to identify.

R&D Chemicals

EPA proposes to exempt PFAS manufactured (including imported) in small quantities for R&D purposes. EPA highlights that the proposed exemption, while limited to PFAS manufactured solely for R&D purposes, has no threshold limit. EPA notes that “such quantities manufactured solely for R&D purposes are quantities no greater than reasonably necessary for those R&D activities.” EPA states that based on stakeholder input, it understands that information on PFAS manufactured solely for R&D purposes would be limited and would provide minimal information regarding PFAS exposures and quantities in commerce, which were the focuses of TSCA Section 8(a)(7). Pursuant to TSCA Section 8(a)(5)(A), EPA has determined information about such chemicals is unnecessary but “may consider future data calls for R&D chemicals if the Agency determines a need to do so.”

Submission Period

EPA proposes to amend the data submission period to accommodate the changes to the reporting scope in the proposed rule, with the submission period beginning 60 days after the effective date of the final rule and lasting three months. EPA states that the time it took to develop the 2023 final rule and engage with stakeholders on the content of the rule, as well as the time that has passed since promulgation of the final rule, “suggests to the Agency that reporters have had adequate time to consider how they intend to comply with the rule.” EPA notes that because no reporting will be required from article importers due to the proposed exemption, EPA proposes to remove the reporting deadline for small manufacturers that would report under the rule exclusively as article importers.

Clarifications and Technical Corrections

Scope of Environmental and Health Effects Information

EPA notes that the current rule requires the submission of exposure-related information and “all existing information concerning the environmental and health effects” of the chemical substances covered by this rule. In addition, certain information is required to be reported using the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)-harmonized template (OHT) format. EPA proposes to clarify the requirements related to reporting using the OHT format, including to propose a regulatory change to confirm that OHTs are required for unpublished study reports on the environmental and health effects of the reportable PFAS, except for exposure information provided in the fielded data elements throughout the reporting application.

Consumer and Commercial Product Categories

EPA proposes to update the names used for specific consumer and commercial product categories as required under 40 C.F.R. Section 705.15(c)(4). EPA notes that this proposed change would not alter any reporting requirements or introduce new burden but rather aims to clarify existing requirements. EPA states that it has received requests for clarification from data submitters under the CDR regulation, which uses the same product category names, so EPA proposes to clarify the names and descriptions for the same consumer and commercial article related codes in the PFAS Data Reporting Rule.

Requests for Comment

EPA requests comment on the content of this proposed rule and the Economic Analysis prepared in support of the proposed rule that will be available in the docket when the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register. In addition, EPA has provided the following list of issues on which it is specifically requesting public comment. EPA requests that commenters include materials supporting their rationale to the extent possible.

EPA is soliciting comment on the proposed 0.1 percent de minimis exemption for PFAS in mixtures and articles. EPA is also interested in comments on a 1.0 percent de minimis exemption for PFAS in mixtures and articles instead of the proposed 0.1 percent de minimis exemption, or another appropriate de minimis level.

EPA is soliciting comment on an imported articles exemption. EPA is also interested in comments on its reconsidered interpretation of the statutory language of the NDAA and whether the NDAA is best read as excluding articles from the scope of reporting.

EPA is soliciting comment on exempting certain byproducts, impurities, and non-isolated intermediates by incorporating the exemptions at 40 C.F.R. Section 720.30(h). This exemption would extend to PFAS that are manufactured upon incidental exposure or end use of another substance or mixture based on conditions described in 40 C.F.R. Section 720.30(h)(3)-(7).

EPA is soliciting comment on an exemption for manufacturing PFAS in small quantities for R&D activities.

EPA is soliciting comment on whether its proposed amendment to the data submission period is appropriate to accommodate the proposed changes to the PFAS Data Reporting Rule.

EPA is soliciting comment on the requirements related to reporting using the OHT format, including to propose a regulatory change to confirm that OHTs are required for unpublished study reports on the environmental and health effects of the reportable PFAS, except for exposure information provided in the fielded data elements throughout the reporting application. EPA states that it has not quantified and is also soliciting comment on the potential burden with the OHT requirement for unpublished study reports under 40 C.F.R. Section 705.15(f). Additionally, in response to stakeholder requests that EPA has received, EPA is soliciting comment on whether to maintain the requirement for full study reports under 40 C.F.R. Section 705.15(f) or to provide an option for a submitter to provide a robust study summary in lieu of the full study report, with the submitter to provide the full study report upon reasonable EPA request, such as when technical concerns about the data or methodology as described in the summary are identified or the Agency deems that the summary is not robust. EPA “continues to maintain its position that full study reports are necessary; however, the Agency is amenable to receiving further perspectives on this topic to further inform its understanding of stakeholder concerns.”

EPA is soliciting comment on the nature and extent of any reliance interests that may have arisen from the October 11, 2023, TSCA Section 8(a)(7) final rule.

In addition to the topics listed above and proposed in this action, EPA is also soliciting comment on specific questions discussed below:

Should EPA amend the scope of reportable chemicals? EPA is not proposing changes to the scope of reportable chemical substances but is soliciting comment on this topic. EPA states that it “is receptive to feedback on a possible means to lower burden by modifying the scope of reportable substances,” such as by limiting reporting to those PFAS with a Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number® (CAS RN®), or, in the case of a PFAS listed as confidential on the TSCA Inventory, a TSCA Accession Number or Low-Volume Exemption Number. Although EPA is not proposing to provide a production-volume threshold, EPA “is amenable to comments regarding the benefits and/or drawbacks of providing such a threshold and what would be an appropriate threshold. EPA would also be interested in comments on whether such a threshold would either make other proposed exemptions unnecessary or impact their scope, e.g., the de minimis threshold.”

Should EPA modify any assumptions or cost savings calculations in its Economic Analysis? EPA specifically seeks comments and data to consider in developing an Economic Analysis for a final rule. EPA states that in this proposed rule’s Economic Analysis, it assumes that 255 manufacturing firms have undergone all compliance determination and rule familiarization activities, and 20,985 article importers have undergone some level of compliance determination and rule familiarization since the promulgation of the final rule on October 11, 2023. Therefore, EPA estimates that approximately five percent of the estimated total industry cost for the 2023 final rule has already occurred. EPA seeks comment on its assumptions, including on the sunk costs estimates and on the assumption that the exemption for article importers and the 26 percent reduction in reporting from manufacturers would not result in a large reduction in benefits. EPA requests any information that can be provided to refine its estimates related to cost savings of this proposed action.

Commentary

Revisions to EPA’s TSCA PFAS reporting rule were both widely expected and hotly anticipated. The October 2023 final rule’s steep price tag and reach that extended far beyond the typical set of TSCA regulated entities created significant angst across the business community. These concerns were amplified by the rule’s bumpy rollout, including delays in the development of the necessary reporting tool that left EPA scrambling to extend the reporting window — not once, but twice. It was not difficult to predict that EPA would offer some course-corrections in the new Administration. Administrator Zeldin’s April 2025 PFAS announcement included a specific reference to TSCA Section 8(a)(7), vowing to implement the provision “smartly” and “without overburdening small businesses and article importers.” And in the May 2025 notice extending the reporting window for the second time, EPA foreshadowed that it was considering reopening parts of the final rule to public comment.

Not surprisingly, the proposed rule announced Monday would exempt article importers — a savings to small businesses estimated to exceed $700 million. This exemption, by far, offered the most bang-for-the-buck savings in the proposed rule, purporting to eliminate a whopping 80 percent of the 2023 final rule’s $876 million total cost. It was less clear what other exemptions, if any, EPA would choose to put into the proposed rule. EPA had previously taken a firm position that reporting exemptions were inappropriate based on a strict reading of the 2020 NDAA provision that created the impetus for action and the text of TSCA Section 8(a)(7) itself. EPA’s prior messaging suggested an overarching view that Congress intended the one-time reporting requirement to be a swift and comprehensive vehicle for EPA’s collection of large amounts of PFAS information that would accelerate the pace of efforts to address this issue.

The proposed rule marks a clear shift in EPA’s thinking and one likely to invite controversy. First, EPA no longer interprets any sort of statutory limitation to including reporting exemptions — a notable reversal. EPA now seemingly departs from its own prior argument that Section 8(a)(7) operates as freestanding, independent rulemaking authority and instead reads Section 8(a)(7) in the larger context of Section 8(a), including the provisions of TSCA Section 8(a)(5). Section 8(a)(5) mandates explicit considerations regarding burden reduction and small manufacturers. EPA also argues that the previous application of the rule to articles importers exceeded EPA’s statutory authority — a position framed narrowly, but one that could have significant implications for the decades-long interpretation by EPA that import of an article containing a chemical substance constitutes “manufacture” of that chemical under TSCA. The exemptions in the proposed rule largely align with a May 2025 industry petition that sought these changes — a petition that was withdrawn after EPA indicated it would reopen the rule. In addition to exemptions typical of other TSCA Section 8(a) reporting rules (e.g., article imports, impurities, certain byproducts), EPA also asserts inherent statutory authority to establish a “de minimis” threshold, noting that the retrospective nature of reporting and the absence of commensurate domestic and international recordkeeping requirements diminish the likelihood that a reporting requirement for de minimis quantities would actually bear any fruit, blunting or eliminating any justification for the burden on reporters. On the whole, EPA’s rationale for this and other exemptions include very thoughtful and pragmatic balancing regarding where the Agency expects to be most successful in collecting PFAS information versus areas EPA views as adding burden for little or no foreseeable benefit. EPA addresses the efficacy of testing as a source of information; we are somewhat surprised at this discussion because one cannot test in the past. At best, testing a product that was imported in 2025 might tell you what PFAS is present in the current product. A past product could have very different levels (higher or lower) of PFAS. Second, the substance and tone in the proposed rule reflect a more realistic view of the utility of the data that may be collected. This is apparent both in the extent of reporting exemptions — a significant narrowing of requirements that may or may not also reduce incoming information — and EPA’s suggestion of a potential phased or sequenced approach under which it defers additional reporting beyond the narrowed requirements in the proposed rule “until there is a clear role that such information could play to support a program mission of the Agency.” PFAS remains a dominant topic in the national conversation and has for years now been a significant focus and priority for Congress, states, industry and non-governmental organization (NGO) stakeholders, the public, and EPA across multiple administrations. It will be interesting to monitor reactions to the proposed rule and assess whether EPA’s primary focus on burden reduction will withstand the scrutiny of those who have been relentlessly advocating for more EPA action on PFAS. EPA does not offer exemptions for PFAS polymers or one specific to small businesses, although there is some overlap between some of the proposed exemptions and (in particular) import by small businesses.

As with the active/inactive reporting and quadrennial obligation under the CDR rule, this is yet another opportunity for the potential disclosure of Confidential Business Information (CBI). As always, submitters will have to consider carefully what information must be protected as CBI and how a submitter will be able to substantiate its CBI claims.

Detractors will undoubtedly decry any relief for potential reporters, but as we have discussed previously, the retrospective nature of the reporting and its significant look-back period will make it difficult to find any meaningful information in past records, especially for small quantities and content in articles. In this proposed rule, EPA explicitly acknowledges that the burden is largely felt during the research for reportable information, not in the reporting itself. Each potential reporter must — within the meaning of “reasonably ascertainable” — review records maybe over a decade old to determine if the reporter has any information that is potentially reportable. Recall, however, that this is a proposed rule; time will tell what comments EPA receives and what sticks in the final rule. Time will also tell if EPA issues future reporting requirements, either for retrospective or prospective manufacture or import.

The regulated community will no doubt breathe some collective sighs of relief. But one can assume there are also some simmering frustrations that the rollbacks came so late. Presumably a fair number of regulated entities took steps — and perhaps substantial and expensive steps — to put their business in a position to comply when the reporting window opened, only to have that deadline extended days prior (twice). EPA’s proposed rule does not appear to account for burden already incurred in its calculations of burden reduction. We may find ourselves in a similar position in 2026 when the final rule will be published if there are substantial changes and again if litigation requires EPA to make further changes to the rule.

Companies may also lament the apparent waste effort of preparing to report under the previous rule, but Bergeson & Campbell, P.C. submits that any early and/or ongoing due diligence to understand where PFAS is or may be present in your products or supply chain is time well spent. The domestic (federal and state) and international landscape of PFAS reporting and regulatory requirements is growing ever more complex by the day, and companies are urged to stay ahead of the curve. A final related note on the proposed timeframe for reporting: In a clear acknowledgement of reporters’ efforts already undertaken to prepare for the previous reporting deadline, EPA is proposing that the reporting window open just two months after publication of a final rule and stay open for only three months. For those who have not yet opened your file cabinets, now is the time. Once final, it will be a scramble to get reporting prepared and submitted.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-11/Pollution%20Microplastics%20Plastic%20Particles%20on%20Finger%20PFAS%20SMALLER.jpg.webp?itok=0qBCLjTD,N,,2025-11-14 06:59:12.553808

Key initiatives include temporary immediate expensing for manufacturing and processing buildings, reinstated and enhanced accelerated capital cost allowance rates for LNG facilities, significant expansions to the Scientific Research and Experimental Development program, and targeted incentives for clean technology, critical minerals, and carbon capture projects. Budget 2025 also addresses a technical tax concern by tightening rules on refundable tax deferrals within Canadian corporate groups.

Immediate expensing for manufacturing and processing buildings

The capital cost allowance (CCA) system enables businesses to deduct the cost of depreciable property over time, with rates designed to reflect the useful life of assets. Under current rules, manufacturing or processing buildings in Canada qualify for a combined CCA rate of 10%, 4% under Class 1, plus an additional 6% provided that at least 90% of the building’s floor space is dedicated to manufacturing or processing goods for sale or lease.

Budget 2025 introduces a temporary measure allowing immediate expensing for eligible manufacturing or processing buildings and qualifying improvements. This means taxpayers can claim a full 100% deduction in the first year the property is used for manufacturing or processing, provided the 90% usage requirement is met. Eligible additions or alterations to such buildings acquired on or after November 4, 2025 (“Budget Day”) and used before 2030 will also qualify for this accelerated deduction.

To be eligible, the property must be acquired on or after Budget Day, become available for use before 2030, and meet the 90% floor space requirement. Used property may qualify if it was not previously owned by the taxpayer or a non-arm’s-length person and was not transferred on a tax-deferred rollover basis. Recapture rules may apply if the building’s use changes after the deduction is claimed.

The measure applies to property first used before 2030. For later years, the enhanced deduction phases out: 75% for property first used in 2030 or 2031, 55% for property first used in 2032 or 2033, and no enhanced rate after 2033. After this period, the regular CCA rules will resume.

Accelerated CCA rates for LNG equipment and related buildings

The accelerated CCA for liquefied natural gas (LNG) equipment and related buildings expired at the end of 2024. Budget 2025 proposes to reinstate accelerated CCA for property acquired on or after Budget Day and before 2035, provided it is used in low-carbon LNG facilities. Eligibility will depend on meeting new emissions performance standards. Facilities in the top 25% for emissions performance will qualify for the same accelerated rates previously available, 30% for LNG equipment and 10% for non-residential buildings. Facilities in the top 10% will qualify for an enhanced rate of 50% for LNG equipment and 10% for related buildings. Facilities outside the top 25% will not be eligible. Details on the emissions performance requirements will be released at a later date.

Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) tax credit

The SR&ED tax incentive program allows businesses to deduct qualifying expenditures in the year they are incurred and generally claim an investment tax credit. Under current rules, Canadian-controlled private corporations (CCPCs) can claim a fully refundable investment tax credit at an enhanced rate of 35% on up to $3 million of qualifying SR&ED expenditures annually. This expenditure limit is phased out for CCPCs with taxable capital employed in Canada between $10 million and $50 million in the previous year and is shared among associated corporations.

The 2024 Fall Economic Statement proposed increasing the expenditure limit to $4.5 million and raising the taxable capital phase-out thresholds to $15 million and $75 million. Budget 2025 confirms these changes and further increases the expenditure limit for the enhanced 35% refundable credit to $6 million. These measures apply to taxation years beginning on or after December 16, 2024. Budget 2025 also extends eligibility for the 35% refundable credit to certain Canadian public corporations and restores eligibility for specific capital expenditures under the SR&ED program.

In addition to legislative changes, Budget 2025 announces significant administrative reforms to improve program efficiency. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) will introduce an elective pre-claim approval process to provide upfront technical approval of eligible projects, cutting review times for these claims to 90 days from 180 days. The CRA will also increase the use of artificial intelligence to streamline low-risk claims, eliminate unnecessary steps, and reduce burdensome information requirements. These administrative changes are expected to take effect April 1, 2026, alongside targeted consultations to further modernize the program, including a review of Form T661.

Clean economy and climate competitiveness strategy

Budget 2025 reinforces Canada’s commitment to building a clean economy by introducing a climate competitiveness strategy aimed at creating an investment environment that positions Canadian businesses to compete globally. A key component of this strategy is the continued use of targeted tax incentives to accelerate the adoption of clean energy and technology.

Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage Investment Tax Credit (CCUS ITC)

The CCUS ITC provides a refundable credit of up to 60% for eligible costs incurred to acquire or install equipment used in qualifying carbon capture projects where captured carbon dioxide is put to an approved use. The credit rate varies based on the type of equipment and the timing of the expenditure.

For expenditures incurred from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2030, full rates apply:

60% for equipment used in direct air capture projects;

50% for equipment used in other carbon capture projects; and

37.5% for transportation, storage, and utilization equipment.

Initially, these rates were scheduled to drop by half starting in 2031. However, Budget 2025 extends the full rates until December 31, 2035, after which reduced rates will apply for expenditures incurred between 2036 and 2040.

Additionally, Budget 2025 postpones the Government’s planned review of the CCUS ITC. Instead of conducting the review before 2030 as announced in the 2022 Federal Budget, the review will now occur before 2035.

Clean Technology Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit (CTM ITC)

The CTM ITC provides a refundable credit of 30% on eligible capital costs for property used in clean technology manufacturing. The credit applies to property acquired and available for use after December 31, 2023, and before January 1, 2035, provided the property is used in a qualifying manufacturing activity.

A qualifying use includes activities that produce all or substantially all qualifying materials, which currently include lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, rare earth elements, and graphite. The credit begins to phase out gradually, starting in 2032.

To encourage investment in the extraction, processing, and recycling of critical mineral co-products and by-products, Budget 2025 proposes to expand the list of critical minerals eligible for this investment tax credit to include antimony, indium, gallium, germanium, and scandium.

This expanded definition applies to clean technology manufacturing property acquired and available for use on or after Budget Day.

Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (CE ITC)

The CE ITC is a refundable tax credit equal to 15% of the capital cost of eligible property used for low-emission electricity generation, electricity storage, and interprovincial or territorial transmission infrastructure. The credit applies to property acquired and available for use on or after April 16, 2024, for projects that began construction on or after March 28, 2023. Under existing rules, the capital cost of eligible property is reduced by any government or non-government assistance received.

Budget 2025 introduces two significant changes.

First, the Canada Growth Fund (CGF) is now recognized as a qualifying entity for the CE ITC, acknowledging its role as an equity investor in clean electricity projects. Importantly, financing provided by the CGF will not reduce the capital cost of an eligible property for the purpose of calculating the credit. This measure aligns with similar treatment previously granted to the Canada Infrastructure Bank. These changes apply to property acquired and available for use on or after Budget Day.

Second, Budget 2025 removes conditions previously imposed on provincial and territorial Crown corporations to be eligible, which required jurisdictions to commit to achieving net-zero by 2050, pass credit benefits to ratepayers, and meet public reporting requirements. These changes are expected to apply retroactively to property acquired and available for use since April 16, 2024.

Finally, Budget 2025 announces the Government’s intention to consult Canadians on introducing domestic content requirements for both the CE ITC and the Clean Technology Investment Tax Credit. Further details on this consultation will be provided at a later date. Legislation to implement the CE ITC is expected soon, with retroactive application anticipated.

Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit (CMETC)

Flow-through shares allow qualifying corporations to renounce certain exploration expenses to investors, enabling those investors to deduct the expenses in calculating their taxable income. The CMETC provides an additional benefit by granting a non-refundable tax credit equal to 30% of specified Canadian exploration expenses incurred in mining activities primarily targeting designated critical minerals.

Currently, critical minerals eligible for the CMETC include nickel, cobalt, graphite, copper, rare earth elements, vanadium, tellurium, gallium, scandium, titanium, magnesium, zinc, platinum group metals, uranium, and lithium (including lithium from brines). Budget 2025 expands this list to include bismuth, cesium, chromium, fluorspar, germanium, indium, manganese, molybdenum, niobium, tantalum, tin, and tungsten. Once enacted, Canadian exploration expenses related to these minerals will qualify for the credit if renounced under a flow-through share agreement. This expanded eligibility applies to agreements entered into after Budget Day and on or before March 31, 2027.

The definition of Canadian Exploration Expense (CEE)

CEE represents a category of deductible costs that mining corporations can transfer to investors through flow-through shares. Investors who acquire these shares are entitled to claim a 100% immediate deduction for the renounced CEE when calculating taxable income and may qualify for further incentives, such as the flow-through mining expenditure tax credit or the CMETC.

Under current provisions of the Tax Act, CEE includes expenses incurred to determine the quality of a mineral resource in Canada. Budget 2025 proposes to amend these rules to clarify that such expenses do not include costs related to assessing the economic viability or engineering feasibility of the resource. This clarification is intended to nullify the impact of the recent British Columbia Supreme Court decision in Seabridge Gold Inc. v. British Columbia (2025 BCSC 558), which held that “quality” could encompass expenses related to determining economic viability under the provincial equivalent of CEE. The proposed amendment will apply as of Budget Day.

Refundable tax on investment income and proposed changes

Canadian-controlled private corporations (CCPCs) and substantive CCPCs pay a refundable tax on investment income, which can later be recovered when taxable dividends are paid, based on the assumption that individual shareholders will be taxed on those dividends. Under existing rules, an additional refundable tax under Part IV of the Tax Act applies to private corporations and certain non-private corporations that receive taxable dividends from a “connected corporation” (generally where the recipient controls the payer or owns more than 10% of its voting shares and value) if the payer is entitled to a refund of its own refundable taxes.

Currently, if the recipient corporation’s balance-due day for this additional tax falls after the payer corporation’s balance-due day for the year in which the dividend was paid, the payment of refundable tax can effectively be deferred. This deferral can be extended by moving dividends through a chain of connected corporations with different year ends.

Budget 2025 seeks to curb this deferral strategy by introducing a rule for dividends paid between affiliated corporations (as defined under existing Tax Act affiliation rules). Under the proposal, the payer corporation’s refund would be suspended if the recipient corporation’s balance-due day for the year in which the dividend is received is later than the payer’s balance-due day. This measure would apply to dividends paid in taxation years beginning on or after Budget Day.

Two exceptions are proposed:

Acquisition of control: Dividends paid by a corporation that undergoes an acquisition of control within 30 days of payment will be exempt. This accommodates pre-closing dividends often paid during share sale transactions, which could otherwise be caught by the rule due to the deemed year-end triggered by the acquisition.

Subsequent dividend payments: Where each recipient corporation in the chain pays a dividend on or before its own balance-due day, the rule will not apply, as no deferral would occur in such cases.

Missing measures

Two anticipated tax measures that we noted in our Post 2025-election – Tax policies expected under the new Canadian Government, were absent from Budget 2025:

the introduction of an innovation-focused flow-through share regime, and

a patent box regime.

These omissions are significant because both initiatives were highlighted in the Liberal Party’s April 2025 election platform. The proposed flow-through share regime was expected to support sectors such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotechnology, and advanced manufacturing, modeled on the existing regime for mining exploration companies. Similarly, the patent box regime, designed to encourage the commercialization of intellectual property in Canada, was the subject of a Department of Finance consultation in 2024 alongside the SR&ED program. Budget 2025 provides no indication as to whether these proposals have been deferred or abandoned.",https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/dlapiperukl0cbf-dlapiperba5d-devd44d-3fa6/media/project/dlapiper-tenant/dlapiper/brand-images/dla-piper-og-image-default-logo.jpg?h=1302&iar=0&w=2500,N,,2025-11-14 04:59:39.536508

Funded through the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, the REM Program aims to strengthen Somerville’s rental housing stock by incentivizing small landlords to complete energy-efficiency and decarbonization projects. The program is designed to complement existing Mass Save incentives and make it easier for property owners to pursue improvements that benefit both landlords and renters.

“Somerville is committed to increasing energy efficiency in every home, including the many rental units that make our community vibrant and accessible,” said Mayor Ballantyne. “This program provides an extra boost for landlords making green upgrades — a win for property owners, a win for tenants, and a win for our climate goals.”

Benefits of participating include:

Increased property value

Access to additional state incentives

Improved tenant comfort and retention

A healthier, more efficient home environment

Because tenants often pay utility costs directly, rental units can lag behind owner-occupied homes in pursuing energy improvements — even with strong state incentives. The REM Program helps close that gap by offering supplemental funding for eligible projects in small multifamily buildings (2–4 units).

To receive a microgrant, projects must meet program eligibility requirements, submit all required documentation, and be completed by November 2, 2026.

For the uninitiated, retrofitting involves removing the old internal combustion engine from a diesel bus and replacing it with an electric motor, battery system, and associated components. According to the RTC official, Kalyani Powertrain approached APSRTC with the proposal for retrofitting, following which a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between the two parties to convert one bus as part of a pilot project. ""For retrofitment, a seven-year-old Super Luxury bus has been selected, and the firm is expected to complete the work within three months,"" the official said, adding that after conversion, the bus can operate for the remaining eight years as an electric AC service. The official also informed that the range of the retrofitted bus will be around 200 kilometres on a full charge. A similar retrofitted bus, ‘Saptagiri,' is already operating successfully on the Tirupati–Kanipakam route in Chittoor district.

For years, millions of Americans have watched their energy bills tick upward. (TNND)

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on Monday that most of the Department of Energy’s loan program funding will be directed toward nuclear power projects — part of a broader effort to meet growing electricity demands and drive down energy costs.

For years, millions of Americans have watched their energy bills tick upward.

From wildfires to natural gas prices, the causes behind rising energy costs vary across states. Inflation has added pressure, and now artificial intelligence is demanding a huge amount of energy. Data centers powering AI models from companies like Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft require enormous amounts of energy — prompting many of those firms to invest directly in nuclear power.

""Big tech is a key part of the piece that's going to relaunch American nuclear power,"" Wright told The National News Desk. ""They have a huge appetite for power. They want as much as they can get, not just hundreds of megawatts, but gigawatts...They're willing to sign power purchase agreements. That's the thing. You need to build a nuclear power plant. They're willing to put equity capital in front of debt from the loan program office. They're going to be absolutely essential to relaunching the nuclear renaissance.""

President Donald Trump, who campaigned on expanding U.S. energy production, has made nuclear a centerpiece of his “all-of-the-above” energy strategy. “We will embrace all forms of energy, including nuclear,” the president said earlier this year. “Nuclear’s a great energy.”

In May, Trump signed an executive order calling on the U.S. to break ground on 10 new large-scale nuclear reactors by 2030 — the first such expansion effort in decades. Currently, the United States operates 94 nuclear reactors, which provide roughly 19 percent of the country’s electricity, a share that has remained steady since the 1980s.

Wright said the administration is now reviewing potential reactor sites, with announcements expected in the coming months. “We’re looking at locations very carefully,” he said.

Last month, the administration finalized an $80 billion agreement with Westinghouse to build new reactors as part of that expansion.

Wright said the biggest challenges ahead are logistical.

“We have President Trump all in. We’re reforming the regulatory regime. We have lots of private capital and government capital to match it,” Wright said. “The problem right now is just execution — having enough workers and supply chain capacity to build these plants as quickly as we’d like.”

Trump has set a long-term goal of quadrupling U.S. nuclear capacity by 2050, a move his administration argues is essential to maintaining the country’s energy independence and supporting the rapid rise of artificial intelligence.",https://upnorthlive.com/resources/media/c04050b9-6cb7-486d-9024-9a660179619f-Screenshot20251113at3.54.00PM.png,N,,2025-11-13 22:57:46.900716

The legislation's introduction came ahead of a December session in which lawmakers and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer plan to enact economic development measures after recently stopping a scheduled final $500 million transfer into a business-attraction incentives fund and not continuing future automatic deposits.

House Bill 5293 would let a business qualify, for up to 10 years, for a credit equal to 50% of income tax attributable to a qualified new job — defined as one in excess of the number of jobs the employer has as of Sept. 30, 2025, and that pays at least 150% of median regional wage.

Of the $50 million limit, $10 million would be for businesses with under 100 employees, $15 million for companies with between 100 and 999 workers and $25 million for employers with at least 1,000 employees. Credits would be prorated if claims exceed the caps.

HB 5292 would scale back Republican House Speaker Matt Hall's proposal to end refundable Michigan Economic Growth Authority tax credits owed to the automakers and some other companies, which are worth an estimated $2.5 billion and are expected to expire in 2030.

Under the legislation, outstanding credits would be claimed in equal installments over the next 10 years, double the current timeframe. The businesses would not qualify if they fail to maintain at least 95% of the jobs they had as of Sept. 30, 2025.

""This is not upfront money,"" Rep. Mark Tisdel, R-Rochester Hills, said of the new job-creation incentive. ""This is incentives based on performance. It is not limited to simply large employers. Every employer from Main Street right on up to the Renaissance Center in Detroit can participate. It's not giving away or digging into our base. It's crediting against incremental (job) growth. So we're not mortgaging the future.""

Mike Johnston, executive vice president of government affairs and workforce development for the Michigan Manufacturers Association, criticized the MEGA bill.

""An agreement between a job provider and the state ought to be a deal,"" he said, saying it sends ""a message that Michigan is an unstable place to make a deal for those companies who are in Michigan or companies thinking about coming to Michigan."" He also questioned the legality of such as move, as he has done previously.

Johnston welcomed the job-creation measure as a sign that the Legislature wants the state to ""be in the game"" to compete for new jobs, but he said the $50 million in incentives must be ""much bigger"" if Michigan is to land ""transformational investment.""

Whitmer, a Democrat, has called for reviving, and changing, a Gov. Rick Snyder-era tax incentive for job creation that legislators let lapse in 2019 after six projects were authorized. Legislation that stalled in 2024 would have let businesses capture up to 100% of income taxes from new jobs — at least 25 jobs paying 175% of the regional median or a minimum 250 jobs equal to 150% of the regional median under legislation proposed in the last two-year term. The overall cost would have been limited to $125 million a year.

""This is our good-faith attempt to try to do something by the end of the year,"" Hall said, referencing a budget-related deal to pass an economic development package before January.

But none of the “big four” US broadcasters – CBS, NBC, ABC and Fox – appear to currently have teams present at the talks.
The Guardian has contacted all four major broadcasters for comment.
If that is the case, publications seem to be deprioritizing climate coverage.
Perhaps due in part to workforce reductions, US broadcasters’ climate coverage has been on the decline.","Thousands of media professionals are at the United Nations climate talks in Brazil. Almost none of them appear to be from the four major US broadcasters.

Nearly 4,000 members of the media registered to attend the global climate conference, known as Cop30, according to a preliminary list released by the United Nations climate body on Tuesday. But none of the “big four” US broadcasters – CBS, NBC, ABC and Fox – appear to currently have teams present at the talks.

According to the list, no representatives from CBS, NBC or Fox signed up to attend the talks. Two US staffers from ABC signed up to attend, and though they are reporting on the summit, it is unclear if they are in Brazil.

The big four television outlets also appear not to be covering the climate negotiations in a significant way. In a review of TV coverage of Cop30 shared exclusively with the Guardian, the non-profit Media Matters found that weekday morning and evening national news shows on ABC, CBS and NBC had not covered Cop30 from 6 November through 11 November. Fox News aired two segments that totalled roughly five minutes of coverage, one of which promoted “anti-climate narratives”, Media Matters said.

The Guardian has contacted all four major broadcasters for comment.

It was “unimaginable” that major western broadcasters would choose to sit out the talks, said Stefano Wrobleski, director of InfoAmazonia, a non-profit independent media outlet focused on the Amazonian region.

“I can’t see how or why an outlet with funds would choose not to come to Brazil for this,” he said. “We are here and we have a much smaller budget than the big outlets in the US.”

This year, the US has failed to send a delegation to the UN climate talks for the first time. Donald Trump, who calls climate action a “scam”, pulled the US from the Paris climate agreement in January.

But the absence of US officials should not be an excuse to ignore the talks, said Wrobleski.

“News is still happening here,” he said. “It’s not as though because Trump isn’t here, because the US didn’t send a delegation, this is not newsworthy.”

Mark Hertsgaard, executive director of the New York-based Covering Climate Now, of which the Guardian is a founding member, said he immediately noticed the lack of US-based TV news reporters at Cop30.

“Most climate journalists I’ve spoken with privately want to be here – it’s their newsroom managers and corporate bosses who’ve decided against it,” he told the Guardian. “The rationale is usually budgets – it costs money to fly journalists to Belém, house them, etc.”

News budgets are shrinking in the US amid slowed advertising growth, but “how newsrooms spend their limited budgets still reflects the editorial priorities of those newsrooms”, said Hertsgaard, who added that the scaling back comes amid visible evidence of the dangers of the climate crisis in recent weeks with the typhoon in the Philippines and Hurricane Melissa in Jamaica.

Logistical issues have made it difficult for some attending Cop30 to find affordable lodging. But there is “no good reason”, Hertsgaard said, that those challenges should have stopped major US outlets from attending.

“It’s difficult and expensive to go to any Cop, and not only Cop, but so many major events,” he said, adding that there was “too much of a narrative” that a city such as Belém was “not the richest”.

If that is the case, publications seem to be deprioritizing climate coverage. That includes large TV networks, several of which have seen major layoffs in recent years. Climate reporting has been harshly affected by outlets’ staffing cuts. Last month, CBS reportedly laid off most of its climate team shortly after the arrival of its controversial new editor-in-chief, Bari Weiss. Environmental reporters and editors have also been cut from publications from CNN and the LA Times, to HuffPost and Vice.

Perhaps due in part to workforce reductions, US broadcasters’ climate coverage has been on the decline. Last year, US corporate broadcast networks aired 12 hours and 51 minutes of climate coverage in 2024, according to a separate analysis from Media Matters – a 25% decline in volume of coverage from 2023.

InfoAmazonia did not just send a team to cover Cop30: Wrobleski and his team also organized accommodations for more than a dozen Indigenous and local journalists from around the Amazon region to stay. The group is staying in a house 20 minutes from the Cop venue, where the organizers are hosting briefings with social movements, political leaders and others.

“We’ve managed to come here. We’ve managed to bring much smaller outlets here,” he said.

It would have been well worth the effort for outlets to send teams to the talks, Wrobleski said. “It’s the first Cop in the Amazon, and the whole city is alive with Cop,” he said. “They’re missing a lot.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b3caea0681e04e2e1a1bcef0a605731fc6e8dd2/698_0_6984_5587/master/6984.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9bad10171fd3488de7a3026d9a16bd8e",N,,2025-11-13 21:01:14.700335

The close vote Nov. 12 capped a contentious debate over the environmental and economic consequences of widening and lengthening riparian buffers to shade streams.

Forest landowners will lose $2.8 billion in harvestable timber because of the new buffers, according to a University of Washington analysis.

Ten state representatives, five Democrats and five Republicans, questioned whether the board had thoroughly examined the social costs. And the Environmental Protection Agency said the bigger buffers are not needed to meet the Clean Water Act.

But the Department of Ecology championed wider and longer buffers. The buffers will keep timber harvests from warming water temperatures in most cases, according to Ecology.

“Not taking action is not an option,” said Ecology Director Casey Sixkiller, a member of the forest board.

Water-quality standards already require streams to stay cool. By demanding no change in temperatures, Ecology is setting an impossible standard, Washington Forest Protection Association executive director Jason Spadaro said.

“That sets a very significant precedent for the state of Washington, and we should all be concerned,” he said. “How do we have any land-use activity?”

Ken Miller of the Washington Farm Forestry Association, which represents small forestland landowners, said the rule was political. “It is 100% about saving trees, not science,” he said.

The rule goes into effect Aug. 31, 2026. Currently, buffers are generally 50 feet over half the length of a stream without fish. The new rule will require 75-foot buffers along longer stretches.

The buffers will not apply to agriculture, but farm groups are concerned Ecology’s push to widen buffers will renew talk of mandatory riparian buffers on farmland.

The Department of Agriculture was the only state agency to vote against the bigger buffers. Assistant Director Kelly McLain warned against cutting into working lands. “I have never seen a buffer get less restrictive,” she said.

The Department of Natural Resources, Department of Fish and Wildlife and Department of Commerce joined Ecology in voting for the bigger buffers. Three board members appointed to represent the public also voted for the buffers.

Four public members joined McLain in voting “no.”

Board member Steve Barnowe-Meyer, a small forestland owner, said fixed-width buffers are an inept way to shade streams.

“A lot of these trees don’t help create cool water,” he said. “We’re better than this. We should be able to produce a solution better than this one.”",https://capitalpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/11/Forest-Buffers-copy.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 01:58:57.835479

But opponents say federal law requires a balancing act for managing the reserve that includes environmental considerations and protections.

The U.S. Interior Department said the final rule would be published next week but announced it is repealing rules put in place last year. Those rules restricted future leasing and industrial development in areas within the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska designated as special for wildlife, subsistence or other values.

Thursday's announcement is in line with an Alaska-specific executive order President Donald Trump signed upon his return to office. The order sought to unravel policies put in place by his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, that state political leaders complained had limited Alaska’s ability to develop its vast energy resources, including oil and gas.

The Biden-era rules also had called for the Interior Department to evaluate regularly whether to designate new special areas or to boost protections in those areas. They cited rapidly changing conditions in the Arctic — such as melting permafrost and changes in plant life and wildlife corridors — due to climate change. The agency under Biden said the rules would not affect existing leases or operations, including the large Willow oil project, but would “raise the bar” for future development.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in June said the Biden-era rules were at odds with a leasing program mandate for the petroleum reserve and prioritized “obstruction over production.”

There has been longstanding debate over where oil and gas should be developed within the reserve. Supporters cite the petroleum reserve’s name to underscore their point that it’s a place for drilling. But opponents say federal law requires a balancing act for managing the reserve that includes environmental considerations and protections.

The reserve, roughly the size of Indiana, was set aside more than a century ago as an emergency oil supply for the U.S. Navy. It’s been overseen by the Interior Department since the 1970s.

Biden had angered many environmentalists when his administration approved Willow in the northeast portion of the reserve in 2023. Development of that project has being ongoing.

The most recent lease sale for the reserve was in 2019. A law passed earlier this year by Congress calls for at least five sales within the reserve over a 10-year period.

Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, an advocacy group that includes leaders from Alaska's petroleum-rich North Slope, has seen responsible development as important for the economic wellbeing of communities in the region. Members expressed concerns during the Biden administration that their views weren't being heard, and lauded Thursday's announcement.

Josiah Patkotak, North Slope Borough mayor, in a statement called repealing the rules “a meaningful step toward restoring a federal process that respects local knowledge and leadership.”

But environmentalists criticized the administration's decision as short-sighted. Erik Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice, in a statement called it “another example of how the Trump administration is trying to take us back in time with its reckless fossil fuels agenda.”

“This would sweep aside common-sense regulations aimed at more responsibly managing the Western Arctic’s irreplaceable lands and wildlife for future generations,” he said.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/AP25317779316732_Cropped,N,,2025-11-13 20:00:29.967130

The agency under Biden said the rules would not affect existing leases or operations, including the large Willow oil project, but would “raise the bar” for future development.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in June said the Biden-era rules were at odds with a leasing program mandate for the petroleum reserve and prioritized “obstruction over production.”

There has been longstanding debate over where oil and gas should be developed within the reserve. Supporters cite the petroleum reserve’s name to underscore their point that it’s a place for drilling. But opponents say federal law requires a balancing act for managing the reserve that includes environmental considerations and protections.

The reserve, roughly the size of Indiana, was set aside more than a century ago as an emergency oil supply for the U.S. Navy. It’s been overseen by the Interior Department since the 1970s.

Biden had angered many environmentalists when his administration approved Willow in the northeast portion of the reserve in 2023. Development of that project has being ongoing.

The most recent lease sale for the reserve was in 2019. A law passed earlier this year by Congress calls for at least five sales within the reserve over a 10-year period.

Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, an advocacy group that includes leaders from Alaska's petroleum-rich North Slope, has seen responsible development as important for the economic wellbeing of communities in the region. Members expressed concerns during the Biden administration that their views weren't being heard, and lauded Thursday's announcement.

Josiah Patkotak, North Slope Borough mayor, in a statement called repealing the rules “a meaningful step toward restoring a federal process that respects local knowledge and leadership.”

But environmentalists criticized the administration's decision as short-sighted. Erik Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice, in a statement called it “another example of how the Trump administration is trying to take us back in time with its reckless fossil fuels agenda.”

“This would sweep aside common-sense regulations aimed at more responsibly managing the Western Arctic’s irreplaceable lands and wildlife for future generations,” he said.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/AP25317779316732_Cropped,N,,2025-11-13 21:01:00.693081
,IRA Tax Credits,2025-11-14 00:05:40+00:00,Latitude Media,Report: Most solar and wind projects are safe harbored | Latitude Media,"Maeve Allsup, Bianca Giacobone, Shayle Kann, Alexander C. Kaufman",,,,,https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/report-most-solar-and-wind-projects-are-safe-harbored/,"According to a report out this week from PPA marketplace LevelTen Energy, 76% of solar projects and 86% of wind projects slated to come online by the end of 2028 are already safe-harbored.
The final OBBB was a little more lenient on clean energy tax credits than earlier iterations of the legislation.
Just 38% of solar projects and 16% of wind projects slated to come online in 2029 and beyond have locked in tax credit eligibility by commencing construction.
Energy storage projects can continue to qualify for both the 48E investment tax credit and the 45Y production tax credit under the original Inflation Reduction Act timelines.
Wind and solar developers, whose tax credit eligibility will have phased out by mid-next year, may not have to worry.","In the five months since the passage of the GOP’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” slashed domestic clean energy incentives, the U.S. clean energy sector has moved rapidly to safe harbor wind and solar projects.

According to a report out this week from PPA marketplace LevelTen Energy, 76% of solar projects and 86% of wind projects slated to come online by the end of 2028 are already safe-harbored. Those projects account for around 33 gigawatts of capacity eligible for tax credits.

The final OBBB was a little more lenient on clean energy tax credits than earlier iterations of the legislation. The law gave wind and solar projects until July 4, 2026 to “commence construction” — which would allow them an additional four years to build and come online, and still qualify for the credits. According to updated guidance from the Treasury Department, projects must have started physical work to qualify; prior guidance allowed projects that had spent at least 5% of their total costs to be classified as having started construction.

Solar stocks soared in mid-August after a leaked copy of the new guidance indicated the Treasury declined to go as far as some in the Trump administration had hoped to curb the use of safe harbor. The agency declined to shorten the four-year safe harbor period, and also confirmed that construction could begin offsite.

In the wake of the guidance, shares in manufacturers like First Solar and Enphase, as well as in developers like Sunrun, surged. And at least in the short-term, it looks like the stock market’s optimism was well-placed. But beyond 2028, the number of safe-harbored projects plunges dramatically. Just 38% of solar projects and 16% of wind projects slated to come online in 2029 and beyond have locked in tax credit eligibility by commencing construction.

Meanwhile, in both the short- and longer-term, the outlook for energy storage is strong. The technology emerged largely unscathed from the OBBB, avoiding the early phase-out of tax credits that hit both wind and solar. Energy storage projects can continue to qualify for both the 48E investment tax credit and the 45Y production tax credit under the original Inflation Reduction Act timelines.

According to LevelTen’s survey, storage and hybrid asset development are on a steep upward trajectory, and will grow by more than ten-fold in the next five years, from 3% of developers’ pipelines in 2026 to 43% by 2030.

By that year, storage and hybrid projects are projected to surpass standalone wind and solar pipelines. And beyond 2030, hybrid development plans “exceed all other technologies by a substantial margin.”

Challenges remain

Even for those projects that have secured tax credit eligibility, however, significant hurdles remain before they’re sending power to the grid. Projects must still navigate myriad uncertainties, including permitting challenges and interconnection queues, rising costs, and lack of available components and labor.

Of particular concern for many developers are the forthcoming “foreign entity of concern” rules, which will expand restrictions on eligibility for certain tax credits.

The definition of a foreign entity of concern outlined in OBBB spanned dozens of pages, reaching a huge range of companies with direct and indirect ties to China, North Korea, and Iran. But the restrictions go beyond just the companies incorporated in those countries or on a U.S. government list; significant questions remain, which is why developers are anxiously awaiting Treasury’s upcoming guidance.

That guidance will, in theory, outline how to determine whether suppliers are “foreign influenced entities,” for example, Power Brief CEO Jason Clark explained on a Latitude Dispatch earlier this year.

However, given the timelines for FEOC compliance, the forthcoming guidance may actually be most influential for storage projects. Energy storage must meet a 55% threshold — of components that do not come from a prohibited entity — by January 2026. That jumps to 60% in 2027, and up to 75% in 2030. Wind and solar developers, whose tax credit eligibility will have phased out by mid-next year, may not have to worry.",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-11-13T185551.985.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 20:00:44.160326

So today, in writing about sustainability certifications, I begin with berries. Once, I attended a marketing team meeting to review the packaging for a clamshell of heirloom strawberries. The lead designer had added the words “Gluten Free” to the label, and I threw a fit.

This would’ve been eight or 10 years ago, around the time that Vox declared “The gluten-free craze is out of hand.” Why, I asked our designer, would we point out that an inherently gluten-free item lacked gluten? Since when had any piece of raw, unprocessed, whole fruit ever contained gluten? The designer argued that gluten-free products were selling faster than ever before. This was absolutely true, I conceded. But that was no reason to clutter up the label, given how little room we had to convey how special these tiny, intensely fragrant strawberries were. Furthermore, the callout was likely to confuse consumers, and make them wonder if fruit could contain gluten. Eventually, the company VP joined us, and I won the battle of the Mara des Bois strawberry package.

Let’s talk about sustainable seals of approval.

There’s been a big uptick in the number of labels and certifications available for products over recent years. In theory, these words and symbols guide consumers as they search for berries, leggings, mattresses, food-storage containers, paint, and so much more. In practice, their meaning isn’t always clear.

Today, I want to talk you through three sustainability certifications you’re likely to encounter. These are 1% for the Planet, B Corp, and The Climate Label (formerly known as Climate Neutral Certified). I’ll give you an overview of what these certifications mean, and tell you about a few companies that boast at least two of the three. One thing to remember, however: Don’t necessarily write off a brand if these certifications are absent. But more on that later.

B Corp: An Introduction

Essentially a stamp of good corporate citizenship, B Corp Certification measures “a company’s entire social and environmental impact.” B Corp states that the certification shows “that a business is meeting high standards of verified performance, accountability, and transparency on factors from employee benefits and charitable giving to supply chain practices and input materials.”

To become a Certified B Corp, a company must go through a 13-step process that can take months or years — and receive a total score of 80 points or higher on the B Impact Assessment created byB Lab Global, the non-profit that verifies the assessments and certifies B Corps. (Per B Lab, the median score for businesses is 50.9., well short of the 80 points that would be needed to achieve certification.) Companies that achieve certification must then recertify every three years. The assessment assigns scores for Governance, Workers, Community, Environment, and Customers. Around 9,500 companies worldwide are B Corps, about a third of those in the U.S.

Changes at B Corp?

You can easily search for B Corps. (I have that page bookmarked in my browser and like to nerd out by looking at B Corp assessments. But that’s probably just me…). While I haven’t been able to find a breakdown of averages, most companies seem to score under 100. Anything over perhaps 120 really makes me take notice. Bluedot favorite Dr. Bronner’s has the highest B score of all: 206.7. However, the soapmaker won’t be a B Corp for long.

Earlier this year, Dr. Bronner’s announced that it will not seek recertification, “citing weak standards that enable greenwashing and purpose-washing by multinationals.” Per the release, “The increasing certification of multinationals including Unilever Australia and Nespresso in 2022 followed by Nestle Health Sciences in 2023 demonstrated that B Lab is not committed to protecting the integrity of the B Corp Certification and movement, nor ensuring that the certification won’t be used to mislead consumers. Sharing the same logo and messaging regarding being of ‘benefit’ to the world with large multinational CPG companies with a history of serious ecological and labor issues, and no comprehensive or credible eco-social certification of supply chains, is unacceptable to us.”

Whether or not other purpose-driven companies will follow Dr. Bronner’s remains to be seen. I wouldn’t bet on it: 51% of American adults under 39 and 36% of American adults overall are familiar with B Corps and more likely to make purchases from certified companies.

The Climate Label (formerly Climate Neutral Certified)

If you see The Climate Label stamp on a product, it means that a company has measured and publicly disclosed its greenhouse gas emissions, set an internal price on emissions and invested that amount into climate solutions verified by the The Change Climate Project, and more. Before adding the label to its website or branding, a company must first offset at least a full calendar year’s worth of emissions. Some brands go further by offsetting emissions from earlier years as well.

The certification originated in 2019. The founders of two brands, Peak Design and BioLite, launched a nonprofit called Climate Neutral to help brands measure and account for greenhouse gas emissions. Climate Neutral created a certification, Climate Neutral Certified, to aid consumers looking to make climate-conscious choices. It also gave brands like theirs a way to stand out. The certification meant that companies had measured their entire carbon footprints, purchased third-party verified carbon offsets, and committed to reducing emissions over time.

Early adopters like Allbirds embraced the stamp as a signal of accountability, and hundreds more brands followed. But as claims of carbon-neutrality proliferated and scrutiny around offsets increased, the Climate Neutral team decided to increase its standards. In 2023, the organization rebranded as The Change Climate Project. In January 2025, it began issuing certifications with a new name: The Climate Label.

The updated framework moves beyond offsetting and toward more financial investment in decarbonization. Under the 2025 Standard, certified companies must still measure their emissions. They're now also also required to set an internal carbon price and spend that amount on climate solutions.

The minimum carbon price a company can set is $15 per ton. A company with 1,000 tons of measured greenhouse gas emissions, for example, would be compelled to spend at least $15,000 on emissions reductions solutions approved by Change Climate Project. Those solutions could include improving operations, redesigning supply chains, or investing in carbon removal. According to The Change Climate Project, the idea is to “align the true cost of pollution with the dollars companies put toward solving it.” Over 270 brands have The Climate Label certification.

What Does It All Mean?

These certifications — 1% for the Planet, B Corp, and The Climate Label — can be useful tools for consumers looking to shop more sustainably. Each one signals that a company has invested time, money, and effort toward environmental or social responsibility. Any brand that has all three has put substantial effort into its sustainability program, as well as into being perceived as sustainable.

While none of the certifications is wildly expensive, the associated processes do require a real investment of time and resources. That can be especially tough for small or early-stage companies. As I mentioned above, I don’t see the lack of these certifications as a mark against a company. Some of the best brands we’ve come across don’t have them. That's not because they don’t meet high standards, but because they’re focused on making products, not filling out paperwork. Or, they may have other certifications not mentioned here.

Furthermore, certifications don’t present a complete picture. A pet peeve of mine is seeing a brand that has lots of sustainability certifications, yet chooses to use plastic packaging for cosmetics that could be packaged in glass or paper. Or one that only sells small sizes and doesn't offer refill options.

When choosing brands for inclusion in Bluedot’s BuyBetter Marketplace, we always consider (and verify) certifications. But we also look beyond these, towards ingredients, materials, packaging, labor, how a company engages with its community, and more. Certifications can be helpful shortcuts, but they’re not the only way to demonstrate values. They also don’t guarantee a company is doing everything right. Case in point: Dr. Bronner's, which has exceptional sustainability standards, is stepping away from B Corp certification to protest what it sees as weakened standards.

Hopefully, this newsletter gives you a better understanding of how some of the top certifications work. We also hope it helps you see how we use them — and look beyond them — when choosing companies to feature. We’d love to hear from you, too: What do you look for when you’re shopping?

Join us, with Dessa Bayrock and Veronika Kratz to discuss their new research, “The Best Book to Save the Planet?: a reading of the inaugural Climate Fiction Prize.” This essay offers an overview and analysis of the Climate Fiction Prize from the perspectives of literary prizing and climate change studies. We situate this new prize within both fields, engage critically with the goals of the Prize itself, and argue that the Prize seeks to re-imagine and elevate climate fiction as a genre (or cross-genre) category of literature for purposes of social good. Prizes are tastemakers with immense pull in the field of cultural consumption, and the Climate Fiction Prize has the potential to shift or define current understandings of climate fiction as a whole: what it is, what it can accomplish, and what is worthy of critical or popular attention. We examine the form, function, and inaugural winner of the 2025 Climate Fiction Prize in order to situate it in the cultural field, offer gentle critique of its underlying priorities, and, as the first academic analysis of the Prize, open the way more broadly for further study of both this prize and other intersections of prizing and climate literatures.

The Berry Hill Megasite is the largest industrial park in Virginia and one of the largest in the Southeastern U.S. at 3,528 acres.
The announcement was a long-awaited win that will bring transformational economic impact to the region, said officials at the groundbreaking ceremony last year.
Despite the project’s size, this isn’t the largest pad at the megasite, Rowe has said.
The company became eligible for a special appropriation of up to $60.6 million approved by the General Assembly’s Major Employment and Investment Project Approval Commission.","One year ago Thursday, Microporous announced that it would bring $1.3 billion in investment and over 2,000 jobs to Southside Virginia.

The region has already seen ripple effects from the project even before it’s up and running, as developers for housing and other projects have taken an interest in the area, said Pittsylvania County Economic Development Director Matt Rowe.

In the past year, the Tennessee-based company, which manufactures lithium-ion battery separators for electric vehicles, has been preparing to start building its 500,000-square-foot facility in the Southern Virginia Megasite at Berry Hill.

“Construction is imminent,” said Rowe. “The layout and design work are complete for the most part.”

When Microporous announced that it would locate at Berry Hill on Nov. 13, 2024, choosing Virginia over a site in North Carolina, it became the largest economic development project in Southside’s history.

The Berry Hill Megasite is the largest industrial park in Virginia and one of the largest in the Southeastern U.S. at 3,528 acres. Microporous will be the first tenant there.

Work to prepare the megasite for industrial use had taken over a decade and hundreds of millions of dollars in state and local investment, and has happened alongside the loss of several big prospects.

The announcement was a long-awaited win that will bring transformational economic impact to the region, said officials at the groundbreaking ceremony last year.

“Just like with any industrial park, the first tenant is always the hardest and most important one to get,” Rowe said in an interview earlier this month. “To be able to get a first tenant for an investment of over $1.3 billion and 2,000 jobs, that’s not a bad way to start.”

The start of a long-awaited project

Construction of the Microporous facility will take place on a 212-acre lot within the park. Despite the project’s size, this isn’t the largest pad at the megasite, Rowe has said. It’s actually one of the smallest: The largest graded pad is about 2,100 acres.

The plant is expected to be fully operational by early 2028, said Rowe.

In April, Microporous President Doug Rich said the project was “moving ahead” and on time after questions arose about whether an executive order might affect a $100 million federal grant slated for the project.

The money, which had been announced alongside the project in November, was to come from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing and Recycling grant program, funded by the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

In announcing the award, the Energy Department said Microporous would help secure domestic manufacturing of a market currently dominated by China.

On his first day in office, however, President Donald Trump signed an order that froze the disbursement of federal funds to some energy-related projects funded by the act.

According to a Microporous LinkedIn post in May, the federal funding did come through, and the grant award period began April 1.

There have been no other posts about the federal grant since then, but Rowe confirmed that the funding was approved.

Rowe said he’s not aware of any change in the project’s timeline. A spokesperson from Microporous did not respond to requests for comment for this story.

“Once construction starts, the average citizen will be able to see that something’s happening,” Rowe said. “Again, with a project of this size, there’s so many moving parts that have to be nailed down and it just takes time.”

Much of the preliminary work — grading land, installing infrastructure — was already complete at the site before Microporous took interest in Virginia.

The megasite, which is jointly owned by Danville and Pittsylvania County, has seen over $200 million in private and public investment since it was formed in 2008.

The land was cobbled together from properties that the city and county acquired, and hundreds of acres have been graded, developed and prepared with infrastructure in the last 16 years.

In 2023, the park received a Tier 5 designation from the Virginia Economic Development Partnership, which means that there is enough graded land and infrastructure for the site to be considered shovel-ready.

The city and county also jointly undertook a connector road project to improve access to the site. The 2.4-mile road cost $33.5 million and was completed over a year and a half.

Not being shovel-ready in the past cost the site some big opportunities. But so did other factors, including politics and geography.

In May 2022, a $5.5 billion Hyundai electric vehicle battery plant went to a site in Savannah, Georgia, because it was more developed than Berry Hill.

In January 2023, Gov. Glenn Youngkin pulled the site out of consideration for a Ford Motor Co. battery plant facility due to concerns about Chinese government influence and the possibility that federal tax incentives would benefit a company with ties to the Chinese Communist Party.

And in March 2023, chemical manufacturer Albemarle Corp. chose a site in Chester County, South Carolina, for a lithium plant because it was closer to the company’s main facility in Charlotte, North Carolina.

To encourage Microporous to locate at Berry Hill, the city, county and state created a package of incentives. The company became eligible for a special appropriation of up to $60.6 million approved by the General Assembly’s Major Employment and Investment Project Approval Commission.

The Virginia Tobacco Region Revitalization Commission also approved up to $25 million in low-interest financing to bring major natural gas service to the project. The Tobacco Commission has invested nearly $35 million in the megasite since 2008.

The Virginia Talent Accelerator Program will provide support for Microporous’ job creation.

This is in exchange for investments of at least $1.3 billion and the creation of 2,015 full-time jobs with a base yearly wage of about $60,000.

Transformational impact in Southside and beyond

Microporous’ decision to locate in Southside Virginia has already generated interest in the region among other developers.

Housing projects, including a 1,900-unit master planned community in Axton and the Vandola Crescent development in Danville, aim to provide workforce housing for future megasite employees.

“Success always brings success,” Rowe said. “Being able to have that first project secured for the 212 acres at the site really just creates momentum that then carries over to the rest of Southern Virginia.”

The announcement has also generated increased interest in the megasite itself, he said.

“We’re hopeful that here in the relative near future, we’ll be out there again with another large announcement,” Rowe said. “There’s a tremendous demand for domestic EV manufacturing. … We sincerely believe that we’ve tied our wagon onto the winning horse.”

At the groundbreaking ceremony announcing the project, Youngkin lauded Microporous for being “an American company, using American technology that will hire American workers and supply American companies.”

The lithium-ion battery separators that Microporous manufactures create a barrier between the positive and negative sides of a battery to prevent short circuits.

In a 2023 interview, Microporous CEO John Reeves said that the growing market for electric vehicles is increasing demand for battery separators.

“Every EV’s going to have battery separators,” Reeves said. “They need to be made in the U.S. We’ve got to fill that demand.”

The company has about 300 employees and plans to add 2,015 more through the Pittsylvania County location.

Reeves said Danville-Pittsylvania County residents will be sought after for these jobs, which would likely pay around $60,000 a year.

Rowe said that Microporous has been actively working with the state’s talent accelerator program in the past year.

“Our local workforce partners are heavily engaged with the company,” he said. “They’ve made some trips out to Tennessee to see the facility and talk about workforce needs. Everybody’s kind of starting to ramp up that support that it takes to be able to implement a large project.”

The company is providing updates on its LinkedIn page, Rowe said, and it has a dedicated webpage to advertise local job opportunities.

Even before becoming operational, Microporous has been a community partner, Rowe said.

The company created a community benefits advocacy group composed of both residents and Microporous employees. Microporous plans to put $500,000 per year toward various community initiatives, which will be identified by the group, Rich said at a panel presentation in Danville earlier this year.

Corrie Bobe, economic development director for Danville, said that this plan will focus on initiatives such as workforce development and recruitment, which include housing, transportation and child care.

So far, the company’s focus has been primarily on child care, Rowe said. A 2024 study by Virginia Tech named the lack of adequate child care one of the biggest inhibitors to growth in Danville and Pittsylvania County.

“We intend on being here for a long period of time, it’s a significant investment, we will be employing a lot of people, and we want to be an upstanding member of the community,” Rich said.",https://i0.wp.com/cardinalnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/microporous-berry-hill.jpg?fit=1200%2C900&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-14 01:59:47.362784

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom vowed this week that he would stop a reported Trump administration effort to unleash energy production off California’s coast in a social media post that was widely criticized by conservatives and experts who spoke to Fox News Digital.

""Dead on arrival,"" Newsom said in a post on X on Tuesday in response to a Washington Post article reporting that Trump officials are mulling plans to propose oil drilling off California’s coast ""for the first time in decades.""

Newsom’s post, viewed over 3 million times, drew quick pushback from conservatives.

""'Dead on arrival' is what @GavinNewsom says about Trump proposal to drill offshore California,"" ophthalmologist and commentator Houman David Hemmati posted on X.

""The SAME man who’s been pushing for overpriced, unreliable, environmentally catastrophic offshore wind.""

Gabriella Hoffman, director of the Independent Women’s Forum Center for Energy and Conservation, told Fox News Digital that new offshore oil and gas projects ""should be explored in California"" and that the projects are ""safe"" and ""have a minimal environmental footprint due to improved technology and increased safety measures.""

""California is considered an oil island, despite having plentiful onshore and offshore recoverable oil reserves,"" Hoffman said. ""Governor Newsom purports to hate oil and gas, yet 60% of California’s petroleum is imported from foreign nations including Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and Guyana. That's unsettling, but a natural consequence of forcing a 100% transition to renewables.""

Newsom was the most prominent American official to attend the COP30 global climate conference in Belém, Brazil, this week — using the platform to criticize the absent Trump administration.

The White House mocked the trip, noting California’s continued rank among the highest in U.S. energy costs.

3 REASONS CALIFORNIA’S GREEN ENERGY CAMPAIGN IS DYING ON THE VINE

In a statement to Fox News Digital, a spokesperson for Newsom's office said, ""The Trump administration has yet to formally share with us their plan, but expensive and riskier offshore drilling would put our communities at risk and undermine the economic stability of our coastal economies. Given recent history, we’re not surprised by the lack of communication or their lack of thought into how their actions will impact Americans. The Trump administration’s focus continues to be on the next grift, and not the well-being of our people and communities.""

Newsom’s office put out a summary of his visit to the conference, saying it shows California is ""leading by example"" and proving that ""climate action and economic growth go hand in hand.""

Hoffman told Fox News Digital that while every energy project has ""environmental trade-offs,"" Newsom’s climate agenda has resulted in renewables getting ""a pass.""

""Governor Newsom desires to litter my home state's coastline with offshore wind farms that are eyesores, produce expensive unreliable electricity, and threaten fish and marine mammals,"" Hoffman said. ""Once decommissioned, oil rigs are converted to sanctuaries under the ‘rigs to reef’ program to support marine life — including endangered fish species — with habitat. Former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger wisely laid the groundwork for this conservation program in 2010 when he signed AB 2503 into law.""

Mark Bednar, former communications director for Speaker Kevin McCarthy, told Fox News Digital that the Trump administration is focused on ""expanding America's energy dominance through further exploration"" and cautioned Newsom on being out of step with that.

""Right now, adversaries like Russia, China, Venezuela, and Iran are working around the clock to expand their economic and geopolitical footholds, and any American lawmaker who opposes moves to grow America's energy dominance will have a hard time explaining to the American people why unilaterally tying one arm behind our back is good for America,"" Bednar said.

Associated Press

Electricity demand will rise much faster than overall energy growth in the coming decades, underscoring the need for diversified energy sources, according to an analysis released Wednesday.

The report by the International Energy Agency said renewable energy, led by solar power, will grow faster than any other major source in the next few years. One scenario the agency anticipates is coal and oil demand peaking globally by the end of this decade — but the group also said global oil and gas demand could continue growing until 2050. The report noted that many natural gas projects were approved in 2025, due to changes in U.S. policy, indicating worldwide supply will rise even as questions remain about how it will be used. Meanwhile, global nuclear power capacity is set to increase by at least a third by 2035 after being stagnant for years.

The release of the annual World Energy Outlook coincided with U.N. climate negotiations in Brazil this week where global leaders are calling for ways to curb the planet’s warming.

Regional dynamics

The IEA says building greater resilience in energy systems is especially important as data centers, heating and cooling, electrification and more drive energy demand. Investment in data centers is expected to reach $580 billion this year, exceeding investment in the oil supply, according to the report.

Growing economies including India and nations in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, will “increasingly shape energy market dynamics in the years,” the IEA said, noting their potential for solar power.

China, meanwhile, has accounted for half the global growth in demand for oil and gas, and more than half for electricity, since 2010.

“In a break from the trend of the past decade, the increase in electricity consumption is no longer limited to emerging and developing economies,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a release. Birol said that electricity use is also rising in advanced economies.

Nations are grappling with meeting demand while preparing for the risks brought on by the planet’s warming. The IEA says the world is falling short on universal energy access and climate change goals. Around 730 million people still live without electricity, according to the IEA, and despite progress, nearly one-quarter of the global population still relies on inefficient cooking methods that hurt their health or the environment. 2024 was also the hottest year on record.

Nations should diversify their energy sources and cooperate to expand supply chains for critical minerals used to make things like batteries for electric vehicles and components for solar and wind power generation, the IEA said. This also includes making quick improvements to the grid, energy storage and broader infrastructure.

“When we look at the history of the energy world in recent decades, there is no other time when energy security tensions have applied to so many fuels and technologies at once,” Birol said. “With energy security front and (center) for many governments, their responses need to consider the synergies and trade-offs that can arise with other policy goals — on affordability, access, competitiveness and climate change.”

The IEA brought back an approach to this year’s outlook using what it calls current policies. It used this approach in 2019 to weigh different possible global energy outcomes, before better aligning with clean energy transition plans. This year the agency’s outlook includes the possibility of essentially regressing on the phase out of fossil fuels.

In a conference call Wednesday, Birol said: “We will still use oil, we will still use gas. But the growth of electricity demand is spectacular.”

He noted the role transportation plays in accounting for 45% of global oil consumption, for example. “How the electrification of the transportation takes place, especially in countries beyond China and Europe, will determine the shape of the oil demand and growth.”

Global reaction

Wednesday’s edition of the yearly report is the first released since the start of U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term. Trump’s administration has for a second time opted out of the Paris agreement, rolled back dozens of climate regulations, slashed federal support for renewable energies such as wind and solar power and is reversing the “endangerment finding” that sits at the core of U.S. climate policy.

Trump has pledged his support instead to the fossil fuel industry, investing in coal and loosening restrictions on pollution.

But energy analysts said the shift to clean power is happening regardless of climate policy around the world.

“The evidence on the ground is overwhelming. EV sales are taking off in many emerging countries, solar is permeating even through the Middle East,” said Dave Jones, chief analyst at global energy think tank Ember. “Renewables and electrification will dominate the future.”

Maria Pastukhova, energy transition program lead at climate change think tank E3G, said the report makes “the choices for the global energy system and the global economy unambiguous.”

Others, however, were critical of how the outlook addressed oil and gas. Ben Backwell, CEO of the Global Wind Energy Council, said the outlook does not fully capture the momentum in renewables, and that it should have emphasized the trajectory for renewable energy is accelerating, driven by the decreasing cost of the technologies, strong policy support and the move toward electrification.

“We’re accelerating,” he added. “You can see it all around the world and we can see it in our numbers for last year, but also in our numbers for the first half of this year. It looks very, very exciting, both for wind and for solar, in fact, and for next year, even more so.”

The outlook foresees the likelihood of surpassing the warming threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) established in the Paris Agreement. Nonetheless, Stephan Singer, global energy senior adviser at CAN International, a global network of environmental organizations, said getting below that point is still possible.

The IEA addressed some of the criticism in the call Wednesday. It said that it sees differences economically, politically and with regard to clean energy efforts across the globe, and that its analysis tries to account for those differences.

“In a nutshell, the IEA is backsliding. As a global think tank, the IEA has largely failed to represent where most countries in the (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) and the developing world are, as they’re supporting net zero emissions with 98% CO2 emissions reductions by mid-century,” Singer said.

Restitution, or what South Carolina law refers to as an ​“ascertainable loss”, does not require a showing of willfulness.","South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson and Jared Libet, Assistant Deputy Attorney General in the Consumer Protection Unit, recently joined a Kelley Drye webinar to discuss the core philosophy behind their office’s practice and the state’s approach to consumer protection.

Attorney General Wilson kicked off the webinar by laying out the guiding principles with which he runs his office: neutrality, predictability, and transparency.

Attorney General Wilson described his office as a ​“referee on a football field,” whose goal is not to target companies or individuals, but to ​“protect[] the players on the field from unfair competitive advantages or deceptive advantages.” He does not guarantee outcomes but guarantees process. According to Wilson, he understands that sometimes the offense is of such nature that should disqualify one from the game, but “[s]ometimes, it’s just an offsides.” His guiding principles—neutrality, predictability, and transparency—shape how consumer protection is handled in South Carolina.

“We don’t hide our cards,” Wilson said. ​“We always try to play with an open hand.” He emphasized that his office aims to make its processes foreseeable and open, ensuring that all parties involved in a complaint are heard before any action is taken. ​“If a person’s complaining and they want to seek to bring a consumer protection complaint in South Carolina, I’m certainly open to that. But I’m equally open to reaching out to the person who’s been alleged to have violated that and give them a chance. We never, ever make a decision or take an action without inviting the complainee.”

As part of his commitment to transparency, Wilson shared a framework he uses to evaluate consumer protection claims that he calls the Meritorious and Compelling State Interest Test. After hearing from all parties, he asks:

Is the allegation facially meritorious?

If so, is legal action necessary, or is there a compelling state interest that justifies litigation over alternative remedies?

Wilson summarized his approach as ​“meek with power,” clarifying that ​“meekness is not weakness.” He explained that power should be exercised with care and tact, and that his office has a duty to conduct thorough due diligence before taking action.

Wilson closed by emphasizing the value of building relationships with his office. Trust, he explained, fosters smoother and more efficient interactions. ​“Once I develop a relationship with someone, the last thing I want to do is burn it,” he said. Once trust is established and it’s clear that his office acts as a neutral and predictable enforcer, Wilson finds that communications become smoother and more productive.

Lightning Round: Consumer Protection in South Carolina

The conversation then turned to Deputy Libet who emphasized that the structure and operations of the office are shaped by its relatively small size compared to other states.

Libet described the office’s prioritization approach as an organic process, both top-down and bottom-up. The small size fosters frequent communication between the Attorney General, the Chief Deputy, and staff attorneys. Major cases may originate directly from the Attorney General’s desk or be flagged internally and elevated through the ranks.

Multistate investigations play a significant role in South Carolina’s consumer protection efforts. Participating in these collaborations allows the office to share resources and expand its reach despite limited capacity.

Libet also clarified that the Attorney General’s office does not receive direct consumer complaints. In South Carolina, that responsibility falls to the Department of Consumer Affairs, which operates under a separate statutory framework. While the two offices share information, they enforce distinct sections of the state code.

South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act. South Carolina’s primary consumer protection statute is the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act, codified at S.C. Code § 39-5-10. It includes a three-year statute of limitations, governed by the discovery rule: the clock starts when the office knew or reasonably should have known of the conduct. Additionally, the continuing violation doctrine, adopted by the South Carolina Supreme Court, allows the office to pursue conduct that has occurred within the most recent three years, even if it began earlier.

Before filing suit, the statute requires a three-day pre-suit notice, along with an opportunity for the respondent to present reasons why a proceeding should not be instituted. Libet emphasized that the office takes this requirement seriously and is typically accommodating if more time is needed. The statute does provide an exception to the notice requirement if the Attorney General believes that delay would substantially impair the purposes of the law.

The Act authorizes a civil penalty of $5,000 to be imposed if a party is found in willful violation of the law. Libet explained that ​“willfulness” means the party ​“knew or should have known” about the violation.

Restitution, or what South Carolina law refers to as an ​“ascertainable loss”, does not require a showing of willfulness. While the statute does not explicitly mention disgorgement, Libet noted that if a violation is ​“willful” or ​“knowing”, the law grants courts broad authority to award any relief deemed necessary and proper. His office interprets this to include the ability to seek disgorgement.

You don’t have to believe in science, you have to believe your own eyes,” and he pointed to the Los Angeles wildfires in January. “I talk about financial risk in relation to climate risk.

Over Budget: The Global Carbon Project launched the 20th edition of its annual Global Carbon Budget report, which quantifies the carbon emission reductions needed to avoid 1.5°C (2.7°F) of warming, as well as annual carbon emissions by country and fossil fuel source and the planet’s natural capacity to absorb these emissions. The 2025 report calculated that the world has 170 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions remaining before hitting 1.5°C, a “carbon budget” that will be met before 2030 unless countries scale up mitigation efforts. On emissions by source, it projected a 0.8% increase in coal-related emissions for 2025, a 1% increase in oil-related emissions, and a 1.3% increase in natural gas emissions. The report also found that climate change has weakened the carbon sequestration capacity of land and oceans, which currently absorb 50% of carbon. In better news, 35 countries have successfully reduced emissions while growing their economies, and global emissions from both land use and cars decreased in 2024.

Healthy Planet, Healthy People: A health and climate ministerial meeting served as the official launch of the Belém Health Action Plan for the Adaptation of the Health Sector to Climate Change, which was designed collaboratively with civil society, international organizations, academia, and countries. As climate impacts increase in severity, health systems must be able to adapt to address the health risks that grow in parallel. The health action plan—the Brazil Presidency’s effort to connect the Global Goal on Adaptation to the resilient health systems objective of the COP30 Action Agenda—outlines 27 targets and 33 concrete actions for authorities and health services across all levels of government to adopt over the next decade. The recommendations, ranging from early warning systems to strategic medicine stockpiles, are underpinned by principles of health equity and the inclusion of civil society in governance. Brazil Health Minister Alexandre Padilha also foreshadowed the launch of two special reports on health and climate change at COP30, expected tomorrow.

Breaking Through Food Waste: A UN Environment Programme (UNEP) event saw the launch of the Food Waste Breakthrough. One third of humanity suffers from food insecurity, and yet over one billion tons of food is wasted from retail, food service, and households every year. This waste, in turn, generates up to 14% of total methane emissions. The Breakthrough is a five-year plan enlisting cities and food businesses to halve food waste through consumer behavior change, public-private partnerships, circular food systems, and food waste deterrence policies. It will also build on the efforts of two existing UNFCCC declarations: the COP28 UAE Declaration on Sustainable Agriculture, Resilient Food Systems, and Climate Action, and the COP29 Declaration on Reducing Methane from Organic Waste. UNEP is serving up implementation of the Food Waste Breakthrough with a four-year project funded by the Global Environment Facility to the tune of $3 million.

Now You Know: The new report, Resilience Science Must-Knows, distills decades of research and inputs from over 100 resilience scientists into nine takeaways for decision-makers. At the Resilience Hub launch event, speakers underscored that investing in resilience is a cost-saving strategy. They also noted that taking a close look at resilience trade-offs will lead to stronger policies. Building from the report, the Stockholm Resilience Centre and its partners are focused on embedding these “must-knows” in climate philanthropy and using them to help inform national adaptation plans.

Climate Disinformation (Cont.): Yesterday’s newsletter featured the COP30 Presidency’s information integrity theme. A new study looking at climate disinformation spread through the mainstream media in France and Brazil uncovered 19 different disinformation narratives circulating in France from January to August 2025, the top six being about renewable energy. In Brazil, most climate disinformation was about agriculture, deforestation, electric vehicles, ethanol, and COP30 itself. Separate from the report, Brazil is taking steps to address this challenge, including by starting the first national chapter of the Global Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change, while France is leading on the Paris Declaration on Multilateral Action for Information Integrity and Independent Media.

Climate and Development: The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs assesses the intersection of climate action and the sustainable development goals. This year, they released reports on conservation, disaster insurance, and public health in urban areas. The insurance report found that 62% of global losses from disasters are uninsured, and references microinsurance and parametric insurance as possible mechanisms to expand coverage.

Financing Resilience: At a high-level event, Ilan Goldfajn, president of the Inter-American Development Bank, shared that multilateral development banks are joining forces to improve their work at the intersection of climate and health, with a specific focus on adaptation. He said that the collaboration has four goals: to increase financing for resilience, make financing transparent to encourage private sector engagement, support countries in integrating resilience into their budgets, and innovate with financing tools like debt-for-nature swaps and resilience bonds.

Bridging Solutions for Latin American and Caribbean Cities: ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability and KfW, the German development bank, launched ProUrbano at the COP30 Cities & Regions Hub on Wednesday to expand on their collaborative urban resilience finance program in Latin America and the Caribbean. ProUrbano will establish a link between two existing instruments, the Urban Infrastructure Insurance Facility and the Urban Adaptation Financing Facility. By connecting disaster risk insurance with adaptation finance, this new program will streamline climate resilience for cities across the region with a budget of about $68 million through 2030.

Putting Demographic Intelligence on the Map: Also looking at resilience in Latin America and the Caribbean, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and partners found that 41% of the region’s population and 37.5% of its emergency hospitals are located in medium- to high-hazard zones. The report mapped exposure to the major natural hazards in the region, including earthquakes, hurricane-force winds, and riverine floods. Susana Sottoli, UNFPA’s regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean, stated, “When development investments are not risk-informed, they can inadvertently reinforce vulnerabilities and increase long-term costs.” Women, for example, face heightened barriers to accessing contraception, maternal healthcare, and gender-based violence protection during climate disasters.",,N,,2025-11-13 19:01:22.387348

“The natural gas-fueled Timmerman Power Plant is a peaker plant that can ramp up and shut down in minutes, providing power when it is needed the most.”","The Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) has executed its first agreement under the Texas Energy Fund (TxEF) Completion Bonus Grant (CBG) Program, awarding the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) up to $22.56 million for its 188-MW Timmerman Power Plant Unit 1, a new natural gas–fired plant in Caldwell County, Texas. The agreement marks the operational launch of Texas’s performance-contingent funding mechanism, which is designed to accelerate dispatchable generation projects connecting to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid before June 1, 2029.

Timmerman Unit 1, which features 10 high-efficiency Wärtsilä 50SG natural gas reciprocating engines, supplied under LCRA’s multiyear procurement program, delivers roughly 190 MW of fast-start peaking capacity on a 51-acre site near Maxwell in Caldwell County. Unit 1, which was formally connected to the ERCOT grid in August 2025, is the first of two identical Wärtsilä-engine peaker units planned for the site, built by Minnesota-based Fagen as its engineering, procurement, and construction contractor. According to the PUCT, Unit 1 can start within 45 seconds and reach full output within five minutes.

Under the CBG grant structure, the LCRA—a Texas river authority that supplies wholesale power and operates a growing fleet of natural gas peaker plants—may receive annual payments of up to $2.256 million over a 10-year period. Each payment is contingent on the plant’s operational performance during a June-to-May “test period” as measured by ERCOT and benchmarked against a reference group of other thermal generation resources.

“Texas’ electric grid is evolving rapidly to meet the needs of our growing economy and rising energy demand,” said PUCT Chairman Thomas Gleeson on Nov. 10. “I am pleased to see the TxEF’s Completion Bonus Grant Program is already incentivizing ‘speed to market’ in the construction of safe, reliable power plants in Texas. This LCRA power plant will help us both meet the needs of today and prepare our grid for the future.”

Reliability Pressures Drive State-Funded Acceleration

Texas’s operational launch of its CBG program arrives as the state grapples with extraordinary demand growth and mounting pressure to expand dispatchable capacity. At ERCOT’s September 2025 board meeting, the grid operator’s president and CEO, Pablo Vegas, warned that the absence of new peak demand records is masking the system’s underlying risk. While ERCOT has not exceeded its August 2023 all-time peak of 85,508 MW, settled energy consumption has been growing at a rate of more than 5% annually since 2021, significantly outpacing the estimated 1% average growth rate from 2000 to 2020, he said.

Vegas likened the situation to “the proverbial frog that’s boiling slowly in a pot of water,” noting that rapid demand growth—driven by data centers, industrialization, and electrification—combined with winter “tail events,” which he described as “not a normal weather situation” but “an extreme weather situation… in particular, a tail event in the winter,” creates “a real and present risk that we have to continue to keep our eye on.” Unlike summer peaks supported by large solar additions, he stressed that winter tail events depend on “thermal and long-duration resources,” because those conditions occur before sunrise or after sunset and can persist longer than short-duration resources can sustain.

The “good news,” he said, is that ERCOT is also seeing an unprecedented wave of new resources approaching interconnection. ERCOT’s latest quarterly stability assessment—the outlook for January through March 2026—shows “6,000 MW of proposed generation planning to be connected during that time period,” the largest quarterly total ERCOT has recorded. The mix includes “over 3,000 MW of energy storage, a little over 1,000 MW of gas and over 2,000 MW of solar.” On the gas side, he noted that it is “a pretty significant number for one quarter, seeing a gig in one quarter,” adding that three of the four gas units expected to connect are part of the Texas Energy Fund proposals and projects, leveraging state-backed incentives to accelerate dispatchable additions. In parallel, ERCOT highlighted rapid advancement on its temporary mobile-generation project for the South Texas transmission constraint, including the mobilization of 15 Life Cycle Power mobile units. Life Cycle and CenterPoint Energy’s agreement with ERCOT allows the generators to run through March 2027.

An Aggressive Legislative Push for Dispatchable Capacity

The efforts mark substantial progress for efforts championed by Texas policymakers to aggressively fund dispatchable capacity in the aftermath of Winter Storm Uri in 2021. The Texas Legislature passed Senate Bill (SB) 2627, known as the Powering Texas Forward Act, and Gov. Greg Abbott signed it into law on June 9, 2023. The legislation established the Texas Energy Fund (TxEF), which was approved by Texas voters through Constitutional Proposition 7 on November 7, 2023. Legislature appropriated $5 billion for fiscal years 2025-2026 and an additional $4 billion for fiscal years 2027-2028, providing the state’s most ambitious sustained commitment to grid infrastructure investment in decades.

The TxEF comprises four distinct programs administered by the PUCT, collectively providing $9 billion in funding through fiscal year 2028. Since its launch in 2024, the fund has allocated $2.3 billion for loans supporting 3,109 MW of new generation for the ERCOT grid, and selected 10 projects totaling $621.65 million to strengthen reliability for nearly 400,000 Texas customers outside ERCOT.

The largest TxEF component is the In-ERCOT Generation Loan Program, which offers 20-year loans at a fixed 3% interest rate to build or expand dispatchable generation of 100 MW or more. Loan amounts are capped at 60% of project costs, with the program authorized to finance up to 10,000 MW of new capacity.

As of Oct. 30, 2025, the PUCT has approved five loan agreements totaling $2.3 billion for 3,109 MW of new generation capacity.

Kerrville Public Utility Board (Rock Island Generation Project): a 122-MW natural gas facility in Colorado County, approximately 10 miles south of Columbus, featuring six MAN Energy Solutions reciprocating internal combustion engines with fast-start capability. The $105 million loan (60% of the total project cost of $175 million), announced in June 2025, is targeting summer 2027 operations.​

NRG Inc. (TH Wharton Generating Station): a 456-MW simple-cycle natural gas facility at the existing plant in Harris County (Houston area), interconnecting to the ERCOT Houston Load Zone. The $216 million loan (60% of $360 million total project cost) targets summer 2026 operations. Abbott announced this expansion on Aug. 4, 2025.​

NRG Inc. (Cedar Bayou Generating Station): a 721-MW combined-cycle natural gas unit at an existing facility in Chambers County near Baytown, interconnecting to ERCOT Houston Load Zone. The $562 million loan (60% of $936 million total project cost) anticipates summer 2028 operations. Abbott announced the Southeast Texas facility on Sept. 26, 2025.​

Calpine (Pin Oak Creek Energy Center): a 460-MW peaking facility adjacent to Calpine’s Freestone Energy Center in Freestone County (Fairfield area), interconnecting to ERCOT North Load Zone (Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex). The plant is designed to start within minutes. The $278 million loan (60% of $464 million total project cost) targets summer 2026 operations. Abbott announced the Freestone County project on Oct. 14, 2025.​

Competitive Power Ventures (CPV Basin Ranch Energy Center): a 1,350-MW combined-cycle natural gas facility in Ward County (West Texas Permian Basin) featuring two 1×1 combined-cycle power plants with GE Vernova H-Class (7HA.03) gas turbines, designed for future carbon capture integration. The facility will interconnect to ERCOT West Load Zone, with a $1.12 billion loan (60% of the total project cost of $1.88 billion) and operations scheduled for 2029. The largest TxEF investment to date, the loan was announced on Oct. 30, 2025.​

The PUCT, notably, began accepting In-ERCOT loan applications on June 1, 2024, and the submission window closed on July 27, 2024. The first loan agreement was signed on June 25, 2025. So far, 12 additional applications representing 5,861 MW of proposed dispatchable generation are in due diligence review, suggesting a robust pipeline and continued developer interest. The PUCT must make initial disbursements for each approved In-ERCOT loan by Dec. 31, 2025, unless it grants an extension due to market factors affecting project schedules.

Completion Bonus Grant (CBG) Program Based on Performance

The CBG program represents just one component of a diversified state strategy. The program essentially provides performance-contingent grants to companies for dispatchable generation projects of 100 MW or more that interconnect to ERCOT before June 1, 2029. Unlike the In-ERCOT Loan Program’s fixed rates and terms, the CBG ties payments directly to operational metrics, creating dual incentives: speed to market (earlier interconnection dates trigger higher per-MW awards) and sustained reliability performance. Resources interconnecting before June 1, 2026, are eligible for $120,000 per MW; those connecting between June 1, 2026, and June 1, 2029, receive $80,000 per MW. Grants are paid over 10 years, with annual payments contingent on ERCOT-measured performance during “test periods” (June 1–May 31) evaluated against a reference group of other thermal generation resources in ERCOT.​

According to the PUCT, the program’s performance metrics are stringent. ERCOT calculates the Performance Reliability Factor (PRF)—the average ratio of each resource’s real-time high sustainable limit to its obligated capacity during the 100 hours with the least operating reserves (termed “assessed hours”)—and the Availability Reliability Factor (ARF), measuring the proportion of time the resource was available and not in planned outage. Resources performing at or above the 90th percentile with ARF between 0.9 and 1.0 receive full annual payments; those between the 50th and 90th percentiles receive discounted payments; and those at or below the median receive no payment for that test period.

“Annual payments are contingent upon the performance of the power plant. Performance is measured by ERCOT during an annual “test period” and compared to the performance of a reference group of other generation resources in the ERCOT region. Specific performance metrics are outlined in the PUCT’s CBG rule,” the PUCT said on Monday.

Second Timmerman Unit Under Construction

For LCRA’s Timmerman Unit 1—so far the only announced and executed CBG agreement—the first test period runs from June 1, 2026, to May 31, 2027. ERCOT will calculate the results within 45 days of the end of each test period.

LCRA owns or has rights to approximately 3,750 MW of generation capacity serving wholesale electric customers across Central Texas. The utility’s generation portfolio includes the 1,625-MW Fayette Power Project, a three-unit coal-fired plant in Fayette County (with Austin Energy co-owning two units); the 540-MW Thomas C. Ferguson combined-cycle natural gas plant in Horseshoe Bay, which began operating in 2014; and the 176-MW Winchester Power Park natural gas peaker facility in Fayette County. LCRA also operates hydroelectric facilities across the Highland Lakes and holds ownership shares in the Sandy Creek Energy Station and Lost Pines Power Plant.

LCRA is also now developing Timmerman Unit 2, which is expected to be operational in 2026. “Unit 2 will supply about 190 MW of power, bringing the plant’s total capacity to about 380 MW,” the company says. Wärtsilä, which has supplied its 10 50SG engines, notes the technology consumes “little to no water, which is an important feature in Texas, an area often affected by drought.”

“As more people and businesses move to Texas, the state needs more dispatchable power that can be available quickly during times of peak demand,” LCRA adds. “The natural gas-fueled Timmerman Power Plant is a peaker plant that can ramp up and shut down in minutes, providing power when it is needed the most.”",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/timmerman-power-plant.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 18:01:26.796721

FedEx spokeswoman Savannah Haeger said the order for Harbinger chassis represents the first time the shipping company has paired an order in the medium-sized EV chassis space with an investment in the EV truck maker.

Haeger said this isn’t the only buy of EV delivery trucks for FedEx in this niche. In a separate deal announced in May 2024, FedEx made the largest purchase of medium-sized EV delivery trucks — which haul up to 26,000 pounds of cargo — from Michigan-based Shyft Group Inc. That’s when FedEx bought an initial order of 150 Blue Arc trucks at an undisclosed price.

Shyft is not connected with Harbinger chassis.

The privately held Harbinger said it received the $160 million investment from a group co-led by FedEx, Capricorn, an investment firm backing companies in electrification, and recreational vehicle maker THOR Industries in Elkhart, Indiana.

The latest funding round brings to more than $358 million that Harbinger has raised from financial backers since its inception in 2021, Harris said.

As part of the funding announcement, FedEx placed an order for 53 electric delivery truck chassis — which look like FedEx and UPS delivery trucks when customized — that will be delivered by the end of the year.

“Traditionally, the biggest fleets in the U.S. haven’t placed any big orders into electrification. There’s been a lot of people placing orders for two trucks, and four trucks and six trucks,” Harris said. “The nice thing about an order of two trucks is you can park them in front of the building and take a picture and talk about how you’re buying electric trucks, but it doesn’t actually make a difference.”

The EV truck market has seen a shakeout this year as tax credits for buying electric-based chassis have disappeared. Harris noted he’s actually seen a pickup in interest from the transportation market to buy Harbinger’s EV chassis as rivals have pulled back.

For instance, ecommerce giant Amazon had been testing General Motors’ BrightDrop electric vans as part of its plan to bring 100,0000 electric delivery vehicles on the road by the end of the decade. But last month, GM officially pulled the plug its electric vans.

“We don’t view the BrightDrop vehicle as a competitor to us,” Harris said. “We felt that way before they discontinued it.”

Amazon, which owns a large position in Irvine-based EV maker Rivian, began adding custom-built electric delivery vans from the startup automaker in mid-2022. A Rivian spokeswoman couldn’t immediately say how many EV vans have been purchased by Amazon.

Others who have downsized their operations over the past year have included financially struggling Brea-based Mullen Automotive Inc., and New Jersey-based Cenntro Inc., which last year opened a large plant in Ontario where it planned to assemble drayage trucks and cargo vans.

In January 2025, Harbinger said that it wanted to build up production capacity at its Knott Avenue plant to meet demand for a flurry of chassis orders and expand its sales and parts and service operations for the nationwide rollout of its EV chassis. At the time, Harbinger said it employed about 250 people.

In the past year, Harbinger has added another 150 workers, and now has plans both “inside and outside of California” to add more plant capacity to accommodate its growth, according to Harris. “We’ve got lots of potential expansion projects in the works.”

Harbinger, which moved its headquarters from Gardena in July 2024, previously received vehicle orders from buyers like bread delivery company Bimbo Bakeries USA, the Nebraska-based postal service operator Mail Management Services Inc., and THOR.

The EV truckmaker was co-founded in 2021 by Harris, who previously worked at Costa Mesa-based defense technology company Anduril Industries Inc. and EV startups Faraday Future of Gardena and Xos Trucks in northeast Los Angeles.

Co-founders include Phillip Weicker, who serves as Harbinger’s chief technology officer and who formerly had key roles with San Jose-based lithium battery developer QuantumScape and Torrance-based EV carmaker Canoo; and Will Eberts, chief operating officer who worked with Harris at Faraday Future and with Weicker at Canoo.",https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/OCR-L-EVTRUCKS-1115-01mr.jpg?w=1024&h=701,N,,2025-11-13 18:02:40.273876

In January 2025, Harbinger said that it wanted to build up production capacity at its Knott Avenue plant to meet demand for a flurry of chassis orders and expand its sales and parts and service operations for the nationwide rollout of its EV chassis. At the time, Harbinger said it employed about 250 people.

In the past year, Harbinger has added another 150 workers, and now has plans both “inside and outside of California” to add more plant capacity to accommodate its growth, according to Harris. “We’ve got lots of potential expansion projects in the works.”

Harbinger, which moved its headquarters from Gardena in July 2024, previously received vehicle orders from buyers like bread delivery company Bimbo Bakeries USA, the Nebraska-based postal service operator Mail Management Services Inc., and THOR.

The EV truckmaker was co-founded in 2021 by Harris, who previously worked at Costa Mesa-based defense technology company Anduril Industries Inc. and EV startups Faraday Future of Gardena and Xos Trucks in northeast Los Angeles.

Co-founders include Phillip Weicker, who serves as Harbinger’s chief technology officer and who formerly had key roles with San Jose-based lithium battery developer QuantumScape and Torrance-based EV carmaker Canoo; and Will Eberts, chief operating officer who worked with Harris at Faraday Future and with Weicker at Canoo.",https://www.dailybreeze.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/OCR-L-EVTRUCKS-1115-01mr.jpg?w=1024&h=701,N,,2025-11-14 02:58:41.826978

HIDALGO, Texas, November 13, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Terra-Gen, one of the largest independent, integrated renewable energy producers in the United States, jointly owned by Masdar and Igneo Infrastructure Partners, announced today the commissioning of the Monte Cristo I Windpower Project.

The 238.5-megawatt facility, located in Hidalgo County, Texas, will generate more than 850 gigawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, equivalent to powering approximately 81,000 homes a year. The facility’s capacity has been contracted to two corporate buyers through long-term power purchase agreements.

A ribbon-cutting ceremony at the site marked the milestone, bringing together companies’ representatives, local officials, and members of the community.

""It is an honor to celebrate the hard work and dedication of the hundreds of men and women who made the commissioning of the Monte Cristo wind project possible,"" said John O’Connor, Chief Financial Officer for Terra-Gen. ""This project underscores Terra-Gen’s commitment to expanding access to renewable energy across Texas and the U.S. and providing clean, sustainable power, and investing in our local communities.""

""We are thankful to Terra-Gen for its investment in Hidalgo County. Projects like this represent real progress for our community,"" said Edinburg Mayor Omar Ochoa. ""This community has a lot to offer, and we are confident that we have a bright future ahead.""

Construction of the Monte Cristo I Windpower project created approximately 280 jobs at the peak of activities, with more than 490,000 hours worked without a lost-time incident during construction and transition to operations.

In addition, the project also enhanced the community through infrastructure upgrades, including improvements to more than 11 miles of Texas Department of Transportation roads and 25 miles of county roads.

Beyond the construction phase, the facility will continue to deliver significant long-term economic benefits to the region, including more than $100 million in property taxes, landowner payments and other local contributions during the project’s life.

""We welcome Terra-Gen’s continued investment in Hidalgo County,"" said Richard F. Cortez, Hidalgo County Judge. ""This development represents more than clean, renewable energy, it’s an investment in our people and our long-term economic growth. By creating high-quality jobs, generating millions in local spending, and supporting essential public services, projects like this help us develop and attract human capital while positioning Hidalgo County as a leader in sustainable progress.""

Monte Cristo I Windpower is Terra-Gen’s second wind project in Texas. Together with the Texas Big Spring wind facility, the company’s clean energy generation in the state now totals 273 MW. Phase 2 of Monte Cristo Windpower has also been permitted and development activities for the project are ongoing.

In addition to an upwardly revised price target, speculation that Rivian could expand its partnership with Volkswagen is also powering investors' enthusiasm.

According to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, shares of Rivian are up 10.5% from the end of trading last Friday through 12:15 p.m. ET today.

Investors spotted two green lights this week

Taking a more bullish tack, D.A. Davidson hiked its price target (though it maintained a neutral rating) on Rivian stock to $15 from $13. With shares trading above $15 at the time that the rating became public, the price target implied some downside. Investors, however, likely responded favorably to the new price target since Goldman Sachs had reduced its price target to $13 from $15 last week in response to the company's third-quarter 2025 financial results.

The other encouraging sign came in the form of a Reuters article that reported Volkswagen believes its partnership with Rivian could transcend the joint venture that the two companies entered into last year. Volkswagen believes the technology the two companies are developing could also be used in its internal combustion engine vehicles. Speaking to the merits of the technology under development, Carsten Helbing, co-CEO of the joint venture said, ""The architecture is highly capable of also driving additional drivetrain configurations.""

Is it too late to hitch a ride with Rivian after the stock's rise?

Despite the stock's recent climb, investors interested in electric vehicle (EV) exposure would be well advised to kick the tires further on Rivian stock. There's fear in the market regarding the future of the EV market with the expiration of EV tax credits but it's hardly the end of the road right now for Rivian.",https://finviz.com/favicon_2x.png,N,,2025-11-13 19:01:06.130673

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on Monday that most of the Department of Energy’s loan program funding will be directed toward nuclear power projects — part of a broader effort to meet growing electricity demands and drive down energy costs.

For years, millions of Americans have watched their energy bills tick upward.

From wildfires to natural gas prices, the causes behind rising energy costs vary across states. Inflation has added pressure, and now artificial intelligence is demanding a huge amount of energy.

President Donald Trump, who campaigned on expanding U.S. energy production, has made nuclear a centerpiece of his “all-of-the-above” energy strategy. “We will embrace all forms of energy, including nuclear,” the president said earlier this year. “Nuclear’s a great energy.”

In May, Trump signed an executive order calling on the U.S. to break ground on 10 new large-scale nuclear reactors by 2030 — the first such expansion effort in decades. Currently, the United States operates 94 nuclear reactors, which provide roughly 19 percent of the country’s electricity, a share that has remained steady since the 1980s.

Wright said the administration is now reviewing potential reactor sites, with announcements expected in the coming months. “We’re looking at locations very carefully,” he said.

Last month, the administration finalized an $80 billion agreement with Westinghouse to build new reactors as part of that expansion.

Wright said the biggest challenges ahead are logistical.

“We have President Trump all in. We’re reforming the regulatory regime. We have lots of private capital and government capital to match it,” Wright said. “The problem right now is just execution — having enough workers and supply chain capacity to build these plants as quickly as we’d like.”

BY THE NUMBERS: TVA FY 2025

Advancing nuclear amid a ‘historic’ gas build

The Tennessee Valley Authority saw its operating revenue for fiscal year 2025 increase by more than a billion dollars over the previous year, and plans to make significant investments in nuclear and transmission, said TVA’s CEO Don Moul during a Thursday investor call.

TVA is “undertaking one of the largest new asset campaigns in our history,” with 3.7 GW of new generation currently under construction, Moul said.

TVA’s CFO Tom Rice said the utility is “in the middle of a historic gas build right now” as it constructs 1.4 GW of natural gas at its Cumberland Fossil Plant and another 1.4 GW at its Kingston Fossil Plant.

The utility is planning to build up to four small modular reactors at its Clinch River Nuclear Site after TVA’s board of directors authorized up to $350 million in expenses, and in February entered into an agreement with Type One Energy to develop a plan for a TVA fusion power plant project.

Type One is co-located for a stellarator demonstration at TVA’s Bull Run facility, Moul said, and TVA’s Power Service Shops team is assisting with the fabrication and construction of that stellarator.

“We’ll be working with them to share our operating experience on how to make it more cost effective and commercially viable, and then we’ll evaluate the performance and decide what the next steps are,” Moul said.

TVA also announced during a board meeting last week that it’s targeting up to 1.5 GW of battery storage by the end of 2029.

The utility’s nuclear generation was down in fiscal year 2025 due to outages, but TVA “used that time strategically to advance nuclear life extension work,” Rice said.

However, “that nuclear generation was replaced by natural gas, coal and purchase power resources, which drove the fuel expense higher year over year,” he said.

Though TVA is bullish on advanced nuclear, the utility is structuring its deals in that space “to make sure that that risk isn’t on our balance sheet,” Moul said.

The Southgate pipeline would extend from Pittsylvania County, Virginia, into Rockingham County, North Carolina.
The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality is currently undergoing its review process for a Clean Water Act Section 401 certification.
Additionally, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has yet to decide whether to grant a Clean Water Act Section 404 permit.
“North Carolinians have made it clear that we do not want MVP Southgate,” said Chris Herndon, North Carolina Chapter Director, at Sierra Club.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality issued a Clean Water Act Section 401 certification for Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC’s proposed methane gas pipeline “Southgate,” rejecting concerns raised by North Carolina community members that the project would pollute streams and wetlands and harm protected aquatic species. More than 2,400 comments were submitted to the DEQ during the public input period.

The developer recently altered its plans for Southgate, changing the route and increasing the capacity and pipe diameter. Southgate would extend the controversial Mountain Valley Pipeline, and has faced significant opposition since the original project was first proposed in 2018.

During its original permit review in 2020, DEQ determined MVP Southgate posed an unneeded risk to North Carolina waterways and denied the developer’s application for a Clean Water Act permit. The Southgate pipeline would extend from Pittsylvania County, Virginia, into Rockingham County, North Carolina. It is currently subject to an amendment review process by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for MVP’s recently requested changes to the project.

North Carolina communities are especially concerned with Southgate’s project route, which is very similar to the proposed Southeast Supply Enhancement Project from Williams Companies’ expansion of the Transco pipeline network. The co-location of two additional high-pressure, large diameter pipelines, next to already-aging pipes, adds to safety risks for both proposed pipelines.

Southgate faces many remaining undetermined permitting decisions. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has yet to decide whether to approve the Southgate amendment request to change the capacity, route and pipe diameter. The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality is currently undergoing its review process for a Clean Water Act Section 401 certification. Additionally, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has yet to decide whether to grant a Clean Water Act Section 404 permit.

“North Carolinians have made it clear that we do not want MVP Southgate,” said Chris Herndon, North Carolina Chapter Director, at Sierra Club. “And yet, at a time when so many households are struggling to pay their energy bills, the NCDEQ has approved this dangerous, polluting pipeline that will not only threaten the health of our waterways and communities but will translate to increasing energy bills. The fight doesn’t stop here. We’ve been in this battle against this project for the long haul, and we know that disappointing decisions like this can’t and won’t stand in the way of the will of the people.”

“This is an incredibly disappointing outcome, knowing the harm that MVP Southgate would inflict on the communities, waterways and aquatic ecosystems along the pipeline,” said Juhi Modi, North Carolina Field Coordinator at Appalachian Voices. “As the federal courts have recognized, MVP has a history of causing water quality standards violations during construction of the mainline project. Southgate would also fuel Duke Energy’s proposed massive expansion of methane gas power plants across our state, causing higher electric bills and irresponsibly increasing the risks we face from climate change. We know that there are safer, more affordable renewable energy options that can better serve North Carolinians.”

“DEQ’s decision to grant MVP Southgate’s water permit is a blow to impacted communities and, regardless of conditions, risks our access to clean water,” said Dr. Crystal Cavalier-Keck, Executive Director at 7 Directions of Service. “Even federal regulators have suggested MVP Southgate may not be necessary. It’s baffling to imagine how — given the developer’s disastrous track record of violations — any decision maker would invite such bad actors into our backyards. Nevertheless, our communities will keep fighting to protect our natural resources for future generations.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-13 18:01:42.183129

RELATED: City manager unveils no-cost plan to revive Inner Harbor desalination; mayor says she called for action

The earlier deal with contractor Kiewit was projected to reach nearly $1 billion. In September, the council voted against moving forward, citing the price and uncertainty surrounding the long-term financial impact.

City leaders now say any new version of the project must include firm price guarantees before council members are asked to vote again.

City Manager Peter Zanoni said that as the project restarts, the city will rely more heavily on outside experts to review data tied to the plant’s environmental footprint and bay circulation.

As part of that effort, Zanoni announced Wednesday that the city will commission a far-field study, a wider analysis that examines how the plant’s saltwater discharge would spread and dilute through the bay system. The study looks beyond the immediate discharge point, modeling how tides, wind, and currents could carry the brine plume and how quickly it would return to normal salinity levels.

Zanoni said the expanded review is meant to address lingering questions about previous modeling and provide clearer, independently reviewed findings as the city works to relaunch the project.

The Inter-American Development Bank Group (IDB Group) announced today the Power Transmission Acceleration Platform (PTAP), a new regional effort to help countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) expand and modernize their energy grids and close the infrastructure gap.

The announcement followed a bilateral meeting between IDB Group President Ilan Goldfajn and State Secretary Jochen Flasbarth of Germany's Federal Ministry for the Environment, Climate Action, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety.

During the meeting, German authorities announced their intention to contribute up to 15 million euros (around 17,3 million US dollars) through the International Climate Initiative to support PTAP's implementation, including 3 million euros (around 3,5 million US dollars) to directly support the 16 countries participating in the Renewables in Latin America and the Caribbean (RELAC) initiative – focused on reaching at least 80 percent renewable electricity by 2030.

""Energy security in Latin America and the Caribbean depends on more than generation – it depends on having a reliable and resilient transmission grid,"" said Goldfajn. ""With Germany’s support, PTAP will help countries strengthen transmission, unlock investment, and build more resilient energy systems. The IDB Group is acting as a bridge – connecting national priorities with global capital,"" he added.

""Grids are the backbone of the global energy transition, they are essential for achieving the target of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030. Germany, together with key partners, has prepared a 'grids package' for COP30 and our collaboration with IDB is part of that. As a longstanding partner of Latin America and the Caribbean, Germany is honored to contribute to PTAP and welcomes the RELAC declaration on grids. PTAP and the declaration both support the transition towards resilient, decarbonized energy systems, provide opportunities for the private sector and enhance regional cooperation,"" said State Secretary Jochen Flasbarth of Germany's Federal Ministry for the Environment, Climate Action, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety

PTAP is a regional platform that supports countries in modernizing and expanding their power grids by improving planning, permitting, regulation, and investment frameworks. It is designed to crowd in private capital, reduce project delays, and connect more renewable energy to the grid.

PTAP, which will be formally presented to partner governments and international institutions on November 15 at COP30, will be accompanied by three other key announcements:

The Belém Declaration on Grids, endorsed by RELAC member countries, committing to accelerate transmission and storage;

The “Unlocking the Grid” flagship report, outlining how to close the transmission investment gap—projected to require tripling annual investment by 2035;

And the IDB Group’s support of the Climate Finance Principles for Green Grids, launched by the Green Grids Initiative at COP30.

Over the past decade, the IDB Group has financed over one billion US dollars in transmission projects and supported regulatory reforms across the region. PTAP now adds dedicated capacity to convert plans into bankable projects – linking national energy priorities to regional public goods and global climate goals. Germany's announcement reinforces a broader partnership with the IDB Group under IKI, which has delivered over 135 million euros (around 156,4 million US dollars) in support for climate and nature programs across Latin America and the Caribbean since 2016. Recent initiatives include investments and refoms in fiscal policy, biodiversity, water security, and green finance, as well as the IKI-LAC Climate Private Sector Mobilisation Fund with IDB Invest, a 46 million euros fund (around 53,3 million US dollars), announced earlier this year, which focus is to support and mobilize private sector investment in climate mitigation projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in LAC.",https://www.bundesumweltministerium.de/typo3temp/assets/images/_c__chungking_-_stock.adobe.com__csm_luftaufnahme_solar_energie_kp_1200_cc96b65248_27a242fdab23a9064b84487cab15ec61.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 18:01:08.367317

“The bill is retreating from a couple of decades of climate progress in Massachusetts,” said Larry Chretien, executive director of the nonprofit Green Energy Consumers Alliance.
Cusack’s rival bill includes many of the same elements as the governor’s proposal but takes a far harsher approach to efficiency spending and climate goals.
“It essentially does eviscerate Mass Save,” Chretien said.
“The best you could say is that it is going after short-term affordability at the expense of long-term affordability,” said Kyle Murray, Massachusetts program director for climate-action nonprofit Acadia Center.","Massachusetts lawmakers have advanced an energy-affordability bill that opponents say would undo years of work on policies to fight climate change and promote energy efficiency, all without actually saving consumers much money.

“The bill is retreating from a couple of decades of climate progress in Massachusetts,” said Larry Chretien, executive director of the nonprofit Green Energy Consumers Alliance.

The legislation, which a House committee approved 7 to 0 on Wednesday, would make the state’s 2030 emissions target nonbinding, slash funding for energy-efficiency programming, reinstate incentives for high-efficiency gas heating systems, and limit climate and clean-energy initiatives that impact customers’ utility bills. It would also prevent projects in cities and towns with natural-gas bans from claiming energy-efficiency incentives for all-electric construction.

The bill’s author — Democratic state Rep. Mark Cusack, the House chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy — has said these steps are necessary to get ballooning energy bills under control. Critics of the proposal, however, say this approach would trade minimal short-term savings for environmental damage and much higher costs down the road.

“We want good energy-affordability legislation. This is not that,” said Amy Boyd Rabin, vice president of policy for the Environmental League of Massachusetts. ​“The claim that climate policies are the thing making prices rise is just not based in fact.”

Electricity prices in Massachusetts have been trending upwards for a decade and are among the highest in the country. In May, Gov. Maura Healey, a Democrat, unveiled energy-affordability legislation aimed at saving consumers around $10 billion over the next 10 years. A hearing on the bill took place in June, but it has not advanced any further.

Cusack’s rival bill includes many of the same elements as the governor’s proposal but takes a far harsher approach to efficiency spending and climate goals. The bill still has a long way to go to become law. It would need to clear the Senate committee and be approved by both the House and the Senate, which would require support from many legislators who have previously voted for the priorities it undermines. Then Healey would need to sign it.

Still, in a state that has long been a leader in energy efficiency and climate action, the fact that the bill has gained any traction reflects the increasingly popular idea that decarbonization is at odds with affordability. This adversarial notion has gained currency in the past year as politicians and policymakers throughout the region — and the country — scramble for ways to address rising power prices. These claims, however, are simply incorrect, say climate advocates. They argue the cost of energy-delivery infrastructure and the rising price of natural gas are what’s really driving up utility bills.

Climate, energy, and consumer advocates are particularly concerned about the bill’s attempt to scale back and rework Mass Save, the state’s energy-efficiency program, which is funded by a small charge on consumers’ utility bills.

The legislation calls for cutting Mass Save’s current three-year budget from $4.5 billion to $4.17 billion, and capping spending for future triennial plans at $4 billion. These savings would, in theory, be achieved by tightening the program’s scope to focus on weatherization and lowering energy use. Mass Save would no longer be allowed to consider whether an incentive would promote decarbonization or electrification when assessing its benefits, which could put rebates for equipment such as heat pumps or home batteries at risk, advocates said.

“It essentially does eviscerate Mass Save,” Chretien said.

The charge that funds the energy-efficiency program currently makes up about 7% to 8% of the per-kilowatt-hour electricity rate from major utilities Eversource and National Grid. Reducing Mass Save’s budget by 11% would only lower that number slightly.

At the same time, Mass Save cuts costs for consumers. Those who take advantage of the incentives can save thousands of dollars on new appliances or home improvements that can then create ongoing savings by reducing energy demand. By lowering power demand, the programming also helps reduce the need to expand the grid, producing additional savings for everyone. Mass Save generated a total of $2.8 billion in benefits for participants and nonparticipants in 2024, the program administrators report.

The bill also calls for eliminating Mass Save incentives for all-electric projects built in cities and towns that are part of Massachusetts’ pilot program allowing some municipalities to ban fossil fuels in new construction.

Reducing incentives for efficient electric appliances leaves people paying more for energy-hungry systems, critics point out — even as both electricity and natural-gas prices are expected to keep rising.

“The best you could say is that it is going after short-term affordability at the expense of long-term affordability,” said Kyle Murray, Massachusetts program director for climate-action nonprofit Acadia Center. ​“Unfortunately, because it misunderstands the actual drivers of cost, it will drive up costs for ratepayers.”

Advocates also question the logic behind the plan to make the state’s 2030 climate goals nonbinding. Cusack argues the move is necessary to prevent lawsuits against the state, should it not meet its targets, especially in the light of obstacles being thrown up by the Trump administration. Murray, however, finds this contention unconvincing: The likelihood of a successful lawsuit is too low to justify unravelling years of climate progress, he said.

Despite the bill’s success in the House committee, opponents could still defeat it by making their case to legislators, Boyd Rabin said. And there are a lot of opponents to speak up, she said, including not just climate activists but groups concerned with municipal operations, economic development, and equity.

“I am yet to have a conversation with anyone who supports it,” she said. ​“I would hope legislators would listen to what they’re hearing.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2001268132.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=ac172274eda2ca8fe934bcd6514772cd,N,,2025-11-13 17:01:46.506055

Patrick Morrisey presented at an energy summit in downtown Charleston, West Virginia, on Thursday, where he praised numerous power-related projects that are either underway or soon to be coming in the Mountain State.

The announcements included the construction of a new natural gas power plant in Harrison County, the expansion of an existing power company in Hancock County and the creation of new gas compression-related manufacturing jobs in Weirton.

Morrisey said the investments for these projects total more than $4 billion from private companies. He called the projects — several of which had already been previously announced — crucial for West Virginia to ensure that energy remains a dominant but diverse market.

He also said that residents should expect to hear more updates on different, soon-to-come projects and developments “over the next 30 to 60 days.”

“We’ve been a little busy, but there’s going to be more,” Morrisey said. “We had a number of projects we were working to get announced by today but, you know, you can’t control the timing of really big announcements coming.”

While he celebrated the potential for increased energy production and jobs, Morrisey did not give much mention to environmental risks or concerns about such developments. More in-depth details for several of the projects were not shared on Thursday.

Morrisey said, under his leadership, residents should trust him when he says something is going to be built and that such announcements are not just “hot air.”

“I don’t announce things unless they’re going to happen. I want you guys to get used to that,” Morrisey said. “Everything we’re doing is highly vetted, and it’s going to continue. Our energy plan is no longer aspirational. It’s very realistic.”

His comments alluded to his gubernatorial predecessor, now-U.S. Senator Jim Justice, R-W.Va. As governor, Justice oversaw and heralded several large economic announcements for the state that often ended on lackluster terms — if they came to fruition at all.

In 2020 he celebrated recruiting Virgin Hyperloop to build its new Hyperloop Certification Center on about 800 acres between Tucker and Grant counties. The project was supposed to start in 2021, and would have allegedly employed thousands while contributing millions to the state economy, officials said. But the project never actually broke ground and likely never will.

In 2022 Justice lauded GreenPower Motor Company for signing an agreement with the state to open a manufacturing plant in South Charleston for the creation of zero-emission school buses. He said the company could bring up to 200 jobs for the area when it first opened and up to 900 in the future. Earlier this year — after both challenges between the state and the company as well as increased tariffs under President Donald Trump — the company began layoffs and halted production of the electric buses. Google lists the South Charleston facility as permanently closed. At the time of the layoffs, fewer than 100 people worked at the facility and only a fraction of the buses it promised the state had actually been produced.

In July of 2024, Justice announced a $150 million investment — including $50 million from the state — to help keep 600 people employed and reopen operations at the previously idled tin plant in Weirton. The facility was set to reopen and produce electrical transformers. Less than a year later, in May 2025, Cleveland-Cliffs pulled out of the deal.

He also spearheaded work to reopen the Pleasants Power Plant; now, per the Charleston Gazette-Mail, court filings show state leaders were potentially misled out of $50 million in funds for retrofitting the station.

On Thursday, Morrisey was clear that he wants to see everything he announces actually come to fruition. Ensuring they do, he said, is crucial to West Virginia staying competitive economically, but specifically in the energy industry.

There was hope that some of the clean energy and manufacturing investments made by the previous administration would survive. A large majority were benefiting red states in regions like Appalachia. It seemed logical that members of Congress from those regions would fight for investments creating jobs in their communities.

That hope was misguided. As the end of 2025 nears, and after Trump and a Republican-led Congress repealed more than half a trillion dollars to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy in their not-so-beautiful budget bill, the administration is pursuing a whole-of-government strategy to sabotage the deployment of the fastest growing energy sectors in the United States — solar, wind, batteries, and electric vehicles. They are eviscerating the government’s capacity to understand and act on climate change.

Why is this happening? It’s tempting to rely on well-worn explanations, like Trump’s embrace of the fossil fuel industry and their cash. But that doesn’t explain it all. His assault on clean energy is in some cases so extreme it is opposed by the oil and gas majors — such as tearing up permits and leases for offshore wind.

A better explanation is that Trump and his advisors are waging a culture war, and clean energy and climate change are a new front. It is a war built on dividing our country between “real Americans” and “the other,” portrayed as aggressive and dangerous. “The others” are threatening to take away “our” freedom, liberty, guns, and—now—cars.

This is a familiar strategy for folks in Appalachia, particularly those who experienced the economic brunt of the coal industry’s long decline, which accelerated roughly 15 years ago when the price of natural gas dropped below the price of coal. This represented a fundamental change in how we power our country, but the coal industry and the Republican Party effectively transformed it into a culture war. In their telling, the fall of coal was not an economic shift but an attempt by cosmopolitan elites on the coasts and the Democratic Party to destroy a way of life in coal communities — “real America.”

What Trump has done is to nationalize — and supercharge — this strategy. He pursued some of this in his first administration — recall “Trump Digs Coal” — but this time his war is fueled by the progress made in the deployment of clean technologies since 2020.

It’s a maddening irony that much of that progress was made in “energy communities” based on incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act to drive investment into communities that historically relied on fossil fuel production, and recently closed coal mines or plants. Community-level analysis of clean energy investment following passage of IRA showed that energy communities attracted an outsized share of national clean investment.

Much of that investment has been put at risk by the Trump-led repeal of IRA’s clean energy incentives and the outright cancellation of federal funding for already awarded projects. Trump is making a bet that the culture war benefits of this scorched earth campaign will blind Americans to facts and their economic-self interest.

Trump is gambling with the future of Appalachia, and it is up to people in the region to step up and reject this culture war. That is not going to be done with 30-second political ads or quippy soundbites. It will be done by workers and neighbors talking to each other and finding common ground about our shared energy future among people from all walks of life. That is how we stop Trump from dividing Americans between “us” and “them” on climate and clean energy. That is how we protect our jobs and environment at the same time.",https://www.kentucky.com/public/latest-news/3sme62/picture312904257/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/BriteNight_Starfire_Project_Dean_Hill.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 17:01:54.895546

Generating Local Impact

Over its operating lifetime, Lafitte Solar is projected to generate approximately $32 million in regional tax revenue — supporting public schools, law enforcement and emergency services. Construction of Lafitte Solar was completed in collaboration with RWE's EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) partner McCarthy, supporting more than 150 full-time jobs on the project at its peak. During construction, workers supported local businesses and restaurants, and shopped at area stores, amplifying the project's economic impact.

Joe Holyfield, President, Ouachita Industrial Development Board: ""Lafitte Solar brought jobs and investment to Ouachita Parish at a crucial time. Our local businesses felt an immediate benefit, and we look forward to sustained growth as energy projects like these strengthen our region's future.""

Amanda Yang, Head of Clean and Renewable Energy, Meta: ""We're thrilled to see the Lafitte Solar project reach this important milestone — not only adding clean energy to the grid locally but adding jobs to the local economy. Projects like Lafitte Solar are essential to achieving our clean energy goals while strengthening communities.""

RWE remains dedicated to supporting local schools and families. The company partnered with Roy Neal Shelling, Sr. Elementary School, providing donations to support classroom resources, while its construction partner McCarthy supplied toys during the holiday. RWE and McCarthy remain committed to improving the quality of life for children in the local area by funding a new playground being built at Tanglewood Community Park. Additionally, RWE and McCarthy together provided one of the largest holiday food donations the Food Bank of Northeast Louisiana has received, supporting families throughout Monroe during the Christmas season.

Supporting Sustainable Land Use

Lafitte Solar's site design features natural and native vegetation around the perimeter, promoting biodiversity and habitat conservation to benefit the project's land and surrounding farmlands. The project will also incorporate agrivoltaics, using a flock of over 600 sheep to maintain healthy vegetation onsite. This practice not only protects local farmland but deepens partnerships with regional farmers, demonstrating how renewable energy coexists with agriculture.",https://www.nacleanenergy.com/images/thumbnail_57939_TEA-bluestem-solar-farm-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 19:01:13.666586

At the end of his letter, Gates urged the global climate community to make a “strategic pivot” toward prioritizing human welfare.","Read: 4 min

Delegates from Canada and nearly 200 other countries gathered in Brazil this week for COP30, the United Nations’ 30th annual climate change conference.

Ahead of the conference, Microsoft cofounder and philanthropist Bill Gates published a letter calling for a shift in how countries approach climate policy.

“It’s time to put human welfare at the center of our climate strategies,” he wrote in the Oct. 28 letter published on his site, Gates Notes.

The letter has received significant attention internationally, but muted coverage within Canada.

This is unfortunate. We would love for Gates’ thinking to permeate the climate policy debate in Canada as well.

In our view, Gates has earned the right to be listened to on climate policy. Over the past 25 years, the Gates Foundation has spent a staggering US$100 billion on solving some of the world’s most intractable problems — including poverty, disease and climate change. His separate venture, Breakthrough Energy, has invested billions more in 150 companies focused on clean energy innovation.

From this front-row seat to climate developments, Gates has arrived at a critical conclusion: that climate change is serious, but will not end civilization.

“Even if the world takes only moderate action to curb climate change, the current consensus is that by 2100 the Earth’s average temperature will probably be between 2°C and 3°C higher than it was in 1850,” he writes.

(Interestingly, climate advocate Mark Carney voiced a similar conclusion in a podcast interview before becoming prime minister.)

Warming of 2°C to 3°C will result in what Gates refers to as “latitude creep” — where a northern U.S. state like Iowa starts to feel more like the southern state of Texas, for example, and Texas more like northern Mexico.

These shifts will require governments to invest heavily in climate adaptation, such as better land management, more fire-resistant materials and sturdier infrastructure.

As experts have previously told Canadian Affairs, climate adaptation has been a woefully neglected area of Canada’s climate strategy so far. Hopefully, the Carney government — which is prioritizing infrastructure development as a vehicle for economic growth — makes climate adaptation a key part of its investment and climate strategy.

Of course, not all countries are as well-equipped as Canada to adapt to climate change — and not all citizens have the opportunity to migrate in response to latitude creep, Gates notes.

But this makes it important to be informed about the true effect of climate change on human suffering.

Contrary to the impression one gets from much of the media, extreme heat now causes about 500,000 deaths a year — a decrease from earlier periods, primarily due to more people being able to afford air conditioners, Gates says.

Similarly, deaths from natural disasters such as floods have also fallen dramatically. Annually, natural disasters now claim between 40,000 and 50,000 lives a year, Gates writes, due to better warning systems and more-resilient buildings.

These are of course still tragic figures. But it is worth putting them in perspective. Tuberculosis, by contrast, claimed an estimated 1.23 million lives last year, the World Health Organization said Wednesday. And that’s just one preventable disease of many.

Gates’ position, which we second, is that such numbers underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize development aid that maximizes human welfare.

“Vaccines are the undisputed champion of lives saved per dollar spent,” he writes, noting the Gavi vaccine alliance (to which Canada has contributed about $1 billion) saves a life for a little more than $1,000.

But here, Canada may be moving in the opposite direction. The 2025 Budget released last week revealed cuts to development aid of $2.7 billion over four years, on total spending of about $8 billion a year previously.

“There will be reductions in development funding to global health programming, where Canada’s contribution has grown disproportionately relative to other similar economies,” the budget says in a section briefly explaining the cuts.

Gates’ other key takeaway, which we also endorse, is that governments must be rigorous about evaluating the impact of their climate spending.

His point in particular is that countries must focus on bringing down the “green premium” — that is, making the cost of producing something through clean methods equal to or less than the cost of producing something with dirtier methods.

As Gates says, countries and companies have already succeeded in driving down global projected emissions by an astonishing 40 per cent over the past ten years due to clean energy innovations.

“Ten years ago, the International Energy Agency predicted that by 2040, the world would be emitting 50 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year. Now, just a decade later, the IEA’s forecast has dropped to 30 billion, and it’s projecting that 2050 emissions will be even lower,” he writes.

“This progress is not part of the prevailing view of climate change, but it should be,” he adds.

If countries are to further limit warming, they must reduce the green premium in the most emissions-intensive sectors — namely, electricity, manufacturing, agriculture, transportation and buildings. Countries should evaluate all climate spending through the lens of whether their dollars are helping do so.

Here again, Canada’s recent track record is worrisome. A new report from Canada’s environment commissioner says Ottawa is not doing enough to measure the impact of the $100 billion worth of federal climate measures it has announced since 2021.

Specifically, the commissioner flagged concerns with low uptake of clean economy investment tax credits and ongoing federal investments in oil and gas sector projects.

“There was also a lack of transparency of expected emission outcomes and insufficient systems for measuring results,” the report says.

At the end of his letter, Gates urged the global climate community to make a “strategic pivot” toward prioritizing human welfare. We couldn’t agree more. That means directing funds to welfare-maximizing causes, and being ruthlessly analytical about what all those dollars are getting us.",https://www.canadianaffairs.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/bill-gates-letter-climate-strategy-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 18:01:22.644181

Under current one-size-fits-all EPA regulations, trucks and heavy equipment are required to use emissions systems that can trigger engine shutdowns when diesel exhaust fluid (DEF)—which freezes at just 12 degrees Fahrenheit—fails to reach proper operating temperatures, even though the engine itself is working normally. This legislation directs the EPA to update its regulations to account for how diesel engines actually operate in cold-weather states, like Alaska and Wyoming, to prevent the automatic shutdowns caused by cold-related emissions faults, and to provide year-round exemptions from DEF system requirements for vehicles and equipment that operate primarily in cold weather climates.

“In extreme cold, diesel engines can shut down because EPA-mandated emissions systems weren’t designed for the harsh conditions we face in Alaska and across the northern United States,” said Sen. Sullivan, “That’s not just an inconvenience, it’s a compliance trap for the men and women who keep Alaska moving. The Cold Weather Diesel Reliability Act makes sure trucks and heavy equipment can keep operating safely in freezing weather by preventing automatic shutdowns caused by cold-related emissions faults. Our legislation brings common sense to EPA rules, aligning federal policy with real-world conditions in the nation’s coldest regions.”

“Climate-alarmist bureaucrats in Washington do not understand that the consequences of their radical agenda are hurting real people in western communities,” said Sen. Lummis. “I am proud to join Senator Sullivan in correcting the Obama and Biden administrations’ disastrous policies and ensuring folks don’t get stranded in their ‘EPA-compliant’ vehicles, even during the harshest winter weather. The people of Wyoming should not have to choose between breaking the law or losing their lives.”

“Alaska is not only a cornerstone of America’s resource development and national defense—it is also one of the most logistically challenging environments in the country,” said Ryan Anderson, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities. “Reliable, year-round transportation is the backbone of our economy, our communities, and our national security readiness. But current federal emissions regulations too often fail to account for the realities of operating in Arctic conditions, where subzero temperatures can disable critical diesel systems and strand operators in life-threatening situations. The Cold Weather Diesel Reliability Act ensures that truckers, maintenance crews, and equipment operators can keep moving safely and effectively in extreme cold, without being sidelined by systems never designed for this environment. It’s a common-sense fix that protects lives, supports economic activity, and strengthens our nation’s ability to operate in the Far North.”

“Alaskans face exceptional challenges daily. Laws and rules are made without consideration for extreme weather with the sub-zero conditions we often endure,” said Justin Hargrove, owner of Different Strokes of Alaska. “Our industries here sometimes require exception for dependability of our equipment to complete the already complex, dangerous and arduous jobs. We need not be encumbered by things we can change, specifically if they can make enough of a difference to prevent hard working Americans and vital industries from risk. Emissions regulations that are already waived for the Department of Defense, because of the locally recognized environmental challenges, should be considered for the civilian population for the same benefit. With the current blanket emissions standards for non-DOD, our diesel engines in Alaska are unreliable and can ultimately put lives in jeopardy. Making a subtle change to diesel regulation in Alaska will save lives, increase productivity, provide reliability and help to remove a proven dysfunction that needlessly challenges Americans here nearly half of their lives.”

“On behalf of United Freight and Transport, Inc., a commercial carrier based in Alaska, I write to express our strong support for the Cold Weather Diesel Reliability Act of 2025,” said Samantha Brown, corporate director & manager of health and safety compliance for United Freight and Transport, Inc. “We believe this legislation is essential for safeguarding both public and driver safety throughout the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions we operate in daily. Alaska’s extreme cold weather presents unique and dangerous challenges for commercial drivers. Current emissions control systems, particularly shutdown and derate functions triggered by faults in sub-zero temperatures, can leave vehicles stranded in remote, rugged terrain with limited emergency access. This poses serious safety threats, including hypothermia, frostbite, or delayed response in life-critical deliveries and rescue operations. By allowing engine manufacturers to suspend derate or shutdown functions during cold weather, this bill provides a crucial operational safeguard. It ensures that trucks remain mobile, and drivers remain protected without compromising long-term emissions compliance. The ability to maintain vehicle performance under such conditions is not just a matter of convenience, it is a matter of life and death in Alaska’s most isolated regions. We urge swift passage of this important legislation and appreciate your commitment to common-sense safety measures that respect both environmental responsibility and human life.”

“Farmers and ranchers in cold climate states have long awaited exemption from DEF requirements in cold climates. It will be a great relief from the problems it has caused our equipment, and added expense to our supply chain,” said Scott Mugrage, president of the Alaska Farm Bureau. “This exemption has our full support.”

Senator Sullivan has long pushed back against heavy-handed overreach from federal agencies, like the EPA, especially the aggressive Biden administration EPA’s enforcement actions in Alaska, including armed raids on small mechanics in the Mat-Su. Earlier this year, Sen. Sullivan secured a commitment from EPA Administrator Zeldin to work with him to rein in these rogue enforcement tactics and to review impractical regulatory requirements that don’t work in Alaska’s extreme conditions.

A voting shift by Virginia's rural Republicans helped Democrats win the November governor's race; Louisiana is adopting new projects to help rural residents adapt to climate change and as Thanksgiving approaches, Indiana is responding to more bird flu.

TRANSCRIPT

For the Daily Yonder and Public News Service, this is the news from rural America.

Recent election victories by Democrats may not predict next year's midterms, but analysis by the Daily Yonder shows a shift in rural Virginia.

Editor Tim Merrimah says rural voters stuck by the Republican Party in the governor's race, but by far less than in the last two elections.

He notes a 12-point shift in rural voters turning out for Democrat Abigail Spanberger.

And sometimes that can say something about how enthusiastic people are about the candidate and their party.

Turnout is almost always lower in off-year elections compared to presidential years, but Republican turnout in Virginia was down by 30 percent from 2024, when the state's rural vote went for Donald Trump by 34 points. - Rural voters were still favoring the Republican candidate by two to one.

So it's not as if Democrats turn the tide in these rural areas, but they do reduce the lead that the Republican party had. - Democratic wins in Virginia and elsewhere come as Trump's approval ratings are falling dramatically.

Rural parts of Louisiana's coast are at risk from climate change, but those communities can fight back.

Julia Tilton reports. - In the last 80 years, Louisiana has lost 2,000 miles of coastline to rising sea levels, erosion, and severe storms.

In the next 25, it stands to lose 7,000 more.

Cities like New Orleans have levies that flood-prone rural areas lack.

There are projects by the Corps of Engineers and Louisiana's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority that could help.

But Allie Olson-Oski with the Environmental Defense Fund says the challenge is getting rural communities on board.

There is a level of distrust of government intervention with the Federal government coming in and changing communities.

Olson-Oskie says residents are becoming aware of how flood mitigation and elevating buildings could help.

If there is an opportunity for them to make their homes safer so that their homes may be passed down to their kids and grandchildren, that's a really, really important and exciting opportunity.

I'm Julia Tilton.

New bird flu outbreaks are hitting northern Indiana farms with 13 under quarantine.

More than 130,000 birds have been affected and the state's working to contain the spread, monitoring nearby farms as a precaution.

Indiana University epidemiology professor Thomas Duszynski says properly cooked poultry and eggs are still safe to eat. - The risk to humans is really, really low on these bird farms.

So most of us aren't coming in contact with these animals. but he says the loss of flocks can have a big impact on finances.

The farmer obviously has to replace those flocks, so there is a cost to doing that.

Rebuilding a Crippled Energy Sector Syria’s power grid remains one of the most devastated in the region.","U.S. energy firm GE Vernova (GEV.N) and Germany’s Siemens Energy (ENR1n.DE) are in discussions to supply gas turbines for a $7 billion reconstruction project aimed at reviving Syria’s war-ravaged power sector, according to three sources familiar with the talks.

The project stems from an agreement signed in May between Syria and a subsidiary of Qatar’s Power International Holding (PIH) to construct four combined-cycle gas turbine power plants with a total capacity of 4,000 megawatts, along with a 1,000-MW solar component.

Potential Contracts and Scope

Both GE Vernova and Siemens Energy are being considered for major equipment supply contracts, one source said, though negotiations remain at an early stage and the value of the turbine deals has not yet been determined.

The talks could also expand beyond turbines to include critical power grid infrastructure a key step toward rebuilding Syria’s national electricity network, much of which was destroyed during the country’s 14-year civil war.

Western Companies Re-enter Syrian Market

If finalized, these deals would make GE Vernova and Siemens Energy among the first Western firms to re-enter Syria’s energy sector following U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to lift most sanctions on Damascus earlier this year.

A Siemens Energy spokesperson confirmed that a local delegation had met Syrian officials: “While no specific agreements or contracts have been made, we are ready to contribute our technical expertise if it can help stabilize a reliable energy supply and support the population.”

GE Vernova, PIH, and Syria’s information ministry did not respond to requests for comment.

Rebuilding a Crippled Energy Sector

Syria’s power grid remains one of the most devastated in the region. Following the rebel-led ouster of former President Bashar al-Assad last year, the country’s new leadership under President Ahmed al-Sharaa has sought to diversify energy partnerships and reduce reliance on Iran.

During his visit to Washington this week, al-Sharaa met with Trump to discuss investment frameworks for reconstruction, including energy cooperation.

In July, U.S. firms Baker Hughes (BKR.O), Hunt Energy, and Argent LNG announced plans to back Syria’s recovery through oil and gas exploration and new power generation ventures.

Outlook

After years of conflict, Syria produces only a fraction of its pre-war electricity output, though recent gas imports from Azerbaijan and Qatar have helped ease shortages.

Separately, UAE-based Dana Gas (DANA.AD) signed a preliminary deal on Wednesday with Syria’s state oil company to evaluate redevelopment of damaged natural gas fields.

Syria’s domestic gas production has fallen sharply from 8.7 billion cubic metres in 2011 to around 3 bcm in 2023 highlighting the scale of the challenge in restoring national energy security.

Aidy Chou, Chairman and CEO of Armlogi, said, ""Our first quarter results show that our core business is still growing, with revenue up 16.5% year over year and improvement in our gross margin profile. We are especially happy with the 24% increase in revenue from our warehousing services, which shows that customers are using our expanded facilities and full range of logistics solutions.”

""Even though we are still addressing rising freight costs across the board, especially from big carriers like FedEx, we have made progress in diversifying our carrier relationships and setting more competitive prices. Our gross margin improved year over year, which we believe is indicative that our operational efforts are starting to yield results.”

""Our network of warehouses now includes ten locations and covers about 3.9 million square feet. We believe this positions us favorably to meet the growing needs of cross-border e-commerce merchants. Adding our Illinois facility has been especially important because it has increased our presence in the Midwest and made it easier for us to serve customers nationwide.”

Mr. Chou concluded, ""Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on three main goals: making the most of our expanded warehouse network, improving our gross margin profile through operational efficiencies, and selectively pursuing growth opportunities that fit with our strategic vision. We believe Armlogi is well-positioned to deliver long-term value to our stockholders, thanks to our infrastructure and growing customer base.”

HOUSTON, Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Battalion Oil Corporation (NYSE American: BATL, “Battalion” or the “Company”) today announced financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2025.

Key Highlights

Generated third quarter 2025 sales volumes of 12,293 barrels of oil equivalent per day (“Boe/d”) (53% oil)

AGI facility remains out of service

Gas Production is being treated by third party

The Company has entered into an amendment of its existing credit facility allowing additional operational flexibility

The Company continues to pursue potential merger, acquisition and divestiture opportunities

Management Comments

Drilling and completion operations concluded in the West Quito Draw with two wells coming online and producing an average of 883 Boe/ day over the first 120 days of production. Well operations yielded more than $1.1 million in savings per well across all phases compared to AFE. Both wells are still on choke while flowing back, confirming the significant inventory in the asset area.

The acid gas injection (“AGI”) facility ceased operations on August 11, 2025 and remains out of service. In response, we temporarily shut in a portion of our Monument Draw field and redirected our gas production to alternative gas processing options available in the immediate vicinity of our operations. Currently, we have brought most wells back online; however, approximately 1,600 barrels of oil per day remain shut-in across Monument Draw ready to flow to sales.

Results of Operations

Average daily net production and total operating revenue during the third quarter of 2025 were 12,293 Boe/d (53% oil) and $43.5 million, respectively, as compared to production and revenue of 12,076 Boe/d (52% oil) and $45.3 million, respectively, during the third quarter of 2024. The decrease in revenues in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the third quarter of 2024 is primarily attributable to a $2.24 decrease per Boe in average realized prices (excluding the impact of hedges) partially offset by an approximate 217 Boe/d increase in average daily production. Excluding the impact of hedges, Battalion realized 98.3% of the average NYMEX oil price during the third quarter of 2025. Realized hedge gains totaled approximately $4.1 million during the third quarter of 2025.

Lease operating and workover expense was $11.69 per Boe in the third quarter of 2025 versus $11.56 per Boe in the third quarter of 2024. The increase in lease operating and workover expense per Boe year-over-year is primarily the result of increased water production from new wells yielding higher disposal costs. Gathering and other expenses were $9.02 per Boe in the third quarter of 2025 versus $11.20 per Boe in the third quarter of 2024. The decrease in gathering and other expenses per Boe is primarily related to progress made at the central production facilities yielding lower labor and repair costs as well as increased throughput and overall production volumes being treated by the AGI facility during 2025. Although the AGI facility ceased operations on August 11, 2025, we were able to secure treatment at alternative facilities. The AGI facility treated natural gas production from March 2024 to August 11, 2025. General and administrative expenses were $2.73 per Boe in the third quarter of 2025 compared to $3.46 per Boe in the third quarter of 2024. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2025 is primarily due to lower merger costs. Excluding non-recurring charges, general and administrative expenses would have been $2.44 per Boe in the third quarter of 2025 compared to $2.58 per Boe in the third quarter of 2024.

For the third quarter of 2025, the Company reported a net loss available to common stockholders of $15.0 million and a net loss of $0.91 per share available to common stockholders. After adjusting for selected items, the Company reported an adjusted diluted net loss available to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2025 of $15.7 million or an adjusted diluted net loss of $0.96 per common share (see Reconciliation for additional information). Adjusted EBITDA during the third quarter ended September 30, 2025 was $18.9 million as compared to $13.5 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (see Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation table for additional information).

Liquidity and Balance Sheet

As of September 30, 2025, the Company had $213.8 million of term loan indebtedness outstanding and total liquidity made up of cash and cash equivalents of $50.5 million.

On November 12, 2025, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Agreement which provides total net leverage ratio and asset coverage ratio covenant relief through the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2027.

TORONTO, Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- POET Technologies Inc. (“ POET ” or the “ Company ”) (TSX Venture: PTK; NASDAQ: POET), the designer and developer of Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs), light sources and optical modules for the AI and data center markets, today reported its unaudited condensed consolidated financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025. The Company’s financial results as well as the Management Discussion and Analysis have been filed on SEDAR+. All financial figures are in United States dollars (“USD”) unless otherwise indicated.

Management Commentary:

“The third quarter of 2025 demonstrated continued progress toward commercialization of our optical engine and light source products. The placement of two successive initial production orders from two key customers valued at over $5.6 million is the beginning of a revenue ramp which we expect to increase steadily throughout 2026,” said Dr. Suresh Venkatesan, Chairman & CEO of POET Technologies.

“The introduction of our 1.6T optical receiver, developed in collaboration with Semtech, enhances POET’s product leadership into the highest-performance segments of the AI interconnect market. We are also evolving our light-source product in partnership with Sivers Semiconductors, and expanding into the mobile AI telecom space with NTT Innovative Devices. These engagements form a foundation for accelerated customer adoption and revenue growth in high-volume AI networking solutions.”

“Having developed one of the most flexible, high-performance assembly platforms available in the photonics space today, we are now focused on adding to our Optical Interposer advanced components to produce highly differentiated engines and modules for both high-speed interconnect and light-based chip-to-chip data communication. To support this strategy, we recently closed US$250 million in equity financing from three institutional investors, enabling both internal expansion of development and manufacturing capabilities and inorganic growth through acquisitions.”

Notable Business Highlights:

Introduced 1.6T optical receivers with Semtech supporting next generation AI clusters and data-center interconnects.

Advanced POET Starlight light-source strategy through new partnerships with Sivers Semiconductors.

Entry into the front-haul mobile networking space in collaboration with NTT Innovative Devices.

Secured a US$5,000,000 initial order for 800G transmit and receive engines, confirming readiness for volume production.

Successfully completed three rounds of equity financing with three institutional investors at prices ranging from $5.00 to $7.25 per share for gross proceeds of $250,000,000.

Non-IFRS Financial Summary

The Company reported non-recurring engineering (“NRE”) and product revenue of $298,434 in the third quarter of 2025 compared to $3,685 for the same period in 2024 and $268,469 in the second quarter of 2025.

GARDNER, Mass., Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Precision Optics Corporation, Inc. (NASDAQ: POCI), a leading designer and manufacturer of advanced optical instruments for the medical and defense/aerospace industries, announced operating results on an unaudited basis for its first quarter fiscal year 2026 for the period ended September 30, 2025.

Q1 2026 Financial Highlights (3 Months Ended September 30, 2025):

Revenue was $6.7 million, a quarterly record, compared to $4.2 million in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year, representing growth of approximately 59%.

Production revenue was $6.0 million, a quarterly record, compared to $2.6 million in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year, representing growth of approximately 133%.

Engineering revenue was $0.7 million compared to $1.6 million in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year, a decrease of 59%.

Gross margins were 14.2% compared to 26.6% in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

Net loss for the quarter was $(1.6) million, compared to $(1.3) million in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

Adjusted EBITDA was $(1.2) million for the quarter compared to $(1.0) million in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

Recent Additional Highlights:

Accepted a $700,000 product development order to design and build a sub-assembly for an advanced augmented reality (AR) system.

Accepted a $678,000 product development agreement to develop a custom high-end borescope for jet engines. The system will include multiple configurations to measure critical components inside jet engines in the field with greater-than-1080p HD resolution in extreme environmental conditions.

Increased production to meet the growing demand from a top-tier aerospace company for a highly complex and specific assembly provided by POC. First quarter fiscal 2026 revenue totaled $2.5 million from this customer, a quarterly record.

Introduced a second production line to meet increasing demand for single-use endoscope assemblies used by a leading surgical company in their cystoscopy surgery system. First quarter fiscal 2026 revenue totaled $1.6 million from this customer, a quarterly record.

FY 2026 Financial Guidance (Year Ended June 30, 2026):

The Company projects for the fiscal year 2026 revenue to exceed $25 million, which represents 31% growth over the Company’s fiscal year 2025 revenue.

The Company projects fiscal year 2026 Adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $0.5 million compared to $(3.7) million in fiscal 2025.

“The positive momentum continued during the first quarter as we once again reported record quarterly revenue of $6.7 million, an increase of 59% from the year ago period, driven by production deliveries against multi-year agreements with a top tier aerospace company and a surgical robotics company,” commented Dr. Joe Forkey, CEO of Precision Optics. “Gross margins were impacted by lower revenue and underutilization of resources in other parts of the business during the first quarter. However, we expect overall gross margin improvements during the second and subsequent quarters.”

“Two new large development agreements coming in over the past weeks are a positive sign. The programs, one for the development of sub-assemblies for an augmented reality system and the other for a high-resolution borescope for jet engine inspection, broadens our exposure to the aerospace and defense industry as our solutions are well positioned to align with the industry's need for smaller sized optical systems”

“We believe fiscal 2026 is set to be a very good year for POC. We look forward to the continued execution against a strong backlog, delivery of systems at improved margins, and expansion of our pipeline. We continue to remain on track with the financial guidance we previously set for the year, highlighted by fiscal year 2026 revenue growth and positive Adjusted EBITDA,” Forkey concluded.

The following table summarizes the first quarter results for the periods ended September 30, 2025, and 2024:

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Precision Optics has provided in this press release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America (“non-GAAP”). The non-GAAP financial measure is Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). In addition to the aforementioned items, Adjusted EBITDA also excludes from Net Income (Loss) the effect of stock-based compensation.

This non-GAAP financial measure assists Precision Optics management in comparing its operating performance over time because certain items may obscure the underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult, as they are of a nature and/or size that occur with inconsistent frequency or relate to discrete acquisition or restructuring plans that are fundamentally different from the ongoing productivity of the Company. Precision Optics management also believes that presenting this measure allows investors to view its performance using the same measures that the Company uses in evaluating its financial and business performance and trends.

Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure presented above to GAAP results has been provided in the financial tables included with this press release.

~ Strongest Balance Sheet in Several Years, Powered by $20 Million Private Placement and Zero Debt ~

~ Continued Revenue Diversification and Lean Cost Structure Driving Clear Path to Profitability and Growth ~

SANTA MONICA, Calif., Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Super League (Nasdaq: SLE) (the “Company”), a leader in playable media trusted by global brands to reach and activate gaming audiences through playable ads and gamified content, today released third quarter 2025 financial results.

Super League Chief Executive Officer, Matt Edelman Commented:

“Our third quarter and the initial weeks of October represented a pivotal moment for Super League, a new beginning punctuated by decisive financial, operational, and strategic achievements. We executed a series of capital and balance-sheet transactions that strengthened our financial foundation and eliminated legacy overhangs, culminating in the restoration of full Nasdaq compliance across all listing requirements. These steps, combined with partnerships set to open access to new revenue channels, supported by rigorous cost controls within our simplified capital structure, have positioned Super League to pursue disciplined, sustainable growth into 2026 and beyond.

At the same time, we continue to do what we do best, activate playable media campaigns with leading global brands such as Google, Panda Express, Lionsgate, Bazooka Brands and more, highlighting the value of interactive brand storytelling within mobile games and massive immersive platforms such as Roblox and Fortnite. We create opportunities for deep engagement with 190 million US consumers across these channels by harnessing the cultural influence and proven psychology of play.

We view play as one of the most powerful forms of human expression – a state of discovery, imagination, connection, and accomplishment. With 85% of the total online population playing video games, appealing to a consumer’s love of play is the future of advertising engagement. Our custom and scalable solutions reside in the heart of this cultural shift, empowering brands to achieve key marketing objectives through interactive content that transforms passive audiences into active customers.

Financially, we maintained strict cost discipline, decreasing non-cash operating expenses by 29% year over year. Our Q3 gross margins remained strong at 45%, up from 39% a year ago. While Q3 revenues declined to $2.4 million, we narrowed our operating losses by 23% on a cash basis compared to Q3 2024. Mobile ad revenue held steady at 15% of total revenue, while Roblox campaigns represented 42% of revenue, down from 57% of our revenue in 2024 - a result of purposeful diversification efforts. We also made tangible progress toward our goal of achieving Adjusted EBITDA profitability, now supported by an efficient cost structure, stronger balance sheet, and a reinvigorated partner pipeline.

Achieving profitability and increasing shareholder value remains our highest priority. We recognize that profitability is the foundation for growth and innovation. With the disciplined execution we’ve demonstrated recently and the new beginning now in place, we are confident in our ability to deliver that result.

Looking forward, with opportunity for expansion through multiple revenue engines, our path to outsized growth extends beyond gaming media. Through the backing from Evo Fund, the lead investor who committed $10 million in our private placement, we are exploring strategies within the digital asset economy. This convergence of gaming, media, and digital assets represents a massive frontier, and Super League is uniquely positioned to lead it.

With the capital round and corporate restructuring now behind us, we can channel the same intensity and focus into scaling operations by recapturing our revenue and partnership momentum, pursuing new avenues for business acceleration such as accretive M&A, including the possibility of building an owned and operated asset base of significance. These opportunities are only possible now because of our strong cash position.

We enter the final quarter of 2025 poised for resurgence with unwavering conviction, a fundamentally transformed balance sheet, and a team inspired by the long-term opportunity to make Super League a consequential company. We believe that our disciplined execution and expanding ecosystem will translate into meaningful, sustainable value creation for our shareholders.”

“Folks behind me would have been a fantastic congressional delegation to the Belem climate conference this week. That’s where we were supposed to be. The world still needs and wants American leadership. And unfortunately, the consequence of Donald Trump pulling the United States delegation out at the federal level is just that China is going to get a few more of these amazing opportunities that the United States ought to be leading on,” said Ranking Member of the House Committee on Natural Resources Congressman Jared Huffman. “We’re not going away, just like the climate crisis is not going away. Climate action leadership at the national level is not going to stop. Even in Brazil, we’re super proud of what’s happening at the sub-national level, with states and local governments, tribes, so many leaders in the United States are carrying the message to Brazil this week that America is still in and we will do our part to do that as well, even though Donald Trump and our Republican colleagues are going to try to stop us at every turn.”

“When I became Speaker for the first time, my flagship issue was the climate crisis because I saw it as a health, economic, security, and moral issue,” said Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi. “It is so sad that the United States of America, one of the biggest economies of the world and one of the leading emitters of the world, is not there in Brazil to protect God’s creation. I do believe this planet is God’s creation and we have a moral responsibility to be good stewards of it for the benefit of our country and for our children.”

The proposed bill, which would have prohibited virtually all noncompetes entered into after June 30, 2025, signals Indiana lawmakers are increasingly willing to reconsider the role restrictive covenants play in today’s labor market.

For employers across all industries, the proposed bill serves as a reminder that the legal landscape surrounding noncompetes is evolving and future legislative effort could push Indiana closer to broader constraints. While it is not possible to predict if a similar bill will be introduced in the 2026 session, now is an ideal time for organizations to assess how prepared they are for a potential shift.

What HB 1625 Would Have Done

Introduced on January 21, 2025, and referred to the House Committee on Employment, Labor and Pensions, HB 1625 represents a broader attempt to eliminate noncompetes. In fact, this straightforward bill would have completely prohibited an individual or entity from entering into a noncompete agreement after June 30, 2025.

The text of the proposed bill, as introduced, defined a noncompete agreement as “any contract that restricts an employee’s ability to work for a competitor or start a competing business.” While the bill did not move out of committee, its language aligned with a growing national trend toward limiting or completely eliminating non-competes for many workers.

HB 1625 had a clear intent: enhance labor mobility and reduce barriers for employees seeking to change jobs or start new businesses. Other states that have implemented near total statutory bans, such as California, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Oklahoma, credit those restrictions with creating a more dynamic labor market with higher wages, greater economic opportunities for workers, higher rates of entrepreneurship, and increased innovation. Further, federal agencies including the Federal Trade Commission and the National Labor Relations Board have pushed for similar limitations for much the same reasons.

Why a Failed House Bill Still Matters

The Indiana legislature’s focus on restrictive covenants is not a new endeavor by any means. Over recent years, Indiana has gradually tightened restrictions on noncompete agreements, first in specific professions (e.g., physicians) and then more broadly. For instance, under Indiana’s Senate Enrolled Act 475 (effective July 1, 2025), noncompetes entered by hospitals and physicians are banned in certain circumstances. It is common for major policy shifts to start small and fail to pass the first time they are introduced. HB 1625 is no different and its introduction alone offers several insights.

The proposal of HB 1625 signals that Indiana is paying attention to national trends and its legislators are willing to revisit noncompetes. This proposal did not emerge in a vacuum and Indiana has already demonstrated its willingness to curtail noncompete use in the health care sector and in relation to certain physicians. HB 1625 suggests a willingness to consider broader reform that reaches beyond one profession or industry.

Even though the bill stalled during the 2025 session, the question of whether noncompetes still serve Indiana’s economy and labor market is unlikely to disappear. HB 1625 provides a preview of how future legislation could be structured and where the policy debate may be heading.

What Do Businesses Do Now?

For businesses, especially those that rely on restrictive covenants such as noncompetes to protect client relationships, proprietary information, and workforce stability, HB 1625 and any successors, are worth watching.

While no immediate changes are required, a proactive approach requires employers to evaluate the strength and necessity of existing protections. Employers should consider auditing current noncompete agreements and strengthening other restrictive covenants, including non-solicitations, confidentiality, and trade secret agreements, moving forward.

It is also advisable to revisit the organization’s talent strategies because if mobility increases, recruitment, retention, and succession planning will become more important than contractual restrictions. Finally, employers should monitor upcoming legislative sessions for a likely reintroduction of the bill, potentially with revised language and/or new sponsors. Staying informed is critical in preventing any lapse in compliance.

HB 1625 should not be viewed as a failure, but rather as a warning shot. Whether similar proposals return next session, or whether narrower bills emerge first, noncompetes are clearly on the radar of Indiana’s policymakers. Employers who take time now to evaluate their reliance on noncompetes will be better positioned should Indiana decide to join the growing number of states passing similar bans. So while no immediate action is required, HB 1625 is a reminder that change may be on the horizon. Being proactive today will prevent disruption tomorrow.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15756_2603.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 18:02:00.238505
,EVs,2025-11-13 20:29:44+00:00,Tech Brew,Report: EV battery sector facing 'twin challenges' amid market slowdown - Tech Brew,Jordyn Grzelewski,,,,,https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2025/11/13/ev-battery-sector-challenges-alixpartners,"EV battery suppliers are under pressure—pressures, actually, according to a new report from AlixPartners.
Against the backdrop of significant policy changes on vehicle electrification in the US and Europe, EV battery makers face growing uncertainty and challenges related to plant utilization and finances, according to the report.
Automakers and suppliers are canceling EV projects, mulling cuts to existing electric models, and pivoting into other lines of business like energy storage.
“What we see in our study for the EV battery landscape is that there is a real change or a reset going on,” Rohit Gujarathi, SVP at AlixPartners, told Tech Brew.
“Because the past few years, the industry built a capacity for EV batteries for demand that has really not materialized at the scale where people expected it to be.","EV battery suppliers are under pressure—pressures, actually, according to a new report from AlixPartners.

Against the backdrop of significant policy changes on vehicle electrification in the US and Europe, EV battery makers face growing uncertainty and challenges related to plant utilization and finances, according to the report.

US EV sales are falling after tax credits of up to $7,500 expired at the end of September under President Donald Trump’s tax and budget bill. Automakers and suppliers are canceling EV projects, mulling cuts to existing electric models, and pivoting into other lines of business like energy storage.

To sum up the situation: “Billions of dollars have been invested in R&D, product development, and associated costs to rapidly scale batteries, lightweight materials, and other vehicle technologies designed to make EVs more attractive and affordable,” per AlixPartners.

But the demand that industry players projected just a few years ago hasn’t materialized, and now EV sales are falling. In 2023, AlixPartners’ own forecast called for EVs hitting 36% US market share by 2030. The consultancy has since slashed this projection in half.

“What we see in our study for the EV battery landscape is that there is a real change or a reset going on,” Rohit Gujarathi, SVP at AlixPartners, told Tech Brew. “Because the past few years, the industry built a capacity for EV batteries for demand that has really not materialized at the scale where people expected it to be. We are entering a phase where the supply is outstripping the demand, and it’s creating challenges both at the operational and financial level for the auto suppliers.”

Twinning: The report homes in on “twin challenges” facing EV battery suppliers: financial pressures and overcapacity, meaning plants are producing more batteries than demand levels can sustain.

Global battery cell manufacturing capacity was four times higher than demand last year, according to AlixPartners. By decade’s end, the firm still expects supply to be 2.9 times higher than demand.

And on the financial front, the report’s authors point to the indicators they use to measure financial stability for battery suppliers, noting that “scores have declined consistently from 2022 to 2024.”

“Layer on broader uncertainty from volatile US tariff policy, recent big swings in prices of steel and aluminum, and it becomes clear why battery manufacturers and automakers alike are struggling to balance steady operations with long-term investment decisions,” the report states.

Strategizing: AlixPartners prescribes a few strategies battery suppliers can use to weather the storm: maximizing plant efficiency, repurposing or ditching underused assets to fix some of the overcapacity issues, tweaking R&D investments “to simplify production, lower costs, and drive technical differentiation,” and focusing on specialized areas where individual companies can demonstrate unique value.

“For suppliers, addressing structural overcapacity and growing financial strain will require sharper operational discipline and targeted innovation,” per the report. “For OEMs, moderating EV demand and shifting policy landscapes call for more strategic supplier partnerships, flexible sourcing commitments that provide agility, and prudent bets on battery technologies that are most likely to deliver long-term competitiveness.”

“This is a critical transition phase for EVs,” Gujarathi said. “The near future is not about acceleration and growth. It’s more about doing some strategic course-correction by focusing on operations, having financial discipline, and making good technology bets. That will help the various players within the industry to come out relatively stronger.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/b2654e55eda51e7fec973a82d5d0f810625aace1-5120x2880.jpg?rect=0,96,5120,2688&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-11-13 16:00:14.724351

The 600-acre campus in Berkeley County is the second new battery plant opened by the company founded in 2017 by a former Tesla executive. It follows the company’s first plant and headquarters in Nevada, which opened in 2019.

The $3.5 billion investment marks the largest single economic development project in South Carolina’s history.

Over the next year, Redwood’s South Carolina-based employees will gather 20,000 metric tons of lithium and other metals, eventually refining and remaking them into renewed battery components to sell back to U.S. battery manufacturers. That’s enough materials to build about 41,000 electric vehicle batteries, according to a company spokesperson.

Electric vehicle battery company halts construction of SC manufacturing plant

At full capacity, the factory is slated to produce enough to supply battery materials for more than a million electric vehicles, the company said when it first announced its plans in December 2022.

The company did not respond to questions from the SC Daily Gazette about how many people are working at the plant as part of this first phase or when it might ramp up its next round of hiring.

“We’ve now begun work on our second phase and will continue to ramp capacity over the next several years as additional facilities come online,” a statement reads.

Current job openings advertised include chemical, mechanical and automation engineers and a financial analyst.

Over the next decade, Redwood plans to hire a total of 1,500 workers for jobs paying some of the highest wages in Berkeley County — between $27 and $75 per hour.

South Carolina legislators approved a $226 million incentive package in December 2022 to pay for improvements to the property in the Camp Hall industrial park.

Redwood’s other campus in Nevada produced more than 60,000 metric tons of materials last year, which the company said put it on par with the largest U.S. source of nickel and made it the only domestic source of cobalt.

New lithium battery recycling plant planned for Chester County

By comparison, Eagle Mine on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the only operating nickel mine in the U.S., produced 17,000 tons of nickel in 2023, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The country imported 159,000 tons of the metal that year, largely from Canada.

Redwood calls the materials it plans to recycle the “backbone of our modern economy, powering everything from computers and smartphones to energy storage, defense systems, and AI data centers.”

“Yet today, the United States imports nearly all of these minerals, often from unstable regions or adversarial nations,” the company’s statement said.

Redwood is valued at $6 billion, according to Business Insider.

The U.S. Department of Energy had earmarked the company for a $2 billion loan under the Biden administration’s hallmark clean energy legislation, but Redwood walked away from the funding in fall 2024 in favor of privately raised money.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/EVcar-scaled-1-2048x1536.jpeg,N,,2025-11-13 16:00:19.210113

Today, and long into the future, critical minerals are the backbone of many important industries in the world such as Tech and National Defense. These minerals power everything from electric vehicles to advanced defense systems.

Now, as Washington races to rebuild domestic capacity, Missouri is emerging as a surprising player in this new industrial contest. With vast untapped mineral reserves and a century-old mining heritage, the state could soon play a pivotal role in securing the raw materials that underpin both economic and national security.

A National Imperative

Critical minerals, cobalt, nickel, copper, lithium, and rare earth elements, form the foundation of modern technology and clean energy. They’re also central to defense production, powering jet engines, guidance systems, and advanced batteries.

But today, the U.S. imports more than half of its critical minerals from foreign sources, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Even more striking, China controls between 40% and 90% of the global refining and processing capacity for most of these materials

That dominance gives Beijing enormous leverage. In recent years, China has restricted exports of key materials like germanium and gallium, essential for semiconductors and defense systems, as a reminder of how mineral dependency can translate into strategic vulnerability.

Missouri’s Hidden Reserves

Few Missourians realize just how mineral-rich their state might be. According to a 2024 geological study by the Missouri Geological Survey, Missouri could hold up to 150,000 metric tonnes of cobalt, one of the world’s most sought-after metals.

For comparison, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), currently the top global producer, mined roughly 170,000 metric tonnes of raw cobalt in 2023 and holds an estimated 6 million metric tonnes of reserves.

Cobalt is essential for manufacturing EV batteries, jet turbines, and advanced communication systems, but the U.S. currently produces almost none. Nearly 70% of China’s refined cobalt comes from the DRC, where Chinese companies dominate both mining and processing infrastructure.

Other destinations for DRC cobalt exports include Tanzania, Zambia, South Africa, Singapore, the UAE, Switzerland, and Belgium, but China remains by far the largest buyer.

If Missouri’s projected cobalt deposits prove economically recoverable, the state could be sitting on one of the largest domestic cobalt reserves in North America, providing a potential alternative to Chinese-controlled supply chains.

Missouri also holds an estimated 103 million pounds of nickel, another critical component for batteries and high-performance alloys.

From Lead to Lithium: A Mining Legacy Reimagined

Mining is nothing new for Missouri. The Southeast Missouri Lead District, centered around the Viburnum Trend, has been home to commercial operations since the early 18th century. Companies like Doe Run have long produced lead, zinc, and copper, forming the backbone of the regional economy.

Now, as global priorities shift toward clean energy and advanced manufacturing, Missouri’s historic mining regions are being re-examined through a 21st-century lens.

State officials and academic researchers, especially at Missouri University of Science and Technology in Rolla (Missouri S&T), are exploring how those same geologic formations might yield new materials critical to America’s next-generation industries.

In 2024, Missouri S&T was designated a U.S. Tech Hub for Critical Minerals Innovation, one of only a handful nationwide. The initiative aims to develop new extraction methods, recycling techniques, and workforce training programs to support domestic mineral independence.

“This is about more than mining, it’s about building a modern industrial ecosystem that can supply our defense, energy, and technology sectors,” said Missouri S&T researchers in the announcement.

Tariffs Could Provide Investment

Missouri’s critical minerals sector could see rapid growth as the U.S.-China trade tensions highlight the risks of foreign dependence. China controls 40–90% of global refining and processing for key minerals, and the U.S. has launched a national security review that could trigger new tariffs if vulnerabilities are confirmed.

Michael Hollomon, commercial director for U.S. Strategic Metals, said Missouri could become a “boom state” for mining and processing, potentially creating thousands of jobs. The company has invested over $265 million in southeast Missouri and expects to produce alloy-grade cobalt for defense and aerospace by next year.

Doe Run Company, a longtime regional miner, urges caution, noting that bringing a new mine online can take five to ten years and requires policy stability.

At Missouri S&T, the Tech Hub for Critical Minerals Innovation is developing safer, more efficient extraction methods. Dr. Kwame Awuah-Offei said consistent policy is essential: “Our economy and national defense depend on these minerals, but without stability, investment is risky.”

The Policy Frontier: Building a Framework for Critical Minerals

While private exploration and academic research are moving quickly, state policy is still catching up. Missouri has no comprehensive framework for supporting critical mineral production, leaving potential projects vulnerable to inconsistent permitting, uncertain incentives, and limited coordination among agencies.

One earlier attempt to tackle that gap came in 2024, when the legislature considered the “Missouri Defense and Energy Independence Act” (HB 1834), sponsored by State Senator Justin Brown and former Rep. Aaron McMullen. The bill, though not enacted, offers a detailed roadmap for how Missouri might structure a statewide critical minerals strategy.

The measure proposed a tax credit system for companies converting operations to produce strategic materials such as cobalt, nickel, and rare earths for U.S. defense and energy projects. It also called for the creation of a “Grants for Independence from Foreign Influence Fund” seeded with at least $10 million in state and federal contributions, to support companies investing in new refining or recycling technologies.

Under the bill, qualified companies could receive up to 15% in tax credits on conversion costs, capped at $40 million statewide per year, and apply for grants of up to $500,000 to offset startup expenses. The proposal also required the Department of Economic Development to verify costs and outcomes, ensuring taxpayer accountability.

Though the measure expired when McMullen left office, the concept has since reemerged in policy discussions among lawmakers and economic development officials, who see potential to adapt its framework for future legislation.

Experts note that reviving and refining such an approach could give Missouri a competitive edge, pairing financial incentives with environmental oversight and workforce training.

Potential state-level solutions include:

Revisiting a tax credit or grant structure to attract new exploration and refining projects.

Establishing a Missouri Critical Minerals Task Force to coordinate agencies, industry, and research institutions.

Partnering with the Department of Defense and U.S. Department of Energy to align projects with national priorities.

Taken together, these measures could help Missouri capitalize on its geological advantages while protecting public lands and communities.

Balancing Growth and Responsibility

Environmental concerns remain a central part of the debate. Past mining operations left behind contamination that required decades of cleanup, a legacy that still shapes public opinion in the state’s Lead Belt.

Advocates for sustainable mining argue that any new mineral projects must prioritize transparency, local engagement, and modern reclamation practices.

National policy experts agree. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) emphasizes that responsibly mined domestic minerals can actually reduce global environmental harm by replacing imports from countries with weaker labor and ecological standards.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo for instance, a nation which provides roughly 70-80% of the worlds Cobalt supply, employs child laborers to mine the critical mineral.

From State Strength to National Security

Federal agencies are already investing in this space. The Department of Defense and Department of Energy have launched programs under the Defense Production Act to fund domestic critical mineral projects, while the USGS continues to identify new regions with strategic potential.

Missouri’s combination of infrastructure, research capacity, and geological potential gives it a strong position to benefit from this national effort. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace notes that partnerships between states, universities, and private industry will be essential to building a resilient U.S. supply chain.

A Strategic Opportunity

With global supply chains strained and China dominating the refining of key minerals, Missouri’s long-dormant mining sector is gaining fresh attention. Federal and state initiatives, from Missouri S&T’s new Critical Minerals Tech Hub to proposed tax credits for domestic production, are positioning the state to play a central role in U.S. mineral security. But experts warn that success will depend on consistent policy, environmental responsibility, and realistic assessments of what Missouri’s geology can truly deliver.",https://themissouritimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Second-Boeing-T-X-First-Flight-PUBLIC-e1493222993563.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 16:00:23.629598

Build a secure structure that protects you against the weather and predators, then cut gaping holes in the sides and roof and fill in those gaps with glass.

It was unthinkable in years gone by.

A home, or castle, did not have windows. They were an expensive luxury that weakened defenses and structures and made it difficult to keep a building comfortable.

The past hundred years have seen a radical change in design due to improvements in glass and window manufacture, combined with a recognition of good thermal insulation and improvements in the air conditioning equipment we use.

Window-to-wall ratio, WWR, the percentage of exterior wall surface to windows, has increased in the last 50-plus years with a slight hiccup occurring in the late ’80s/early ’90s.

On the cusp of both threats of global cooling and the “fact” the world would run out of all fossil fuels before the turn of the century, proposed building codes sought to restrict the WWR limiting design freedom.

As an example, under the proposed code changes back then, you would not be able to have that three-wall conditioned sunspace on the back of your home if the walls contained windows.

The building industry sought to combat this thinking with the idea you could design a theoretical glass house using available technology, materials and techniques that are energy efficient, especially when compared to the millions of existing buildings.

The psychological benefits of well-placed windows, both in the home and the work environment, is undisputed. Visual access to the outdoors lowers stress, enhances mood, has been shown to increase cognitive performance, leads to improved well-being and improved circadian health.

WWR in a typical two-story home is around 30% and may actually increase to 50% in warmer climates.

Good design considers the view, but it also must include exposure to summer sun, privacy issues, security and structural integrity.

All of this begs for the intelligent use of a good window product and professional installation.

The industry has seen the proliferation of many very good window products in recent years, but proper design, sizing and installation is a critical component of the installation.

The Guys love good vinyl, wood and fiberglass units provided they are well designed, constructed and installed. Flashing materials that direct water away from the unit should be long-lived metals or plastics, and the use of caulk should be minimal, with only top-end products used.

According to recent cost-to-value surveys, new window installations in a home will return, on average, around 70% their cost when the property sells with an average installed cost of $17,000 to $20,000, depending on frame material.

Actual return on investment, ROI, is generally not the reason to install, as computed energy savings based on a replacement may be calculated to take several decades to achieve break-even on the dollars invested.

But new windows can improve the living environment as well as provide the benefits described above.

A proper window replacement should enhance building appearance inside and out as well as increase the energy efficiency of the building. A good product will also reduce sound transmission, creating an often surprising result for homeowners.

Maintenance required for new windows should be reduced to occasional washing of the glass, but little else.

A long-term warranty should be a large consideration when examining a potential purchase, as well as maximizing glass area in the opening.

Companies like J&E Installation in Farmington Hills; Window World in Commerce Township; Clarkston Window and Door in Pontiac; Performance Remodeling in Macomb County; and Victors Home Solutions in Canton offer a wide variety of great products that are expertly sized and installed while providing the security of long-term warranty and service that have been proven by their decades in business.

These companies can also install a window where you currently don’t have one, an intriguing thought.

Consider that window replacement is a major investment in your home and quality of life.

Don’t make this decision based on advertising campaigns or low prices. Use the criteria we’ve discussed and talk to the people we trust.

The $10 billion additional investment signals Toyota isn’t just defending existing hybrid production—they’re expanding capacity precisely when competitors retreat.","Toyota began production Wednesday at its $13.9 billion North Carolina battery plant and announced an additional $10 billion investment over five years—a massive bet on hybrid vehicles timed perfectly with the Trump administration’s rollback of EV mandates. The facility in Liberty, North Carolina, marks the world’s largest automaker’s first battery plant outside Japan and validates the company’s cautious “multi-pathway” electrification approach while competitors scramble to add hybrids after betting heavily on pure EVs.

The timing couldn’t be more strategic. Just six weeks after federal EV tax credits expired on September 30, Toyota is doubling down on the hybrid technology it never abandoned, even as U.S. EV sales collapsed 24% and traditional automakers laid off thousands of workers.

$60 Billion Total U.S. Investment Anchors Manufacturing Strategy

The 1,850-acre (749-hectare) facility will produce 30 gigawatt-hours of batteries annually at full capacity, supporting 14 production lines for hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids, and battery electric vehicles. Toyota announced the plant will create 5,100 jobs and currently employs 2,500 workers, with full buildout expected by 2030.

“Over the next five years, we are planning an additional investment of $10 billion in the U.S. to further grow our manufacturing capabilities, bringing our total investment in this country to over $60 billion,” said Ted Ogawa, president and CEO of Toyota Motor North America.

The plant, first announced in December 2021 during the Biden administration’s push to onshore battery production, will supply hybrid batteries for the Camry, Corolla Cross, and RAV4, plus a yet-to-be-announced all-electric three-row SUV. Batteries currently ship to Toyota’s Kentucky factory and the Mazda-Toyota joint venture in Alabama.

Multi-Pathway Approach Gains Political Validation

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy attended Wednesday’s opening ceremony, praising Toyota’s strategy and signaling the administration’s support for hybrids over pure EV mandates.

“American people want hybrids and electrics, and Toyota is doing that with what the consumer wants as opposed to politics,” Duffy told attendees, according to local news reports.

Duffy also announced plans to ease fuel economy standards previously implemented under the Biden administration, which had aimed to drastically reduce fuel consumption for the 2022-2031 model years.

“We know there is no single path to progress,” Ogawa said. “That’s why we remain committed to our multi-pathway approach, offering fuel-efficient gas engines, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery electronics and fuel cell electronics.”

The statement reflects Toyota’s long-standing resistance to abandoning internal combustion technology entirely—a position that looked questionable when competitors raced toward all-electric futures but now appears strategically sound as policy winds shift.

Industry Rivals Pivot Back to Hybrids Post-Tax Credit Expiration

Toyota’s hybrid focus stands in sharp contrast to competitors now reversing course. Volkswagen secured a $426 million Brazilian loan for hybrid development after years of betting on pure EVs, while VW admitted its Rivian partnership technology could power internal combustion vehicles.

Other automakers like Volkswagen have signaled they will add more hybrids as the Trump administration has rescinded EV tax credits and eliminated penalties that incentivized EV sales. Ford halted F-150 Lightning production with no restart timeline, while General Motors laid off more than 3,300 EV workers and idled multiple battery plants.

Toyota has been one of the slowest automakers to move to full EVs but rapidly converted its best-selling vehicles to hybrids. In September 2024, the company reduced its 2026 EV production targets from 1.5 million to 1 million vehicles annually—a decision that now appears prescient given market conditions.

Post-Tax Credit Market Validates Cautious Strategy

The elimination of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit through President Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” triggered an immediate market correction. After the September 30 deadline, October EV sales plummeted from 98,289 units in September to just 74,897—a 24% collapse in a single month that validated warnings about subsidy-dependent adoption models.

Light vehicle sales overall decreased 6.5% to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 15.3 million units in October, marking the lowest sales pace in 15 months. The drop extended beyond EVs, with overall unadjusted light vehicle sales declining 4.5% year-over-year as economic uncertainty, labor market concerns, and the loss of tax incentives converged to suppress demand.

Toyota’s North Carolina plant opening comes as the International Energy Agency reversed its stance on peak oil demand, projecting continued petroleum consumption growth through 2050 as EV adoption slows without sustained policy support. The IEA essentially admitted that removing both purchase incentives and emissions penalties means EVs won’t displace petroleum fast enough to meet climate commitments.

Facility Details and Economic Impact

The state-of-the-art plant spans 7 million square feet across the 1,850-acre site in Randolph County, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) southeast of Greensboro. The facility operates 24/7 and will eventually house 14 battery production lines producing batteries that are approximately 80% complete when they leave North Carolina for final assembly at vehicle plants.

Beyond manufacturing, Toyota designed the facility as a “vibrant community” featuring on-site childcare, a pharmacy, medical clinic, and fitness center for employees. North Carolina Governor Josh Stein noted the state is home to more than 100,000 clean energy jobs, with Toyota’s investment strengthening the automotive supply chain.

President Trump mentioned Toyota’s $10 billion investment commitment during his trip to Japan last month, praising the company’s decision to “build where we sell.” The investment follows a broader deal between Japan and the Trump administration promising manufacturing investments in exchange for lower tariffs.

EVXL’s Take

Toyota’s North Carolina battery plant opening represents the culmination of a strategy we’ve been tracking for over a year—one that looked questionable when announced but now appears brilliantly timed.

Back in August 2024, we reported Toyota was considering converting most Toyota and Lexus models to hybrid-only versions, with hybrid sales skyrocketing from 9% of total sales in 2018 to 37% by mid-2023. While competitors rushed toward pure EV futures, Toyota methodically expanded hybrid options across its lineup—a decision that drew criticism from EV advocates but positioned the company perfectly for the post-tax credit market.

The contrast with competitors is stark. Volkswagen struggled with a 38% profit plunge even as EV deliveries rose, then pivoted to secure hundreds of millions for hybrid development after years of all-in EV bets. Meanwhile, Toyota was already manufacturing the hybrid batteries that customers actually want to buy without subsidy support.

When Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” eliminated the $7,500 EV tax credit effective September 30, we warned about the demand cliff that would follow. Then in October, we reported U.S. vehicle sales cratered as EV demand collapsed 24% in a single month. That’s not a market correction—that’s policy-induced destruction of consumer confidence in pure EV value propositions.

Toyota’s multi-pathway approach now looks like the only rational strategy for an industry facing regulatory whiplash. Hybrids provide meaningful emissions reductions without the range anxiety, charging infrastructure dependency, or price premium that deterred mainstream buyers even with $7,500 subsidies. Remove the subsidies, and the value proposition for many pure EVs simply evaporates.

The $10 billion additional investment signals Toyota isn’t just defending existing hybrid production—they’re expanding capacity precisely when competitors retreat. While Nissan bleeds billions betting on solid-state batteries it may not survive to commercialize, and Toyota makes promises about 40-year solid-state batteries with a decade-long history of missed targets, the North Carolina plant is producing real batteries for real vehicles customers are actually buying today.

The question facing other automakers: how much market share will they cede to Toyota while they scramble to add the hybrid technology they dismissed as “transitional” just two years ago?

Each year, Veterans Day reminds us of the courage and dedication of the men and women who serve our country. In the days that follow, it’s worth reflecting on an important question: What happens to our nation’s heroes once their military service ends?

When service members take off the uniform, their mission isn’t over. It changes. The same discipline, technical skill, and sense of purpose that drive military operations are precisely what America needs to power its energy future.

That’s why we support H.R. 4105, the Veterans Energy Transition (VET) Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by Reps. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., and Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., both veterans themselves. The legislation connects two national priorities that unite us all: helping veterans and military families successfully move into civilian life, and strengthening the skilled workforce needed to build America’s next generation of energy and manufacturing.

Across America, energy demand is surging, with electricity demand alone anticipated to increase as much as 50% by 2050. Artificial intelligence data centers and grid-modernization projects are changing how we live and work. Yet the number of skilled electrical workers entering the field still lags behind retirements. For example, about 7,000 new electricians join the industry each year, while 10,000 retire — leaving a growing gap. In the transformer sector alone, the employee shortfall has reached 13,400 workers.

As leaders in this field, we know that gap doesn’t just slow projects, it threatens American competitiveness and energy security. To stay ahead, the electrical industry must attract workers and close the talent gap.

At the same time, more than 200,000 service members shift out of the armed forces each year, many with the exact technical expertise and leadership experience our industry thrives on. The VET Act bridges these realities. It expands partnerships between the Department of Defense and employers in the energy, utility and advanced manufacturing sectors. It also creates new grants through the Department of Labor for training and certification while removing barriers for small businesses and nonprofits to participate.

The concept is simple but powerful: match the nation’s best trained, most mission-driven talent with the industries that keep America running — and power the future workforce leading smart manufacturing and industrial automation.

That same vision is already taking shape across our sector.

This year, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association partnered with the Veteran Internships Providing Employment Readiness program, a veteran-founded nonprofit dedicated to helping service members and military spouses find meaningful civilian careers.

In partnership with allied trade associations, NEMA launched a pilot program with VIPER this summer to place veterans directly into civilian roles across the electrical industry. Our goal: 50 hires in six months. Each placement represents a new career, a stronger family, and a step toward closing America’s workforce gap.

VIPER was built by veterans for veterans. Its mission is not just to find jobs but to fight the root causes of veteran suicide -- unemployment, underemployment and isolation — by providing purpose, stability and community. That mission aligns with what our industry stands for. Every transformer, receptacle, circuit and control system, and lighting source the industry produces is part of something bigger: powering our hospitals and schools, our communities, our nation.

To understand how programs like these look in practice, consider Leviton, an American manufacturer of electrical, lighting, controls, and network infrastructure solutions with nearly 120 years of commitment to daily excellence and industry advancement — including through proactive development of the electroindustry.

As one of the first NEMA members participating in the VIPER pilot program, Leviton actively collaborates with organizations like NEMA, the National Electrical Contractors Association, the National Electrical Manufacturers Representatives Association, and the National Association of Electrical Distributors that value leadership, practical experience, and the meticulous approach that veterans bring to critical industries. This involves providing essential materials for learning labs, training, and education at apprenticeship and trade schools, alongside active participation in industry standards development.

The VET Act would make it even easier for employers to open more doors for veterans ready to continue serving, this time by powering America’s future. This is what effective, bipartisan policy looks like.

The VET Act builds on proven programs within the departments of Defense and Labor that help service members of all ranks prepare for civilian careers, linking them with employers ready to train and hire. It combines government action with private-sector leadership to produce measurable results. That’s exactly the kind of partnership America needs more of.

It also reflects the best of our national character. Veterans have already proven their commitment to our country. They deserve opportunities that make full use of their talents. And America’s energy and manufacturing industries need access to the capable, values-driven workforce that veterans provide.

In the days after Veterans Day, when the parades are over and the flags are folded, the best way to honor those who served is by expanding their opportunities to lead in civilian life. The VET Act — and the collaborative work already underway across the electroindustry — do exactly that.

It’s a perfect opportunity for Congress to turn gratitude into action and service into strength.",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/w5zdep-5585559.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/5585559.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 17:03:13.810886

“When I became Speaker for the first time, my flagship issue was the climate crisis because I saw it as a health, economic, security, and moral issue,” said Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi. “It is so sad that the United States of America, one of the biggest economies of the world and one of the leading emitters of the world, is not there in Brazil to protect God’s creation. I do believe this planet is God’s creation and we have a moral responsibility to be good stewards of it for the benefit of our country and for our children.”

“Folks behind me would have been a fantastic congressional delegation to the Belem climate conference this week. That’s where we were supposed to be. The world still needs and wants American leadership. And unfortunately, the consequence of Donald Trump pulling the United States delegation out at the federal level is just that China is going to get a few more of these amazing opportunities that the United States ought to be leading on,” said Ranking Member of the House Committee on Natural Resources Congressman Jared Huffman. “We’re not going away, just like the climate crisis is not going away. Climate action leadership at the national level is not going to stop. Even in Brazil, we’re super proud of what’s happening at the sub-national level, with states and local governments, tribes, so many leaders in the United States are carrying the message to Brazil this week that America is still in and we will do our part to do that as well, even though Donald Trump and our Republican colleagues are going to try to stop us at every turn.”

“This is the year that marks the 10-year anniversary of the Paris Agreement, the agreement where just about every country on the planet agreed to cut climate pollution in order to avoid the worst impacts and the escalating cost of the heating climate,“ said Congresswoman Kathy Castor. “House Democrats — and especially the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition — most states, most local communities, businesses large and small, environmental justice organizations, scientists, religious organizations, all remain committed to that goal, even in the face of Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress turning a blind eye to the growing costs and escalating catastrophic events that are impacting us.”

“For the first time in history, the Trump Administration did not send a federal delegation to the UN climate change summit, instead choosing to boycott this critical global summit.

Financing to deploy heat pumps at scale A functional, highly efficient industrial heat pump is just table stakes.","DALLAS — Past gnarly live oaks, behind a barbecue joint and a brewery in a suburb north of Dallas, a white-washed brick commercial building extruded its own wispy cloud into the Texas sunlight.

Inside, the startup Skyven Technologies was running a mechanical apparatus dubbed Arcturus, which turns waste heat into industrial-grade steam. It’s so new that I was the first outsider to see the contraption up close — signing my name in slot No. 1 in the log book. But, soon, Skyven will show it off to manufacturers who want to save money on energy bills while cutting their carbon emissions.

Industrial heat causes about 20% of global carbon emissions, per a McKinsey analysis. Very high-temperature processes, like melting ores for steelmaking, are tough to replicate without fossil fuels. But, in Skyven’s analysis, about half of those industrial heat emissions come from making steam, usually in boilers that burn gas or other fuels. Skyven, and a growing cadre of startups, are designing clean, electric, hyper-efficient heat pumps to take over that task.

They have their work cut out for them: Right now, the U.S. is home to about 39,000 industrial boilers, according to Richard Hart, a decarbonization expert at the think tank American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. The steam they generate is used to sterilize injectable drugs, turn pulp into paper, pasteurize milk, cure lumber, and more.

Boilers are reliable and not particularly expensive — and in the U.S., natural gas is cheap — so it’s hard for cleaner alternatives to compete. ACEEE, which tracks announcements of new industrial clean-heat projects, namely heat pumps or thermal batteries, currently registers just 19 completed installations nationwide.

Skyven tackles the tricky economics by focusing on energy savings. The startup installs Arcturus at no cost to the customer, alongside existing gas boilers. The heat pump taps into the factory’s waste heat, which helps it reach high temperatures with far more efficiency than older technologies. Skyven and the customer split the savings from making cheaper electric steam, but if electricity prices spike, Skyven temporarily switches back to the gas boiler to avoid higher costs.

“What we want to do as a business is make industrial manufacturing in the U.S. and worldwide a lot more efficient, by being the leader in upcycling industrial heat and reusing it without having to create it anew,” Skyven founder and CEO Arun Gupta told me.

For now, the steam produced in Skyven’s site near Dallas floats harmlessly into the sky. But with contracts signed and real-world data to share, Skyven is mobilizing for a wave of factory deployments in the years to come.

A first look at Skyven’s industrial heat pump

Arcturus is not something you can pull out of a box fully formed, but a room-sized network of interlocking pipes, chambers, and appliances.

Gupta and Jim Saccone, Skyven’s senior vice president of global sales, handed me earplugs and led me into the clamorous, sun-washed room where the machinery whirred. In one corner sat a conventional gas boiler and a water heater, which acts as a stand-in for the waste source Arcturus will harness in factories.

Arcturus uses a heat exchanger to transfer energy from whatever the source is to a loop of water. While I observed it, relatively cool water from Arcturus hit the heat exchanger and rose from around 67˚C (153˚F) to 92˚C (198˚F). That heated water flows through shiny steel piping into a thick metal vacuum chamber, which lowers the boiling point and swiftly ​“flashes” the water into steam.

That low-pressure steam then travels through a series of four compressors, all noisily spinning at roughly 15,000 revolutions per minute. Each compressor ratchets up the temperature and pressure of the steam until it hits the target zone, which can be tailored to the needs of each factory.

“Because we make this steam with waste heat that was otherwise going to get dumped, and then just use compressors to compress that steam, that’s much less energy than using the energy to make the steam but not having any compressors,” Gupta said.

The demonstration unit generates 105˚C (221˚F) steam, which runs back through a pipe into the ​“customer” side of the room. In a real customer setting, Arcturus could sit up to half a mile from the factory where it delivers steam, if space is limited. For now, the vapor just vents through the roof.

The demo system produces up to 1 megawatt of thermal output. Skyven has already signed deals in the 10- to 15-megawatt-thermal range — these will have a similar footprint, Gupta said, but use bigger pipes and compressors. The technology can heat steam all the way to 215˚C (419˚F) if needed; that’s unusually high for industrial heat pumps, which typically reach around 170˚C (338˚F).

Since Skyven is producing real heat now, it has established an empirical baseline for its operating efficiency. The term of art here is ​“coefficient of performance,” which measures how much energy is produced per unit of energy consumed.

Gas boilers score 0.83, Saccone said, losing some energy along the way. Electric resistance boilers, a commercially mature electric heat technology, hit close to 1, a near-complete transfer of energy into heat. Startup AtmosZero recently installed an air-source industrial heat pump at New Belgium Brewing in Colorado that can reach 165˚C (329˚F); that device sports a COP of around 2.

Skyven’s average measured COP for its pilot is 6.5, but Gupta said he aims to raise it to 8 within the next three months. This isn’t a fixed value: It depends on factors like how hot the waste source is and how hot the steam needs to get. The demo site nonetheless establishes a real-world high water mark of how efficient Arcturus can be.

“The higher that [COP] value goes, the less important the spark gap is going to turn out to be,” said Hart, referring to the gap between power and gas prices. If, for example, a unit of electricity costs twice the equivalent in gas, but produces six or eight times the heat, then the heat pump is cheaper to run than a gas boiler.

The accidental heat pump

Gupta didn’t set out to invent an industrial heat pump.

He had been working at Texas Instruments’ digital-light-projection business, designing the chips that run most every digital movie-theater projector. He wanted to do something good for the world and was concerned about climate change. ​“So, I was skimming ARPA-E research papers, as one does,” Gupta recalled, as we noshed on burgers up the road from Skyven headquarters.

The Department of Energy’s ARPA-E funds research on potentially transformative technologies. That archive was where he hit on the challenge of clean industrial heat; he figured, with his expertise manipulating light, he could make a better solar-powered heat source.

Gupta founded Skyven in 2013. At first he just tinkered in his Dallas garage, for a while confined to a wheelchair by a calamitous motorcycle accident. Eventually, he moved to the Dallas Makerspace and raised pre-seed financing for his concept. But the sheer amount of insulated plumbing needed to distribute the solar thermal heat wrecked his project economics.

“I made the mistake of a classic technical founder, in that I had a technology that I thought solved the market problem, but I didn’t really validate the market problem,” he explained. Still, he didn’t want to give up on his goal.

“At the time, no one knew anything about industrial heat,” Gupta said. The cleantech industry had spawned plenty of companies that could sell solar electricity to commercial customers, but hardly any solutions for heating needs at factories.

So Skyven reoriented around developing and financing energy-efficient upgrades for industrial heat using the best available technologies. The startup raised seed funding for this tech-agnostic model and landed a breakthrough deal with California Dairies, Inc., the largest dairy co-op in the Golden State.

The mission was to reduce gas combustion, saving money and carbon emissions, at major dairies in Turlock and Visalia. Skyven did this by deploying three types of equipment at each site: solar thermal to generate clean heat, smart steam traps to monitor steam loss in the existing system, and apparatuses to recover heat from boilers.

Skyven bundled $9 million in grants from the California Energy Commission with utility incentives from Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co., and landed project financing from Kyotherm, a French lender for clean-heat projects. With that combined funding, Skyven installed the equipment at no up-front cost to the dairies, and then as the facilities reduced their gas consumption, split the cost savings with them. The dairies could see a metered readout of the avoided gas combustion, and they paid Skyven an agreed-upon portion of it.

Installation wrapped up in 2023. The interventions, still operating under 10-year service contracts, are cutting 7,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually by avoiding over 110,000 million British thermal units of natural-gas combustion, more than originally anticipated. But Skyven concluded that the commercially available solar thermal panels weren’t a competitive source for heat, reporting to the California Energy Commission that a steam-generating heat pump would be ​“a more effective decarbonization solution with a wider appeal.”

Around that time, Gupta said, Skyven was scoping out a deal for an ethanol company in the Midwest. The team came across a bare-bones case study from a European ethanol plant that had built something called an ​“open cycle mechanical vapor recompression” device — machinery that takes waste heat, compresses and heats it, then recirculates it into the plant.

The problem was, outside of that European plant’s in-house engineering team, ​“there’s really no one in the world that knows how to implement this,” Gupta said. Skyven tried hiring a third-party engineering firm to draw up designs for the Midwestern customer, but that proved unsatisfactory. ​“We then said, ​‘Okay, what if we built that experience and expertise and essentially invented this system in house?’”

Having learned from his early missteps, Gupta first vetted the idea with a slew of potential customers, who responded enthusiastically. Then Skyven stopped its tech-agnostic deals and staffed up on engineers, drawing on millions of dollars of revenue from the dairy projects. The company’s task, Gupta said, was to take existing steam compressors and adapt them into a heat pump that can be easily inserted into ​“an actual manufacturing facility with all the intricacies and challenges.”

Now that process has concluded, as evidenced by the steam billowing into the blue Texas sky. And Skyven did all that having raised just $11 million in outside investment and having generated real revenues, quite the outlier for Silicon Valley-backed cleantech.

Financing to deploy heat pumps at scale

A functional, highly efficient industrial heat pump is just table stakes. For Skyven to succeed, it must fight an uphill battle convincing big, old companies to bet on new technology. That’s why the startup designed its product and deal structure to minimize risk for the customer.

Arcturus can be assembled without interrupting factory operations, so customers don’t have to sacrifice production time to get the benefits of clean heat. Then Skyven schedules the steam and water connections to coincide with the plant’s regular maintenance shutdown. If that’s not possible, workers can perform a ​“hot tie-in” to connect Arcturus without stopping factory operations.

Skyven only runs the heat pump when it’s less expensive than using the legacy heat source. This entails real-time algorithmic calculations based on the price of electricity, the price of gas, and the COP. Company software toggles back to the original gas boiler in moments when power prices surge; if Arcturus is running, it’s got to be saving money compared to burning gas, with a target of at least a 30% reduction in cost.

This arrangement means that factories don’t have to pony up millions of dollars up front to decarbonize their heat.

“You can spend your dollars on stuff that’s core, like expanding production or improving quality or rolling out a new product line, and you can still hit your sustainability goals,” Gupta said.

Facilities teams that partner with Skyven can even tell their bosses that they’ll reduce their future operating budgets through the savings from electric heat, Saccone said.

Skyven is able to offer no-money-down steam with the ongoing financial support of Kyotherm, which financed the waste-heat collectors Skyven put into the two California dairies. Now, Kyotherm has signed an agreement whereby Skyven pitches Arcturus installations, and Kyotherm agrees to finance ones that clear its performance thresholds.

“You cannot give a blank check; you need to look at each different project,” said Remi Cuer, Kyotherm’s investment and business development director.

Kyotherm expects high single-digit internal rates of return; that’s more than solar or wind farms would pay, because emerging heat tech carries more risk. But assuming Skyven keeps bringing attractive projects, it can expect project financing for quite some time. Cuer declined to name a specific cap on the agreement but suggested his firm could fund a few hundred million dollars of Skyven installations.

Financiers usually run away from new technology until several of their peers have vetted it. But Kyotherm wasn’t afraid to back Skyven despite the newness of Arcturus. Cuer attributed that assurance to having seen how the team worked on the dairy installations. The Dallas-area pilot project is ​“really important for us,” he added, so his team can review the logs of COP, uptime, and other key metrics.

The Trump administration canceled Skyven’s fully contracted grants along with many others in a legally dubious effort to roll back binding federal commitments for clean energy.

“The loss of certainty on the $6 billion from the DOE’s Industrial Demonstrations Program is a challenge for the recipients. They are all considering next steps,” Hart said. But even where the money is gone, the knowledge and corporate buy-in required to win those grants lives on. The grantees ​“had to really think about how to do this technically, how to bring the right partners together, get the plants excited about the idea, and do all of that due diligence as part of their submissions,” Hart said.

Most other companies losing those grants boast far greater balance sheets, like Kraft Heinz and Diageo. Skyven, a much smaller company, is pursuing an internal appeal within DOE, and not currently seeking legal recourse, Gupta said.

“The cancellation of the funds has not killed the projects,” Gupta said. ​“They are actually all still moving forward, they’re just moving forward a lot slower.”

The plan had been to build a slew of them and learn from the results to drive costs down. Instead, Skyven slowrolled development to grind out system-cost reductions, so the projects would still make financial sense without government support. This effort went surprisingly well, Gupta reported, and pushed costs 40% lower in just a few months.

For this analysis, Insurify defines “uninsured” as homeowners who reported spending less than $100 annually on home insurance — meaning they likely aren’t buying coverage at all. A mix of unaffordability and climate risk likely explains this lack of coverage.1

The 10 states with the highest uninsured home rates have average median household incomes that are at least $25,000 lower than average incomes in the 10 states with the lowest uninsured rates. For example, Mississippi, West Virginia, Louisiana, and Arkansas — the four states with the lowest average household incomes in the U.S. — are also among the 10 states with the highest uninsured home rates.

This is true even in climate-vulnerable states, such as Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas, which are also among the 10 states with the highest share of uninsured homeowners.

While forgoing home insurance coverage might save these homeowners some money in the short term, they risk not meeting mortgage requirements. It also leaves a critical financial asset unprotected when disaster strikes.

These are the 10 states with the highest percentage of uninsured homes.

Key findings

Florida, Louisiana, and Oklahoma — the most expensive states for home insurance per Insurify data — are also among the states with the highest rates of uninsured homes.West Virginia has the highest rate of uninsured homes — nearly 1 in 4 (23.9%).In Florida’s Miami-Dade County, which has a 24.9% uninsured home rate, the average annual home insurance cost is $16,872 — 22% of the county’s median household income.In Arizona’s Navajo County, 51% of homes are uninsured — the highest county rate in the U.S.

West Virginia, New Mexico, Louisiana lead top 10 states with highest uninsured home rates

While homeowners can save money in the short term by forgoing home insurance, a damaging weather event or other disaster could threaten that asset. Climate change is increasing the probability of severe, destructive weather. It means that homeowners who may not have previously experienced severe weather now face the threat of significant damage.

Insurance companies are re-evaluating as risk shifts. Home insurance non-renewals increased by 267% in Louisiana between 2018 and 2023.2 And, when the cost of protection becomes unaffordable, some homeowners opt to go without insurance.

1. West Virginia

Percentage of uninsured homes: 23.9%Average annual cost of home insurance: $1,387Median household income: $60,798

West Virginia’s low housing costs likely contribute to its high rate of uninsured homes. Homeowners may be able to pay off their mortgages faster, which could explain why West Virginia has the highest share of homeowners without a mortgage, at 55.1%.

West Virginia also has a low cost of living and well-below-average home insurance costs, according to the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center (MERIC).3 It has the lowest average home value in the country, according to the Zillow Home Value Index, boosted by a high prevalence of manufactured housing. The state also has a 75.5% homeownership rate — the highest in the U.S., according to census data.

But West Virginia also has the second-lowest median household income, at $60,798 annually. Raleigh and Wood counties have the highest uninsured home rates in the state and the lowest median household incomes.

About 6.2% of homeowners without a mortgage statewide are “house poor,” meaning they spend 30% or more of their income on housing costs, according to an Insurify analysis of ACS data. The national average is 5.4%.

West Virginia also has a high overall climate vulnerability, according to the U.S. Climate Vulnerability Index.4 Dam failures, earthquakes, floods, landslides, levee/floodwall failure, and severe storms are all “hazards of concern,” according to West Virginia’s 2023 Hazard Mitigation Plan.5

2. New Mexico

Percentage of uninsured homes: 23%Average annual cost of home insurance: $2,463Median household income: $67,816

Like in West Virginia, New Mexico’s high uninsured home rate is likely partly due to 50.6% of homeowners not having a mortgage. A lower number of mortgages means fewer homeowners are required to buy insurance.

But New Mexico faces changing climate hazards, notably hail, riverine flooding, and wildfires, which can make going uninsured financially risky.6 New Mexico also ranks high in terms of climate vulnerability.

Home values and insurance costs in New Mexico rank below the national average. The low cost of living and high share of manufactured homes may contribute to the high 71.1% homeowner rate.

Still, the low median household income of $67,816 means home costs take up more of residents’ budgets. In New Mexico, homeowners spend 24% of their income on housing costs, including insurance, taxes, maintenance, utilities, and flood insurance, according to an Insurify report.

New Mexico has large Native American reservations, which often lack access to financial and mortgage products due to low lender participation.7 Federal land ownership and credit issues create other barriers.8 The uninsured home rate is 30% in San Juan County, home to a large Navajo Nation reservation. The median household income there is also below the state average.

3. Louisiana

Percentage of uninsured homes: 21.2%Average annual cost of home insurance: $5,132Median household income: $60,986

More than 1 in 5 Louisiana homes are uninsured, representing unprecedented financial risk given the state’s hurricane exposure. Around 48.2% of Louisiana homeowners don’t have a mortgage. Many mortgage-free homeowners may try to save money by going uninsured, especially as the state’s median household income of $60,986 is the third-lowest in the nation.

Louisiana is also the second most expensive state for home insurance, according to Insurify data. Insured homeowners carry the highest cost burden of any state, spending 8.4% of their income on home insurance. About 6.1% of Louisiana homeowners are house poor — more than the national average.

Terrebonne Parish, a coastal region southwest of New Orleans, has the highest uninsured home rate in the state, at 29.7%. Due to its hurricane exposure, the parish has a relatively high risk index, and insurance premiums reflect that risk. The average annual cost of home insurance is $8,316 in Terrebonne, according to Insurify data.

Louisiana has pushed for strong building codes and incentivized weather-mitigation renovations to help homeowners reduce damage and the possibility of expensive repairs.9 Homeowners who can afford to invest in resilience improvements can also save on their home insurance.

4. Alaska

Percentage of uninsured homes: 20.6%Average annual cost of home insurance: $1,377Median household income: $95,665

Alaska’s exceptionally high cost of living may squeeze budgets enough for homeowners to try to save money by going without insurance. Between April and June in 2025, Alaska ranked sixth for the overall cost of living, behind Hawaii, California, Massachusetts, Washington, D.C., and New York, according to MERIC.

About 39.6% of Alaska homeowners don’t have a mortgage, and the state has a much higher median household income and lower-than-average insurance costs. But Alaskans — particularly those living in cities — face utility, healthcare, and grocery costs that exceed the national average, according to a 2024 survey by the Council for Community and Economic Relations.10

Climate risks, including avalanches, wildfires, volcanic activity, and earthquakes, can also compound the financial consequences of forgoing home insurance in the state.

5. Mississippi

Percentage of uninsured homes: 20.2%Average annual cost of home insurance: $3,427Median household income: $59,127

More than half of Mississippi homeowners (51.6%) don’t have a mortgage, and Mississippi is among the 10 most expensive states for home insurance, according to Insurify data. Since Mississippi has the lowest median household income in the country, homeowners spend a bigger percentage of that income on home insurance.

Jones and Forrest counties have the highest percentages of uninsured homes in the state, at 26.7% and 22.6%, respectively. They also have median household incomes below the state average: $48,298 in Forrest County, the lowest in the state, and $51,748 in Jones County.

Mississippi also faces several climate-related risks, including tornadoes, hailstorms, riverine flooding, and hurricanes, particularly along the Gulf Coast, according to FEMA. Homeowners may opt to go uninsured to save money in the short term, but damage from a weather event or a house fire could leave many struggling to recover.

Around 6.6% of homeowners without a mortgage are house poor, so losing that asset could be disastrous.

6. Florida

Percentage of uninsured homes: 19.4%Average annual cost of home insurance: $8,491Median household income: $77,735

Florida is the most expensive state for home insurance, according to Insurify data, largely due to its climate risk. And even with a higher median household income, Florida ties Louisiana for the highest insurance cost burden.

Home insurance costs 8.4% of the median income in Florida, more than three times the national average. The state tops the list for homeownership costs, which take up 37% of household income, according to an Insurify report.

Around 44.2% of Florida homeowners don’t have a mortgage, which is higher than the national average but lower than most states on this list. But 7.8% of homeowners without a mortgage are house poor, the highest share nationwide.

As in other states, affordability is likely a contributing factor to the high rate of uninsured homes. More than 1 in 3 (37.7%) homes in Putnam County are uninsured, the highest rate in the state. Putnam County also has the lowest median household income statewide, at $51,293.

Florida’s high hurricane exposure, as well as wildfire and tornado risks in certain areas, can drive up insurance costs. But those hazards also make opting out of home insurance exceptionally risky.

Miami-Dade County, for example, has a high uninsured home rate, despite its hurricane and wildfire risk. Its median household income is $76,184, close to the state average, but home insurance costs $16,872 per year — a staggering 22% of median household income.

7. Arkansas

Percentage of uninsured homes: 19.1%Average annual cost of home insurance: $2,621Median household income: $62,106

Climate risks have a less acute effect on insurance costs in Arkansas than in Florida. But weather events like severe hailstorms, tornadoes, and wildfires still threaten properties around the state.

Arkansas’ percentage of uninsured homes is likely linked to its high 47.6% share of homeowners who don’t have a mortgage. Home insurance costs are much more moderate in Arkansas than in nearby states like Louisiana and Oklahoma, Insurify data shows. But home insurance still costs 4.2% of the median household income, the seventh-highest nationwide.

White, Jefferson, and Garland counties have the highest uninsured home rates in the state. Jefferson and White counties also have the lowest median household incomes in Arkansas. The Garland County median income is closer to the state average, but Garland has the highest share of house-poor homeowners without a mortgage, at 8.4%.

8. Alabama

Percentage of uninsured homes: 18.9%Average annual cost of home insurance: $3,190Median household income: $66,659

Alabama’s high percentage of homeowners without a mortgage (46.5%) contributes to its 18.9% rate of uninsured homes statewide. But the picture shifts dramatically depending on different regions in the state. Alabama has the fourth-lowest median household income in the country, and, though costs spike along the Gulf, insurance costs are more moderate than in neighboring states.

Shelby County has the lowest rate of uninsured homes in the state, at 10.8%. The median household income there is $102,265, the highest in the state. And, despite its high tornado risk, Shelby County has the cheapest average insurance premiums in the state. Home insurance costs make up 2.2% of the median income. Just 2.7% of homeowners without a mortgage are house poor.

In Walker County, on the other side of Birmingham, 32.6% of homes are uninsured, and 6.7% of homeowners without a mortgage are house poor. Insured homeowners spend 5.6% of their median household income of $58,017 on insurance.

9. Oklahoma

Percentage of uninsured homes: 18.3%Average annual cost of home insurance: $4,058Median household income: $66,148

Oklahoma is the third most expensive state for home insurance, according to Insurify data. Hailstorms, tornadoes, and severe wind have increased insurer losses, which policyholders feel in premiums.

High insurance costs can squeeze the budget: Oklahoma has one of the lowest median household incomes in the U.S., and insurance costs can eat up 6.1% of that income. It also has a high rate of homeowners without a mortgage, which likely contributes to its higher percentage of uninsured homes.

Muskogee County, home to part of the Muskogee Nation reservation, has a 25.8% uninsured home rate. Oklahoma has the largest population of people who chose American Indian as their only race, according to the 2020 U.S. Census.11 As in New Mexico, Native American reservations can lack mortgage access, which may contribute to higher rates of uninsured homes. The county’s median income is also below the state average.

The Oklahoma county with the lowest uninsured home rate, Canadian County, also has the highest median household income. And, even though insurance costs are higher there than in Muskogee County, they account for 5.3% of the median income versus Muskogee’s 6.6%.

10. Texas

Percentage of uninsured homes: 17.7%Average annual cost of home insurance: $3,610Median household income: $79,721

In Texas, 44.5% of homeowners don’t have a mortgage — more than the national average. And, though the median household income is higher than in many states on this list, more costly premiums mean insured homeowners pay 4.5% of that income to home insurance.

Since Texas is such a large state, climate risks vary considerably. Galveston County, located southeast of Houston on the Gulf Coast, is the most expensive county in Texas for home insurance due to its hurricane exposure. But, likely due to that risk and its above-average median income, it has one of the lowest uninsured home rates, at 10.7%.

Three Texas counties — Liberty, Hidalgo, and Cameron — are among the 10 counties with the highest uninsured home rates in the country.

In Liberty, northeast of Houston, 45.6% of homes are uninsured — the second-highest percentage nationwide. Climate risks from lightning storms and tornadoes may contribute to the county’s above-average insurance costs. Homeowners with insurance pay 6.7% of the county’s median income of $60,963 to cover premiums, higher than the 4.5% average share that insured homeowners pay statewide.

Arizona’s Navajo County has the highest uninsured home rate in the U.S.

The average rate of uninsured homes in the U.S. is 14.1%, but county-level data shows just how much that percentage can vary based on local factors. Nearly 1 in 7 homes nationwide are uninsured, but in Arizona’s Navajo County, more than half of homes (51%) are uninsured.

Various factors, some similar and some distinct, influence the rate of uninsured homes among the 10 counties with the highest rates.

Almost 66% of Navajo County is reservation land.12 It’s home to the Hopi, Navajo, and Fort Apache reservations. Barriers complicating mortgage access on reservation land likely contribute to its high uninsured home rate. Nearly 74% of homes in Navajo County don’t have a mortgage, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.

Lack of mortgage lender participation and the challenges of mortgaging land held in a federal trust can make lending difficult, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Navajo County’s most significant climate risks are lightning storms and wildfires, according to FEMA. The average home insurance costs in the county are below the state average. Still, a lower median income means insured homeowners are paying a higher share of that income to cover premiums.

Tips: How homeowners can make home insurance more affordable

For homeowners already on tight budgets, home insurance may seem like an obvious line item to cut. But going without it comes with serious risks, especially as severe weather becomes more erratic.

“When budgets are tight, it’s understandable to question whether insurance is really necessary,” said Mallory Mooney, director of sales and service at Insurify. “But even a basic policy can make the difference between a manageable setback and a major financial hardship. The key is finding the right balance between protection and affordability.”

The most straightforward way to lower home insurance costs is to regularly shop around and compare quotes, enabling homeowners to ensure they have the best available deal. Talking to an agent can also help homeowners find the right policy for their needs.

Mooney recommends homeowners start by reviewing their deductible.

“Raising your deductible can lower your premium significantly, as long as you have enough set aside to cover that amount in the event of a loss,” she said. “It’s also important not to cut coverage too deeply. If your policy limits fall far below your home’s rebuild value, you could face unexpected gaps, even with smaller claims.”

Mooney also recommends homeowners take advantage of every available discount and make thoughtful adjustments while trying to avoid risky reductions.

“Remove coverage for items you no longer own, drop riders that no longer apply, and skip add-ons that duplicate benefits you already have elsewhere,” Mooney said. “The goal isn’t a fancy or even generic policy, but the one that gives you meaningful protection at a cost you can sustain. Personalized protection that you can afford keeps you from being one broken pipe or storm away from losing everything.”

Methodology

Insurify analysts used the U.S. Census Bureau 2024 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-Year Estimates, published on Sept. 11, 2025, to determine the rates of uninsured homes. This report defines “uninsured homes” as owner-occupied homes with home insurance costs of less than $100 per year in 2024. The survey notes that the less-than-$100 category may include $0, and some escrowed homeowners may appear as $0.

To determine the rate of uninsured homes, Insurify analysts divided the number of owner-occupied homes with less than $100 in annual home insurance costs by the total number of owner-occupied homes nationwide and by state and county. The ACS 1-Year Estimates include only counties and metro areas with a population of 65,000 or more.

For the lead statistic, Insurify defines “climate-vulnerable states” as the 20 states with the highest national percentile for vulnerability on the U.S. Climate Vulnerability Index, a project from the Environmental Defense Fund, Texas A&M University, and Darkhorse Visualization.

Insurify data scientists turned to their real-time database of insurance quotes from partner carriers, as well as aggregated rate filings from Quadrant Information Services, to determine average home insurance costs.

Unless otherwise stated, home insurance rates in this report represent the average annual cost of an HO-3 insurance policy for homeowners with good credit and zero claims within the past five years, covering a single-family frame house with the following coverage limits: $200,000 to $750,000 dwelling coverage depending on the locality’s typical home value, $25,000 personal property, $30,000 loss of use, $300,000 liability, and a $1,000 deductible. Certain states also include a 2% hail deductible and/or a 5% wind/hurricane deductible.

This means that Texas — and not the federal agency — will directly administer the permitting, enforcement and oversight of underground carbon storage facilities in the state.

While there’s no substitute for electrification, fuel switching and energy efficiency — which can achieve much of the emission reductions needed in our state — carbon sequestration also has a significant role to play in Texas. High levels of industrial emissions, significant economically viable pore space and deep industry expertise in doing this type of work coupled with increasing interest in low-carbon value chains for commodities produced here means carbon storage can be a huge player in climate solutions here. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has concluded with high confidence that “[i]f the geological storage site is appropriately selected and managed, it is estimated that the [carbon dioxide] can be permanently isolated from the atmosphere.” This is easier said than done. Implementing and enforcing a robust Class VI permitting program is a critical ingredient that can help Texas agencies and operators ensure sites are “appropriately selected and managed” and meet permanence expectations.

Will Texas carbon storage primacy spark a world-class permitting and enforcement program, or will it merely check the boxes? Only time will tell - and the world is watching Share on X

Texas certainly has the industry and technical expertise to build a credible, science-based oversight program that delivers the environmental and public safety protection required by law, though doing so will demand advancements beyond EPA’s minimum requirements. And Texas has a far from perfect history in independently enforcing strong standards and holding industry accountable for a high bar of performance. So, now starts the critical test of whether the Texas Railroad Commission (the agency that will administer the process) will step up to this task and bolster both global credibility and local public trust in the program.

In other words, getting primacy was Step One. Now, Texas has to deliver.

We’ve learned a lot in the 15 years since the federal Class VI program was adopted, both technically and with respect to specific community concerns. If Texas wants to lead — if it wants to help industry continue to prove that commercial CO2 storage can be done with environmental integrity and be safe and permanent — it must commit to a stronger, smarter and more transparent regulatory approach.

During the EPA’s public comment period, EDF submitted a collection of eleven recommendations we believe will put Texas on the best path to meeting this objective. As the Texas Railroad Commission moves forward, EDF will continue to work with Texas regulators and elected officials to ensure the RRC builds and implements the best possible program.

In doing so, we’ll focus on four primary areas.

Aim higher than minimum standards

The EPA’s authority to regulate underground injection projects like carbon sequestration predominantly turns on preventing impacts to underground sources of drinking water — not every surface or subsurface issue that may arise — meaning Class VI standards are a strong foundation for environmental integrity for carbon storage, but not the final word. There’s much to be learned from both real-time experience and leading research on what best practices look like for subsurface activities to avoid impacts like felt earthquakes, containment leaks that don’t reach groundwater and over-pressurization, and much of that expertise is here in Texas. The RRC has the ability and, now, the authority to build a stronger-than-baseline technical program that protects more than just groundwater if it has the will to do it.

Specifically, EDF’s comments recommended that Texas:

Update monitoring well standards to reflect knowledge learned from recent incidents at ADM’s well in Decatur, IL.

Issue clear public guidance on how RRC will address seismic risks that may fall below EPA’s threshold for storage complex integrity but could still cause felt earthquakes.

Adopt more protective and proactive approaches to identifying undocumented wells in areas of review.

Adopt rules or establish guidance to prevent adverse impacts to storage facilities from other subsurface activities.

Assess the limitations of ‘pressure space’ in addition to pore space and risks that may increase as more projects come online.

Strong oversight and enforcement

Much of the excitement around Class VI primacy seems to stem from a desire to expedite the permitting process. But Texas’ program must not sacrifice oversight for speed, or it risks cutting corners and unsafe projects. We’ve seen with the Class II program how things can go wrong quickly if a flood of projects overwhelms staff and impacts enforcement, from seismicity to sinkholes. The RRC has to get Class VI right from the start and avoid repeating the mistakes of the past with other injection programs.

Specifically, EDF’s comments recommended that Texas:

Ensure the RRC has enough funding and trained staff to safely oversee the Class VI program.

Avoid changing liability laws in a way that reduces RRC’s authority to enforce Safe Drinking Water Act requirements.

Avoid backsliding

Primacy also gives Texas a bigger decision-making role when it comes to less clear and untested aspects of the Class VI program, such as how it will apply in coastal waters or at what point other types of wells that inject carbon need to upgrade to Class VI standards. It’s vital that the RRC avoid backsliding when it comes to answering these questions and, instead, show leadership in requiring best practices that provide the strongest protections for communities and the environment.

Specifically, EDF’s comments recommended that Texas:

Provide more formalized guidance or additional rulemaking to clarify how the RRC will make decisions on when and how other carbon injection wells, like enhanced oil recovery wells, can or must meet Class VI requirements.

Apply full Class VI rules to projects in coastal or state-water areas, even if underground sources of drinking water aren’t present, to prevent integrity loss.

Safety and people first

Lost in many discussions of primacy are safety and people — a core reason to have rules and regulations in the first place. Done right, carbon storage in Texas can provide many benefits — energy, climate, landowner revenue and others. Yet the RRC must ensure we do not chase these benefits at the expense of public safety and the people who will be affected by these new facilities.

Specifically, EDF’s comments recommended that Texas:

Strengthen emergency planning and coordinate with local responders.

Build a stronger public engagement program, including mandating outreach and public information sharing.

EDF stands ready to help — and to hold to account

We are cautiously optimistic that the RRC can and will, and in some cases may already, exceed the federal Class VI requirements. With primacy, Texas now has a responsibility to further build public, corporate and investor confidence in carbon management technologies. And doing so will require a stronger, smarter and more transparent regulatory approach.

Texas has a chance to get it right from the start. With thoughtful enhancements and a commitment to public accountability, the RRC can build a Class VI program that meets the moment — protecting people, water and climate while supporting economic opportunity. EDF stands ready to support this outcome. But we will also continue to hold regulators and operators accountable to the high standards this work demands.",https://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/wp-content/blogs.dir/38/files//Screenshot-2025-11-13-131927.png,N,,2025-11-13 15:02:07.444466

Company officials emphasized that Toyota wants to produce the full range of different types of electrified vehicles that customers desire.
Toyota officials made two announcements during the ceremony.
Stein, who often touts the state's success in recruiting green energy companies, did so at the battery plant ceremony.","Toyota held the ceremonial grand opening Wednesday for its only battery plant outside of Japan — a $14 billion array of mall-sized buildings spread across an 1,800-acre site in the tiny Randolph County town of Liberty.

The event drew some of the company’s top executives, as well as government officials from Japan and the United States, including U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy and Governor Josh Stein.

Toyota’s North American president and CEO Ted Ogawa pronounced the plant opening ""a milestone in Toyota's American Journey.""

""The launch of this plant marks a pivotal moment in the future of electrification for Toyota and for U.S. auto manufacturing,"" he said.

It also marks a startling turnaround for the area where Toyota built the plant. For decades, traditional North Carolina industries like furniture making and textile mills in Randolph County have been shutting down.

Now, a place where the county seat was declared ""one of America's fastest dying towns"" by Forbes magazine less than 20 years ago is home to the largest single investment in North America by the largest automaker in the world.

Stein said the future-focussed jobs Toyota is bringing are a huge win for the region and the state.

""This is super high-tech, these are the jobs of the future, and we are thrilled that Toyota invested nearly $15 billion here in North Carolina,"" he said.

“When a company of the scale and significance of Toyota plants a seed, a seed in the ground — $14 billion, it's going to eventually be 5,000 jobs — there's going to be all kinds of other businesses that come around to support this incredible operation,"" Stein said. ""So Liberty, North Carolina, is going to be a place of immense opportunity, and we're excited about the future here.""

Local officials say landing such an important plant for a company with a reputation like Toyota’s is the kind of endorsement that already has other companies even outside the auto industry considering locations there.

The plant now has four production lines in operation making cells for the batteries in standard hybrid vehicles.

Eventually, the company expects it to have 14 lines, with some also producing cells for plug-in type hybrids and all-electric vehicles.

Hybrids are in heavier demand than all-electric vehicles, at least for now.

Company officials emphasized that Toyota wants to produce the full range of different types of electrified vehicles that customers desire. They said the Liberty plant was designed to be flexible so as the market shifts among different kinds of vehicles, the mix of cells can change.

Toyota officials made two announcements during the ceremony. Ogawa said the company is planning another $10 billion in manufacturing investments in the United States, but didn’t offer details. And another company official announced it is donating $2.7 million to the Asheboro and Guilford County school systems.

It had made earlier donations to the schools.

Stein, who often touts the state's success in recruiting green energy companies, did so at the battery plant ceremony. Then he went from the Toyota ceremony in the morning directly to Charlotte, where he announced an electric vehicle company, Scout Motors, plans to invest more than $200 million to build its corporate headquarters in the city.

On 4 November 2025, Member of the European Parliament Susana Solís Pérez and Clean Air Task Force (CATF) co-hosted a high-level policy dialogue at the European Parliament on the future of fusion energy in Europe.

As the European Commission prepares to publish its first EU Fusion Energy Strategy, the closed-door meeting provided an opportunity for an open and forward-looking exchange on how Europe can transition from a research-oriented model to an industrial strategy centered around accelerating commercial deployment. Participants discussed the recommendations of Clean Air Task Force’s A Fusion Engine for Growth: A European Industrial Strategy for Fusion Energy and shared their perspectives on the policy shifts needed to support commercial deployment.

The discussion brought together EU policymakers, industry leaders, researchers, and financial institutions to align perspectives on Europe’s role in advancing this emerging clean energy field.

Designing the Path to Commercialisation

For decades, Europe has led the world in fusion research and development. But today, fusion is no longer just a scientific pursuit—it’s becoming a global commercial race. Around the world, countries are realigning their funding tools and industrial policies to accelerate commercial deployment. Europe will need to do the same to stay competitive, or it will risk ceding the global leadership it has built over decades.

As MEP Solís put it, “We must turn our research strength into industrial strength — transforming our scientific leadership into commercial success, competitiveness, and jobs.”

Indeed, Europe already has a world-class foundation to build on. Its long-term investment in fusion research — through ITER and related R&D programmes — has created unmatched expertise, infrastructure, and supply chain capacity. The challenge now is to turn this scientific leadership into a thriving industrial sector that can drive innovation, enable technology transfer, and strengthen Europe’s energy security through clean, firm, and abundant power.

The meeting underscored how the forthcoming EU Fusion Strategy can enable this shift from research to deployment, and Europe’s policy choices in the coming months will determine whether it leads or lags in this emerging clean energy industry. The strategy can play a pivotal role in driving competitiveness, decarbonisation, energy independence, and innovation.

Key suggestions raised during the discussion included:

Recognising the deployment of fusion energy as a strategic element of Europe’s future energy autonomy.

Shifting toward a Key Enabling Technology–based research strategy that closes. common science and technology gaps across fusion concepts and ensures public research directly supports commercialisation pathways.

Establishing fit-for-purpose regulatory frameworks that clearly distinguish fusion energy from fission energy.

Establishing dedicated fusion energy public–private partnerships to accelerate technology maturation and large-scale deployment.

Adopting milestone-based principles in PPPs to de-risk public investment by tying support to demonstrated technical progress.

Embedding technological neutrality across harmonised and flexible EU funding instruments—particularly in the forthcoming EU budget—to ensure a level playing field for all clean energy solutions, including the diversity of different fusion designs. This includes tackling challenges in accessing funding for infrastructure utilities

Leveraging Europe’s fusion supply chain strengths as a result of the ITER project to support commercialisation and access global markets.

Together, these measures can help Europe translate decades of research excellence into tangible progress toward deployment. By aligning policy, industry, and innovation, Europe can position itself not only as a leader in fusion science, but as a driving force in the global fusion economy.

What’s Next

It’s clear that Europe stands at a turning point for fusion energy – one that requires coordinated action across policy, industry, and finance to turn decades of research into a commercial reality. Participants shared a strong sense of momentum and alignment around the need for strategic investment, regulatory clarity, and industrial coordination to ensure Europe’s continued leadership in this emerging field.

There were differing views on what the EU Fusion Strategy should prioritise, and the discussion featured genuine debate and open exchange. Bringing policymakers, industry leaders, researchers, and financiers together in one room created space for honest dialogue that clarified differing perspectives, surfaced the key questions Europe must address, and highlighted shared priorities moving forward.

The insights from this dialogue will continue to shape CATF’s work to support a European industrial strategy for fusion energy — one that turns Europe’s long-standing research excellence into commercial strength, ensuring that fusion contributes to competitiveness, innovation, decarbonisation, and energy security for decades to come.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/05134011/CATF_EuropeFusionReport_HeaderImg.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 18:00:53.821216

Lafitte Solar was enabled through a long-term PPA with Meta, through which Meta also receives all environmental benefits associated with the project, including RECs. This follows another 385-MW Louisiana PPA for Meta earlier this fall.

The project was celebrated on Nov. 13 at a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by Monroe Mayor Friday Ellis, local officials from the Ouachita Parish Police Jury and Ouachita Parish Industrial Development Board, RWE leadership and employees and construction partner McCarthy Building Companies.

Construction of Lafitte Solar was completed in collaboration with RWE’s EPC partner McCarthy, supporting more than 150 full-time jobs on the project at its peak. During construction, workers supported local businesses and restaurants, and shopped at area stores, amplifying the project’s economic impact.

“We’re thrilled to see the Lafitte Solar project reach this important milestone — not only adding clean energy to the grid locally but adding jobs to the local economy,” said Amanda Yang, head of clean and renewable energy at Meta. “Projects like Lafitte Solar are essential to achieving our clean energy goals while strengthening communities.”

Lafitte Solar’s site design features natural and native vegetation around the perimeter, promoting biodiversity and habitat conservation to benefit the project’s land and surrounding farmlands. The project will also use a flock of over 600 sheep to maintain healthy vegetation onsite. This practice not only protects local farmland but deepens partnerships with regional farmers, demonstrating how renewable energy coexists with agriculture.

For clarity they were called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) back then and before the Paris Agreement was adopted in December 2015, countries were asked to submit their proposed climate plans.

When the Paris Agreement entered into force these INDCs were formally converted into NDCsonce countries ratified the agreement. So, effectively, the first round of NDCs were the INDCs submitted in 2015, and they became official NDCs upon ratification 2016 onward!.

The earliest NDCs focused on energy, transport, forestry, and finance. Few included measurable climate education goals. Early adopters such as Costa Rica, Colombia, Cambodia, Benin, Malawi, Vanuatu, and the EU, UK, and Dominican Republic set important precedents, integrating climate education into curricula, teacher training, or community learning. Of 133 NDCs reviewed, only 40 countries mentioned climate or environmental education specifically in strategies for mitigation, adaptation, or resilience.

By October 2025, the picture has transformed: 152 countries now meaningfully include, reference, or institutionalize climate education, marking a clear shift toward recognizing education as a strategic tool in climate action.

WHY DOES CLIMATE EDUCATION MATTER?

Here’s why climate education in all schools matters: it empowers students to navigate the climate crisis and helps to alleviate eco-anxiety. On top of that, it equips students and all learners with the knowledge and skills necessary to thrive in the burgeoning green economy.

According to the latest World Bank 2025 report on the subject, Are Green and Digital Skills a Pathway to Jobs in the Middle East and North Africa?, the demand for green and digital skills is rapidly outpacing supply, underscoring the urgency of integrating these competencies into educational curricula.

Similarly, LinkedIn’s 2024 Global Green Skills Report highlights a significant gap between the increasing demand for green talent and the available workforce, with global demand for green skills growing approximately twice as fast as supply between 2023 and 2024..

Countries such as Costa Rica, Colombia, Cambodia, Benin, Malawi, Vanuatu, and members of the EU, UK, and Dominican Republic have pioneered efforts by embedding climate education into national curricula, teacher training, and community initiatives. These countries have not only addressed environmental concerns but have also laid the groundwork for a workforce adept in sustainable practices and green technologies.

WE HAVE LIFT OFF!

It was from 2016 onwards that climate education began to gain real traction. UNESCO’s Global Action Programme on Education for Sustainable Development (2015–2019) framed education as a driver of transformation, helping to mainstream sustainability principles across education systems. The implementation guidance adopted at COP24 in Katowice in 2018 provided an international framework for education, awareness, training, and public participation under Article 12 of the Paris Agreement—known as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE). Meanwhile, civil society, led by EARTHDAY.ORG’s Climate Education Coalition, mobilized governments to embed climate education into their updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

EARTHDAY.ORG has played a pivotal role in both tracking and mainstreaming the concept of climate education through its decades long advocacy for teaching students about climate change.

At COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh in 2022, EARTHDAY.ORG’s Global Climate Education Coalition was launched to bring together more than 100 youth focused partner organizations to further champion climate education. Building on EDO’s 2020 Climate and Environmental Literacy Campaign, the Coalition advocates for countries to embed education and civic engagement into their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The Coalition positions education as a strategic tool for resilience and green transformation, empowering young people to take a lead in creating a sustainable future.

All of this advocacy and campaigning was made even more accessible by EARTHDAY.ORG’s communication team’s decision to create an NDC Tracker in 2024. This tracker monitors which countries include, or omit climate education and is maintained by EDO’s dedicated education team with the help of their interns. The tracker cleverly divides climate education adoption into 4 categories, 1 featuring the most significant adopters. By translating complex UNFCCC language into clear data EARTHDAY.ORG is amplifying calls for climate education and is a measurable component of climate ambition.

By October 2025, 62 countries explicitly integrated climate education into school curricula, Kindergarten through Grade 12 (Category 1 on the EARTHDAY.ORG NDC Tracker), while 64 countries referenced it as important without specifying curricular inclusion (Category 2 in the NDC Tracker). One of these 64 in Category 2 represents the EU’s 27 member states.

Altogether, 152 nations have now meaningfully included climate education in their NDCs. Only a few countries remain without mention—a nearly four-fold increase since 2015, demonstrating the powerful alignment between education policy and climate commitments.

REGIONAL PROGRESS IS KEY

Regional progress is notable. In Latin America and the Caribbean, Colombia, Costa Rica, Argentina, the Dominican Republic, and Panama have moved from symbolic mentions to institutional mandates. Coalitions like the Brazilian Coalition for Climate Education link ministries, civil society, and private actors to anchor education in energy-transition narratives.

In Africa, Cabo Verde, Gambia, Namibia, and Benin have launched teacher-training curricula integrating climate content, with the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) endorsing education as a national priority.

In Asia and the Pacific, Cambodia, Viet Nam, Vanuatu, and the Marshall Islands operationalize climate education across school systems, where literacy is critical for survival in Small Island Developing States. Europe continues embedding environmental education into Green Deal and Just Transition frameworks.

Challenges remain. Few NDCs include indicators for educational outcomes, funding for climate education remains limited, rural and Indigenous communities often lack access, and cross-ministerial coordination is weak. Dedicated funding through mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund and Transforming the Future Fund is essential to close these gaps.

WORK STILL TO BE DONE

Around 40 countries have yet to integrate climate education into their NDCs. But UNFCCC procedures allow them to submit updates at COP30 Belém to align with global consensus. COP30, the first UN Climate Conference in the Amazon, brings together civil society—including EARTHDAY.ORG, the Brazilian Coalition for Climate Education, IPAM Amazônia, and youth networks—advocating for a Belém Declaration on Climate Education.

All parties are urged to integrate climate education into their NDC 3.0 revisions, fund teacher training and curriculum reform, and include education indicators in the Global Stocktake 2028. If adopted, Belém could mark the moment when education becomes a measurable lever of climate ambition rather than a footnote.

From 40 nations in 2015 to 152 in 2025, climate education’s inclusion in NDCs reflects the growing maturity of global climate governance. EARTHDAY.ORG’s NDC Tracker provides the transparency and accountability needed to sustain this progress. What is more, we will have a three person team in Belém, during COP30, including myself to keep advocating for climate education.

Based on those constraints, Toor expects the rebate program will provide benefits to at least 6,500 households.","Coloradans looking to make their homes more climate-friendly can now apply for up to $14,000 in rebates for electric appliances and energy upgrades.

On Thursday, the Colorado Energy Office opened applications for its Home Electrification and Appliance Rebate Program, or HEAR, which offers discounts for electric stoves, heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, insulation, wiring and panel upgrades.

The program is funded by the Inflation Reduction Act, the landmark climate and health care law signed by President Joe Biden in 2022. The $4.5 billion investment has so far survived the Trump administration’s attempts to claw back federal investments designed to slow global warming.

Along with support for electric vehicle chargers along highways, the discounts appear to be a rare example of a green energy initiative continuing under President Trump. Will Toor, the executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, said the federal government hasn’t actively stopped Republican- and Democratic-led states from launching the rebate programs.

“We can’t predict what the federal government may do in the future, but both Congress and the administration have allowed the programs to move forward, and we have no indications that that’s going to change,” Toor said.

The new discounts, however, come less than two months before the federal tax credit for home energy upgrades expires.

What kind of home energy upgrades are covered by the rebates? And who qualifies?

The rebates offer discounts on all-electric appliances certified by the federal Energy Star program. It’s available to homeowners living in manufactured or single-family homes. Renters can also apply with the written authorization from their landlords.

To qualify for the maximum amount, a household must earn less than 80% of its county’s area median income. Households earning between 80% and 150% of the AMI can qualify for half the maximum rebate. Potential applicants can consult state income tables to determine their county’s AMI.

How can residents apply?

Anyone interested in the discounts should start with the online application.

The process involves submitting income verification documents. If approved, participants should contact a contractor registered to participate in the rebate program, according to Raine Queenan, a senior program manager with the Colorado Energy Office. A full list of registered contractors is available on the state website.

Those contractors will then help decide the full scope of upgrades. Once complete, the state will review the proposed projects and issue the rebates to installers, which would apply the discounts to the upfront cost paid by customers.

“There are a lot of requirements in this program, and we want to ensure Coloradans — especially low-income Coloradans — are receiving professionals who are trained and ready to support them,” Queenan said.

Are there even enough contractors to do the work??

Not yet.

Only four contractors have fully completed registration with the state to participate in the rebate program. Queenan said more than 40 additional companies spread across Colorado are now working their way through the registration process.

Ari Rosenblum, a spokesperson with the Colorado Energy Office, acknowledged many households might not be able to obtain a contractor through the program immediately. The sooner households apply and prove their eligibility, the sooner the state can connect participants with registered contractors, Rosenblum said.

Elephant Energy, a Boulder-based home electrification company, is still awaiting approval to participate in the state rebate program. Co-Founder D.R. Richardson said state communication about the program has been “hit or miss,” but he’s glad the incentive program is moving forward.

“Medium-term, this is amazing. This is money for low-income homeowners to electrify their homes,” Richardson said.

Have other states launched programs like this??

Besides Colorado, 12 other states and the District of Columbia have launched some version of the federally funded home electrification rebate program, according to an ongoing analysis published by the National Association of State Energy Officials.

David Terry, the president of the association, said other states are awaiting final approval from the U.S. Department of Energy to launch their rebate programs. Those efforts are now on hold while the federal government “streamlines” requirements for states receiving the federal funding.

It appears Colorado avoided the issue by launching an initial version of the program last year. Toor acknowledged that the move allowed the former Biden administration to approve Colorado's program — clearing the way for it to launch consumer-facing rebates more quickly than most other states.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Energy did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

How many households can benefit from the program?

There’s a fixed amount of funding available for the program.

Out of an initial $70 million federal grant, Colorado has set aside $46 million for rebates earmarked for single-family homes, manufactured homes and small multifamily buildings. The program will last through 2029 or when the state exhausts its federal funding.

Based on those constraints, Toor expects the rebate program will provide benefits to at least 6,500 households. The final number could vary widely, however, depending on whether participants opt for cheaper upgrades like induction stoves or more expensive options such as a heat pump, or new insulation.

Are there other programs available to discount the cost of home energy upgrades?

Yes — and it’s not easy to figure out the full range of incentives.

Municipal governments like Boulder County offer rebates for home energy upgrades. Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest utility, also offers discounts on heat pumps through its Clean Heat Program, an incentive program ordered by state policy makers.

Additional rebates could also arrive in the next few months. In early 2026, Colorado plans to expand its new rebate program to include discounts for small multifamily buildings. In the first quarter of 2026, it will also launch its version of the Home Efficiency Rebate (HER) Program, a separate federally funded initiative offering $56 million in rebates based on the amount of energy saved by different building upgrades. The Denver Regional Council of Governments also received a $200 million federal grant to boost cleaner buildings around metro Denver.

It’s a rapidly shifting landscape Elephant Energy navigates on behalf of consumers and HVAC subcontractors. Richardson said the complexity has benefited his company, but he fears it’s holding back the larger home electrification industry.

“It’s really hard as a consumer or HVAC contractor to stay on top of it all,” Richardson said.",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/03/20240813-home-electrification-event007-Cropped.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 15:01:44.038954

Key findings Florida, Louisiana, and Oklahoma — the most expensive states for home insurance per Insurify data — are also among the states with the highest rates of uninsured homes.
Since Mississippi has the lowest median household income in the country, homeowners spend a bigger percentage of that income on home insurance.
Home insurance costs are much more moderate in Arkansas than in nearby states like Louisiana and Oklahoma, Insurify data shows.
This report defines “uninsured homes” as owner-occupied homes with home insurance costs of less than $100 per year in 2024.","One in seven (14.1%) American homes are uninsured, according to an Insurify analysis of data from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2024 1-Year Estimates. In the states most vulnerable to climate catastrophes, that ratio rises to 1 in 6 (16.2%).

For this analysis, Insurify defines “uninsured” as homeowners who reported spending less than $100 annually on home insurance — meaning they likely aren’t buying coverage at all. A mix of unaffordability and climate risk likely explains this lack of coverage.1

The 10 states with the highest uninsured home rates have average median household incomes that are at least $25,000 lower than average incomes in the 10 states with the lowest uninsured rates. For example, Mississippi, West Virginia, Louisiana, and Arkansas — the four states with the lowest average household incomes in the U.S. — are also among the 10 states with the highest uninsured home rates.

This is true even in climate-vulnerable states, such as Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas, which are also among the 10 states with the highest share of uninsured homeowners.

While forgoing home insurance coverage might save these homeowners some money in the short term, they risk not meeting mortgage requirements. It also leaves a critical financial asset unprotected when disaster strikes.

These are the 10 states with the highest percentage of uninsured homes.

Key findings

Florida, Louisiana, and Oklahoma — the most expensive states for home insurance per Insurify data — are also among the states with the highest rates of uninsured homes.

West Virginia has the highest rate of uninsured homes — nearly 1 in 4 (23.9%).

In Florida’s Miami-Dade County, which has a 24.9% uninsured home rate, the average annual home insurance cost is $16,872 — 22% of the county’s median household income.

In Arizona’s Navajo County, 51% of homes are uninsured — the highest county rate in the U.S.

West Virginia, New Mexico, Louisiana lead top 10 states with highest uninsured home rates

While homeowners can save money in the short term by forgoing home insurance, a damaging weather event or other disaster could threaten that asset. Climate change is increasing the probability of severe, destructive weather. It means that homeowners who may not have previously experienced severe weather now face the threat of significant damage.

Insurance companies are re-evaluating as risk shifts. Home insurance non-renewals increased by 267% in Louisiana between 2018 and 2023.2 And, when the cost of protection becomes unaffordable, some homeowners opt to go without insurance.

1. West Virginia

Percentage of uninsured homes: 23.9%

Average annual cost of home insurance: $1,387

Median household income: $60,798

West Virginia’s low housing costs likely contribute to its high rate of uninsured homes. Homeowners may be able to pay off their mortgages faster, which could explain why West Virginia has the highest share of homeowners without a mortgage, at 55.1%.

West Virginia also has a low cost of living and well-below-average home insurance costs, according to the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center (MERIC).3 It has the lowest average home value in the country, according to the Zillow Home Value Index, boosted by a high prevalence of manufactured housing. The state also has a 75.5% homeownership rate — the highest in the U.S., according to census data.

But West Virginia also has the second-lowest median household income, at $60,798 annually. Raleigh and Wood counties have the highest uninsured home rates in the state and the lowest median household incomes.

About 6.2% of homeowners without a mortgage statewide are “house poor,” meaning they spend 30% or more of their income on housing costs, according to an Insurify analysis of ACS data. The national average is 5.4%.

West Virginia also has a high overall climate vulnerability, according to the U.S. Climate Vulnerability Index.4 Dam failures, earthquakes, floods, landslides, levee/floodwall failure, and severe storms are all “hazards of concern,” according to West Virginia’s 2023 Hazard Mitigation Plan.5

2. New Mexico

Percentage of uninsured homes: 23%

Average annual cost of home insurance: $2,463

Median household income: $67,816

Like in West Virginia, New Mexico’s high uninsured home rate is likely partly due to 50.6% of homeowners not having a mortgage. A lower number of mortgages means fewer homeowners are required to buy insurance.

But New Mexico faces changing climate hazards, notably hail, riverine flooding, and wildfires, which can make going uninsured financially risky.6 New Mexico also ranks high in terms of climate vulnerability.

Home values and insurance costs in New Mexico rank below the national average. The low cost of living and high share of manufactured homes may contribute to the high 71.1% homeowner rate.

Still, the low median household income of $67,816 means home costs take up more of residents’ budgets. In New Mexico, homeowners spend 24% of their income on housing costs, including insurance, taxes, maintenance, utilities, and flood insurance, according to an Insurify report.

New Mexico has large Native American reservations, which often lack access to financial and mortgage products due to low lender participation.7 Federal land ownership and credit issues create other barriers.8 The uninsured home rate is 30% in San Juan County, home to a large Navajo Nation reservation. The median household income there is also below the state average.

3. Louisiana

Percentage of uninsured homes: 21.2%

Average annual cost of home insurance: $5,132

Median household income: $60,986

More than 1 in 5 Louisiana homes are uninsured, representing unprecedented financial risk given the state’s hurricane exposure. Around 48.2% of Louisiana homeowners don’t have a mortgage. Many mortgage-free homeowners may try to save money by going uninsured, especially as the state’s median household income of $60,986 is the third-lowest in the nation.

Louisiana is also the second most expensive state for home insurance, according to Insurify data. Insured homeowners carry the highest cost burden of any state, spending 8.4% of their income on home insurance. About 6.1% of Louisiana homeowners are house poor — more than the national average.

Terrebonne Parish, a coastal region southwest of New Orleans, has the highest uninsured home rate in the state, at 29.7%. Due to its hurricane exposure, the parish has a relatively high risk index, and insurance premiums reflect that risk. The average annual cost of home insurance is $8,316 in Terrebonne, according to Insurify data.

Louisiana has pushed for strong building codes and incentivized weather-mitigation renovations to help homeowners reduce damage and the possibility of expensive repairs.9 Homeowners who can afford to invest in resilience improvements can also save on their home insurance.

4. Alaska

Percentage of uninsured homes: 20.6%

Average annual cost of home insurance: $1,377

Median household income: $95,665

Alaska’s exceptionally high cost of living may squeeze budgets enough for homeowners to try to save money by going without insurance. Between April and June in 2025, Alaska ranked sixth for the overall cost of living, behind Hawaii, California, Massachusetts, Washington, D.C., and New York, according to MERIC.

About 39.6% of Alaska homeowners don’t have a mortgage, and the state has a much higher median household income and lower-than-average insurance costs. But Alaskans — particularly those living in cities — face utility, healthcare, and grocery costs that exceed the national average, according to a 2024 survey by the Council for Community and Economic Relations.10

Climate risks, including avalanches, wildfires, volcanic activity, and earthquakes, can also compound the financial consequences of forgoing home insurance in the state.

5. Mississippi

Percentage of uninsured homes: 20.2%

Average annual cost of home insurance: $3,427

Median household income: $59,127

More than half of Mississippi homeowners (51.6%) don’t have a mortgage, and Mississippi is among the 10 most expensive states for home insurance, according to Insurify data. Since Mississippi has the lowest median household income in the country, homeowners spend a bigger percentage of that income on home insurance.

Jones and Forrest counties have the highest percentages of uninsured homes in the state, at 26.7% and 22.6%, respectively. They also have median household incomes below the state average: $48,298 in Forrest County, the lowest in the state, and $51,748 in Jones County.

Mississippi also faces several climate-related risks, including tornadoes, hailstorms, riverine flooding, and hurricanes, particularly along the Gulf Coast, according to FEMA. Homeowners may opt to go uninsured to save money in the short term, but damage from a weather event or a house fire could leave many struggling to recover.

Around 6.6% of homeowners without a mortgage are house poor, so losing that asset could be disastrous.

6. Florida

Percentage of uninsured homes: 19.4%

Average annual cost of home insurance: $8,491

Median household income: $77,735

Florida is the most expensive state for home insurance, according to Insurify data, largely due to its climate risk. And even with a higher median household income, Florida ties Louisiana for the highest insurance cost burden.

Home insurance costs 8.4% of the median income in Florida, more than three times the national average. The state tops the list for homeownership costs, which take up 37% of household income, according to an Insurify report.

Around 44.2% of Florida homeowners don’t have a mortgage, which is higher than the national average but lower than most states on this list. But 7.8% of homeowners without a mortgage are house poor, the highest share nationwide.

As in other states, affordability is likely a contributing factor to the high rate of uninsured homes. More than 1 in 3 (37.7%) homes in Putnam County are uninsured, the highest rate in the state. Putnam County also has the lowest median household income statewide, at $51,293.

Florida’s high hurricane exposure, as well as wildfire and tornado risks in certain areas, can drive up insurance costs. But those hazards also make opting out of home insurance exceptionally risky.

Miami-Dade County, for example, has a high uninsured home rate, despite its hurricane and wildfire risk. Its median household income is $76,184, close to the state average, but home insurance costs $16,872 per year — a staggering 22% of median household income.

7. Arkansas

Percentage of uninsured homes: 19.1%

Average annual cost of home insurance: $2,621

Median household income: $62,106

Climate risks have a less acute effect on insurance costs in Arkansas than in Florida. But weather events like severe hailstorms, tornadoes, and wildfires still threaten properties around the state.

Arkansas’ percentage of uninsured homes is likely linked to its high 47.6% share of homeowners who don’t have a mortgage. Home insurance costs are much more moderate in Arkansas than in nearby states like Louisiana and Oklahoma, Insurify data shows. But home insurance still costs 4.2% of the median household income, the seventh-highest nationwide.

White, Jefferson, and Garland counties have the highest uninsured home rates in the state. Jefferson and White counties also have the lowest median household incomes in Arkansas. The Garland County median income is closer to the state average, but Garland has the highest share of house-poor homeowners without a mortgage, at 8.4%.

8. Alabama

Percentage of uninsured homes: 18.9%

Average annual cost of home insurance: $3,190

Median household income: $66,659

Alabama’s high percentage of homeowners without a mortgage (46.5%) contributes to its 18.9% rate of uninsured homes statewide. But the picture shifts dramatically depending on different regions in the state. Alabama has the fourth-lowest median household income in the country, and, though costs spike along the Gulf, insurance costs are more moderate than in neighboring states.

Shelby County has the lowest rate of uninsured homes in the state, at 10.8%. The median household income there is $102,265, the highest in the state. And, despite its high tornado risk, Shelby County has the cheapest average insurance premiums in the state. Home insurance costs make up 2.2% of the median income. Just 2.7% of homeowners without a mortgage are house poor.

In Walker County, on the other side of Birmingham, 32.6% of homes are uninsured, and 6.7% of homeowners without a mortgage are house poor. Insured homeowners spend 5.6% of their median household income of $58,017 on insurance.

9. Oklahoma

Percentage of uninsured homes: 18.3%

Average annual cost of home insurance: $4,058

Median household income: $66,148

Oklahoma is the third most expensive state for home insurance, according to Insurify data. Hailstorms, tornadoes, and severe wind have increased insurer losses, which policyholders feel in premiums.

High insurance costs can squeeze the budget: Oklahoma has one of the lowest median household incomes in the U.S., and insurance costs can eat up 6.1% of that income. It also has a high rate of homeowners without a mortgage, which likely contributes to its higher percentage of uninsured homes.

Muskogee County, home to part of the Muskogee Nation reservation, has a 25.8% uninsured home rate. Oklahoma has the largest population of people who chose American Indian as their only race, according to the 2020 U.S. Census.11 As in New Mexico, Native American reservations can lack mortgage access, which may contribute to higher rates of uninsured homes. The county’s median income is also below the state average.

The Oklahoma county with the lowest uninsured home rate, Canadian County, also has the highest median household income. And, even though insurance costs are higher there than in Muskogee County, they account for 5.3% of the median income versus Muskogee’s 6.6%.

10. Texas

Percentage of uninsured homes: 17.7%

Average annual cost of home insurance: $3,610

Median household income: $79,721

In Texas, 44.5% of homeowners don’t have a mortgage — more than the national average. And, though the median household income is higher than in many states on this list, more costly premiums mean insured homeowners pay 4.5% of that income to home insurance.

Since Texas is such a large state, climate risks vary considerably. Galveston County, located southeast of Houston on the Gulf Coast, is the most expensive county in Texas for home insurance due to its hurricane exposure. But, likely due to that risk and its above-average median income, it has one of the lowest uninsured home rates, at 10.7%.

Three Texas counties — Liberty, Hidalgo, and Cameron — are among the 10 counties with the highest uninsured home rates in the country.

In Liberty, northeast of Houston, 45.6% of homes are uninsured — the second-highest percentage nationwide. Climate risks from lightning storms and tornadoes may contribute to the county’s above-average insurance costs. Homeowners with insurance pay 6.7% of the county’s median income of $60,963 to cover premiums, higher than the 4.5% average share that insured homeowners pay statewide.

Arizona’s Navajo County has the highest uninsured home rate in the U.S.

The average rate of uninsured homes in the U.S. is 14.1%, but county-level data shows just how much that percentage can vary based on local factors. Nearly 1 in 7 homes nationwide are uninsured, but in Arizona’s Navajo County, more than half of homes (51%) are uninsured.

Various factors, some similar and some distinct, influence the rate of uninsured homes among the 10 counties with the highest rates.

Almost 66% of Navajo County is reservation land.12 It’s home to the Hopi, Navajo, and Fort Apache reservations. Barriers complicating mortgage access on reservation land likely contribute to its high uninsured home rate. Nearly 74% of homes in Navajo County don’t have a mortgage, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.

Lack of mortgage lender participation and the challenges of mortgaging land held in a federal trust can make lending difficult, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Navajo County’s most significant climate risks are lightning storms and wildfires, according to FEMA. The average home insurance costs in the county are below the state average. Still, a lower median income means insured homeowners are paying a higher share of that income to cover premiums.

Tips: How homeowners can make home insurance more affordable

For homeowners already on tight budgets, home insurance may seem like an obvious line item to cut. But going without it comes with serious risks, especially as severe weather becomes more erratic.

“When budgets are tight, it’s understandable to question whether insurance is really necessary,” said Mallory Mooney, director of sales and service at Insurify. “But even a basic policy can make the difference between a manageable setback and a major financial hardship. The key is finding the right balance between protection and affordability.”

The most straightforward way to lower home insurance costs is to regularly shop around and compare quotes, enabling homeowners to ensure they have the best available deal. Talking to an agent can also help homeowners find the right policy for their needs.

Mooney recommends homeowners start by reviewing their deductible.

“Raising your deductible can lower your premium significantly, as long as you have enough set aside to cover that amount in the event of a loss,” she said. “It’s also important not to cut coverage too deeply. If your policy limits fall far below your home’s rebuild value, you could face unexpected gaps, even with smaller claims.”

Mooney also recommends homeowners take advantage of every available discount and make thoughtful adjustments while trying to avoid risky reductions.

“Remove coverage for items you no longer own, drop riders that no longer apply, and skip add-ons that duplicate benefits you already have elsewhere,” Mooney said. “The goal isn’t a fancy or even generic policy, but the one that gives you meaningful protection at a cost you can sustain. Personalized protection that you can afford keeps you from being one broken pipe or storm away from losing everything.”

Methodology

Insurify analysts used the U.S. Census Bureau 2024 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-Year Estimates, published on Sept. 11, 2025, to determine the rates of uninsured homes. This report defines “uninsured homes” as owner-occupied homes with home insurance costs of less than $100 per year in 2024. The survey notes that the less-than-$100 category may include $0, and some escrowed homeowners may appear as $0.

To determine the rate of uninsured homes, Insurify analysts divided the number of owner-occupied homes with less than $100 in annual home insurance costs by the total number of owner-occupied homes nationwide and by state and county. The ACS 1-Year Estimates include only counties and metro areas with a population of 65,000 or more.

For the lead statistic, Insurify defines “climate-vulnerable states” as the 20 states with the highest national percentile for vulnerability on the U.S. Climate Vulnerability Index, a project from the Environmental Defense Fund, Texas A&M University, and Darkhorse Visualization.

Insurify data scientists turned to their real-time database of insurance quotes from partner carriers, as well as aggregated rate filings from Quadrant Information Services, to determine average home insurance costs.

Unless otherwise stated, home insurance rates in this report represent the average annual cost of an HO-3 insurance policy for homeowners with good credit and zero claims within the past five years, covering a single-family frame house with the following coverage limits: $200,000 to $750,000 dwelling coverage depending on the locality’s typical home value, $25,000 personal property, $30,000 loss of use, $300,000 liability, and a $1,000 deductible. Certain states also include a 2% hail deductible and/or a 5% wind/hurricane deductible.",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/wyomingnewsnow.tv/content/tncms/custom/image/b2e47b94-535a-11ef-8535-f7e71726e889.png?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-11-13 15:02:45.421015

Hurll emphasised that the government’s AU$1 billion (US$653 million) Solar Sunshot Programme, administered by Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), is essential to establishing domestic production. Stellar PV received AU$4.7 million in ARENA funding for feasibility and front-end engineering studies, which Hurll described as “a huge jump start” that has helped attract private investors by demonstrating government commitment.

About Denali Denali is a leading organic recycling company in the U.S. on a mission to replenish the Earth by repurposing waste.","RUSSELLVILLE, AR and CHICAGO, IL — Nov. 13, 2025 — Denali, the nation’s leading and largest recycler of food and organic materials, today announced a new partnership with Green Era, a community recycler of packaged food waste and the first to operate a food-waste-only digester in the Midwest. Together, the two organizations will enhance the region’s food waste recycling capacity, generate renewable energy, clean soil, and local jobs, setting a new standard for circular, community-based sustainability.

Through this agreement, Denali will serve as Green Era’s go-to provider for sourcing packaged, inedible food from new customers, expanding Green Era’s ability to recycle more material, create local jobs, and strengthen the local circular economy. This will also build Green Era’s capacity to divert more than 150 million pounds of food waste each year.

Green Era’s integrated model — combining anaerobic digestion, composting, urban agriculture, and workforce development — makes it one of the most innovative organics recycling operations in the country. The collaboration will leverage Denali’s national collection and logistics network to supply high-quality organics for Green Era’s renewable energy and compost production.

“Green Era represents what the next generation of food recycling looks like — technologically advanced, environmentally smart, and deeply rooted in community impact,” said Eric Speiser, Chief Revenue Officer at Denali. “By combining our scale and expertise with their local innovation, we’re expanding the reach of circular food systems across the Midwest.”

Located on a 9-acre site in Chicago’s Auburn Gresham neighborhood, Green Era is more than a food waste recycling and renewable energy campus – it’s a community investment project that’s diverted more than 150 million pounds of food waste while generating dozens of jobs. The facility uses cutting-edge anaerobic digestion technology to convert food waste into clean energy and nutrient-rich compost while creating green jobs, educational opportunities, and access to fresh, healthy food through its planned urban farm and marketplace.

“Partnering with Denali strengthens our ability to capture more food waste and transform it into valuable resources for our community,” said Jason Feldman, CEO of Green Era. “This collaboration reflects a shared vision for sustainable infrastructure that benefits both people and the planet.”

The partnership underscores Denali’s commitment to advancing the U.S. organics recycling industry and supporting regional innovation. By linking its nationally scaled recycling network with a community-based renewable energy facility, Denali and Green Era are demonstrating how sustainability and economic growth can work hand-in-hand.

As a result of the partnership, food once destined for landfills will be recycled into renewable energy, compost, and other beneficial products that support local agriculture, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and return nutrients to the soil.

Another aspect is that conservation sometimes has an approach of static thinking in a world that is essentially dynamic and changing.
And we've got other ways of knowing, traditional ways of knowing, indigenous ways of knowing, inter-species ways of knowing.
In traditional conservation, we still see human communities as a challenge and a problem.
We reimagine our world, we talk about what we think the world is or should be, or we restate what reality is.","“If I can visualize the consequences of my behavior, it helps me avoid actions that could lead to bad endings. For example, if I wake up in the morning and take a little journey in my mind – imagining what it would be like to spend 24 hours without water – I’m sure that, by the end of that exercise, I will truly understand the value of water.

If I do this with people who don’t yet appreciate how precious water is – if I guide them through this meditation and help them visualize a day without it – they will inevitably change their behavior toward water. And if they don’t, then they are not noble people!

And it is especially important to do this with children, because they are more sensitive and naturally connected to nature.

I do it with my grandchildren, for example, when we talk about people throwing plastic into the sea. I ask them to imagine what happens when a turtle comes out to play, sees the colorful plastic, and eats it. They understand that the turtle will die and that they should never throw plastic into the sea. I do the same when they use up many tissues, I ask them to imagine the tree it came from. Every sheet of paper is a piece of that tree’s life. When we waste paper, we take part in the process of chopping off more trees to give us this tiny thing, so before pulling more than a single tissue, think of our beautiful friend, the tree – thankfully this helped.

Because I bring this kind of visualization into every environmental activity we do, my grandchildren have become the ones who remind others not to behave badly and to act in eco-friendly ways. And this transformation happens through the power of visualizing and reimagining.”

“When we think about reimagining conservation, to some extent we have to ask the question, it's really about conservation moving beyond the crisis of its own making. So when we look at traditional conservation approaches, there are key points and challenges where we can see that traditional approaches aren't necessarily working anymore.

And one of those is the fragmentation of purpose. We find conservation today is becoming responsible for so much more than just protected areas and engaging with the protection of species. It intersects with livelihoods, rights, gender… a diversity of issues that one might argue are essentially outside of the core focus or mandate of the conservation sector. And so the question is, how is conservation preparing itself to be playing a much more intersectional role, if one might call it that, in the landscapes where conservation action is taking place?

Another aspect is that conservation sometimes has an approach of static thinking in a world that is essentially dynamic and changing. And we see this change with migration, movement of species, movements of people, changing ecosystems as a result of climate impacts, natural disasters, environmental degradation of land. And really, the key message for me is that conservation needs to be much more flexible, both in its approach and in its adaptability to changing scenarios. We tend to conserve for the past when we need to be thinking of how we conserve for the future in the sense that past systems, past scenarios in landscapes may no longer be relevant in 10, 15, 20, 30, 50 years time. So how do we conserve for a changing landscape when we're not even sure how it's going to be changing? This is the challenge of our time, and demands an expanded integrated, deeply holistic approach.

We also need to acknowledge that the planet is not dying. It's more a situation that's changing so fast that conservation can't even keep up with that in its own imagination. So one of the key things that is going to help us moving forward is to think of conservation instead of protecting species and places specifically, it's about protecting processes and ensuring that processes can unfold effectively with meaning, with resilience, with broad input from a diverse community of actors and resilience particularly in the light of change. How do we keep things going despite the environment shifting and changing?

Then we've got the situation of what one might refer to as economic capture of conservation. It's become dependent on markets, carbon markets, tourism, biodiversity offsets. These are all sorts of market related impulses that can distract also from some of the key functions, but also shifts our relationship and perceptions of nature more broadly. And I think we still need to be cautious of that.

Another insight is the question of rethinking knowledge. Today we can see at this congress a multiplicity of businesses offering satellite data capture, genomics, capturing species information at a genome level, being able to map unbelievable amounts of information from very small bits of sampling. And yet at the same time, we've got the urgent need to continue to build relationships. And we've got other ways of knowing, traditional ways of knowing, indigenous ways of knowing, inter-species ways of knowing. And that raises for me this idea of something one might call intersentience, where to know a place, to know a species, to know a dynamic in a landscape requires both satellite imagery, satellite data, microscopic analysis of things, but it also requires the stories, the narratives, the history of place, the types of relationships people have with that place, and with the processes that happen there. In traditional conservation, we still see human communities as a challenge and a problem. That's certainly something that needs to shift. And we are beginning to see this happen. After all it is us, as human communities, who are the key threat and the key solution to conservation as a living practice of harmony with the natural world.”

“One way Indigenous people and local communities are working to reimagine conservation is through the motions process. We reimagine our world, we talk about what we think the world is or should be, or we restate what reality is.

We're currently supporting at least three motions here this year. One, to bring more support to linguistic diversity, languages that are more in touch with the biodiversity of place. And these most often are the languages of indigenous people. We're also supporting a motion to unequivocally recognize territories of life or indigenous and community conserved areas as an effective way to conserve our places. And the third motion is motion 96, setting area-based conservation targets in a manner that includes justice and doing right by the people who live in those places.”",https://iucn.org/themes/custom/iucnsub/img/favicons/apple-touch-icon-180x180.png,N,,2025-11-13 16:01:07.570352

Leading Light Wind cited “changing regulatory requirements” for their decision to pull the plug on construction. The news comes a week after a Democratic victory in New Jersey, where Governor-elect Sherrill centered on lowering utility costs and directly attacked Trump’s clean energy cuts in her winning campaign.

Donald Trump and Republicans have taken a sledgehammer to clean energy projects across the country while electricity demand skyrockets, jacking up energy costs for Americans. Far from delivering on his campaign promise to cut electricity prices in half, Trump’s own reckless energy policies are causing utility bills to soar, with household electricity prices up 11% under his watch. New Jersey has seen the highest increase in the country, with a 21% spike in electricity prices over the past year.

Climate Power Communications Director Alex Glass issued the following statement:

“New Jersey families have seen their utility bills climb higher and higher each month, and Trump and Republicans are to blame. Their war on clean energy is shuttering projects across the country and taking energy options off the grid, leaving hardworking Americans to pay the price. Trump and Republicans promised to lower costs, but in fact, life has gotten more expensive on their watch and last week, New Jersey voters held them accountable at the ballot box. We’re going to spend every day between now and November 3rd, 2026 making sure Republicans continue to pay the political price for their broken promises.”

Trump’s reckless energy policies are leaving a trail of shuttered projects across the country:

Earlier this week, a solar firm in North Carolina laid off 78% of its workforce after filing for bankruptcy due to renewable energy policy changes under the Trump administration.

QCells, a solar manufacturing plant in Georgia, announced that it would be furloughing 1,000 workers and permanently laying off an additional 300.

In just two months, six clean energy projects were closed in Michigan, including most recently, two electric vehicle battery plants that laid off 324 workers.

Last month, General Motors laid off 1,200 workers at its electric vehicle plant in Detroit, along with hundreds of additional permanent and temporary layoffs at battery plants in Ohio and Tennessee.

In October, Topsoe cited the repeal of clean energy tax credits as a reason for canceling 150 jobs and a $400 million investment in their Richmond, Virginia facility.

Earlier last month, Fox 2 Detroit reported that over 100 employees at Dana Incorporated, an electric vehicle battery component manufacturer in Auburn Hills, Michigan, had been laid off.

General Motors canceled a $55 million factory that would have created 300 jobs, citing “decisions of the DOE”.

Fortescue blamed U.S. “policy settings” and the elimination of “critical tax credits” in Trump and Republicans’ budget bill for the cancellation of their $210 million Detroit EV battery factory.

Trump used the government shutdown as an opportunity to sow even more chaos and uncertainty for American workers by cancelling $8 billion in investments in states that did not vote for him. The Trump administration has put $24 billion for energy projects on the chopping block since May.

Trump’s federal energy policies contributed to battery startup, Natron Energy, shutting down and canceling its planned $1.4 billion factory in Eastern North Carolina, which would have created 1,000 jobs.",https://climatepower.us/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Meta-Image_Climate-Power.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 15:01:24.418155

Given the uncertainty and potential for large cost increases, here is how experts advise Americans to approach this year’s open enrollment.
When the Affordable Care Act was first passed in 2010, it implemented federal subsidies that lowered the price of health insurance for low-income Americans.
As Straight Arrow News previously reported, experts advise that Americans begin the open enrollment process as soon as possible.
Federal and state governments offer a service that helps Americans navigate the entire open enrollment process.","President Donald Trump signed into law a spending bill on Wednesday, ending the longest federal government shutdown in American history. For weeks, congressional Republicans and Democrats were deadlocked over extending expiring tax credits for more than 20 million people who purchase insurance through Affordable Care Act marketplaces.

The shutdown deal does not extend the tax credits. Instead, it calls for a December vote on the issue. The chances of extending the credits seem bleak, given that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has not agreed to a vote.

Open enrollment season has begun for most Americans, and many are already facing steep cost increases. Premiums for Americans who receive insurance through their employer will increase by upwards of 7%, a reflection of higher spending on health care.

Meanwhile, premiums for individuals who purchase their insurance through the Affordable Care Act will rise by about 30%, not only due to rising health care spending but also because there are no more federal subsidies for most people.

Given the uncertainty and potential for large cost increases, here is how experts advise Americans to approach this year’s open enrollment.

What are the tax credits?

When the Affordable Care Act was first passed in 2010, it implemented federal subsidies that lowered the price of health insurance for low-income Americans. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 expanded the original subsidies to all Americans regardless of income and eliminated health insurance premiums for the lowest-income households. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 extended subsidies through 2025.

These provisions will expire in December unless the government votes to further extend them. Democrats and at least two Republican members of Congress have pushed to retain the subsidies, but many Republicans are resisting. Vice President JD Vance has said these credits fuel fraud.

Should Americans wait to purchase coverage?

As Straight Arrow News previously reported, experts advise that Americans begin the open enrollment process as soon as possible. Though chances are low, if Congress does vote to extend the subsidies, consumers can change their plans until Dec. 15 for plans beginning on Jan. 1, 2026.

Federal and state governments offer a service that helps Americans navigate the entire open enrollment process. Experts warn that numerous fraudulent websites offer these services.",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-453041979_Getty_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 15:01:47.022322

Furthermore, permitting 10% of the carbon dioxide to escape into the environment is no longer tenable, he said.
A lower cost path to near-total capture Economic analyses show that PICC can capture and compress 99% of carbon dioxide emissions for $26 per metric ton.
At that level of capture, even the carbon dioxide from the combustion air is removed, Holtzapple said.
“Without adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, PICC allows us to use abundant fossil fuels on which our civilization is built.","A new, low-cost method for capturing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and industrial facilities relies on a simple physical phenomenon — the same one that causes bubbles to fizz when popping a bottle of Champagne or cracking open a bottle of seltzer.

The process, called Pressure Induced Carbon Capture (PICC), uses water and pressure to pull carbon dioxide out of exhaust gases before it reaches the atmosphere, offering a cleaner and far less expensive alternative to traditional chemical methods.

Co-inventors Dr. Mark Holtzapple, professor of chemical engineering at Texas A&M University, and Jonathan Feinstein of ExcelThermic Enterprises have filed patents for licensing the technology to power plants, hydrogen facilities, cement kilns, steel blast furnaces and other industrial emitters worldwide. Holtzapple said PICC is a practical solution to an urgent problem because fossil fuel combustion — which releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere — remains an important component of the global energy mix.

“Our invention is a cost-effective way to address one of the greatest challenges facing humanity,” Holtzapple said. “We can capture carbon dioxide from flue gas using only water and pressure, which makes the process simple, clean and less expensive than competing technologies.”

Traditional carbon capture systems rely on strong chemicals called amines that bind with carbon dioxide to remove it from exhaust gases. Amines struggle to pull more than 90% of the carbon dioxide out of the flue gas, Holtzapple said. Also, the amines are expensive and degrade when exposed to flue gases. Furthermore, permitting 10% of the carbon dioxide to escape into the environment is no longer tenable, he said.

In contrast, PICC uses physical absorption. Because PICC uses no chemical bonds, carbon dioxide pops back out of the water at reduced pressures just as easily as it dissolves in water at high pressure.

“Everybody knows that high-pressure carbon dioxide dissolves in water, and that when you open a bottle of Coca-Cola or beer you see that carbon dioxide bubble back out,” Holtzapple said. Once released, the carbon dioxide can be safely stored or utilized.

How the system works

In operation, flue gas from combusting coal, natural gas or biomass — like forest waste, crop residues or municipal solid waste — is first cooled and compressed. The high-pressure gas is then piped into an absorption column, where cold water flows downward while the gas moves upward through a structured packing that maximizes contact between the two streams. As the nearly clean gas reaches the top of the column, it contacts fresh water entering at the top. There, the last traces of carbon dioxide dissolve into the water, with clean gas releasing into the environment.

The water exiting the bottom of the column contains dissolved carbon dioxide and is transferred to a series of vessels, each operating at lower and lower pressures, where the carbon dioxide progressively bubbles out. Holtzapple said the released carbon dioxide is then ready for compression and injection into underground geological formations, such as saline aquifers, where it is permanently stored.

A lower cost path to near-total capture

Economic analyses show that PICC can capture and compress 99% of carbon dioxide emissions for $26 per metric ton. Other current technologies capture about 90% and cost $50 to $100 per metric ton, Holtzapple said.

Additionally, by adding a small amount of lime — an alkali — to the water, PICC captures 100% of carbon dioxide for an average cost less than $28 per metric ton. At that level of capture, even the carbon dioxide from the combustion air is removed, Holtzapple said.

“Without adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, PICC allows us to use abundant fossil fuels on which our civilization is built. Furthermore, by coupling PICC to biomass combustion, we can remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere cost effectively,” he said.",https://stories.tamu.edu/wp-content/themes/aux-wordpress/images/tamu-icons/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-13 14:01:30.817381

Now, the state of Indiana and a major US nuclear company have announced that Indiana will be the preferred location for a new advanced small modular reactor energy park, setting the stage for a nuclear revolution in the United States.

The US is set to become a global leader in sustainable energy technology

For far too long, the United States nuclear sector has lagged behind the rest of the world, with oil and gas dominating the US energy production sector. However, following the recent announcement by First American Nuclear and the state of Indiana that the pair will develop a new advanced modular reactor park in Indiana, the future of the American nuclear sector is looking brighter than ever.

The plan would be for the new energy park to be the first in the United States to be a “closed-fuel cycle” facility, which means that any spent nuclear fuel will be reprocessed and reused on site. Additionally, First American Nuclear will also move its headquarters from Richland, WA, to the great state of Indiana. While the project is expected to pass the legal hurdles in place, no exact timeline or construction costs have been detailed by the company or by the state of Indiana.

The new energy park will focus on gas at first, with nuclear power coming second

The company has noted that the initial plan is for the site to produce gas for the international sector, which has become essential as the sanctions on Russian energy resources come into effect. After that, the co-located facility will process nuclear power using some of the same infrastructure, including grid connections.

“Our unique integrated gas and nuclear solution for quick deployment starts with gas then transitions to nuclear using the same systems bringing power to customers in 24-36 months.” – First American Nuclear press release

The state of Indiana is set to become the spiritual home of the US nuclear energy sector

First American Nuclear has stated that the planned process they will use at the new Indiana energy park eliminates 97% of long-lasting nuclear waste produced on site, a major problem that has plagued nuclear operations for decades. The 240 MWe EAGL-1 reactor is specifically designed to produce more fuel than it burns on an average day.

“Indiana and First American Nuclear joining forces to improve the quality of life for Hoosiers and the American people was an easy decision to make. FANCO has the ability to deliver affordable, sustainable power to light up our rooms, keep us warm in the winter, cool in the summer, and rise to the ever-increasing energy demands of an advanced manufacturing and computing economy.” – Suzanne Jaworowski, Indiana Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources

Other nations have also been experiencing significant progress in their nuclear energy ambitions, with the UAE’s first-ever nuclear facility reaching a milestone recently.

Government shutdown ends

The longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history ended late Wednesday when President Donald Trump signed a government funding bill. The move came after the House advanced a Senate-backed spending measure earlier in the day. The Washington Post’s team reports:

The deal will fund the government through Jan. 30, pass three appropriations bills, reverse more than 4,000 federal layoffs the Trump administration attempted to implement earlier in the shutdown and prevent future layoffs through the end of January. It will appropriate funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or food stamps, through September 2026. … It will provide backpay to 650,000 federal workers who have been furloughed since Oct. 1 and an additional 600,000 who have been forced to continue working without pay.

The New York Times’ Karoun Demirjian and Eileen Sullivan report on how long it will take the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and other federal programs, to return to normal:

Though the Trump administration fought efforts to force them to use contingency funds to pay out benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, during the shutdown, a spokeswoman for the White House’s budget office insisted this week that beneficiaries will see their accounts fully restored within hours of the federal government reopening.

States, such as Louisiana, that have administered partial SNAP benefits could run into technical issues when administering the remaining amount.

Louisiana’s infrastructure woes

Louisiana continues to suffer from poor infrastructure due to a trifecta of age, extreme weather and inadequate funding. That’s according to a new report from the American Society of Civil Engineers. The Times-Picayune | Baton Rouge Advocate’s David J. Mitchell reports:

The overall “C-” represents a slight improvement from what the society concluded in its 2017 analysis, but the group said the 2025 grade still means “Louisiana’s built environment is not keeping pace,” as infrastructure continues to age and is affected “by limited resources and increasingly frequent severe weather events.” The national average was a “C.” The society noted that the state has experienced 36 extreme weather events over the past decade that resulted in $200 billion in damages statewide.

While Louisiana’s overall infrastructure received a “C-,” the state’s roads and bridges received “D” and “D+” grades, respectively. Funding issues contribute heavily to this dismal score:

But the society pointed out that Louisiana roads and bridges still have a $33 billion maintenance and capital improvement backlog combined, a rising figure affected not only by continuing demands but also by inflated material and other costs over the past several years. … Louisiana highways and bridges rely on a 20-cent-per-gallon state sales tax that has lost two-thirds of its purchasing power since it was last raised in the late 1980s. The state road tax has seen total revenues decline due to greater gasoline engine efficiency and electric vehicles.

Don’t use TANF funds to plug budget holes

The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant provides states with federal dollars that are supposed to be used, in large part, to provide basic cash assistance for low-income families with children. But far too often states divert these dollars to other, unrelated priorities. A new blog from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities explains why some states, such as Kentucky and South Dakota, are being tempted to use TANF dollars to plug budget holes:

Fiscal pressures on states have been growing in recent years, often because of state-enacted tax cuts. This pressure is predicted to get worse due to the harmful Republican megabill drastically cutting food assistance through SNAP and health coverage through Medicaid. The cost implications of the megabill will intensify over the next two to three years, creating enormous pressure for states to fill in gaps of support that many families with low incomes depend on to meet basic needs.

CBPP’s team explains why this is a bad idea:

Cutting a vital income source like TANF makes it harder for families to meet their children’s basic needs — such as food, housing, and medical care — which are often the factors considered in child neglect cases. … With fewer resources, families are forced to make impossible choices: paying the rent or buying groceries, buying their kids’ school supplies, or keeping the lights on. Cuts to already low TANF benefits deepen hardship and undermine parents’ ability to care for their children at home.

If we're talking about new vehicle sales, the percentage of electric cars in the U.S. was 7.9% in February 2025, according to Edmunds sales data. This is an improvement of 6.3 percentage points from 2020. This EV market share figure does not include plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), which was measured separately and had their own market share of 1.8% in February 2025. EVs and PHEVs combined made up 9.7% of the vehicles sold in February, which is still far from the 90.3% market share of gas-powered vehicles (including hybrids) sold in that same month.

These percentages offer only a limited insight into the current state of the electric car market, leaving several questions unanswered. Read on to better understand what's happening in the EV market.

What percentage of electric cars are on U.S. roads?

2024, 9.2% of new car registrations were for electric vehicles, according to an Experian Automotive report. This is an increase of 1.2 percentage points from 2023. If we fly higher to a bird’s eye view of the roughly 292.3 million cars on the road in 2024, 1.4% of those were electric vehicles.

What is each company's EV market share?

Here are the latest EV market share percentages, from 2024 and through February 2025, according to Edmunds data. Tesla has enjoyed a comfortable lead with the highest market share over the past five years. In recent years, however, Tesla's market share has dwindled from nearly 80% in 2019 to 45.2% in February 2025 as other automakers entered the playing field and introduced more rivals for customers to choose from. Ford maintains a distant second place in market share (7%), while Chevrolet (5.5%) is in third but has made significant progress in just a few years. Volkswagen (4.2%) and Hyundai (3.8%) round out the top five currently, but these automakers could easily switch places as the year goes on.

What are the best-selling electric cars in the U.S. by percentage?

Although Tesla's market share has been falling, the electric carmaker still dominates the market. According to Experian Automotive, the Tesla Model Y was the best-selling electric car in the fourth quarter of 2024, making up 26.1% of new EVs sold. The Model 3 was second with 15%. The Honda Prologue came in third with 5.3%, and the Chevrolet Equinox EV and Ford Mustang Mach-E held fourth and fifth place with 4.7% and 4.4% market share, respectively.

With world leaders gathered on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon to spur action on climate change, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has released its annual World Energy Outlook, the “most authoritative source of global energy analysis.” The outlook explores how the global energy system could evolve through scenarios with different assumptions about government policies, technology costs, and climate targets. The range of scenarios has never been wider — reflecting ongoing shifts in the global energy transition — but only the net-zero scenario achieves the broadest benefits.

Given the breadth of possibilities, many are asking which scenario represents the most likely future. Some think it is the new Current Policies Scenario (CPS), despite its lack of policy improvement “even when governments have indicated their intention to do so.” Others continue to focus on the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), a “dynamic reading of today’s policy settings.”

However, IEA is clear that no scenario is a forecast; none should be assumed to foretell the future. Instead, it is crucial to compare these scenarios to recent trends on the ground, where progress has outpaced expectations — with vast potential to accelerate. Here are five charts and takeaways along those lines.

1. Cleantech has often outperformed “current policy” outlooks

To evaluate these scenarios, it is helpful to assess how past versions have performed against recent reality. In the case of solar power, wind power, and EVs, deployment has been up to two to three times faster than the previous CPS had projected in 2019. That year’s STEPS wasn’t much closer.

Other metrics are mixed; coal demand and its emissions were still rising until a recent plateau. But it’s clear that for fast-improving clean energy technologies, progress has greatly outpaced scenarios tied to “current” or “stated” policies.

This makes sense given how the scenarios are designed. According to the IEA, the CPS expects constraints that lead it to “project slower adoption of new technologies than has been seen in recent years.” This year’s CPS is similar, assuming a lack of policy implementation such as the planned emissions trading schemes in India, Turkey, and Brazil. Treating this as a “business-as-usual” forecast would ignore the history of clean energy progress.

2. The world continues to be off track for net zero

On the other hand, progress has not nearly been fast enough for IEA’s Net Zero Energy (NZE) scenario, a world that reduces CO2 emissions to net zero by 2050. In recent years, emissions have continued or increased across CO2, methane, and other key climate pollutants — a far cry from the latest NZE scenario, which requires a 2x decline for CO2 and a 5x drop in energy-related methane by 2035.

The reasons are many, but a major one is the lack of progress on energy efficiency. Feasible efficiency improvements across the system could save trillions while accelerating the pace of the energy transition by a decade or more. As a result, more than 130 countries pledged in 2023 to double the rate of annual efficiency improvements, from the 2 percent baseline in 2022 to 4 percent every year as in the NZE scenario. But rather than doubling, annual improvements have fallen below that baseline, putting those savings further out of reach.

At the same time, baseline electricity access remains a consistent issue. While the original NZE scenario in 2021 trended toward universal electricity access by 2030, the number of people without electricity has remained above 700 million ever since. Falling behind that scenario imperils far more than emissions progress; it hinders prosperity for communities around the world.

3. Still, some technologies are accelerating ahead of net-zero trajectories

However, not all metrics are behind pace. Compared to previous Net Zero Energy scenarios, solar and battery deployment are actually running ahead of schedule, although other assessments may differ in methodology.

Both metrics have roughly reached the original net-zero scenario’s 2030 deployment rate already, in 2025 — and although this rate stagnates under the newest “current” or “stated” policy scenarios, history shows a different story. If manufacturing can continue to outpace expectations, while confronting crucial challenges from concentrated supply chains, these positive trends could continue.

4. Overperformance in some areas can reduce the strain on others

In theory, these success stories can reduce the scale-up requirements for more nascent solutions, as in the case of carbon capture and storage (CCS). As the potential for renewable electricity deployment rises in each net-zero scenario, the need for CCS in the power sector has usually fallen slightly. Achieving this shift requires many enabling conditions, from grid deployment to the full portfolios required for reliability, but the trend is moving in a positive direction.

IEA and RMI both recognize that carbon removal will be required in the long term to alleviate the carbon already in the atmosphere, but neither it nor point source carbon capture is needed where clean energy alternatives exist. If less CCS is required for electricity, it can focus on areas that are harder to solve, scaling at a more reasonable rate.

5. We can benefit people’s lives by securing a clean energy future

Above all, it’s important to remember why these trends matter for people around the world. As UN leader Simon Stiell has said, humanity can only win this fight “if we connect stronger climate action to people’s top priorities in their daily lives.”

At RMI, the key is transforming the global energy system to secure a clean, prosperous, future for all. Each of those words matters, and each has a corollary in IEA’s data that shows a drastic difference between the new scenarios in 2035 alone.

For the three in four people who live in fossil fuel importing countries, a path with more domestic renewables means that fossil fuel import costs could be two-thirds less than today’s. A clean future would mean less than half as many deaths from air pollution, along with three to five times the job growth for a more prosperous energy sector. Climate pollution could be halved, on the way to net zero by 2050, and electricity access could still be achieved for all.

With these far-reaching data points, the choice is clear. If we treat IEA’s scenarios not as forecasts but as futures to compare, we can learn from their findings and chart a path to reach the broadest benefits.",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/iStock-1561104545-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 15:01:00.254811

DRRS Plus is a capacity market.
ERCOT wants to carve out a more than $4 billion capacity market to give more money to thermal resources at a time when thermal resources are doing quite well.
When the Legislature passed it, DRRS was not intended to be the vehicle to establish a capacity market in Texas; to the contrary, it was meant to be a tool that would help increase reliability and deal with uncertainty as an alternative to a capacity market.
DRRS should be implemented as it was intended – as another operational reserve, not as a capacity market.","The Texas energy market is in a massive boom cycle right now. Electric consumption is up 25% in four years. There are 48 gigawatts of gas plants in the interconnection queue, up from just 16 gigawatts in May 2024.

There are over 400 gigawatts of total generation and over 200 gigawatts of large load waiting for interconnection. Planned investment in the grid is at an all time high.

Which makes the timing of ERCOT’s DRRS Plus proposal curious. DRRS Plus is a capacity market. It looks very similar to the ill-fated Performance Credit Mechanism. It’s expensive and likely unnecessary when compared to the other things we could be doing.

ERCOT wants to carve out a more than $4 billion capacity market to give more money to thermal resources at a time when thermal resources are doing quite well. Here’s a look at the stocks of the two biggest thermal generators in Texas:

Looking to protect consumers, in 2023, the legislature put a gross cap of $1 billion on the controversial Performance Credit Mechanism. This DRRS Plus proposal looks very similar and would cost more than $4 billion.

ERCOT leadership is doing a very human thing: they’re looking for the one solution that will make our grid bullet-proof. But the models Aurora Energy Research ran for ERCOT show that there would still be outages if DRRS Plus is put into place.

There’s no silver bullet, only silver buckshot. ERCOT and the PUC – the PUC will be the decision maker unless the Legislature decides to intervene – should implement DRRS as it was intended: as an operational reserve which will be one tool among many in the toolbox.

When the Legislature passed it, DRRS was not intended to be the vehicle to establish a capacity market in Texas; to the contrary, it was meant to be a tool that would help increase reliability and deal with uncertainty as an alternative to a capacity market.

Interestingly, according to Aurora’s model if there was a silver bullet – and there isn’t – it’s data centers. They show that outages – in both summer and winter – fall to zero under a large load growth scenario if 60% of data centers are flexible.

Of course, data center load may not reach the requisite scale (22 gigawatts) by the end of 2030. It’s also possible – with the right regulations – that a much higher percentage of data centers will be flexible with a combination of onsite resources, flexibility of demand, and the purchase of demand reductions from residential and small commercial customers. With the potential to participate in demand side markets for energy efficiency and demand response, all data centers could be flexible or purchase flexibility, meaning we would need only 13 gigawatts of data centers to get to “0.0” “max load shed” by 2030, according to the models run for ERCOT.

Texas regulators, policymakers, and ERCOT will have to do many things right. We’ll need strong, clear, and consistent requirements for data centers to bring flexibility – from whatever source – but we’ll also need to speed their interconnection, an area where ERCOT lags.

We’ll need robust demand response from big and small customers alike, clean firm resources like nuclear and geothermal, more renewables and battery storage, more gas peakers, and – perhaps most importantly of all given the impact on winter reliability – energy efficiency. In fact, though it isn’t even mentioned in the 100+ slides of Aurora’s presentation, a report Aurora released only six months ago found that “in a winter storm, heat pump adoption can lower load and prevent load shed.”

DRRS Plus is another distraction (like the PCM was) and would likely set up an epic battle between the PUC and the Senate (like the PCM did) if the PUC goes down this path.

Last week, energy affordability took center stage in elections in Georgia, Virginia, and New Jersey. Consumers are angry about high energy costs.

Texas should prioritize actions that increase reliability and reduce costs. If we exhaust actions that achieve both goals, then, and only then, should we look to artificially increase costs, as DRRS Plus would do. But we are nowhere near that point now.

At a time when Texas is attracting investments in generating resources at a scale other states and regions can only dream of, it would be a mistake to throw more money at generators at the expense of consumers. DRRS should be implemented as it was intended – as another operational reserve, not as a capacity market.

The PUC and ERCOT need to prioritize solutions that strengthen the grid and ensure that Texans can actually afford to pay for power.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-1Kf!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb7ab7a9-cfdd-4b55-9f5e-0cd7bcb0f66a_1600x966.png",N,,2025-11-13 14:01:01.703806

Testimony: Bernhard Capital Partners’ ownership of Louisiana water utility included sludge buildup, bloodworms

Advocates and customers have raised concerns about what they say is BCP’s problematic and limited track record of utility ownership.

New Energy Economy (NEE), a New Mexico climate advocacy group opposing the BCP acquisition, drew attention to National Water Infrastructure (NWI), a small Louisiana water utility which BCP has owned since 2020.

Since then, NWI has been subject to an enforcement action resulting in a settlement with Louisiana’s Department of Environmental Quality (LA DEQ).

NEE’s witness, Louisiana-based attorney Jesse George, testified that the LA DEQ settlement and numerous other non-compliance matters at NWI are evidence of BCP’s business track record of exposing its utility customers to harm and its inexperience in operating utilities. The LA DEQ cited NWI under BCP’s leadership for failing to operate and maintain the treatment facility properly. LA DEQ’s inspection found a build-up of solids in the treatment equipment, close to the surface of the wastewater. Further, the inspection revealed a large amount of sludge build-up, with bloodworms observed throughout the sludge – indicative of stagnant water containing organic matter often associated with sanitary waste.

BCP denied committing any violations, but agreed to pay the LA DEQ a total of $12,817.75 in settlement costs. George’s testimony noted that NWI is a significantly smaller utility than NMGC, with 23,000 customers compared to NMGC’s 556,000. George stated, “The Joint Applicants have not attempted to minimize the risks posed by their ownership and lack of regulated gas utility experience by offering customer protections, like automatic penalties or performance failures. I don’t see any financial insulation for customers if performance declines. Or if reliability declines.”

George testified that BCP’s track record at NWI was important evidence for the PRC to consider as it applied its six-factor test to evaluate whether the transaction “satisfies the public interest,” as required under New Mexico law. Those factors include “Whether [the transaction] provides benefits to utility customers,” “Whether the quality of service will be diminished,” “Careful verification of the qualifications and financial health of the new owner,” and “Adequacy of protections against harm to customers.”

But at the request of BCP, the NM PRC Hearing Examiners ruled to deny an exhibit of George’s testimony, in addition to denying his qualifications as an expert witness, instead granting his testimony in part as a lay witness.

During a public comment hearing, the majority of comments came from NMGC customers in opposition to the purchase. Many cited BCP’s lack of experience and past mishaps running NWI among their concerns.

BCP donated to decision makers on previous bid for Entergy’s Louisiana gas system

Though BCP is new to gas utility management, NMGC would not be the firm’s first gas utility acquisition. Earlier this year, through its subsidiary – Delta Utilities – BCP received final approval from the New Orleans City Council to purchase Entergy’s Louisiana and New Orleans gas systems, following unanimous approval from the Louisiana Public Service Commission last year. The sale did not receive a full hearing before the council, but nearly a dozen people and organizations provided comments while approximately 80 people submitted comments online, all of which were in opposition.

BCP and its executives donated to all five of the Louisiana Public Service Commissioners over the seven years prior to gaining approval of the acquisition, according to the investigative newsroom Floodlight. $149,000 of the total $200,000 in contributions went to Commissioner Craig Greene, whose district covered Entergy Louisiana’s gas service territory. Delta Utilities – backed by BCP – purchased Entergy’s gas systems for $484 million in July 2025, acquiring 200,000 customers. The Louisiana Public Service Commission approved the purchase by a 5-0 vote. Greene told Floodlight before the vote that the contributions from BCP did not affect his decision. After the vote, Greene announced he would return the donations he reported receiving from BCP that year, totaling $36,500.

The company also purchased CenterPoint’s gas systems in Louisiana and Mississippi, which serve 380,000 customers for $1.2 billion. The deal was closed in July of this year.

BCP founder formed private equity firm after selling firm that mismanaged multiple costly projects

BCP’s troubles in managing NWI are not the company founder’s first brush with mismanagement. BCP’s founder, James Bernhard Jr., formed the private equity firm Bernhard Capital Partners in 2013, following the sale of an engineering, construction, and industrial firm, The Shaw Group. Shaw was involved in several business fiascoes under Bernhard Jr.’s leadership.

After Hurricane Katrina, FEMA awarded Shaw and three other companies no-bid housing contracts of up to $100 million each to support recovery efforts in the disaster-stricken area in 2005. In the proceeding backlash, with many concerned that the Bush administration was not doing enough to respond post-hurricane, FEMA pledged to rebid the contracts. Years later, audits revealed that the contract recipients, including Shaw, wasted tens of millions of dollars across those deals. In addition, after the BP oil spill along the Gulf of Mexico in 2011, the state legislative auditor found that Shaw may have overbilled the state of Louisiana by nearly $500,000 for costs of building sand berms to block oil from washing ashore.

Shaw, led by Bernhard Jr., was the main subcontractor to Westinghouse Electric Company for construction of the Vogtle nuclear power plant in 2012. The project stalled for years, resulting in cost overruns estimated at $13 billion, and ultimately led to a bankruptcy filing by Westinghouse. By the end of 2012, Bernhard Jr. sold The Shaw Group for $3 billion.

Other BCP executives have a history of cost overruns and overpromises on project deliverables in the energy sector. BCP executive, and Saturn Holdco President Jeffrey Baudier was the former CEO of Petra Nova LLC, an NRG company capturing carbon dioxide from one of four coal units at W.A Parish Generating Station near Houston, Texas. The carbon capture project stopped operating in 2020, signaling a major setback for proponents of coal carbon capture. The $1 billion project, including $195 million of public funding from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), claimed to reduce emissions by 90%. However, a report submitted to DOE found Petra Nova was capturing only 7% of the coal plant’s carbon dioxide, according to EPA data.

NM PRC staff recommend substantial changes to the application for approval

NM PRC staff found that, as proposed by NMGC and Saturn, the transaction provides “no long-term tangible direct benefit to NMGC’s customers. Staff recommended the inclusion of substantive financial long-term commitments that directly benefit customers, a further commitment to addressing safety issues and staffing, and specific cost allocation to mitigate future rate increases, including the non-recovery of costs associated with the acquisition. The staff’s position is that the transaction should only be approved if BCP agrees to enact those changes. Staff member Naomi Velasquez notes that “this transaction is, at best, one denoted by status quo with benefits to NMGC and its ratepayers being nebulous under the most optimistic of scenarios.”

Proposed transaction draws concern over state’s climate commitments

Many opponents to Entergy’s sale of its Louisiana gas system to BCP’s Delta Utilities voiced concerns over Delta Utilities’ plans to make additional investments in gas infrastructure, which they believe would hinder greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals. Similar opposition is growing in New Mexico. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed an executive order in 2019 committing New Mexico to reduce GHG emissions by at least 45% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.

Another New Mexico clean energy advocate, the Coalition for Clean Affordable Energy, testified that the building of any new data centers powered by gas in New Mexico does not align with the state’s climate commitment. BCP CEO Jeff Jenkins said in an interview that BCP sees a “generational investment opportunity” in providing power to the nation’s growing number of data centers.

Private equity acquisitions carry high stakes for captive customers

Private equity interest in utilities is on the rise, largely focused so far on utilities poised for major infrastructure buildout to accommodate projected load growth from artificial intelligence and data centers. The value proposition comes when utilities make capital expenditures – they recoup from their captive customers the costs of qualifying projects plus an additional profit margin.

Additionally, the moves to own utilities come after many of the same private equity firms have built up robust portfolios of large power users – and look to add data centers to the mix. Given the expansiveness of private equity holdings, potential conflicts of interest loom large. For example, a firm that owns a utility might also hold a stake in a large industrial customer of that utility. In that scenario, the private equity firm could have an interest in keeping rates low for the industrial customer – potentially at the expense of captive residential and small business customers.

Such concerns over customer impacts were prominent in BlackRock’s recent bid to take over Allete, whose largest subsidiary Minnesota Power serves electricity to the northeastern corner of the state, an area that includes a potential new data center. Minnesota utility regulators signed off on the contentious deal in October over the objections of consumer advocates and an administrative law judge who warned that the multitrillion-dollar firm’s aggressive pursuit of profits could stick captive utility customers with higher costs. Supporters of the deal mostly included organizations and individuals with financial ties to the utility.

Shortly before Minnesota regulators signed off on the Allete transaction, news broke that BlackRock is also targeting Virginia-based AES, a substantially larger energy company that operates electric utilities in Indiana and Ohio while also providing renewable power to large tech companies – including ones looking to expand their data center portfolios. When deal rumors came to light, again prompting concerns from consumer advocates, AES was valued around $38 billion. Around the same time, reports surfaced that BlackRock was planning to buy Aligned Data Centers – a developer worth as much as $40 billion.

While the flurry of private equity interest lately is new, investment firms’ snapping up utilities is not entirely unprecedented. Consumer advocates in the Minnesota proceeding pointed to an earlier example of a utility take-private deal that did not turn out well for customers. Michigan’s Upper Peninsula Power Company, known as UPPCO, was sold to a private equity firm in 2014 and since then has seen a series of successive rate hikes and a sale to another private equity firm. Its customers now pay rates 9 cents higher per kilowatt than the state average, as cited in the Minnesota proceeding.

“A utility is not like a Burger King”

During an evidentiary hearing on November 4, the NM PRC hosted on the acquisition of NMGC on Nov. 4, Saturn Holdco President Jeffrey Baudier was cross-examined by Commissioners and intervening parties in the docket. When questioned about his testimony regarding the acquisition premium, an intervenor asked Baudier to explain his position on the staff’s recommendation that NMGC establish a regulatory liability equal to the goodwill or acquisition premium resulting from the transaction, or $100 million. In his written testimony, Baudier claims the staff proposal is based on “the flawed premise that the acquisition premium is due solely to the government monopoly granted to the utility and that the amount over the book value of the utility should be given to customers.” During the hearing, Baudier goes on to say, “That would be the legal equivalent of me going to Burger King and buying a hamburger and saying, ‘I own part of Burger King because I paid for the hamburger.’”

Later, Commission Chair Gabriel Aguilera addressed Baudier’s comment, saying the analogy “completely misses the mark.” Chair Aguilera stated, “Burger King operates in a competitive environment, and the Gas Company is a natural monopoly. I heard you explain your view on the regulatory compact. Nothing like that exists for Burger King, but it does exist for the Company that you are seeking to purchase.”

The proposal would revise the Biden administration’s 2023 Section 401 water quality certification rule. According to the current Unified Agenda, U.S. EPA intends to propose the revised rule in 2025. The stated objective is to “clarify the scope of certification” and address “implementation challenges and regulatory uncertainty associated with the 2023 Rule.” Translation: U.S. EPA is moving toward a narrower interpretation of what states may evaluate when determining whether a project will comply with applicable water quality requirements.

What Section 401 of the CWA Actually Does

Section 401 certifications play a pivotal role in federally permitted projects because they give states and tribes the authority to confirm that a proposed activity will comply with state water quality standards before a federal permit can be issued. The certification requirement applies to a range of activities requiring federal approvals, including U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Section 404 dredge-and-fill permits and authorizations issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for projects that may result in a discharge to Waters of the U.S. In practice, a project cannot move forward until the certifying authority either issues the certification or waives it. Because federal authorization hinges on the Section 401 process, even modest adjustments to the scope of review or timing requirements can affect project feasibility, costs, and overall schedules.

Why U.S. EPA Is Revisiting the 2023 Rule

U.S. EPA’s stated goal is to “clarify the scope of certification” and reduce the implementation challenges that emerged following the 2023 rule. That rule centered review on the entire project “activity,” which many states and environmental groups supported because it allowed for a broader consideration of potential impacts. Industry groups and other states, however, argued that the 2023 rule opened the door to conditions – or outright denials – based on issues only indirectly connected to water quality.

U.S. EPA previewed its shifting position in a May 2025 memorandum that encouraged certifying authorities to focus on whether a project would comply with applicable water quality requirements rather than evaluating broader project-level impacts. This narrower interpretation resembles the approach taken under the 2020 rule.

Signals on the Direction of the New Proposal

U.S. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has emphasized that narrowing the states’ review authority is necessary to prevent states from using Section 401 to block energy infrastructure. At the same time, environmental organizations have urged U.S. EPA to maintain the broader interpretation embedded in the 2023 rule, arguing it aligns more closely with both statute and longstanding practice.

With these competing pressures, the upcoming proposal will likely aim for a more defined, discharge- or water-quality-focused scope paired with clearer procedural steps – elements industry groups have been requesting for several years.

What This Means for Industrial and Manufacturing Projects

If U.S. EPA reinstates a narrower, more discharge-focused scope of the rule:

States may have fewer opportunities to impose broad conditions, reducing the likelihood of project delays unrelated to water-quality compliance.

Expect clearer timelines and application requirements, which could reduce administrative burden for complex capital projects.

Litigation risk may shift. A narrower rule is likely to be challenged by environmental groups, creating potential future uncertainty even if short-term clarity improves.

Projects in states that historically exercised broad Section 401 authority – particularly in the Northeast and Pacific Coast – can expect federal pressure to ensure their Section 401 certification approvals toe the line of federal expectations.

30%: Toyota Will Sink $10 Billion Into U.S. Manufacturing

Photo by: Toyota

Toyota is investing a whopping $10 billion into its U.S. manufacturing footprint. The automaker announced its investment into ""future mobility efforts"" as it celebrated the opening of its new battery plant in Liberty, North Carolina.

And, sure, while popular U.S.-market models like the Camry, Corolla Cross and RAV4 hybrids will all benefit from the battery factory, there's another more subtle reason for the investment. No, it's not the unannounced electrified three-row that Toyota still plans to pencil into its lineup (although I guess that technically is part of it)—it's that Toyota's investment could turn the U.S. into a manufacturing hub for its market back home.

Automotive News explains:

Late last month during a visit to a U.S. naval base in Japan, President Donald Trump said that Toyota was preparing to invest $10 billion to build “auto plants all over” the United States.

At the Japan Mobility Show, which coincided with Trump’s remarks, a Toyota Motor Corp. spokesperson said Chairman Akio Toyoda met Trump at a dinner for business leaders. However, the spokesperson said Trump and Toyoda talked only general economic and industry topics, not specifics about investing in the U.S.

Toyota did say at the time that it “plans to export its U.S.-made vehicles to Japan and open its distribution platform in Japan to U.S. automakers, as a result of Japan’s commitment to accept for sale in Japan U.S. manufactured and U.S. safety-certified vehicles without additional testing.”

What Toyota hasn't said is what projects it plans to use that $10 billion for, or what models are on its export radar. Toyota's lineup does have some overlap in both markets—think the bZ, Corolla, Crown, Highlander, Prius, Rav4 and a few other models. Given that the automaker has been committed to its ""multi-pathway"" approach to electrification, it could be anything from a new BEV, to a hybrid or even a full on gas car. Given that Japan's consumption of BEVs is relatively low compared to other heavy car markets, it might be a fair assumption

It's worth calling out that Toyota's battery plant is absolutely massive. Its 14 production lines will pump out batteries for mild and plug-in hybrids, as well as the mysterious unnamed BEV. All of them will be getting Liberty-grade electrons. But it gives a glimpse into Toyota doing electrification its way: slow and steady.

60%: Xiaomi Wait Times Plummet—But It's Not Why You Think

Photo by: Motor1.com

Suspicions have been mounting after wait times for the Xiaomi SU7's electric sedan dropped from 30 weeks down to just 6. The reason? Well, no official answer exists, however, speculation from analysts is that Xiaomi is good at scaling production. Really good.

New reporting from CNEV Post of a note from Goldman Sachs flagged the automaker's recent efforts to bolster production as the reason for an 80% reduction in delivery time. Their logic is that that factory has finally just caught up the demand (mostly) as the brand is committed to making sure that as many cars hit the road this year as possible.

CNEV Post tells us the forecast from Goldman Sachs:

""We believe the shortened waiting time for SU7 Pro/Max demonstrates Xiaomi's consistent execution in ramping up manufacturing capabilities, and echoes our earlier view that the tax subsidies announced on Oct 24 reflect Xiaomi's confidence in manufacturing capacity ramp-up,"" wrote Goldman Sachs analyst Timothy Zhao's team in a research note yesterday.

The team noted that SU7 new order volume has been softening recently which helps digest the order backlog, and expected Xiaomi's capacity expansion plans to achieve further official progress in the coming months.

With a 6 week wait, the backlog clearly hasn't let up entirely. But it's important to recognize that production capacity is finally starting to get to a point that makes China's Xiaomi-crazed market tenable.

Xiaomi said earlier this year that it was planning to double its output of SU7s in 2025—it sold 135,000 last year. Xiaomi is estimated to have delivered more than 100,000 vehicles in Q3, bringing its total annual sales to more than 257,000 units. Earlier this year, the rapid growth and sales success led Xiaomi's CEO Lei Jun to raise its delivery target to between 300,000 and 350,000 vehicles, or over 250% of its 2024 EV sales figure.

Meanwhile, the automaker surpassed Tesla in sales volume in China last month and is eyeing up expansion into global markets. If this trend (and demand) continues, Xiaomi's automotive unit could be headed for profitability earlier than anybody expected.

90%: Rivian's Partnership With VW Could Extend To Gas Cars

Photo by: InsideEVs

Volkswagen has spent the last half-decade wrestling with software problems a la its Cariad spin-off. But now, the Germans have a renewed lift into what makes a car's software good—and you can thank Rivian for that.

Rivian entered the chat bringing with a modern, cohesive vehicle architecture that powers its own cars. But CEO RJ Scaringe has another agenda that could make it billions. By becoming a whitebox manufacturer, the startup knows that it could make the software underpinnings for the entire industry. And with VW's funding, it might be able to do exactly that.

VW announced last year that it would inject a whopping $5.8 billion into a partnership in order to lean on Rivian's Software-Defined Vehicle platform. The effort was launched as an EV-first venture, but it's been quietly mutating into something bigger. Maybe much bigger.

Reuters reports on recent statements from the joint venture that hints at what could be coming:

The German automaker is counting on its partnership with Rivian to accelerate development of a scalable, next-generation vehicle platform and close the gap with rivals like Tesla and Chinese rivals.

""For sure, it is an extremely capable architecture and we could allow for future use to also use it for ICE, but as we already outlined our clear focus is on BEV implementation and whatever comes after that is to be decided at a later stage,"" Carsten Helbing, co-CEO of the joint venture RV Tech, said.

[...]

“The architecture is highly capable of also driving additional drivetrain configurations. So we do not see a huge issue there, but of course it’s additional work on the component side and on the platform side,"" Helbing told Reuters.

In case it wasn't obvious, the JV's words mean VW's next-gen combustion cars could eventually end up on the same underlying software architecture that its EVs will ride on.

The first car launching with the joint venture's software is the Volkswagen ID.Every1 (don't worry, that's not its final name). That rollout begins in 2027, but the juicy bit is what comes next. First are other EVs built on its Scalable Systems Platform, but maybe—just maybe—ICE cars could follow.

100%: Should Tesla Get Into The White-Lable game?

Photo by: Tesla

With Rivian and Lucid both aiming to be the suppliers supplying the electrified automotive industry, it's almost a surprise that Tesla—the OG in the EV game—hasn't gone down the same road. Now, sure, it's open-sourced the NACS standard so other automakers can make use of its Supercharging network and has talked about licensing its Full Self-Driving software to other automakers, but that's the extent of what we've seen so far.

Tesla happens to be extremely good at software. In fact, one of the hardest things about shopping around for another EV and leaving the Tesla ecosystem is deciding just where you want to compromise in the software world. Is it partial autonomy? An app that just works? An intuitive, quick UI? No other automaker has seemed to nail EV software quite like Tesla.

That being said, is Tesla missing out here? And would other automakers benefit from this? Let me know your thoughts in the comments.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/7Z28zq/s1/toyota-corolla-cm.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 14:02:51.267636

The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday granted Texas permission to authorize companies to capture and store carbon dioxide underground, fulfilling a key wish for the state’s oil and gas industry.

The approval comes after a two-year federal review of the Railroad Commission of Texas, the agency regulating oil and gas. The agency needed to prove it could enforce federal rules, a requirement that supporters of the effort said it could do better than the EPA. Critics have said that state regulators have a history of being too lax on the oil and gas industry.

In a statement, the Texas Oil and Gas Association, which represents the industry’s political interests, lauded the approval.

“Today’s approval is a watershed moment that launches the next chapter of Texas energy leadership,” said Todd Staples, the association’s president. “Texas is now poised to lead the world in (carbon capture and sequestration), which means more investment and more jobs for Texans.”

There are more than 60 pending applications for carbon dioxide injection wells before the EPA. It’s unclear whether the EPA or the Railroad Commission will review those applications.

Carbon capture and sequestration is the process of trapping carbon dioxide molecules, which contribute most to climate change. Oil companies ordinarily retrofit their field equipment, such as pipes, with technology to prevent gas leaks. The technology has been around for decades.

But in recent years, oil companies in Texas began building facilities dedicated solely to absorbing ambient carbon dioxide, known as direct air capture facilities. Inspiring this effort were generous tax credits offered under President Joe Biden, which continue under his successor, President Donald Trump.

Oil companies capturing the gas had nowhere to put it. The permit required to store it underground, known as a Class VI permit, is notoriously hard to obtain, with yearslong review periods. Advocates of the oil and gas industry said the lengthy review kept oil companies from expanding their efforts, which they say are aimed at combating climate change. Some scientists researching carbon capture and sequestration said the Permian Basin, the oil-rich desert in West Texas, has the right geology for permanently injecting carbon.

Industry observers are skeptical. State regulators, eager to take over the permitting process, could rubber-stamp permits much more quickly, said Virginia Palacios, executive director of Commission Shift, an oil and gas watchdog group. Palacios added that the commission has not set a strong example with saltwater disposal wells, built to store industry wastewater underground, some of which have ruptured through abandoned wells, sending torrents of water above ground.

“The Railroad Commission is getting this new authority that is just another form of injection in overpressured formations,” Palacios said. “We’re looking at an agency that handles bad actor companies with kid gloves.”

In a news release, an agency commissioner said in matters of oil and gas, the state is best positioned to make decisions.

“Obtaining Class VI primacy marks an important step forward for our state’s energy sector and our citizens by recognizing the Railroad Commission’s unmatched expertise when it comes to matters of energy production, geological knowledge, and safety,” said Railroad Commission of Texas Chairman Jim Wright.

NYCHA has 177,569 apartments in 2,411 buildings across 335 conventional public housing and PACT developments.","Copper to Develop New Class of Induction Stoves and Produce 10,000 Units

New York City, N.Y.— The New York Power Authority (NYPA), the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), and the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) today announced that the next phase of the Induction Stove Challenge is moving forward following a contract signing with Copper, an appliance manufacturer, as part of a $32 million commitment to develop, pilot and produce 10,000 new energy-efficient induction stoves for use in New York City public housing facilities. The competitive innovation challenge—spearheaded by NYPA, NYCHA and NYSERDA—seeks to replace existing gas stoves to improve air quality in apartments, eliminate service outages and avoid costly gas infrastructure and electrical upgrades in NYCHA buildings. The initiative aims to develop a new class of induction stoves that can be installed in older buildings using standard 120-volt, 20-amp outlets.

Copper will design and produce 100 units for performance evaluation during the challenge’s pilot phase. In July 2024, the NYPA Board of Trustees approved $32 million in short-term financing for the project based on NYCHA’s $30.8 million commitment to purchase additional stoves if the pilot is successful. The product development and pilot phase, supported by $1.2 million in NYSERDA funding, will kick off this month.

The prototype units will be installed in 100 NYCHA apartments—with new cookware provided to each participating household—with the intent of eliminating service outages due to deteriorating gas plumbing, and providing best-in-class, comfortable cooking as well as health and quality of life benefits to NYCHA residents. Copper will work with industry testing and safety standards organizations, such as Underwriter Laboratories, to achieve certification for novel technologies prior to the pilot phase.

Successful testing of the developed product will trigger a large-scale purchase order of up to 10,000 units from NYCHA. The effort will demonstrate to building owners the promise of an affordable conversion to efficient induction cooking, and to manufacturers regarding the potential of a broader residential market for the new induction stove products. This purchase will support dozens of NYCHA buildings, eliminating the need for costly capital investments in gas plumbing infrastructure, and fully electrifying their energy systems and displacing fossil fuel use.

To ensure that the new induction stoves can serve a large, national market, NYSERDA is engaging other states, municipalities and housing providers across North America to generate interest in the results of the challenge. In this way, the challenge will create a pipeline of potential demand from others pursuing cooking electrification, aligning NYCHA’s product specifications with the needs of the broader market. Twelve organizations representing more than 300,000 housing units have already signed up to support the initiative.

NYPA President and CEO Justin E. Driscoll said, “Through the Induction Stove Challenge, NYPA is collaborating with its partners to develop a new class of cooktops that can operate in buildings where electrical systems would have been otherwise unsupportive—an important innovation on the path to the responsible electrification of buildings. The $32 million in funding support reflects the Power Authority’s commitment to drive innovation and strengthen New York’s rapidly growing clean energy economy.”

NYSERDA President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “This investment is a major step in New York’s ongoing collaboration with the manufacturing community to develop and bring to market new technologies that can make residential electrification more affordable. By expanding access to modern, energy-efficient appliances in NYCHA buildings, we are improving quality of life, promoting cleaner indoor air, and helping to lower energy bills for families who need it most.”

NYCHA Chief Executive Officer Lisa Bova-Hiatt said, “The execution of this contract brings us closer to the production and piloting of affordable, energy-efficient induction stoves, which will alleviate the amount of service outages and the need for costly capital investments caused by the deterioration of aging gas plumbing infrastructure in our properties. We thank Governor Hochul, and our partners at NYPA and NYSERDA, for their partnership in this innovation challenge, and look forward to employing these new stoves to improve the quality of life for many NYCHA residents while catalyzing uptake of this product in the broader residential market.”

Copper CEO and Co-Founder Sam Calisch said, “Copper is proud to partner with New York on a project that puts residents first. Together, we’re showing how clean technology can create healthier homes, avoid costly upgrades to aging gas infrastructure, and strengthen the city’s electric grid. Governor Hochul and the State of New York are demonstrating real leadership in accelerating this shift to cleaner, more resilient energy solutions. We share in that vision and are honored to serve the people of New York as we work to build a cleaner, safer future.”

Senator Kevin S. Parker, Chair of the Senate Energy and Telecommunications Committee said, “The partnership between NYPA, NYCHA, and NYSERDA represents real progress toward our state’s clean energy and public health goals. By electrifying cooking in NYCHA buildings, we are addressing decades-old infrastructure issues, improving indoor air quality, and reducing harmful emissions all while lowering long-term costs for residents. This initiative shows how smart investment and innovation can deliver immediate benefits for working families and move New York closer to a fully decarbonized, equitable energy future. The State Legislature has worked tirelessly to advance policies and secure funding that make projects like this possible, ensuring that the transition to clean energy reaches every corner of our state and every household that calls New York home.”

The challenge is modeled after another successful state-city partnership, the Clean Heat for All Challenge , in which NYCHA, NYPA and NYSERDA invited manufacturers to develop and produce a new electrification product to better serve multifamily buildings’ heating and cooling needs, reduce capital investment required to renovate and maintain existing heating systems, and hasten the transition to fossil-free heating sources at NYCHA campuses.

The two companies’ joint venture, known as RV Tech, said it has made solid progress on delivering the EV electrical and software platform that Volkswagen needs to compete with Tesla and Chinese rivals. The JV is focused on delivering models for Rivian and VW but is keeping communication open with third parties about the scalability of its platforms.

“We’re solving a problem for the larger automotive industry,” Wassym Bensaid, Rivian’s software chief and RV Tech co-chair, told journalists at an event in Palo Alto, California, on Wednesday. “That could become an opportunity” for others as well, he said.

The platform is designed to be scalable across vehicle sizes and segments in Western markets.

The earning potential from licensing the technology “is a very different ballgame,” Bensaid said, “and a very different margin profile from a business standpoint than making cars.”

RV Tech also said it will begin testing the system in winter conditions on Audi, VW and Scout models starting in the first quarter of 2026.

Volkswagen has licensed its technology to other carmakers in the past, with Ford Motor Co. and Mahindra & Mahindra using the German carmaker’s first-generation platform for their own electric models.

Volkswagen is grappling with tariffs in the U.S., shrinking deliveries in China and muted demand in Europe. As part of its push to cut costs and bolster sales, it’s turning to Rivian for the kind of software and EV technology its initial battery-powered models were missing. The automaker is investing as much as $5.8 billion into the alliance, making it one of Chief Executive Officer Oliver Blume’s biggest strategic bets.

The partners formed a joint venture one year ago that brings together software developers and engineers from both companies. They’re working with Rivian’s centralized electronics layout with fewer computing units that’s meant to help Volkswagen simplify development and cut costs. For loss-making Rivian, the investment is a financial lifeline as manufacturers rethink strategies in a slowing EV market.

While the JV is prioritizing the ramp-up and delivery of the underpinnings for electric models, there are parallels that would allow the technology to be used for combustion engine cars as well, JV co-chair Carsten Helbing said.

The first car to get the new technology will be Rivian’s R2 sport utility vehicle, out early next year. VW’s compact EV, called ID. EVERY1, expected to cost around €20,000 (about $23,000), will follow in 2027, with rugged vehicles from the Scout brand due after that. Volkswagen has a similar partnership with Xpeng Inc. for the Chinese market.

Volkswagen’s earlier efforts to develop software in-house largely stumbled, first by holding up launches of its namesake brand’s ID models, then by handicapping those vehicles’ sales because of buggy features. The group, which also includes Audi and Porsche AG, has seen EV sales rise in Europe this year after improving software and updating models.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/08/PDTN/86050219007-bizautorivian-20250908-la.jpg?crop=2997,1686,x0,y404&width=2997&height=1686&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-13 13:01:39.723974

Solar Eclipse | What Pine Gate’s Bankruptcy Says About Renewables

Utility-scale solar and storage developer Pine Gate Renewables filed for bankruptcy last week, underscoring the growing pressure on renewable developers. The announcement follows months of speculation around the financial health of independent developers navigating a rapidly changing policy landscape.

Developers have faced mounting challenges this year after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) slashed project economics across the wind and solar sectors. The rollback of key tax credits has sent project levelized costs of energy (LCOEs) soaring, in some cases doubling. This undermines returns and jeopardizes financing pipelines, separating resilient portfolios from those dependent on federal incentives to maintain profitability.

Enverus Intelligence® Research’s portfolio resiliency analysis ranks developers based on the share of capacity with merchant power and renewable energy credit (REC) revenues exceeding before-tax LCOEs, excluding the impact of tax credits. Projects in markets with generation-weighted price premiums demonstrate greater insulation from the phaseout of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives. Against this benchmark, Pine Gate Renewables falls on the lower end of the resiliency spectrum, with just 18% of total capacity remaining economical without tax credit support.

While some projects remain eligible under the safe harbor provision — requiring construction to begin within 12 months of the OBBBA’s passage — prolonged interconnection timelines lower the likelihood of success. Pine Gate Renewables illustrates the pressure felt among mid-tier renewable developers as the market resets around a leaner, post-incentive reality.

In 2005, China only had two EV battery manufacturers. Twenty years later, it produces more than three-quarters of the world’s lithium-ion cells. How did it happen?

At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, athletes, journalists and officials from all over the world were transported by a fleet of sleek buses sporting a white, blue and green design as they zipped between different venues in the Chinese capital.

Different from the diesel-powered vehicles that ruled Beijing’s streets at the time, the Olympic buses, numbering around 50, ran on lithium-ion batteries to help Beijing host a “green and high-tech” Olympic Games. It also marked the country’s first foray into creating a lithium-ion battery industry for electric vehicles (EVs), laying the groundwork for China’s ascension to world leader of this technology two decades later.

The Olympic e-bus campaign had been set in motion as soon as Beijing won the bid in 2001, according to a 2020 documentary aired by China’s state media. But developing and producing EV batteries for the global event was no easy feat.

In late 2003, Mo Ke and his colleagues at the Beijing New Materials Development Centre – a government-affiliated research institute – were tasked to analyse China’s lithium battery industry as part of Beijing’s preparatory work for the Olympics.

But back then, China’s lithium battery industry was “very small” with only two EV battery producers, as Mo’s team found. In 2005, they hosted China’s first conference for the lithium battery industry as a part of their research.

Mo says,

All companies in the industry came, but there were only around 200 people in total,

At the time, CATL, the world’s current largest EV battery maker, was a department of ATL, a Japanese-owned company that made lithium batteries for electronic gadgets. BYD, the world’s current second-largest EV battery maker and a leading EV maker, had just entered the auto industry after earning its first barrel of capital by supplying batteries to phone giants.

Twenty years later, China is the king of the industry indispensable to the world’s 2050 net-zero goal. It produces more than three-quarters of all lithium-ion batteries worldwide and is home to six out of the 10 largest battery makers on the planet.

What led to its meteoric rise? The answer lies in a combination of factors.

Two of them are a huge domestic market “walled off and preserved” for local firms and coordinated government support across the supply chain, says Xie Yanmei, an independent analyst of Chinese political economy and industrial policy. Consumer subsidies, state-sponsored rollout of charging networks and a policy mandating automakers to make EVs also helped, she notes.

But policy is only part of the story. Chinese companies also proved adept at large-scale production and controlling cost – both key to EV battery manufacturing.

Song Xin, who advises Chinese companies ranging from car to robot makers aiming to go global, says:

They have strong survival instinct and will proactively explore new ideas to help them stay competitive,

“This is the foundation of the industry’s continuous growth.”

International roots

The story of lithium batteries began beyond China’s shores about 50 years ago with three chemists: British-American Stanley Whittingham, American John Goodenough and Japanese Akira Yoshino.

Their separate research – which earned them a joint Nobel Prize in 2019 – rode on each other’s strength and led to the invention of the first commercially viable lithium-ion battery in 1985, built by Yoshino for Tokyo-based chemical company Asahi Kasei.

In 1991, Japanese electronics company Sony worked with Asahi Kasei to bring the world’s first lithium-ion batteries to the market. Five years later, Nissan teamed up with Sony to launch the world’s first car powered by a lithium-battery.

In the following decade, Japan was the global number one lithium-ion battery producer, with South Korea keenly vying for supremacy. At the turn of the century, Japanese firms accounted for a staggering 93% of the global market share, with electronics company Sanyo leading the charge. It wasn’t until 2011 that South-Korean Samsung SDI overtook Japanese Panasonic to top the chart.

Chinese policy makers decided that EVs could be an opportunity for the Chinese auto industry to leapfrog the west – Xie Yanmei

When Mo was researching China’s lithium battery industry in the early 2000s, Mengguli and Wanxiang were only two companies making EV batteries in the country.

Mo, now the founder and chief analyst of Chinese battery-research firm, RealLi Research, says:

They supplied most of the batteries for the e-buses that served the Beijing Olympics and the World Expo in Shanghai in 2010,

But before the Olympics, China had already planned a long game. In 2006, its cabinet launched a science and technology scheme that would cover the next 15 years. It included “low-emission and new-energy vehicles [NEVs]” as one of the 62 priority areas the country should pursue, and listed “rechargeable power battery” as a key technology for this area. NEVs, a term frequently used by the Chinese government, refers to pure electric, plug-in hybrids, and fuel cell vehicles powered by alternative fuels such as hydrogen and methanol.

China’s goal was clear: to upgrade its vast manufacturing industry by 2020 so that it would stop relying on cheap labour and start winning with technological advantages.

For years, Beijing had tried but failed to be a global contender in the conventional auto industry that featured internal combustion engines. But it believed it was time for a reboot.

Xie, says:

Chinese policy makers decided that EVs could be an opportunity for the Chinese auto industry to leapfrog the west, because it was like a blank field where everybody was starting from scratch,

A national plan guided regional governments to build supply chains and charging networks for NEVs. It also supported domestic companies to spearhead the research and development of technologies related to EVs, including batteries.

In the same year, the country began its large-scale rollout of new-energy buses, with the “10 Cities and Thousand Vehicles” programme.

Sluggish American competition

In Mo’s view, China’s determination to promote EVs was vital for its battery ascension, and that vision was partly inspired by the US.

The US saw a wave of interest in developing and making battery-powered vehicles first during the 1970s after the breakout of the oil crisis, and then again in the 1990s after the federal government published a regulation to tackle air pollution.

As early as 1990, California launched a zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) programme to improve air quality by encouraging the adoption of EVs. The programme led to the introduction of ZEV mandate, which essentially forced car companies like General Motors to invest in EVs, says Anders Hove, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies in the UK.

Actions on the other side of the ocean led the Chinese government to realise that EVs were “a stepping stone” to what was later described as the “fourth industrial revolution” – an era characterised and driven by digital technologies – and China wanted a place in it, according to Mo.

But the EV push by California did not lead to the establishment of a US lithium-ion battery industry, partly because car oil companies lobbied California to “water down” the ZEV mandate to give more support for fuel cells powered by hydrogen and hybrid cars, whose batteries used non-lithium chemistries, Hove says.

In the 2000s, the George W Bush administration introduced measures to fund the research and development of EVs. US startups made major progress on both batteries and cars, Hove says, but then came the financial crisis in 2008.

Hove says,

[The first wave of US startups] all ran into a lot of financial difficulty and the window kind of closed on investing in clean energy,

“All the people who had invested in that, they were burned.”

In the following year, the Obama administration launched a new round of funding, but it was too late to save that first wave of renewable companies from collapsing or selling their technologies, Hove says. Many of them were bought by Chinese firms, according to him, including battery company A123, a rising-star that boasted advanced lithium-ion battery technology developed at MIT. A123 was acquired by China’s Wanxiang in 2013.

At the same time, China launched an enormous four-trillion-yuan (roughly £394bn or $649bn then) stimulus plan to counter the impact of the global financial crisis and part of it was directed towards “energy-saving and emissions-reduction” projects. The move ignited the country’s interest in renewable technologies, including NEVs, according to a 2010 report published by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and China’s Research Institute of Resources and Environment Policies.

China’s industry snowballs

The years between 2012 and 2020 proved to be critical for China’s battery makers as the government doubled down its effort in putting EVs on the road.

An industrial roadmap for new-energy vehicles set targets on the number of EVs the country should deploy over the period. More importantly, it also set technical requirements for EV and battery manufacturers to apply for state support – a push for them to grow. In 2013, China made EV purchase subsidies available to individual consumers, not just the public sector, opening the floodgate to private car ownership.

The scale of the state backing was enormous. In 2014, China’s central and regional governments spent nearly 10bn yuan (roughly £986m or $1.6bn then) on subsidies, according to a report at the time. Over the next eight years, the country would go on to hand out 200bn yuan (£21bn or $28bn) in tax rebates in total for new-energy vehicles.

The investment yielded almost instant result. Both the number of NEVs produced and sold in the country grew more than threefold in 2014 and 2015, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade body. Their market share would snowball from 1.3% in 2015 to 41% in 2024.

But a bigger boost for the battery industry was yet to arrive. In 2015, China introduced a key rule that – in Xie’s words – “walled off” its huge domestic market for Chinese battery firms. EV makers were mandated to use batteries produced by one of the selected suppliers if their cars were to qualify for consumer subsidies. All of the 57 companies that appeared on a government “white list” turned out to be Chinese.

Xie says,

It was very cleverly designed technical specifications that narrowly defined that only Chinese battery companies would be eligible,

At that time, some South Korean companies had already started building factories in China, “only to find out that they were completely shut out the market”, she adds.

Those Chinese EV makers that had been using foreign suppliers had to make a last-minute switch to battery manufacturer CATL and few other domestic firms complied with the policy, The Economic Observer reported. That rule ended up lasting four years.

In the fast lane

A sudden influx of new customers propelled CATL – which split from ATL in 2011 – to become the world’s largest EV battery producer in 2017, based in Ningde, China, beating Panasonic and its compatriot BYD, Chinese news site Caixin reported. CATL has held the title since.

The policy drive continued with the “Made in China 2025” strategy, which aimed at helping the country “grab the global vantage point for manufacturing” by the mid-2020s through technological innovation. NEVs were listed as a “key area” the country should “vigorously promote”.

Riding on the momentum, China introduced a “dual-credit” system for automakers in 2017. Partly based on California’s ZEV programme, the policy essentially demanded that all automakers in China produce EVs to “balance off” the conventional cars they made through a complex formula. A “one-way street” design pushed automakers to make more EVs in order to avoid unnecessary cash spending.

Xie explains,

As an automaker, on the one hand, you had to produce EVs in China or face a [financial] penalty. On the other, the EVs you were forced to produce would not sell without Chinese batteries,

“So, every automaker, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Americans, Germans, had to use Chinese batteries.”

Xie adds,

The ballooning and protected market allowed CATL to work with advanced Western car makers on joint innovation.

The process “quickly brought up its skill and capability

The way China’s EV and battery industries grew was also fundamentally different from the West. The key was the close partnership between the government and the industry, says Song, founder of Sinnvoll Global Strategy, a think tank with offices in Beijing and Berlin.

The government’s massive investment had come with a clear goal: to build a strong EV manufacturing industry. And that goal was delivered via fierce competition within the industry to decide which companies or technologies would survive and thrive, according to Song.

This method – like running rounds and rounds of industrial-wide “horse races” to pick the fastest – is much more effective than the conventional model in Europe, North America and Japan, where industrial growth is often driven by few major companies or consortiums, she explains. “This also means that China can bring a technology from the lab to mass production very quickly.”

Secrets to success

There are other important elements that set China’s battery industry apart. “It’s the supply chain, know-how and manufacturing,” says Taylor Ogan, chief executive of Shenzhen-based Snow Bull Capital, which invests in China’s clean-tech sector.

For one, top Chinese battery makers, such as CATL and BYD, run on a “vertically integrated” business model, which means that they often own their suppliers fully or partly.

Chen Shan, a Shanghai-based analyst on battery markets at Norwegian consultancy Rystad Energy, says:

This helps control cost and ensure the security and reliability of their supply chains,

Their capability at managing large-scale manufacturing matters enormously, too.

Liu Chengguang, who researches battery materials in Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in China, explains:

Modern EV battery packs string hundreds of small cells side by side or end by end.

”One weak cell would drag down the whole chain, cut range and raise safety risks. Every cell must be almost identical.”

He notes,

Achieving the feat “demands massive, highly automated plants with strict process control and real-time testing and smart sorting,

This is precisely the strength of CATL, which grabbed nearly 40% of the global EV battery market in 2024, more than double second-place BYD.

“The secret to CATL’s success is that it can use less money to make better batteries while maintaining a huge manufacturing capacity,” according to Cheng Manqi, a journalist with Chinese business outlet Late Post, who has investigated the firm.

Constant innovation is another factor helping Chinese battery makers stay ahead of the game. For example, BYD’s signature “blade battery“, a lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery, was launched in 2020 partly because it was cheaper to make: the battery did not use cobalt, a mineral for which China had to rely on imports. But BYD significantly improved the performance of previous LFPs, making them more powerful, safer and smaller. It became so popular that it altered the prevailing type of lithium-ion battery in China.

Chinese batteries are cheaper, they are high-performing, they are available – Francesca Ghiretti

Behind such a rapid tech revolution is a large pool of Chinese battery engineers, who came through a targeted education and vocational training system offered by colleges, universities and battery companies.

Cory Combs, head of critical mineral and supply chain research at consultancy Trivium China, says:

Chinese companies have a generation of incredibly skilled technical researchers,

Combs, says:

They are not just PhDs who work upstream in the lab. They’re not just floor workers in the factories,

They are “practicing engineers”, who know the production processes thoroughly, understand what the market wants and can use their knowledge to improve existing technology quicky to win consumers. “That’s what you need to make batteries cost effective to produce,” he says.

CATL employs more than 20,000 technical engineers while BYD’s battery arm, FinDreams Battery, has more than 10,000 of them.

Can China maintain its dominance?

Today, China dominates the production at every stage of the battery supply chain, apart from the mining and processing of some raw minerals, according to the International Energy Agency. It is home to nearly 85% of the battery production capacity globally, compared to North America’s 5% and Europe’s 7%, according to research by consultancy Wood Mackenzie, seen by the BBC.

A consensus among researchers is that it will be extremely difficult for other countries to challenge China’s dominance over the current generation of battery technologies.

Kate Logan, a director at Asia Society Policy Institute who focuses on China’s climate and clean energy policies, says:

Some aspects that led to China’s leadership, such as the existence of industrial clusters and vertical integration of supply chains, will be difficult to replicate,

The fact that Chinese companies have already achieved scale manufacturing batteries and are expanding its production overseas is another huge hurdle for perspective competitors.

Francesca Ghiretti, a researcher on China and economic security at RAND Europe, a non-profit research organisation, says:

Chinese batteries are cheaper, they are high-performing, they are available,

China’s production scale “makes it really difficult for others to catch up – not to catch up with the technology, but the commercial success of that technology,” she says.

But in Mo’s view, the door isn’t completely shut for other countries. What China is really good at is taking existing technologies and making them better and cheaper, but the country’s weakness is in cutting-edge research, he says.

If other countries can get ahead with next-generation battery technologies, such as solid-state batteries, “there may still be chances” for them to compete, Mo says. Traditional lithium-ion batteries use a liquid electrolyte to transfer ions between the electrodes, but solid-state batteries use a solid electrolyte. What is unique about them is that it may not need the existing supply chain meant for liquid-based cells, potentially opening space for non-Chinese contenders, Mo says.

Companies such as China’s CATL and BYD, South Korea’s Samsung SDI and the US’s QuantumScape are developing solid-state batteries. But for the US – which heavily relies on China for lithium-ion batteries at present – scaling up manufacturing to a competitive level is expected to challenging, according to an analysis published by the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. Obstacles include lagging know-how, uncertain demand and high energy costs, the analysis said.

But growing one’s own battery industry doesn’t automatically mean competing with China, as some point out.

Hove of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, says:

It is only possible in the near term by working with Chinese companies because they are at the forefront of the technology,

“If you don’t have that manufacturing expertise, you won’t be able to scale up any breakthrough technology.” Instead, it is the expansion of the know-how that will enable the catch up, he says.

But this is no easy feat, given China’s 20-year lead in building a battery-manufacturing ecosystem. For some, such as Ogan of Snow Bull Capital, the past two decades may have sealed China’s long-lasting lead in the global battery supply chain.

He says,

There will not be a time that I can ever envision another country catching up with the Chinese in terms of battery manufacturing,

“They’re just so much further ahead.”

Bloomberg

Weeks after ChatGPT was unleashed on the world in November 2022, sustainability executives at Microsoft Corp. realized they had a big problem.

On the tech giant’s 500-acre campus in Redmond, Washington, teams began holding regular “triage” meetings to confront serious questions posed by the artificial intelligence boom: Where would the company find the gigawatts — just one gigawatt can power nearly 750,000 US homes — needed for data centers? And how could Microsoft possibly secure that extra energy while still making progress toward a long-standing goal of going carbon-negative?

The AI discussions were “interesting and terrifying all at the same time,” said Brian Janous, who served until August 2023 as Microsoft’s vice president of energy. Microsoft and other major tech companies, he said, had to “look at the climate commitments they set and say, ‘Can I still do this?’”

Nearly three years later, Microsoft and rivals including Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are still struggling to answer that question. On one hand, they’re trying to obtain every electron possible to power their trillion-dollar bet on AI. On the other, they're trying to stay true to a goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 or sooner.

“There’s no question that the current push to develop AI infrastructure is putting a strain on the climate commitments of the big tech companies, all of which were made prior to the advent of AI,” Janous said in an interview. After leaving Microsoft, he co-founded Cloverleaf Infrastructure, which partners with utilities to develop clean-powered sites that supply the largest data-center providers.

US President Donald Trump isn’t making this challenge any easier. Since taking office, he’s slashed federal funding for green initiatives, such as wind and solar, and signaled his support for powering AI with generators that use fossil fuels, including aging coal-fired plants. Wary of irritating their biggest ally in Washington, tech leaders so far have refrained from publicly challenging the president over his campaign against renewables.

For now, the so-called hyperscalers continue to buy clean energy at a record pace, with Meta, Amazon, Google and Microsoft ranking as the biggest corporate signers of power purchase agreements with renewable suppliers. Together they accounted for 9.6 gigawatts of US clean energy purchases in the first half of 2025, amounting to 40 per cent of the global total, according to the latest BloombergNEF data.

That number falls woefully short of the 362 gigawatts of additional power the industry is projected to need worldwide by 2035 to sustain its growing data center fleet, according to BNEF. With enormous pressure from Wall Street to deliver on AI investments, companies can’t afford to let energy be a limiting factor and are pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy on electricity sources.

AI’s impact is already showing up in sustainability reports. Meta, Google, Amazon and Microsoft disclosed that their carbon emissions went up 64 per cent, 51 per cent, 33 per cent and 23 per cent respectively in their latest climate filings compared to their benchmarks from before ChatGPT’s release. Microsoft explicitly blamed “growth-related factors such as AI and cloud expansion.”

Inside Microsoft, tension between longstanding climate pledges and the insatiable energy needs of AI left the sustainability teams mired in uncertainty, according to two former managers who left the company earlier this year. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the former managers described Microsoft’s climate priorities as constantly shifting in the face of its appetite for electricity.

A key source of strain was over concerns that Microsoft risked a public backlash if it appeared to be abandoning its climate goals in any way, creating a “suffocating level of control” that paralyzed staff, one of the former managers said. Reports were dissected to ensure they adhered to an evolving company line, with individual words in memos and other documents turning into landmines that could “blow up” conversations, the person said.

Adding to the stress, the other former manager said, were industry-wide workforce reductions in 2023 that cut nearly 200,000 jobs, which destabilized climate teams as they worked on one of the toughest problems in tech: how to procure enough energy, sustainably.

In a statement, Microsoft’s chief sustainability officer, Melanie Nakagawa, said the company “remains committed to meeting our climate goals of being carbon negative, water positive and zero waste by 2030 while protecting ecosystems. As we learn and adapt, we’re continuing to expand our global clean energy portfolio, building markets by investing in new climate technology solutions, and empowering others with technology to build a more sustainable future.”

Biggest Bottleneck

On a recent podcast, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said the supply of power, rather than the availability of semiconductors, accounted for the biggest bottleneck in data center capacity. By some estimates, the energy needs of existing and planned AI infrastructure in the US can’t be met with current supply.

Dave Stangis, a senior executive at Apollo Global Management who has led the firm’s sustainability strategy for the past four years, said last month that the amount of energy required to power AI data centers is so vast that meeting that need may be more than a lifetime away.

As a result, big tech companies have been buying more nuclear and geothermal energy to satisfy the needs of their expanding AI infrastructure, according to BNEF data. At the same time, haunted by the risk of losing power for even a minute and driven by the desire to win the AI race, some companies are also exploring what’s known as behind-the-meter power, where a generation plant sits in the data center’s backyard.

“They want a new resource, something that’s not already on the grid, that’s not already spoken for,” said Elaine Walsh, who leads the power group for the law firm Baker Botts. She added that “almost all” of the new development work she does is for gas power.

Meta’s Hyperion Project

That’s the strategy Meta is using as it attempts to get its massive data center in Louisiana up and running as quickly as possible.

The project, dubbed Hyperion, is a 4 million-square-foot complex on 2,250 acres in rural Louisiana that’s expected to consume as much as five gigawatts of electricity. This summer, Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg posted a graphic depicting Hyperion engulfing most of Manhattan — an image that Trump later displayed at a White House Cabinet meeting, saying the facility would cost $50 billion.

To support the Meta site, Entergy Corp. received regulatory approval in August to construct three gas plants capable of producing about 2.3 gigawatts. Last month, in addition to those three plants, the utility applied to tie new natural gas generation to the grid in Louisiana to meet increasing demand from data centers and industrial projects, including from Meta and other hyperscalers.

“From the moment that the Richland Parish data center came onto the picture, we’ve been planning for and executing to secure clean energy to support that site,” Urvi Parekh, Meta’s head of global energy, said in an interview. “What we measure is what is the carbon intensity of the electricity that is serving our data center and then working through the greenhouse gas protocol rules.”

Meta also said in a statement that it plans to add enough clean and renewable energy to match the total electricity use at Richland. To do so, the company said it’s working with Entergy to bring 1.5 gigawatts of renewable energy to the Louisiana grid and that it’s launched other clean and renewable energy projects across the state, including three focused on solar.

Companies like Meta often buy carbon offsets and renewable energy certificates to balance the emissions tied to their operations, but both of those practices have been decried over the years for varying reasons. Offsets can be notoriously difficult to verify, and renewable energy certificates have been assailed for failing to achieve real emissions reduction or drive renewable energy generation.

Meta has maintained that the majority of its renewable energy portfolio actually comes in the form of real, long-term contracts such as power purchase agreements and that “only a small percentage” — less than 5 per cent of its reported renewable energy purchases in 2023, for example — were tied to short-term, unbundled renewable energy certificates.

Nuclear Option

Meta’s use of gas to power its new data center while still purchasing huge amounts of clean energy reflects a balancing act across the industry. Last month, Google announced a first-of-its kind agreement to buy almost all of the electricity from a gas plant in Illinois while supplying the facility with carbon capture and storage equipment.

The technology will capture and store around 90 per cent of the CO2 emissions from the plant, according to a Google release. But some skeptics have cautioned that emissions capture is neither economical nor feasible at scale, and a nationwide carbon storage network would require as many as 96,000 miles of new pipelines, according to Energy Department estimates.

Another option on the table is nuclear energy, which can provide huge amounts of round-the-clock power, free of carbon emissions. Google agreed last month to buy nuclear power from a plant that NextEra Energy Inc. plans to restart in Iowa.

But nuclear power is also expensive, and supply chain issues mean that new nuclear plants will take years to build and bring online. Even though the NextEra generator is already built — and was only shuttered in 2020 — the company won’t start delivering power to Google’s data centers until 2029.

To link data centers to power sources faster, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last month to expedite reviews for grid connections, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg News. As part of a draft rule Wright sent to the agency, those reviews would shrink to 60 days, a seismic shift for a process that currently can take years.

Under the proposal, data centers could win a speedy review if they include new power plants or agree to curtail usage in response to grid strains during high-demand periods such as heatwaves. However, a data center vying to locate next to an existing power plant would require a study to determine if that generation capacity is needed to maintain grid reliability.

Trump Headwinds

Complicating matters is Trump, who has made the industry’s AI ambitions central to his second-term economic agenda. In September, he welcomed leaders including Nadella and Zuckerberg for a White House dinner where he hailed tech companies’ far-reaching infrastructure spending plans and promised help with permitting for energy projects.

At the same time, Trump has roiled the tech companies’ quest for electricity by attacking green energy with a vengeance and assailing global warming as “the greatest con job ever” during a United Nations speech. The administration has stopped or delayed wind and solar initiatives — some of which were near completion — and declined to send delegates to the COP30 climate conference in Brazil.

One of Trump’s biggest moves against renewables was to use the massive tax bill he signed in July to strip away clean energy incentives created through his predecessor Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Total annual deployment of new solar, wind and energy storage facilities in 2035 will be 21 per cent lower — or 227 gigawatts less — than it would have been without the Trump tax law, according to BNEF forecasts.

Backing out of wind and solar projects as Trump envisions is problematic because doing so would force companies to use other power sources, like natural gas, that are not necessarily cheaper or faster to get into service, said Janous. He disputed the narrative that renewables can’t sufficiently power data centers, arguing that the grid should be made more flexible to better use what solar and wind can offer.

Big tech companies likewise can’t simply discard clean energy commitments that have been a decade in the making for some firms, which have put time and money into reaching them, said BNEF analyst Nayel Brihi.

“Dropping out now would first of all hurt their branding a lot, but also would just not make a lot of business sense for them because of all the time and effort that’s been put in already,” he said.

The initiative is led by the Schurmann Family, the first Latin American family to circumnavigate the world in a sailing boat, and promotes ocean protection and recovery through science, education and innovation.

As part of this partnership, the initiative will occupy the iconic cultural space Casa das Onze Janelas, which will be transformed into the Casa Vozes do Oceano (Voice of the Ocean House) during the event.

The space, free and open to the public, will feature an immersive exhibition supported by WEG, along with artistic installations that invite visitors to reflect on the planet’s future and the environmental challenges we face.

WEG’s participation in COP30 goes beyond supporting the exhibition. The company will also play a leading role in the energy transition agenda, presenting case studies and solutions in thematic panels reflecting its sustainability strategy based on four pillars: energy efficiency, operational efficiency, renewable energies and electric mobility.

This journey begins even before the official opening of COP30. Onboard sailing boats Kat and Aysso, which form part of the Voice of the Oceans mission, WEG will showcase sustainable onboard solutions, contributing clean and efficient technologies that support environmentally conscious navigation.

The sustainable sailing boat Kat arrived in Belém in early November and docked at the pier of Casa das Onze Janelas, welcoming visitors at scheduled times for guided and interactive experiences.

WEG’ acts as Co-Chair of the COP Energy Transition Working Group (SBCOP), an initiative led by the Brazilian National Confederation of Industry (CNI) that brings together national and international organisations to strengthen the role of the productive sector in climate discussions. WEG is represented by Daniel Godinho, Director of Sustainability and Institutional Relations.

Among the programme highlights, WEG will present the Association of Agro-Extractive Workers of Ilha das Cinzas (ATAIC) case, a community-based agroindustry in the Amazon operating 100 percent on clean energy (solar and BESS batteries), in partnership with Natura. The project promotes a reduction in diesel use, lower costs and carbon emissions and a positive social and economic impact for riverside communities.

The company will also participate in the Virada Sustentável initiative with the Boat of Hope, which sailed from Manaus to Belém between 4 and 7 November, and will be docked at COP30 from 10 to 21 November.

The vessel will host 250 guests, including business leaders, experts, public sector representatives and civil society to discuss environmental preservation and the energy transition.

Overall U.S. wholesale electricity prices are expected to continue rising next year, the Energy Information Administration said in its latest short-term energy outlook, published Wednesday.

The agency forecast the load-weighted average of the 11 regional wholesale prices it tracks to be $47/MWh in 2025 — 23% higher than the 2024 average — and to reach $51/MWh in 2026, another 8.5% increase.

Driving the rise in wholesale prices next year is primarily a projected 45% increase at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas-North pricing hub. “Natural gas prices tend to be the biggest determinant of power prices,” the EIA said. “But in 2026, the increase in power prices in ERCOT tends to reflect large hourly spikes in the summer months due to high demand combined with relatively low supply in this region.”

Dive Insight:

As prices go up, demand is also rising, EIA said, with much of it concentrated in the West South Central region that includes Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas, as a result of “data centers and cryptocurrency mining facilities,” it said.

Electricity sales are set to increase across the U.S. by 2.4% in 2025 and 2.6% in 2026. But in the West South Central region, sales will grow 4.4% in 2025 and 9.2% in 2026, due in large part to commercial customers.

The increases in Texas and nearby states “contribute 34% of the growth in U.S. electricity sales in 2025 and 66% of the growth in U.S. electricity sales in 2026,” the report said.

Some price increases can be attributed to fuel costs. Natural gas prices are forecast to rise to an average of almost $3.90/MMBtu this winter and an average of $4/MMBtu in 2026, “primarily due to increased liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports amid flat production growth.”

The EIA forecasts U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide emissions to increase by 1.8% in 2025, followed by a decrease of 0.7% in 2026.

“The largest changes in emissions for both years are attributable to shifting coal consumption for power generation,” it said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/-IptqRhrKcXsFjUyORmVSEjFKTIb4oZhxE6balPVTgo/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Ob3ZlbWJlcl9zaG9ydC10ZXJtX2VuZXJneV9vdXRsb29rX0VJQS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-11-13 13:01:18.125558

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has released a proposed rule that would amend the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Section 8(a)(7) PFAS Reporting and Recordkeeping Rule, originally finalized on October 11, 2023. The proposal responds to widespread industry criticism over the rule’s broad scope and reporting burden, particularly for companies lacking knowledge of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) content in imported goods or low-volume mixtures. Most critically, the proposed amendments introduce targeted exemptions, technical clarifications, and an abbreviated reporting window designed to reduce compliance costs while still enabling EPA to collect meaningful PFAS manufacturing data. This shift reflects EPA efforts to balance data collection with administrative practicality—streamlining compliance, clarifying key provisions, and reducing unnecessary costs while maintaining the integrity of PFAS reporting.

Key Exemptions to Reporting Requirements

EPA’s proposal would add several categorical exemptions that significantly narrow the universe of entities subject to reporting.

De Minimis Exemption. PFAS present below a concentration of 0.1 percent in a mixture or article would be exempt, regardless of total annual volume. The agency explained that such concentrations are unlikely to represent meaningful exposure or risk and that the exemption would align PFAS reporting with other TSCA chemical data collection standards.

Imported Articles. Imported articles containing PFAS would be excluded from reporting obligations. EPA noted that importers typically lack “known or reasonably ascertainable” information about PFAS content in complex articles, and compelling such reporting would impose substantial burdens with limited informational value.

By-Products, Impurities, and Non-isolated Intermediates. PFAS unintentionally manufactured as by-products or impurities—or formed as non-isolated intermediates during a reaction sequence—would be exempt if not used for commercial purposes. This exemption recognizes that many such substances are generated in trace amounts incidental to manufacturing processes.

Research and Development (R&D) Chemicals. PFAS manufactured in small quantities solely for R&D would be excluded from reporting. EPA reaffirmed that R&D-only production poses minimal potential for exposure or environmental release and that tracking these quantities adds little value to the agency’s data objectives.

Technical Corrections and Clarifications

The proposal also includes several technical and procedural updates aimed at improving clarity and consistency in reporting. For example, EPA proposes to clarify the data elements required in specific fields of the TSCA § 8(a)(7) reporting form and to correct minor inconsistencies that appeared in the 2023 final rule. The agency would revise the submission period, establishing a three-month reporting window beginning 60 days after the effective date of the final rule, rather than the six-month period previously adopted. EPA anticipates that the reduced time frame will streamline implementation and align reporting schedules with other TSCA data collection efforts. In addition, the proposal clarifies how submitters should employ the OECD Harmonized Template (OHT) when reporting environmental and health-effects data. The OHT format is intended to facilitate international data comparability and electronic submission through EPA’s Central Data Exchange (CDX) portal.

Economic Impact and Burden Reduction

EPA estimates that the proposed revisions would yield a net industry burden reduction of 10 million–11 million hours, translating to $786 million–$843 million in cost savings compared to the 2023 rule. Much of this reduction results from exempting imported articles and de minimis concentrations, which were previously expected to generate substantial compliance costs for companies with limited PFAS information. The agency explained that the amendments aim to “lessen the economic impact of the TSCA and better allow EPA to carry out the statute in a reasonable and prudent manner.” By exempting entities least likely to possess relevant data, EPA seeks to preserve the quality of collected information while avoiding disproportionate burdens on small businesses and downstream users.

Legal Rationale and Statutory Context

EPA’s preamble references both the plain language of TSCA § 8(a)(7) and stakeholder feedback as justification for adopting exemptions. The agency noted that § 8(a)(7) differs from other TSCA reporting provisions because it lacks an explicit statutory purpose directing EPA’s use of the PFAS data. In contrast, § 8(b)(10) explicitly instructs EPA to compile and act on a mercury inventory.

Because Congress did not define how PFAS information under § 8(a)(7) must be used, EPA concluded that it has discretion to balance information gathering with administrative feasibility. Many commenters argued that the expected informational benefits did not justify the extreme reporting costs, particularly for sectors without PFAS expertise or supply-chain visibility. EPA therefore determined that a “reasonable and prudent” implementation required a narrower scope.

This reasoning may invite further debate during the public comment period, as environmental groups could challenge whether the proposed exemptions conflict with TSCA’s overarching goal of ensuring that EPA possesses adequate chemical data to evaluate risks. Nevertheless, EPA emphasized that the amendments retain the “majority” of PFAS manufacture reporting requirements, maintaining comprehensive coverage of intentional PFAS producers.

Public Comment and Next Steps

EPA is soliciting public comment on every major component of the proposal, and comments will be accepted for 30 days after publication in the Federal Register. Following the review of stakeholder input, EPA may modify or finalize the exemptions and clarifications in a subsequent final rule.

Entities potentially affected, such as chemical manufacturers, importers, and article assemblers, should review the proposed text carefully and assess whether their PFAS reporting obligations could change. Companies that previously prepared submissions under the 2023 rule may find their compliance burden significantly reduced, but they should remain attentive to recordkeeping obligations and any retained requirements for intentional PFAS manufacture.

Conclusion

EPA’s proposed amendments represent a notable shift toward risk-based pragmatism in the federal government’s PFAS data-collection efforts. By introducing de minimis and imported-article exemptions, clarifying reporting procedures, and shortening the submission window, EPA seeks to balance transparency with economic feasibility. Whether these revisions ultimately withstand stakeholder scrutiny will depend on the agency’s ability to demonstrate that streamlined reporting can still achieve TSCA’s goal of providing EPA with sufficient information to manage PFAS risks “in a reasonable and prudent manner.”

We have been fighting for nearly a year to protect jobs and keep energy costs affordable in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, and now time is running out. If the State Senate does not act before the end of the year, a recent decision by an Administrative Law Judge could raise energy costs for residents and put hundreds of Steelworker jobs at the Tilden Mine in danger.

Here is what is at stake:

On October 27, a judge issued a recommendation on Upper Michigan Energy Resources’ plan to expand renewable energy. This recommendation would harm customers in the Upper Peninsula (usw.to/5i9).

Future energy cases could bring even higher increases, making energy unaffordable for families and threatening nearly 900 Steelworker jobs at the Tilden Mine.

The judge recommended approval of the plan for 2026 and 2027. This means Tilden Mine would pay 5.3 million dollars more in 2026 and 6.4 million dollars more in 2027, mostly for a solar project that does not benefit the mine.

The company proposed adding over 1,300 megawatts of renewable energy and battery storage over the next ten years at a cost of 4.3 billion dollars to local energy customers.

All Upper Peninsula customers would see 10.6 million dollars in extra charges in 2026 and 12.9 million dollars in 2027, with these costs starting to be collected in January 2026.

The Senate must act now by passing House Bills 4007 and 4283, bipartisan bills that already passed the House. These bills would fix Michigan’s Clean Energy Law and stop the crushing costs that could devastate the U.P. economy.

This is about people, not politics. Lawmakers on both sides already came together in the House. Now the Senate must finish the job before the end of the year. Senators McMorrow and McCann can help make that happen.

As U.S.–China tensions escalate, General Motors is steering its suppliers toward a full exit from China by 2027.

By Felecia Stratton | November 13, 2025

When one of Detroit’s big three automakers tells thousands of its suppliers to get out of China, logistics and supply-chain professionals sit up and take notice. That’s exactly what GM is reportedly doing: setting a hard deadline of 2027 for many of its parts suppliers to eliminate China from their sourcing playbook.

According to multiple reports, GM began nudging suppliers in late 2024 and escalated the directive in 2025 as U.S.–China trade storms intensified amid the Trump Administration’s tariff policies. The move is part of a broader effort by the automaker to bolster resiliency in its supply chain, given the fact that global sourcing ties have grown long, complex, and vulnerable.

As a result, GM suppliers of raw materials and parts—from lighting assemblies to electronics modules and rare-earth components—are being asked to reconfigure long-standing networks and explore non-China sourcing alternatives.

Braking for Impact

GM’s pivot means lanes, loads, and lead times are all in motion. As suppliers work to shift sourcing from China to regions like Mexico, Vietnam, and India, inbound freight patterns will change, forcing teams to validate new routes, carriers, and customs processes.

Suppliers are also likely to build buffer inventory and dual-source parts to hedge against disruption, which could ripple into higher warehouse demand and increased domestic transport volumes.

Meanwhile, new sourcing regions bring fresh visibility challenges. Ensuring that rerouted shipments still hit just-in-time delivery windows will require tighter coordination across 3PLs, forwarders, and manufacturers.

A Sign of the Times?

GM’s push to decouple from China isn’t an isolated tactic, it may be a bellwether for the wider industry. As auto supply chains rewire, logistics teams at every level—from Tier 1 carriers to material-handlers—should gear up for stratified sourcing destinations, greater regional complexity and tighter synchronization.

4 Takeaways for Logistics and Supply Chain Teams:

Network redesign ahead. GM’s directive signals major reconsideration of one of the world’s deepest supply-chain wells. China has long supplied everything from custom tool-and-die sets to electronics modules for vehicles built in North America. Suppliers now must rapidly reroute—or rebuild—supply chain links. “In some cases this has been 20 or 30 years in the making, and we’re trying to undo it in a few years,” Vehicle Suppliers Association head Collin Shaw told The Times of India.

Cost and timing pressures mount. Reshoring or nearshoring parts production isn’t simply plug-and-play. Suppliers face new capital investment, logistics rerouting, and the risk of parts shortages or launch delays during transition. The directive to “deliver alternatives by 2027” means shorter execution timelines than typical multi-year sourcing shifts.

Regionalization and geo-optimization. GM reportedly prefers sourcing parts from within the same region where vehicles are built, especially for its North American vehicle base. This could mean increased production and logistics activity in North America and allied regions, while sourcing footprints in China shrink.

Strategic leverage and geopolitical hedging. GM’s move is as much about reducing geopolitical exposure as it is about operations. Steering clear of China content helps shield the automaker from trade volatility, tariffs, rare-earth supply risks, and sudden export restrictions.

The energy agencies are adjusting their forecasts even as they still do not agree but all seem to be moving closer to the oil balance center. Still OPEC and the report was bearish for oil but very bullish for natural gas. The Fox Weather says our weather is changing. That will add even more excitement as we digest all the conflicting data we get from the EIA, the IEA and OPEC with seeming different outlooks or perhaps just different agendas.

Oil prices took a nosedive on Wednesday as OPEC tossed out its earlier deficit forecast and now says the global market is headed for balance in 2026. OPEC made the change because they say that non-OPEC producers—like the U.S., Brazil, and Guyana—keep cranking out more supply, pushing inventories back up. So much for those carbon targets, eh Brazil? Maybe cut down another rain forest so we can land some more private jets.

OPEC’s crystal ball does not exactly predict world swimming in oil. OPEC also says that global thirst for crude will hitting 106.2 million barrels daily, but even that can’t flip the OPEC script to a deficit. So, OPEC’s October prediction of a supply deficit has been replaced by a forecast of a perception so supply and demand being in balance and one with the universe, I guess.

The Energy Information Administration is seeing even more barrels sloshing around out there than OPEC, but in true government fashion, they’ve gone and bumped up their price and demand forecast anyway. According to the EIA, global oil inventories are on track to keep rising through 2026—which should be a recipe for lower prices. Yet, Brent crude is now pegged to average $54 a barrel in the first quarter of 2026 and $55 for the full year. That’s a $3 jump from last month’s call, and you can chalk it up to a couple of plot twists: China’s inventory growth isn’t as wild as first thought, and those Russian sanctions are still mucking up the math. So, while we keep looking for their predicted oil glut, their price outlook is still climbing.

While low prices are good, it’s not necessarily good for US shale oil production. Are low prices starting to cure low prices? Is it possible that the Energy Information Administration’s latest STEO signals that oil production from the US Lower 48—primarily driven by shale—has reached its peak? What could this mean for the future of American energy? Is this just a temporary plateau, or are we witnessing a turning point in the shale revolution? Of course the shale revolution will not end as long as prices are high enough to support it. The US energy engineer is the best in the world and they can meet every challenge but one of the challenges that they can’t are low prices. Yet with the reduction of inflation and tariffs that should make it easier for shale oil producers to keep producing.

Where the shale revolution was truly most amazing was in transforming the U.S. natural gas market from a devastating production peak and shortage to an abundance unlike anything the world has ever seen. From almost no supply to becoming the largest producer globally, with upward production projections that are nearly unimaginable. While U.S. energy producers can increase output even further and are already setting record production levels, what the Energy Information Administration says about the market is one of the reasons we’re seeing supportive prices. In fact, that might not be a bad thing, because U.S. energy producers need higher prices to keep those drills running.

Remember when the U.S. used to be at the mercy of the world for natural gas? Well, those days are long gone. Now, thanks to American ingenuity, we’re shipping liquefied natural gas (LNG) to every corner of the globe. The Energy Information Administration says U.S. LNG exports will rocket to 14.9 billion cubic feet per day this year—a jaw-dropping 25% jump over last year. Give a tip of your hard hat to Plaquemines LNG in Louisiana, which fired up exports faster than anyone expected, forcing the EIA to hike its fourth-quarter export forecast by 3% compared to last month. And it’s not stopping there—U.S. LNG exports are on track to surge another 10% in 2026. The U.S. isn’t just meeting domestic needs; we’re powering the world’s furnaces, one super-cooled shipment at a time.

The Energy Information Administration also looking at the America’s power surge as it moves to win the global AI race. Electricity demand in the U.S. is off the charts, and if you think it’s over, it may just be getting started. The EIA says that sales of electricity to end-users are set to jump a wild 2.4% in 2025 and another 2.6% in 2026. And if you want to see where the real action is, look no further than the West South Central—yes, Texas, I’m looking at you. Thanks to a boom in data centers and the relentless power appetite of cryptocurrency miners, this region’s electric meters are spinning like slot machines in Vegas. Forget the grid of the past—America’s energy future is being built one server room and mining rig at a time!

Fox Weather is predicting record high temperatures expected for 200+ million Americans after early week polar plunge. They say that after a pre-winter arctic blast set more than 70 record low temperatures across the eastern U.S. earlier this week, a major warmup is on the way, with parts of the Heartland expected to surpass the 80-degree mark by the weekend. So, turn off the heater and turn on the AC. Regardless of the weather, it will still burn natural gas. Yet the real key is December.

Europe posted the most notable growth among major markets, buoyed by increased uptake in Germany, France and the United Kingdom. Although sales moderated slightly after a record-breaking September, confidence remains high as the European Union pushes forward with new battery manufacturing initiatives.

China retained its position as the world’s largest EV market, accounting for more than half of global sales. Rho Motion’s analysis covers both fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Charles Lester, the firm’s data manager, emphasised that the cost gap between electric and petrol-powered cars is far narrower in China than in Europe or North America, making EVs more attainable for Chinese consumers.

In stark contrast, North American sales slumped by 41% compared to previous months. This downturn followed record highs in late summer and was largely driven by the expiry of a $7 500 tax credit (R128 000). Lester noted that battery-electric models remain considerably more expensive than equivalent internal combustion vehicles in the United States, dampening demand.

China led with approximately 1.3 million units sold. Europe recorded a 36% increase to 372,786 vehicles, while North America fell to 100 370 units. Other regions collectively saw a 37% rise, reaching 141 368 vehicles.

Looking ahead, Lester expects Europe’s year-to-date growth to hold firm, with strong sales anticipated through December. He also predicts continued strength in China, as buyers rush to take advantage of a full tax exemption before it is reduced to 50% for new energy vehicles.",https://dealerfloor.co.za/assets/gallery/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/25GlobalSales1.jpg?mtime=1763030339,N,,2025-11-13 16:00:44.924282

""We are very pleased with the way contracting is going and we have lot of interest from people wanting to sign up for capacity,"" Chief Commercial Officer Sheridan Swords said on a webcast of a fireside chat at the B of A Securities Global Energy Conference 2025. ""The big competitive advantage is the location and the customers understand that and they value the closeness to open water where you take a lot of risk out of the fog.""

In early 2025, as part of expanding its integrated NGL value chain in the US, ONEOK said it had entered into agreements to build a new 400,000 b/d LPG export terminal in Texas City, Texas and a new 24-inch pipeline from the company's Mont Belvieu, Texas, storage facility to the new terminal.

ONEOK is 50% partner, along with MPLX holding the remaining 50% interest, in Texas Logistics that is building and operating the planned terminal that is targeted for completion early 2028.

The loading throughput is expected to be primarily low ethane propane (LEP) and normal butane (NC4), with ONEOK and MPLX each contractually reserving 200,000-b/d for their respective customers, ONEOK said early this year.

Last quarter, ONEOK handled a total of 1.574 million b/d of NGL in the US, with volumes from the Permian and the Gulf Coast standing at 567,000 b/d, the company said in its earnings release late October.

More time sought for Sun Belt Connector

Separately, the company has extended the binding open season to Dec. 5 to gauge customer interest in a proposed 440-mile refined products pipeline from Texas to Arizona, he said.

""We have a lot of interest in it, but we had a couple of people who wanted to look at this other option as they go forward and we have given our customers some more time to evaluate this,"" Swords said.

The project would connect refined products with Houston and southern Oklahoma origins to El Paso, Texas, and Phoenix-area destinations through new pipeline construction by Sun Belt Connector, according to the company's Sept. 8 announcement.

The initiative targets transportation of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel with potential service beginning in mid-to-late 2029, subject to final investment decisions and regulatory approvals, it said then.

The Sept. 8 announcement of an open season for the Sunbelt Connector, a 200,000 b/d refined products pipeline, will give the company access to the Southwest refined products market, which is in danger of being underserved with the closure of California refining capacity, which is expected to shift the region's refined products flows.

The proposed system would originate from Magellan's East Houston Terminal in Harris County, Texas, and Southern Oklahoma facilities in Garvin County, delivering to Sun Belt Connector's Phoenix Terminal in Maricopa County, Arizona, and Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport or connecting pre-airfield terminals.

Much like the international markets, market conditions are softening, capacity is stable and underwriting appetite is increasing moderately, which is fuelling the competitive pressures to maintain and grow market share among underwriters in the region. Without any major losses since our last review in April, upstream energy companies with good loss histories can expect rate reductions of 5%-15%.

Regulatory changes are holding the door open for upstream energy companies to ramp up operations and exploration in oil and gas, but an uptick in activity needs to be addressed with a responsive and tailored risk strategy.

The downstream energy property market remains competitive

In the downstream refining and chemicals sector, echoes from the international downstream energy insurance market aren’t quite stretching to the U.S.. Headline losses from refinery fires are not impacting premium reductions. Major losses have been covered by catastrophe bonds, and the downstream energy property insurance market fin North America has maintained its profitability streak.

“Several hurricanes in the last five years have ranked among the costliest in U.S. history”, but largely due to a benign 2025 hurricane season, underwriting profitability is cascading through the commercial market—even in typically catastrophe-prone areas such as the Gulf Coast. In some cases, aggressive reductions of 20% can be achieved, but renewals are achieving 10-15% reductions on average. A strong loss history remains a core factor in the rate reductions available.

Without any withdrawals from the market, capacity remains stable and placements are oversubscribed, keeping competitive forces at play.

Accurate asset valuation and transparent risk management remain prerequisites for smooth renewals.

U.S. casualty

In 2025, the North American energy casualty market has faced varying conditions across different sectors.

Primary liability market capacity is stable. Manageable primary limits, risk-transfer attachment points, and ample overall capacity has kept capacity stable across the primary liability market, including workers’ compensation (WC), general liability (GL), and auto liability (AL). Most sectors are experiencing flat-rated WC and GL renewals in 2025, although carriers have pushed for low single-digit rate increases on GL. AL remains the lone exception, continuing to see high single-digit to low double-digit rate increases due to claims inflation and increase in litigated claims.

General liability rates for upstream, midstream/downstream and chemical segments are seeing low single-digit increases or flat renewals. After the uptick in primary liability/lead umbrella capacity in 2024, some uncertainty remains in 2025 for offshore operators regarding available domestic capacity, as most of the capacity is now coming from the London market.

Workers' compensation remains profitable and stable for most sectors, with small rate increases requested at renewal. This line of business has kept many overall primary liability portfolios profitable for many carriers, offsetting the increasing pressure of social inflation on the AL and GL. OFS companies and industrial contractors are seeing larger rate increases if they have negative loss records, driven by an uptick in severity of workplace injuries.

Auto liability profitability is still a significant challenge for primary insurers after an uptick in litigated auto claims and settlements, particularly in areas like the Permian Basin, Louisiana, and South Texas. A well-funded plaintiff’s bar continues to focus on commercial auto litigation, and accident frequency continues to trend upwards for many insured in the energy industry.

Excess liability market (lead umbrella and first $25 million of programs) is impacted by claims inflation, causing lead umbrella carriers to focus on acceptable limits and more conservative premiums. Lead umbrella capacity remains limited for many industries, with a key market reducing lead capacity from $10 million to $5 million on energy risks. Capacity within the first $25 million remains cautious due to lawsuit abuse issues in the U.S..

Excess liability market (above $25 million) capacity remains stable, with most segments seeing a surplus of options in both the domestic and London markets. While the domestic excess liability market appears to be contracting somewhat, the London market has stepped in to fill the void in 2025.

Trends to watch in 2026

Contractor injuries/limits: Most of the larger claims impacting excess liability carriers continue to center around workplace injuries sustained by contractors.

Continued underwriting focus on fleet safety programs: As a result of the increase in AL settlements, insurers are paying closer attention to buyers’ fleet safety programs.",https://media.wtwco.com/-/media/WTW/Social-Brand-Refresh/custom-refresh2/2025/11/from-fires-to-forever-chemicals-SM.PNG?modified=20251113142117&imgeng=meta_true,N,,2025-11-13 14:01:38.499156

LIBERTY, N.C. — Toyota (NYSE: TM) has begun production at its new $13.9 billion battery plant in Liberty, approximately 20 miles southeast of Greensboro, N.C. The 7 million-square-foot facility, which broke ground in 2021, is Toyota’s first and only battery plant outside of Japan and the company’s 11th U.S. plant.

Toyota will also make an additional investment of up to $10 billion over the next five years to “support future mobility efforts,” according to company representatives. Toyota has invested nearly $60 billion since the company began its U.S. operations nearly 70 years ago.

“Toyota is a pioneer in electrified vehicles, and the company’s significant manufacturing investment in the United States and North Carolina further solidifies our commitment to team members, customers, dealers, communities and suppliers,” says Ted Ogawa, president and CEO of Toyota Motor North America (TMNA).

Toyota North Carolina is expected to create as many as 5,100 jobs.

“This new facility will bring new opportunities and long-term growth to our state. It’s another sign that North Carolina continues to lead the way in manufacturing and innovation,” adds U.S. Representative Richard Hudson of North Carolina.

The 1,850-acre site can produce 30 gigawatt-hours (GWh) annually at full capacity and will serve as Toyota’s hub for developing and producing lithium-ion batteries needed for its electrified vehicles.

The plant will house 14 battery production lines that support hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Additional production lines at Toyota North Carolina are set to launch by 2030.

Batteries assembled at Toyota North Carolina will power the Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, RAV4 HEV and a yet-to-be-announced all-electric BEV — the first of its kind for Toyota to be manufactured domestically. The plant currently ships HEV modules to both Toyota Motor Manufacturing in Kentucky and Mazda Toyota Manufacturing in Alabama.

Upon completion of construction, the new facility will feature a range of amenities for its employees, including onsite childcare, a pharmacy, medical clinic and fitness center.

Toyota has sold more than 6.6 million hybrid, plug-in hybrid, fuel cell and BEVs in the United States since 2000.

Toyota’s stock closed at $205.02 per share on Thursday, Nov. 13, up from $172.35 a share a year ago, a nearly 19 percent increase.

The GEAR report parses diverse policy perspectives around the future of gas and gas infrastructure expansion, NARUC said.
Recommendations include: creation of a natural gas “readiness forum”; development of additional gas pipeline infrastructure and gas storage opportunities; new and enhanced market tools to improve supplier performance in extreme weather; demand response initiatives for gas utilities; and market changes to incentivize gas pipeline capacity releases.
There was some support for the formation of a Gas Reliability Organization, similar to the North American Electric Reliability Corp., but not enough to advance the recommendation, the GEAR report noted.
“The biggest challenge affecting interoperability across the systems is not operational; it is economic,” the Reliability Alliance said in a statement, The group consists of the Electric Power Supply Association, Interstate Natural Gas Association of America and Natural Gas Supply Association.","Dive Brief:

The United States needs additional natural gas pipeline infrastructure and storage opportunities to reliably meet the growing demand for energy, a National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners task force report concluded on Wednesday.

NARUC’s Gas-Electric Alignment for Reliability task force, or GEAR, was formed in 2023 in an effort to improve coordination between the two interwoven energy sectors, with an ultimate goal of bolstering grid reliability.

The report includes nine recommendations but stopped short of advocating for a Gas Reliability Organization akin to electric grid efforts, and concluded changes to the gas-electric market day and force majeure contract provisions were unnecessary.

Dive Insight:

Rising electricity demand, extreme weather and a reliance on gas-fired generation has at times left the power sector scrambling when necessary fuel was not available.

During Winter Storm Uri in February 2021, some Texas electric companies cut power to gas production and transportation facilities as part of their emergency conservation response. That reduced fuel supplies to gas-fired power plants, contributing to energy shortages and blackouts. Almost 250 people in Texas died in the storm.

And in 2022, unplanned generator outages reached 90,500 MW during Winter Storm Elliott, with gas fuel supply issues accounting for 20% of unplanned generating unit outages, derates and failures to start, according to the North American Electric Reliability Corp.

The GEAR report parses diverse policy perspectives around the future of gas and gas infrastructure expansion, NARUC said. However, task force participants found common ground “on the need for harmonization between the electric and natural gas sectors to ensure reliable and affordable electricity service,” the report said.

“The need for harmonization is crucial, regardless of one’s long-term perspective about future energy policy in various regions of the country,” it said.

Recommendations include: creation of a natural gas “readiness forum”; development of additional gas pipeline infrastructure and gas storage opportunities; new and enhanced market tools to improve supplier performance in extreme weather; demand response initiatives for gas utilities; and market changes to incentivize gas pipeline capacity releases.

Regulators and grid operators “should apply a strategic approach to expand opportunities for increased or new storage investment consistent with empowering end-users to exert greater control over supply needs,” the report found.

There was some support for the formation of a Gas Reliability Organization, similar to the North American Electric Reliability Corp., but not enough to advance the recommendation, the GEAR report noted. “A majority of members [concluded] that such an option (on a national, regional or state basis) is unnecessary or not the best means to efficiently enhance gas-electric reliability,” it said.

Similarly, discussions around aligning the timing of gas or electric days were not advanced. Gas and electric market schedules are typically several hours apart, though the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has historically tried to better align them.

“While it is obvious that the current bifurcated system is not how anyone would design the combined system from scratch, we are unaware of any systemwide outage that has occurred due to scheduling issues or mismatches,” the report said.

And possible changes to standard force majeure contract provisions, which cover supply disruptions, were found to be “neither viable nor productive,” the report said.

The task force noted that the primary driver for changes to the force majeure provisions “is aimed at expanded winterization of the production system,” and noted there are two recommendations that “facilitate a better understanding of force majeure and provide greater opportunities to mitigate its use.”

The recommendations provide an “ideal starting point for state regulators to ponder future steps to enhance reliability,” Dwight Keen, vice chair of the GEAR working group, said in a statement. Keen is also a regulator with the Kansas Corporation Commission.

A coalition of gas-electric groups supported the report’s findings. “The biggest challenge affecting interoperability across the systems is not operational; it is economic,” the Reliability Alliance said in a statement,

The group consists of the Electric Power Supply Association, Interstate Natural Gas Association of America and Natural Gas Supply Association.

“Competitive power suppliers have invested significantly to strengthen winter readiness, but we need continued alignment between gas and electric systems,” EPSA President and CEO Todd Snitchler said in a statement. “That’s the measure of success we’re all working toward, and GEAR’s work has been an important step to bridge that gap.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/wUPJ3t0M9_xbY0IU7rUaEhhstO1CIX5CDi86trFxZIc/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy01MjUzMzk5NzMuanBn.webp,N,,2025-11-13 13:01:23.511619

Speaking to PV Tech, the company’s CEO Louise Hurll emphasises the need for Australia to bolster its domestic solar manufacturing capabilities.
Building an end-to-end solar manufacturing supply chain is becoming a strategic imperative for Australia,” she says.
“The Solar Sunshot Programme funding is fundamental to establishing solar manufacturing in Australia.
“Our goal is to demonstrate that advanced solar manufacturing can thrive in Australia, combining technical excellence, low-carbon production, and reliable delivery,” she adds.","In September 2025, ARENA launched the second round of the AU$1billion programme, allocating AU$150 million to further support domestic manufacturing and scale-up projects.

Among the companies selected in the first round was Stellar PV, a Queensland-based silicon ingot and wafer manufacturing start-up. Speaking to PV Tech, the company’s CEO Louise Hurll emphasises the need for Australia to bolster its domestic solar manufacturing capabilities.

“Today, more than 90% of the world’s polysilicon and 98% of its wafers – key building blocks of photovoltaic cells – are produced in China. Building an end-to-end solar manufacturing supply chain is becoming a strategic imperative for Australia,” she says.

Hurll believes the Solar Sunshot Programme is helping lay the foundation for a competitive domestic solar manufacturing industry, not just in terms of financial backing, but as a statement of intent: “The Solar Sunshot Programme marks a turning point for Australia’s solar industry, building on our strengths in research and deployment to develop home-grown manufacturing capability.”

From raw materials to finished products

Australia’s current position in the solar value chain is primarily as a raw materials supplier. “We ship our quartz overseas to be processed. By the time it returns to us in the form of finished solar panels, its value has multiplied many times over,” Hurll explains. “The programme is a transformational opportunity for Australia to move from being a consumer of clean technology to a global supplier.”

Through the Solar Sunshot Programme, ARENA is providing funding and production credits to help projects like Stellar PV’s progress from feasibility to commercialisation. The company has already received AU$4.7 million from ARENA to conduct a feasibility study for a 2GW silicon ingot and wafer facility in Townsville, Queensland.

“The Solar Sunshot Programme funding is fundamental to establishing solar manufacturing in Australia. Private investment alone would not be viable for several reasons,” Hurll emphasises. “Our ARENA-funded feasibility study has been critical in understanding the true costs and financial structure needed to establish manufacturing here. We could not have progressed this far without that support.”

She adds that government backing also provides “vital validation that helps attract private investors who see government as a committed partner in de-risking the project”.

Learning from global manufacturing models

Hurll highlights that every successful solar manufacturing nation has relied on strong government intervention to reach scale. “China’s dominance was built on decades of industrial policy, from low-cost energy and land access to preferential loans, tax incentives and direct support for manufacturing expansion,” she says.

The United States’ Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has further reshaped the competitive landscape, offering up to US$12 per square metre in production tax credits for solar products. Australia’s Solar Sunshot Programme, Hurll notes, “is now positioned to provide a similar kind of investment support and production credits that can accelerate our entry into large-scale solar manufacturing markets”.

While cost competition with China remains difficult, she believes Australia can carve out a niche based on sustainability, transparency and high performance. “Australia is well positioned to compete on both sustainability and cost, supported by abundant renewable energy and growing global demand for traceable, low-carbon materials.”

Stellar PV: From feasibility to full-scale production

The company’s feasibility study, due to be completed by mid-2026, will deliver a bankable engineering and business plan to guide construction, with production expected to begin in late 2028, Hurll says.

The company’s facility will employ the Czochralski (Cz) method for ingot pulling, the global standard for photovoltaic-grade silicon, and the diamond wire sawing process for wafering. Both technologies are mature, efficient and align with Stellar PV’s focus on sustainability.

“The technology itself is not the barrier; these processes are mature and well understood. The challenge lies in building the industrial and economic capability to support them,” she adds.

Polysilicon production and crystal growth, Hurll highlights, are capital- and energy-intensive processes that require specialised expertise and strong policy certainty. “Establishing them in Australia will require coordinated investment, long-term policy certainty and access to affordable renewable energy,” Hurll says.

Stellar PV’s Townsville site’s access to low-cost, behind-the-grid renewable electricity, combined with co-location near Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners’ planned polysilicon facility, creates “ideal conditions for supply chain integration and a strong competitive advantage,” she emphasises.

Initially, polysilicon may be imported from trusted international producers, but Stellar PV intends to transition to domestic supply as soon as local production is ready.

Stellar PV also aims to achieve a green price premium for its wafers by offering verified low-carbon and fully traceable manufacturing. “By combining transparency, certification and technical performance, we aim to position our wafers as a trusted, premium input for manufacturers seeking cleaner and more traceable supply chains,” Hurll explains.

Townville facility and its ‘stellar’ future

Automation will be central to the facility’s operations, but Stellar PV is equally focused on workforce development. The company expects to create a high-skill, regionally based workforce in North Queensland, contributing to economic diversification and long-term community benefits.

“Automation will play a major role in managing high-precision processes, but the human workforce remains central,” Hurll says. “We are building local capability through training, apprenticeships and continuous upskilling, ensuring automation enhances rather than replaces local employment.”

By 2030, Stellar PV aims to be a global benchmark for sustainable wafer manufacturing, exporting to US and European markets while helping build an integrated Australian solar supply chain.

“Our goal is to demonstrate that advanced solar manufacturing can thrive in Australia, combining technical excellence, low-carbon production, and reliable delivery,” she adds. “This is about proving that Australia can compete in advanced low-emissions manufacturing on the world stage.”

Thanks to federal energy-efficiency incentives, homeowners can currently save thousands of dollars on new HVAC systems. But there’s a catch: these valuable tax credits expire on December 31, 2025, and your new system must be installed by that date to qualify.

That deadline might sound far away, but the reality is very different. With demand for qualified installers, potential delays in scheduling, and the complexity of ordering equipment, waiting too long could mean missing out on significant savings.

What’s at stake: Up to $2,600 in tax credits

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, homeowners who invest in energy-efficient upgrades, including qualifying HVAC systems, may be eligible for federal tax credits worth up to $2,600. These credits directly reduce your tax liability, which means money back in your pocket at tax time.

With a new Hisense HVAC system, you’re not only investing in comfort and performance, you’re also ensuring your home is eligible for these savings. Many Hisense models meet or exceed the efficiency standards required for federal credits, giving you both peace of mind and a financial advantage.

But after December 31, 2025, these credits disappear. If you’ve been waiting to replace an aging furnace, air conditioner, or heat pump, delaying could mean paying full price without the benefit of these generous incentives.

Why you need to plan ahead

It’s not enough to simply buy a new system before the deadline. The installation must be complete by December 31, 2025, to claim the tax credit. This end-of-year date is why many homeowners are caught off guard.

Most people wait until their system breaks down to schedule a replacement. By then, installers are often booked solid, especially during peak heating and cooling seasons. Combine that with supply chain delays or limited equipment availability, and suddenly, the end of 2025 isn’t so far away.

The smartest move is to schedule an estimate now with a trusted Hisense HVAC dealer. That gives you time to explore your options, compare systems, and lock in your installation well before the rush. Check out these local HVAC dealers:

The hidden costs of waiting

Beyond losing out on tax credits, delaying a replacement can cost you in other ways:

Higher energy bills: Older, less efficient systems use more energy, which means monthly utility costs that add up.

Unexpected breakdowns: HVAC systems tend to fail on the hottest or coldest days of the year, leaving you scrambling for emergency service.

Limited availability: As the deadline nears, demand will surge. The later you wait, the harder it will be to find a qualified contractor with time on their schedule.

Why choose Hisense HVAC

Hisense is a global leader in home comfort, offering efficient, reliable, and innovative HVAC solutions for every type of home. With Hisense, you’re choosing advanced technology designed for year-round comfort and the efficiency levels that help you maximize today’s federal tax credits.

Act now before the deadline

Replacing your HVAC system is an investment in your home’s comfort, efficiency, and value. With Hisense HVAC and federal tax credits still available, you have a rare opportunity to offset the cost and maximize your savings. But time is running out.

Remember: the system must be installed, not just purchased, by December 31, 2025. Schedule your consultation today with a Hisense HVAC professional, secure your spot on the installation calendar, and lock in your savings before the window closes.

After December 31, 2025, the opportunity is gone, and so are the savings.

Jeremy Furr is senior vice president of strategic sourcing at Stryten Energy.

The U.S. energy storage sector is navigating a critical turning point. As energy demand surges and grid modernization accelerates, utilities and developers are dealing with the twin pressures of global trade uncertainty and grid reliability. At the same time, the push to localize battery manufacturing is intersecting with a growing need to diversify energy storage technologies.

Together, reshoring the battery supply chain and broadening the mix of battery chemistries are redefining what it means to build a resilient, future-ready energy storage ecosystem.

Tariffs continue to drive up the cost of imported battery materials and components, especially those used in lead and lithium-based systems. These rising costs aren’t limited to finished products; they also impact many U.S.-based battery manufacturers and component suppliers that rely on foreign raw materials. As a result, many in the energy storage supply chain are rethinking their procurement strategies and looking for ways to reduce exposure to volatile international markets.

China’s restrictions on exporting key minerals have added further disruption, especially where it serves as the primary global supplier. With trade challenges expected to continue, I am seeing many companies exploring onshoring and nearshoring solutions.

Onshoring and nearshoring activities are vital to securing a reliable energy storage supply chain. Are there challenges? Yes, but they can be overcome.

Constructing a lithium cell plant can require an investment of half a billion dollars, a major hurdle for most companies. Larger original equipment manufacturers and automakers have addressed this issue by partnering with established battery manufacturers that already have U.S.-based production facilities in place. For smaller battery providers, localization is tougher to manage. To fund domestic manufacturing, many are turning to consolidation strategies, including joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions, and partnerships of their own.

Remember, too, that even before recent trade shifts, battery manufacturers and system integrators had started moving from importing complete battery packs to assembling modules domestically, with longer-term goals of localizing cell production and raw material sourcing.

The industry has already been hard at work proving that building a domestic supply chain is doable. While the transition can be costly and complex, it’s laying the groundwork for a more resilient domestic energy storage ecosystem. If more companies and leaders in the sector step up to lead the change, in a matter of years a strong domestic energy storage supply chain won’t be just wishful thinking — it will become a reality.

Technology diversification to ensure grid resilience

The U.S. electrical grid is also under increasing strain due to aging infrastructure, more frequent extreme weather events, and the rising share of renewable energy sources. These factors are making it harder to maintain consistent power delivery, with brownouts and blackouts becoming more common. Because of these challenges, grid operators are under pressure to modernize and stabilize the system.

This reality highlights the need for smarter energy storage integration to provide backup power, smooth grid fluctuations and support clean energy deployment. Lithium continues to play a dominant role in energy storage. However, broadening our chemistry portfolio further strengthens grid reliability and supply chain resilience.

To strengthen U.S. grid resilience and reduce exposure to supply chain risks, battery manufacturers, system integrators and project developers must seek out new and different types of battery energy storage systems technologies. Two complementary technologies to lithium that are gaining momentum are vanadium redox flow batteries and advanced lead BESS.

VRFBs are well-suited in long-duration applications, particularly in renewable energy projects. I’m seeing rising interest, especially among data centers, and a domestic supply chain for VRFBs is already being developed. Lead BESS also presents a formidable option for medium-duration, decentralized applications, especially when domestic sourcing is a priority. It can help integrate renewable energy sources into the existing power mix by providing stable and dependable backup power and reducing grid dependency during peak hours. With its already mature U.S. supply chain and fully established circular economy, in which nearly 100% of battery materials are recycled, lead BESS provides both resilience and sustainability.

Consider this example of a successful lead BESS installation at Georgia Tech earlier this year. The purpose of the installation at the university’s Carbon Neutral Energy Solutions Laboratory was to create an on-campus living-learning lab to support research and real-world applications of medium-duration energy storage solutions. Lead BESS was chosen because of its proven cost-efficiency, high discharge capabilities and recyclability.

Lead BESS and VRFBs are two proven alternatives that deserve a larger role in the energy storage mix. While lithium-based systems remain essential to many applications, we can’t afford to rely on a single technology to meet the full range of grid needs. A diversified portfolio of chemistries is key to building a more resilient, flexible and domestically sourced energy infrastructure.

A more resilient energy future will be built on two pillars: strategic sourcing and technology diversification. Tariffs, supply chain constraints, and geopolitical uncertainty are here to stay, but so is the rising demand for reliable, scalable energy.

To meet that demand, we must look beyond reliance on any single battery chemistry or offshore supply chain. Instead, it’s time to invest in a broader mix of proven technologies, such as lithium, lead and vanadium, and accelerate the buildout of a robust domestic manufacturing base.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/3-j41PCC0Ehet9Y5-BPL2AWZAnAfWnELuvvRE1s6fVM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xOTI2MjI3OTQ4LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-11-13 12:01:53.472497

Pennsylvania lawmakers voted on Wednesday to withdraw the state from a regional effort that cuts carbon emissions from power plants, a move baked into a deal on the state’s long-overdue budget.

An ongoing legal battle kept Pennsylvania from participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative since former Gov. Tom Wolf directed the state to join the pact in 2019. But it was technically in the collaborative of 11 Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states and would have significantly reduced the region’s climate-damaging emissions if it had become an active member, experts say.

Almost five months after the new $50.1 billion budget should have been voted into law, the bill was passed by large majorities—156 votes to 47 in the Democrat-controlled House and 40 votes to 9 in the Republican-led Senate—in a move that critics said made meaningful climate action a victim of lawmakers’ need to restore normal state funding to services such as education and transportation.

“They didn’t offer it as a free-standing bill, which would have been easier to vote against, but as part of a must-pass budget bill,” said David Masur, executive director of the advocacy group PennEnvironment. “Yes, it was a hard vote for many members who said, ‘I don’t want to vote against RGGI but my school districts need money, transit agencies need money.’ Voting no also would mean voting against those things.”

Masur said the vote was one of the most far-reaching environmental rollbacks in recent state history and is a “huge blow” to climate action. Power generators in states participating in RGGI must buy carbon allowances for their greenhouse-gas emissions, incentivizing a shift to clean energy and raising money for climate efforts.

According to a 2023 analysis by the University of Pennsylvania’s Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, active membership in RGGI would have reduced the state’s electricity-sector emissions by 84 percent from 2020 levels by 2030. The state would also have raised $101 million to $148 million in the auction of emissions allowances in 2030, the study found.

Implementing RGGI membership would have little effect on retail electricity prices, cut coal use and encourage the uptake of renewables, the Kleinman analysis said.

But the Consumer Energy Alliance, an advocacy group that opposes RGGI membership, welcomed the legislature’s vote, which it contended will keep retail energy costs affordable and improve reliability.

“Pennsylvania lawmakers recognized that RGGI was a barrier to affordability, reliability, jobs and economic opportunity for families and businesses across the Commonwealth, and their common-sense bipartisan action leads the way for other states to do the same,” said CEA President David Holt in a statement.

“Getting out of RGGI means Pennsylvania can better compete for the data centers, advanced manufacturing facilities and energy investments that are driving 21st-century economic growth,” Holt added.

Since 2005, the other 10 RGGI states have cut power-sector emissions by 50 percent, which is almost 50 percent faster than the U.S. as a whole, while raising some $8.6 billion to invest in communities, the group said in January this year. Participating states set a regional cap for emissions, which declines over time. Each state issues allowances in proportion to its share of the regional cap.

Pennsylvania’s implementation of RGGI has been blocked by litigation brought by some Republican lawmakers over whether the levy on power producers constitutes a tax or a fee. Opponents of membership argued that it would be a tax, and therefore could not be imposed by a governor; only the legislature has the authority to impose a tax. That argument was backed by a state appeals court, a ruling appealed by Gov. Josh Shapiro and advocates to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

Shapiro, a Democrat, sought to deflect criticism of the RGGI withdrawal by calling for support for his “Lightning Plan,” a package of energy-related measures designed to create jobs, cut costs for consumers and curb climate change.

Environmentalists urge Shapiro, lawmakers not to compromise on climate to end budget impasse

“For years, Senate Republicans have used RGGI as an excuse to stall substantive conversations about energy,” Shapiro said in signing the bill. “Today, that excuse is gone. It’s time to look forward—and I’m going to be aggressive about pushing for policies that create more jobs in the energy sector, bring more clean energy onto the grid and reduce the cost of energy for Pennsylvanians.”

Advocates for RGGI membership think it was a bad deal.

“By trading away RGGI, Governor Shapiro has sacrificed progress on climate and air pollution based on politics that prioritizes industry over our children’s health,” Patrice Tomcik, the senior national field director for advocacy group Moms Clean Air Force, said in a statement.

“He is ignoring the voices of millions in his state—and across the country, as we saw in last week’s elections—who want healthcare and safety as non-negotiables. The fact that RGGI has been stripped away is a blow to my family and to thousands of families across Pennsylvania who deserve a strong climate and energy affordability program.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_8692-2048x1537.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 12:02:01.630554

I’d recommend you see for yourself, starting with Gideon Leek’s article explaining the Documerica Project.","The Documerica project, housed at the National Archives, provides a vivid window into environmental destruction circa the 1970s.

In recent decades, environmental laws have not only been challenged in courts and Congress; they’ve also taken a verbal beating. They’ve been denounced as “job killers”, “government overreach,” “radical environmentalism,” a “war on coal,” and, lately, just “woke.” It’s become all too easy to focus on the costs of regulation and forget why we adopted them in the first place. Or worse, to take their benefits for granted. This is a consequence of politics, of course, but also of a kind of amnesia.

Many Americans today have no memory of the world that spurred modern environmental law. When Time magazine declared “Lake Erie is a dead lake” or named “The Endangered Earth” as its Planet of the Year, it was no joke. Air quality was so poor in Los Angeles that schools routinely cancelled recess. Piles of trash lined highways. Cleveland’s Cuyahoga River famously caught fire in 1969 (the 12th time it had burned in a century!).

Put simply, there were plenty of good reasons why the first Earth Day on April 22, 1970, energized the nation. In the largest single-day public demonstration in U.S. history, roughly 10% of the nation’s population took to the streets to shout together: Enough is enough! Politicians listened. Over the decade that followed, all our foundational environmental laws were passed – the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, and more.

This is an important history to tell. But when I do so in class, putting up Powerpoints of charts and graphs and listing dates and disasters, decrying the blight and pollution of decades ago, I sometimes feel like a Simpsons character railing that “You don’t how bad things used to be!”, somewhere between Moe and Troy McClure. It doesn’t really connect: students seem numb.

Conceived by Bill Ruckelshaus during his first stint as EPA Administrator, Documerica was inspired by the famous photographs of depression-era farmworkers commissioned in the 1930s by the Farm Security Administration. Ruckelshaus’ newly-created EPA commissioned a nationwide photo record in order to, as Leek describes, “provide the EPA with a great deal of qualitative environmental data, create a ‘visual baseline’ against which to judge their efforts, and introduce the agency to the country through art.”

Documerica was formally charged to “pictorially document the environmental movement in America during this decade.” In its five years of operation, it produced over 20,000 photographs, from rivers and farms to highways and city streets.

The photos, now housed at the National Archives, provide a vivid window into the state of the environment in the 1970s. For me, they are at once sobering and inspiring. They bring back memories from my childhood of how we took pollution and trash for granted. And a reminder of why I went into this field. For our students, it provides an important baseline of the conditions that led to the Modern Era of environmental law and shows how much has been achieved. They still need to see the charts and the graphs and I still need to offer up the lists of dates and disasters. But the pictures, the pictures are visceral.

I’d recommend you see for yourself, starting with Gideon Leek’s article explaining the Documerica Project. For more detail, you can view the photos by category or searchable.

Environmental laws and regulations have their costs, to be sure, but Documerica’s photos show just how far we’ve come, and the loss we risk through forgetting.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/412-DA-001-1024x697.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 13:01:30.775018

The agreements commit the utility to fixed, but confidential, pricing for periods of 16 and 20 years, respectively.

These purchases aim to stabilize energy costs and help meet Michigan's increasing renewable energy requirements.

COLDWATER, MI — On Monday, Nov. 11, the city agreed to purchase power for Coldwater Board of Public Utility customers from two renewable power generators, the Tallgrass Waste Heat Energy Project and the Kearsarge Michigan Solar Project.

The purchases of both capacity and energy commit CBPU for 16 and 20 years at confidential fixed prices discussed in a closed council session.

The purchases are made through American Municipal Power, which distributes power to its municipal members within the Michigan South Central Power Agency.

Tallgrass Waste Heat Energy Project

What is this project?

The Ohio-based company is capturing excess heat produced from industrial processes — in this case, from gas turbine compressor stations on a natural gas pipeline. Instead of letting this waste heat dissipate into the atmosphere, Tallgrass converts it into electricity using turbines as long as the line is operational.

What will CBPU purchase?

CBPU will purchase 76% or 7.5 megawatts of the 9.84 megawatts of capacity and associated energy for a period of 16 years, with an option for an additional five-year term. The confidential price increases yearly, resulting in a total 35% increase by 2042, the final year of the contract.

Kearsarge Solar Project

What is the project?

The Massachusetts-based company builds full-service turnkey solar plants with small fields planned for four townships and three communities in Michigan, including Sherwood.

CBPU Director Paul Jakubczak stated that all are part of the Consumers Energy system, so they do not require grid operator approval, unlike larger solar farms.

What will CBPU purchase?

CBPU will purchase up to 14.6 megawatts of capacity from MSCPA's 27.35 megawatts capacity and associated energy for 20 years, plus three five-year extension options, for a total of 35 years.

There is an undisclosed flat rate for the first 20 years, but it increases by $10 per megawatt for each of the three five-year extensions.

Purchase benefits

Why is CBPU making these long-term power purchases?

Jakubczak explained both projects, ""Will provide us capacity and energy and gives us some fixed pricing to eliminate some of the variability that we're seeing out in the market and to easier understand and predict what our costs are actually going to be.""

Are there other benefits?

CBPU will receive renewable energy credits for the solar, and apply for those credits for the Tallgrass project.

Michigan utilities are required to have at least 15% renewable energy through 2029, ramping up to 50% renewable energy by 2030-2034, and achieve 60% renewable energy from 2035 onward.

Michigan utilities, while meeting renewable requirements, are required to meet growing demand and either generate or purchase the necessary energy within the state.

The current CBPU peak capacity, as expected in the next 12 months, is 52 megawatts in January 2026, down from 57 megawatts in 2020 due to energy use reductions by large industrial customers.","https://www.thedailyreporter.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/12/NDRP/87222836007-cbpu-sgn.JPG?crop=5999,3375,x0,y312&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-13 17:02:15.019201

“Gas plants owned by private equity are substantial contributors to climate change and public-health costs,” said Alex Hurley, Project Manager at Global Energy Monitor.
In the United Kingdom, more than one-fifth of gas plants in development already have private equity ties.","A new analysis from the Private Equity Climate Risks (PECR) research consortium, “Mapping Private Equity’s Gas Fleet: Climate Footprint, Health Impacts, and AI-Driven Demand,” reveals that the world’s largest private equity firms collectively own or finance nearly 60 gigawatts of gas-fired power capacity—producing an estimated 82 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions each year, roughly equivalent to the annual electricity use of 17 million U.S. homes. As nations gather for COP30 to stress the urgent role of private finance in funding a clean energy future, private equity’s growing gas empire shows how Wall Street capital is instead steering billions toward fossil expansion, undermining climate goals and prolonging pollution.

The findings expose the scale of private equity’s large investment in the global gas power sector. The analysis spans 27 countries, linking 35 portfolio companies to 147 gas plants worldwide. If this private equity-backed fleet were its own country, it would rank as the seventh-largest gas power producer on Earth. These facilities carry a significant and largely hidden public toll; a typical mid-sized gas plant in the dataset could generate $21 million – $28 million in estimated annual health damages from air pollution alone.

“Gas plants owned by private equity are substantial contributors to climate change and public-health costs,” said Alex Hurley, Project Manager at Global Energy Monitor. “Understanding who finances these plants is a critical step toward accountability.”

The report also finds that private equity’s gas assets are increasingly intertwined with the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence and data centers. As demand for electricity surges, private equity firms are not only financing the data infrastructure that powers AI, but they are also buying the power plants that keep it running. Since 2022, private equity firms have invested nearly $200 billion in data center companies, driving the majority of global mergers and acquisitions in the sector. At the same time, firms are acquiring utilities and fossil-fuel power generators to secure energy supply for the digital economy.

BlackRock and Blackstone illustrate how this convergence between fossil fuel power and digital infrastructure is accelerating. BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners recently won approval for its $6.2 billion acquisition of Minnesota-based energy utility ALLETE and is now pursuing a $38 billion takeover of AES Corp.—the largest utility acquisition in U.S. history. Blackstone has announced an $11 billion deal to acquire New Mexico’s largest utility, TXNM Energy, further consolidating private equity control over both the data and energy systems that underpin modern life.

“Private equity is accelerating fossil fuel buildouts to power the AI boom, and the public is paying the price,” said Amanda Mendoza, Senior Climate and Energy Researcher at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. “These firms are keeping gas plants online and taking over utilities to secure energy for data centers, locking in pollution and higher bills while delaying the shift away from fossil fuels.”

Private equity’s reach is especially concentrated in smaller and developing economies. In Togo and Panama, more than half of national gas-fired capacity is owned or financed by private equity firms; in Jamaica and the Philippines, the figure is roughly one-third. In the United Kingdom, more than one-fifth of gas plants in development already have private equity ties.

“The growth of private equity-owned gas power plants cuts into hopes of progress on renewable energy,” said Hibba Meraay, Research Analyst at Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund. “By backing these gas power plants, private equity contributes to global warming while placing an uneven burden of health risks and increased emissions on the global south where many of the plants are located.”

Clean energy resources — specifically solar, wind, and battery storage — are the most affordable and quickest sources of energy to build today, even after Congress and the Trump administration have repealed federal support for these technologies.
States including Texas, Iowa, North Dakota, and Kansas — hardly paragons of climate or clean energy policy — are among the nation’s leaders in on-shore wind and solar power generation, and all boast electricity prices below the national average.
Healey has put forward broad-reaching legislation designed to bring down electricity costs in Massachusetts called the Energy Affordability Independence and Innovation Act.
The legislation won plaudits from business, labor and environmental groups, reflecting that clean energy and energy affordability are not just harmonious but mutually reinforcing.","Electricity bills in Massachusetts have increased by 50% over the last decade, making it more expensive for households and businesses to operate. The average residential bill is now over $300 a month, according to EnergySage, putting Massachusetts 29% above the national average.

This challenge is hardly unique to the commonwealth. Electricity bills are spiking across the U.S., as aging infrastructure and slow deployment of affordable power — such as solar, wind, and battery storage as well as low-cost modernization upgrades to the electric grid — make it difficult to keep pace with demand.

As a result, electricity prices have become a burgeoning national political issue that ranks increasingly high among voter concerns. That angst will grow as we become more dependent on electricity in every part of our lives — from the heat pumps warming our homes, to powering our electric vehicles, to fueling the data centers that underpin our digital economy, including cloud computing and artificial intelligence.

Massachusetts lawmakers have an opportunity to address this issue in a meaningful and holistic way.

To solve electricity affordability, we need more clean power — and we need it fast. Clean energy resources — specifically solar, wind, and battery storage — are the most affordable and quickest sources of energy to build today, even after Congress and the Trump administration have repealed federal support for these technologies. Consider that it costs between $38 to $78 per megawatt hour to build a solar project, and it can be done in 12-18 months, compared to $48 to $107 for a natural gas plant, which faces a turbine backlog of seven years.

States including Texas, Iowa, North Dakota, and Kansas — hardly paragons of climate or clean energy policy — are among the nation’s leaders in on-shore wind and solar power generation, and all boast electricity prices below the national average.

In Texas, the overwhelming majority of new power added or planned to be added to the grid is from solar, wind and battery storage, which helped keep power flowing throughout the state's brutally hot summer. In the absence of climate goals in Texas, it’s clear that the reasons for this growth are purely economic: renewable power is fast and affordable to build.

But the source of electricity is only part of the issue. While energy supply rates have increased over the last decade, another primary cost driver in Massachusetts is the price of delivering that energy. Our transmission and distribution systems also need to be addressed.

Gov. Healey has put forward broad-reaching legislation designed to bring down electricity costs in Massachusetts called the Energy Affordability Independence and Innovation Act. It includes new approaches to manage electricity load and enhance the electric grid with solar and other distributed energy resources, accelerate the process for getting new clean power online, and give the state more flexibility in purchasing energy, all while advancing forms of energy generation such as nuclear and thermal energy networks.

It also maintains Massachusetts’ nation-leading energy efficiency program, Mass Save, which helped more than 55,000 homes in 2024 to reduce costs through efficiency upgrades. Importantly, the legislation improves Mass Save by changing the way it’s financed, reducing the program’s costs to ratepayers.

The legislation won plaudits from business, labor and environmental groups, reflecting that clean energy and energy affordability are not just harmonious but mutually reinforcing. If enacted, the governor’s legislation is estimated to save consumers between $11 and $14 billion over the next decade, according to analysis from Sustainable Energy Advantage and Synapse Energy.

As leaders in climate solutions and corporate sustainability, we are keenly attuned to the challenges of both climate change and energy costs. While some believe the path to achieve energy affordability requires weakening or doing away with the state’s climate goals, nothing could be further from the truth. We call on the legislature to finalize this package to make the Massachusetts economy more competitive by attacking these dual challenges at once.

HARRISBURG, Pa. — In a major setback for Pennsylvania’s environment, economy, and public health, Governor Josh Shapiro and House Democratic leadership agreed to the demands of Senate Republicans to abandon the 11-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) as part of the state budget deal.

Finalized on Earth Day in 2022, the regulation linking Pennsylvania to RGGI would have placed a cap on climate-disrupting carbon dioxide (CO2) pollution from power plants that declined by 3% per year. Generators would comply with the emissions limits by purchasing and retiring an allowance for each ton of CO2 they release, and proceeds from the sale were to be deposited in the state’s Clean Air Fund for investment in projects to further improve air quality, such as clean energy development and energy efficiency measures.

Coal and gas interests and Republican legislators immediately appealed the rule, and it has been tied up in the courts for over three years. The state Supreme Court heard oral arguments in May, and was expected to issue a ruling on the constitutionality of the rule soon. Since RGGI implementation has been on hold, Pennsylvania has missed out at least $3 billion dollars in allowance proceeds that could have been re-invested to transform our energy economy.

This deal leaves Pennsylvania with no policy in place to limit the amount of climate disrupting pollution from any sector of our economy.

In response, Tom Schuster, Director of the Sierra Club Pennsylvania Chapter, issued the following statement:

“It is unconscionable that Senate Republicans’ top demand in this budget negotiation was continued, unfettered climate destabilization for the sake of polluter profits. And it is beyond disappointing that Governor Shapiro and House Democrats gave in to that demand.

RGGI is the single most effective tool available to achieve the Governor’s own stated goals to “address climate change, protect and create energy jobs, and ensure Pennsylvania has reliable, affordable, and clean power for the long term.” When introducing his Lightning Plan, Governor Shapiro himself said, “Doing nothing at this moment is not an option.” Yet giving up RGGI without a replacement is doing exactly nothing.

As states across the country drive the clean energy revolution, Pennsylvania is mired in 49th place in renewable energy growth. Walking away from RGGI and its billions of dollars in targeted investments betrays Pennsylvania workers, communities, and families who are counting on clean, reliable, affordable power and a fair shot at the new energy economy. The Commonwealth deserves leadership that fights for a liveable future, rather than selling out for short-term political bargains. ”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-13 12:02:05.815551

The Clean Energy Fund of the Carolinas (formerly the North Carolina Clean Energy Fund) is a nonprofit, financial institution accelerating clean energy investments across North and South Carolina.","RALEIGH, NC (Nov. 13, 2025) – Clean energy jobs grew more than six times faster in North Carolina than the rest of the state’s economy in 2024, raising the total number of clean energy workers in the state to more than 113,000, according to the seventh annual Clean Jobs North Carolina report released today by the national, nonpartisan business group E2 and its partners at North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association (NCSEA), Carolinas Clean Energy Business Association (CCEBA), Center for Energy Education, and the Clean Energy Fund of the Carolinas.

In fact, North Carolina added 3,254 clean energy jobs last year – which ranks eighth in the United States, above Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Colorado.

“These numbers demonstrate that clean energy continued to be a workhorse for workforce growth in North Carolina in 2024, far outpacing the state’s economy as a whole on job creation,” said Zach Amittay, E2’s Southeast Advocate. “It’s an economic imperative that policymakers recognize this and take action to support the continued growth of clean energy jobs. Unfortunately, we’re seeing the opposite from too many of our state and federal government leaders.”

Jobs in energy efficiency, renewable generation, storage and grid, and other clean energy subsectors continued to grow faster than the broader economy, accounting for an increasingly large share of the state’s workforce. Energy efficiency accounts for over 70 percent of North Carolina’s clean energy jobs, supporting 80,817 jobs in 2024.

However, clean vehicles-related jobs saw a slight dip in 2024, losing 234 jobs after hitting a record high of 9,522 workers at the end of 2023. Clean vehicles-related jobs took a similar hit across the country, as did jobs related to internal combustion engine vehicles.

“North Carolina’s deep bench of skilled workers is one of the things that keeps solar and storage a low-cost source of electricity,” said Chris Carmody, Executive Director of the Carolinas Clean Energy Business Association.

Though not reflected in the 2024 data, recent policy actions by Congress and the Trump administration—to kill projects, revoke tax credits, cancel permits and add new regulatory red tape—have already caused major job losses in the clean energy industry, with more expected to come. According to separate E2 research, since January 2025 companies canceled $1.4 billion in planned clean energy related factories and other projects in North Carolina that were expected to create over 1,000 new jobs.

“Clean energy jobs in North Carolina are more than careers—they’re catalysts for thriving communities,” said Jen Weiss, Co-Director at the Clean Energy Fund of the Carolinas. “By embracing clean energy, we’re creating local wealth, strengthening neighborhoods, and building a future where prosperity is shared by all.”

As clean energy companies and investors are reeling from federal decisions to slash clean energy support, the sector’s importance to the region’s overall economy is clearer than ever. Clean energy now accounts for nearly half of all energy and vehicle-related jobs in the state, and over 2 percent of all jobs. Industry-wide, nearly 67 percent of the sector’s jobs (over 75,500 jobs) are in construction or professional services.

Methodology

This analysis of U.S. clean energy employment is based on employment data collected and analyzed by the BW Research Partnership for the 2025 U.S. Energy and Employment Report (USEER). The USEER analyzes data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) to track employment across many energy production, transmission and distribution subsectors. In addition, the 2025 USEER relies on a unique supplemental survey of 42,800 business representatives across the United States. Created and conducted by BW Research, the methodology has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). This survey is used to identify energy-related employment within key subsectors of the broader industries as classified by the BLS and to assign them into their component energy and energy efficiency sectors.

A full methodology on the sectors and types of jobs this analysis includes and does not include is available in E2’s Clean Jobs America report here.

Mike Stivala, President and Chief Executive Officer, Suburban Propane Partners: Thanks, Devin, and thank you all for joining us today. Fiscal 2025 was another outstanding year for Suburban Propane. In our core propane business, propane demand was strong as a result of a sustained period of more normal winter weather in the heart of our footprint from mid-December through February, the most critical months for heat-related demand, as well as strong demand in our southeast operations in the aftermath of Hurricanes Helene and Milton in the first fiscal quarter, and incremental volumes from our acquisition of a well-run propane business in our southwest territory, which we closed in November 2024. I’m extremely proud of how our field personnel at every level worked tirelessly to meet the surge in demand when our customers needed us most, while also opportunistically taking on new business when some of our competitors were unable to keep up.

This was a real testament to the preparation by our operations teams and the flexibility of our operating model to ramp up when demand dictates. With safety as our highest priority, what’s even more impressive is how our employees performed during a prolonged stretch of very high activity levels and some harsh operating conditions while not compromising on our highest standards for safety. As a result, propane volumes for the fiscal 2025 increased nearly 6% compared to the prior year. Strong volumes, combined with effective margin management during a rising commodity price environment, and good expense discipline contributed to a $28 million, or 11.2%, increase in adjusted EBITDA compared to the prior year. In addition to the higher earnings, we had a number of key accomplishments in fiscal 2025 in support of our long-term strategic growth initiatives.

Just to highlight a few, we acquired and integrated a well-run propane business in strategic markets in New Mexico and Arizona for a total consideration of approximately $53 million. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2025, just in October of 2025, we further invested in the growth of our core propane business with the acquisition of two high-quality businesses in attractive markets in California for a total consideration of $24 million. We created a dedicated sales and business development team focused on specific propane verticals that are less weather-sensitive and present opportunities for growth, as the advantages of propane become a bigger part of the conversation. These verticals include opportunities in material handling, agriculture, power generation, and over-the-road vehicles. We continue to identify and foster new market expansion opportunities to establish and extend our presence in certain attractive markets.

We secured incremental supply of renewable propane and exceeded 2 million gallons of renewable propane sales, focused primarily in the California market, coupled with expansion into the Florida and Virginia markets to meet customer demand for a renewable alternative. We entered into a multi-year partnership with NASCAR and Speedway Motorsports, making Suburban Propane the official propane partner of NASCAR and Speedway Motorsports, reflecting the reliability of our national presence and demonstrating the power and versatility of propane at one of America’s top spectator sports.

In our R&G operations, we continue to implement several operational improvements at our Stanfield, Arizona facility to stabilize and grow R&G production, enhance safety protocols, modify feedstock intake practices, and improve our overall plant efficiency to strengthen the long-term performance and returns of the facility, while also advancing the capital projects at our Columbus, Ohio, and upstate New York facilities, both of which are expected to come online in the first half of fiscal 2026. We also expanded our R&G management team with dedicated safety, construction, and compliance personnel to bring more expertise in-house. Focusing on our balance sheet, we launched an at-the-market equity program to sell up to $100 million of newly issued common units, raising $23.5 million in net proceeds from the sale of 1.3 million common units at attractive prices during fiscal 2025.

Proceeds from the ATM program are being used to support our ongoing pursuit of opportunistic growth and to accelerate debt reduction. During the year, using excess cash flows and proceeds from the ATM program, we deployed nearly $53 million for propane acquisitions, over $25 million for our growth projects in the RNG business, and reduced our overall debt by nearly $2 million. With the increased earnings and slightly lower outstanding debt, we ended fiscal 2025 with a leverage ratio of 4.29 times, a significant improvement from 4.76 times at the end of the prior year. In addition to the strong operating and financial performance, during fiscal 2025, we embarked on a multi-year technology modernization initiative that will simplify the way we operate, consolidate our systems platform, and improve the tools we use to serve our customers, delivering a better experience for both our employees and our customers.

This initiative will not change our personalized hyperlocal business model that sets Suburban Propane apart as best-in-class operators within the propane industry. Fiscal 2025 was a very successful year for Suburban Propane, both in terms of our financial performance and from executing on our long-term strategic growth plans, while remaining patient and disciplined to maintain financial flexibility through a strong balance sheet. A little later, I’ll provide some closing remarks. However, at this point, I’ll turn the call over to Mike Kuglin, who will discuss our full-year and fourth quarter results in more detail. Mike.

Mike Kuglin, Chief Financial Officer, Suburban Propane Partners: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I’ll start by focusing on our full-year results, link us in color in the fourth quarter toward the end of my remarks. To be consistent with previous reporting, I’m excluding the impact of unrealized non-cash mark-to-market adjustments on our commodity hedges, which resulted in an unrealized gain of $2.4 million in fiscal 2025, compared to an unrealized loss of $14.6 million in the prior year, along with certain other non-cash items we’ve identified in the reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA in the press release. Including these items, net income for fiscal 2025 was $128.4 million, or $1.97 per common unit, compared to $107.7 million, or $1.68 per common unit in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2025 was $278 million, an increase of $28 million, or 11.2%, compared to the prior year.

Retail propane gallons sold for fiscal 2025 were 400.5 million gallons, an increase of 5.9% compared to the prior year. The volume increase was driven by sustained widespread cold temperatures during the most critical months for heat-related demand, increased demand for backup power generation and other applications in the aftermath of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, continued growth in our counter-seasonal national accounts business, and incremental volumes from our recent propane acquisitions. With respect to the weather, average temperatures for fiscal 2025 were 9% warmer than normal and 4% cooler than the prior year. During January and February, average temperatures were comparable to normal and 13% colder than the same period last year. From a commodity perspective, average wholesale propane prices for fiscal 2025 were $0.79 per gallon, based at Mount Belvieu, which was 5.8% higher than the prior year.

According to the most recent report from the Energy Information Administration, U.S. propane inventories at the end of last week were at 106 million barrels, which was 6% higher than a year ago and 13% higher than historical averages for this time of year. Given the strength of inventories, wholesale propane prices have trended down from the end of the fiscal year and are currently in the $0.60 range, compared to the $0.80 range at the same time last year. Excluding the impact of the mark-to-market adjustments on our commodity hedges that I mentioned earlier, total gross margin of $866.4 million for fiscal 2025 increased $46.8 million, or 5.7%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher propane volumes sold and higher propane unit margins.

Excluding the impact of the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, propane unit margins for fiscal 2025 increased 2 cents per gallon, or 1%, with margin expansion experienced across all customer categories. In our RNG operations, average daily RNG injection for the fiscal year was approximately 13% lower compared to the prior year, primarily due to downtime experienced, several operational improvement projects designed to enhance future RNG production, as well as the multiple power outages and extremely cold ambient air temperatures in the Arizona area during the winter that impacted anaerobic digestion. While we remain focused on executing controllable operational improvements, revenues at the Stanfield facility continue to face headwinds from lower prices, both California LCFS credits and federal D3 RINs. California LCFS credit prices remain depressed relative to historical levels, though average prices for fiscal 2025 increased 2.5% compared to the prior year.

We were encouraged to see the finalization of amendments to the LCFS program implemented by CARB made effective as of July 1, 2025, which accelerated carbon reduction targets and aimed to create a better balance in the LCFS credit bank. Since the amendments were finalized in June 2025, LCFS credit prices have increased over 30%. Conversely, average federal D3 RIN prices for fiscal 2025 decreased 25% compared to the prior year. With respect to expenses, combined operating and energy and expenses increased $23.7 million, or 4.2%, compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll, benefit-related expenses, overtime, and other variable operating costs to support the increased activities associated with incremental customer demand, as well as higher variable compensation expense associated with the increase in earnings and costs related to the technology initiative that Mike mentioned earlier.

Net interest expense of $76.3 million for fiscal 2025 increased $1.7 million compared to the prior year due to higher average outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, partially offset by lower benchmark interest rates. Total capital spending for fiscal 2025 of $72 million was $12.5 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to advancing construction efforts at our RNG facilities in Columbus, Ohio, and upstate New York. For fiscal 2026, capital spending for our propane operations is expected to be consistent with historical levels, which is between $40-$45 million, and CapEx for the RNG projects is expected to range between $30-$35 million, with the spending concentrated in the first half of the fiscal year.

We expect the capital spending at our RNG facility in upstate New York to qualify for investment tax credit under Inflation Reduction Act at a rate of 30%, which equates to a range of $7-$9 million in tax credits, which could be earned and monetized when the asset is placed into service. Turning to our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, assisted with the seasonality of our business, we typically report a net loss for the fourth quarter. With that said, and excluding the effects of certain non-cash items in both years, we reported a net loss of $35.7 million for the fourth quarter, or $0.54 per common unit, which was flat compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $700,000, which was also essentially flat compared to the prior year.

Retail propane gallons sold during the fourth quarter increased 1.8% compared to the prior year. Total gross margin increased $5.3 million, or 4%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher volume sold and higher unit margins. Combined operating and GMA expenses increased to $5.8 million, or 4.5%, primarily due to higher volume-related variable operating costs, higher variable compensation, and costs related to our technology initiative. Excluded from adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 is an impairment charge of approximately $6 million to fully write down the carrying value of our investment in an early-stage energy technology company, as well as income from the reversal of an earn-out reserve associated with the R&G acquisition. The earn-out was contingent upon the acquired assets achieving a certain EBITDA threshold over a certain period. During the fourth quarter, we determined that the contingent consideration would not be earned.

These non-cash items were reported within other net and statement of operations. Turning to our balance sheet, during the fiscal year, we utilized a combination of cash flows from operating activities and net proceeds of $23.5 million from mutuals and common units under the ATM program to fund a propane acquisition for a total consideration of $53 million, with gross capital expenditures of $25.5 million to advance the construction activities at our RNG production facilities and repayment of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $1.8 million. With the improvement in earnings and debt reduction, our consolidated leverage ratio for fiscal 2025 improved 4.29 times. We have more than ample borrowing capacity under our revolver to support the completion of our planned capital expansion projects, as well as our ongoing strategic growth initiatives.

As we continue to focus on the execution of our long-term strategic goals, we also stay focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet. With that, we’ll turn it back to Mike.

Mike Stivala, President and Chief Executive Officer, Suburban Propane Partners: Thanks, Mike. As announced in our October 23rd press release, our board of supervisors declared our quarterly distribution of $0.325 per common unit in respect of the first fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. That equates to an annualized rate of $1.30 per common unit. The quarterly distribution was paid yesterday, November 12th, due to the Federal Reserve closing on the 11th for Veterans Day, to our unit holders of record as of November 4th. Our distribution coverage continues to remain healthy at 2.13 times for the trailing 12 months ended September 2025. I also want to take a moment to thank and honor our great American veterans for their service, including so many that are part of the Suburban Propane family now that we just passed Veterans Day. So just a few closing remarks regarding our long-term strategy.

Our long-term strategic growth plan remains to foster the growth of our core propane business while making strategic investments in lower carbon renewable energy alternatives through our Suburban Renewable Energy subsidiary, leveraging our core competencies in safety, customer service, and logistics, especially in the localized energy distribution markets. The energy evolution is a long journey, one that requires a pragmatic and balanced approach to identifying and fostering energy solutions that can lower greenhouse gas emissions and our country’s overall carbon footprint. It requires solutions that can deliver energy that is reliable, affordable, and sustainable. We have definitely seen a shift in the conversation that is benefiting the propane industry by recognizing propane’s versatile, affordable, on-demand nature, and its clean qualities as an immediate and long-term solution to helping lower the carbon footprint.

We are very well positioned to take advantage of this growing respect for propane, given our operational and financial strength and stability. We are also maintaining our focus on innovation to ensure that Suburban Propane continues to be regarded as a trusted local distributor of energy for decades to come. That innovation includes our advancements in delivering renewable propane and renewable natural gas as direct drop-in replacements for their traditional energy equivalents. The energy evolution is in the early innings. The investments we have made have been very measured and focused on long-term growth and sustainability. It is great to see a more pragmatic approach toward the energy evolution, and also great to see a supportive regulatory and policy framework that contemplates a more deliberate and inclusive environment to drive down emissions over time, and within all of the above philosophy for energy solutions.

We’re very excited to be starting a new heating season, and our people and platform are very well prepared to handle whatever this year’s weather dictates. With that, I want to thank our more than 3,300 employees for helping make fiscal 2025 another outstanding year for Suburban Propane, and for their unwavering commitment to safety for our customers, our employees, and the communities we serve. I hope you and your families remain safe and healthy, and I wish everyone a very happy holiday season. We appreciate your support. We’d now like to open the call up for questions. Rob, if you could help us with that.

The ideological opposition has, in extreme cases, led to acts of vandalism against EVs and charging stations.
As the commenter shared, copper theft from EV charging stations has become a growing problem.
Research has reported that these thefts play a part in undermining the public confidence in EV infrastructure, harming the transition to renewable energy for a safer and healthier planet.
Redditors worried that the vandalism may stop EV infrastructure from growing.","A troubling trend sweeping through cities was highlighted by a concerned Redditor on r/Edmonton, a subreddit for residents of the Canadian city.

""Has anyone noticed that there are quite a few cut EV charging cables around the city?"" they asked, sparking responses from numerous citizens alarmed by the incidents.

Explanations for the vandalism varied but often touched on similar themes.

""A mix of vandals with no specific axe to grind, vandals hating EVs, and metal thefts,"" said one of the commenters.

The Redditor satisfactorily broke down the harrowing trend. Anti-EV sentiment has been steadily growing in some communities, often fuelled by misinformation or political opposition to the green transition.

Common anti-EV talking points claim that EVs are just as harmful to the planet as gas-powered cars due to pollution from battery manufacturing or electricity generation. In reality, research has consistently shown that even EVs powered by the dirtiest energy grids produce less lifetime pollution than combustion vehicles, electricity is far more efficient, and it produces no tailpipe pollution.

For some, EVs have become symbols of government overreach, sparking anger rather than enthusiasm. The ideological opposition has, in extreme cases, led to acts of vandalism against EVs and charging stations. Damaging cables or vehicles is seen by perpetrators as a form of protest against what they perceive as a forced shift away from combustion engines, even though such actions ultimately harm communities and slow the progress towards a cleaner and safer future.

As the commenter shared, copper theft from EV charging stations has become a growing problem. While each cable only contains a small amount of copper, the cost to repair or replace a damaged station can reach hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Research has reported that these thefts play a part in undermining the public confidence in EV infrastructure, harming the transition to renewable energy for a safer and healthier planet.

Redditors worried that the vandalism may stop EV infrastructure from growing.

""I worry that the headache these cut cables cause for charging operators may make them think twice about expanding their charging offerings,"" one said.

Luckily, cities have not reacted by curtailing sustainable infrastructure. In 2024, the U.S. increased its charging stock to 20% and globally, more than 1.3 million public charging points were added to the stock.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/EV-Charging-station-2.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 17:01:37.338207
,American Energy,2025-11-13 15:44:56+00:00,www.nytimes.com,Britain Gives Go-Ahead to Smaller Nuclear Reactor in Wales - The New York Times,"Stanley Reed, www.nytimes.com, stanley-reed",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/business/uk-nuclear-power-plant.html,"Britain will back a modular nuclear power station for Anglesey Island in northern Wales, ending years of uncertainty over the fate of what is considered the country’s best nuclear site.
The decision, which was announced Thursday morning in London, appears to be an effort to create a British nuclear champion and a move to increase the government’s role in the economy, especially the energy sector.
The Wales plant would also be the first of this type of nuclear plant to be built in Britain.
Small modular reactors like the one proposed by Rolls-Royce are relatively new in the global nuclear industry.
The British government, though, is eager to move forward with small nuclear reactors and may have calculated that lining up an American giant would take years.","Britain will back a modular nuclear power station for Anglesey Island in northern Wales, ending years of uncertainty over the fate of what is considered the country’s best nuclear site.

The decision, which was announced Thursday morning in London, appears to be an effort to create a British nuclear champion and a move to increase the government’s role in the economy, especially the energy sector.

The Wales plant would also be the first of this type of nuclear plant to be built in Britain. Modular designs are promoted as cheaper and quicker to construct.

Rolls-Royce SMR, an affiliate of the jet engine maker that is one of Britain’s few remaining large industrial companies, will design the power station at Wylfa, a rocky headland on the island that overlooks the Irish Sea.

Rolls-Royce is trying to parlay its experience designing and building the reactors for Britain’s nuclear submarines into a new business line. It has brought in investors, including the Qatar Investment Authority, the Persian Gulf emirate’s sovereign wealth fund; Constellation, an American utility; and CEZ, the Czech Republic’s power company.

The Wales plant will consist of three units, known as small modular reactors, or SMRs, whose power output will add up to a little less than half that of one of the current generation of giant power stations.

These “mini-nuclear reactors are smaller and quicker to build” than some larger ones, the government said in a news release. The plan is to lower costs through assembling modules from components in factories and then setting them up on site.

The government is betting that these smaller reactors will give Britain a technology with low carbon emissions and “global export opportunities.” It has pledged 2.5 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) for preliminary work on the site and other preparation. The additional cost of completing the plant may be financed through charges on electric bills, a strategy the government is using to draw investors to another plant, Sizewell C, being built in eastern England.

The government said the plant would support 3,000 local jobs and power three million homes. By comparison, Sizewell C is projected to create 8,000 jobs at peak construction and light six million homes.

The government, though, is taking something of a gamble. Small modular reactors like the one proposed by Rolls-Royce are relatively new in the global nuclear industry. Such leadership could bring both advantages and unexpected problems.

Britain, which is trying to construct nuclear plants after a long hiatus, has already been badly burned by delays and cost overruns at a giant plant being built on the west coast of England at Hinkley Point.

In addition, some critics say the government is making a mistake by not building a larger plant at Wylfa that would generate more electricity and create more jobs. The nuclear industry considers Wylfa the most advantageous of potential British sites because of its bedrock location and easy access to deep water for cooling.

In a statement on Wednesday, Unite, a large trade union, said building the small modular plant at Wylfa was “a missed opportunity.”

The union said that although the smaller plant would provide “some employment opportunities,” those from a larger model would be “far greater.”

In addition, the choice is likely to disappoint Washington, an important ally, and the American nuclear industry, which has been courting Britain. The United States recently signed an ambitious nuclear cooperation deal with Britain.

“We are extremely disappointed by this decision, not least because there are cheaper, faster, and already-approved options to provide clean, safe energy at this same location,” Warren Stephens, the U.S. ambassador to Britain, said in a statement.

The British government, though, is eager to move forward with small nuclear reactors and may have calculated that lining up an American giant would take years.

Keir Starmer, the prime minister, also probably wanted something to happen quickly at Wylfa, whose future has been in doubt since Hitachi walked away from building a power station there in 2019 after spending around £2 billion. A 1960s-era plant at Wylfa closed in 2015.

“It might simply be that Wylfa is the fastest site they can possibly bring online for SMRs, so they’ve gone for that,” said Adam Bell, a former senior British energy official who is now director of policy at Stonehaven, a consulting firm.

Edward T. Jones, a senior lecturer in economics at Bangor University in North Wales, said the local community, which was stunned by Hitachi’s departure, might not be prepared to cash in on the opportunities offered by the new plant. “They’ve been burnt once and don’t want to be burnt again,” he said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/12/multimedia/12biz-uk-nuclear-htfb/12biz-uk-nuclear-htfb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 13:01:27.153943

The ruling follows a comprehensive technical and legal review confirming that Texas’ Underground Injection Control (UIC) program meets federal standards.

“Approving Texas’ request to be in charge of this critical program is a big step forward for cooperative federalism—as big as the state of Texas,” said Regional Administrator Scott Mason. “The Railroad Commission of Texas has demonstrated that the state is ready, willing, and able to add Class VI wells to its underground injection control program.”

With primacy, the state can directly issue permits for new carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects, cutting wait times and removing bureaucratic hurdles that have slowed deployment nationwide.

By making clean energy the foundation for job creation and economic opportunity, we can turn today’s milestones into a future where clean power drives growth and ensures prosperity for all.","WASHINGTON, DC – This year marks a historic milestone: for the first time, global renewable-energy production has surpassed coal. In the first half of 2025, renewables accounted for more than 34% of the world’s electricity, while coal’s share fell to just above 33%. Notably, these gains were largely driven by emerging economies.

As the world’s attention turns to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Brazil (COP30), this milestone serves as a powerful reminder that the clean-energy transition is already underway. Having led investments at the US International Development Finance Corporation and now serving as chief investment officer at the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, I know a promising business opportunity when I see one.

According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), 91% of new renewable-energy projects are now cheaper than their fossil-fuel counterparts. This finding provides clear evidence that, despite the ongoing growth in coal and oil use, renewables are both economically and technically viable throughout much of the world.

We cannot afford to let today’s momentum slip away.

To reduce climate pollution, promote sustainable economic growth, and strengthen energy resilience where it is needed most, we must build on these achievements. As we approach the tenth anniversary of the Paris climate agreement, meaningful global climate action is still possible, even in the face of escalating geopolitical tensions and competing national priorities.

Yet such progress is inherently fragile. All too often, clean-energy adoption stalls once the infrastructure is in place. Solar projects, for example, can fail when communities lack the necessary tools and financing to make full use of the electricity they produce.

Providing solar panels is not enough. To lock in the benefits of renewables, governments must invest not only in power generation but also in systems, training, and equipment – such as electric mills and water pumps – that enable communities and countries to harness clean energy for business growth and job creation.

When implemented effectively, such investments deliver benefits across the board. Climate goals advance as renewables replace costly, polluting fuels. Communities gain access to affordable power, enabling them to improve education and health care, create jobs, and raise incomes. And with energy companies profiting from rising demand, emerging economies can attract new investment.

The challenge is enormous, but so is the opportunity. The World Bank projects that 1.2 billion young people in developing economies will reach working age over the next decade, but that only 420 million new jobs will be created by then. Access to clean energy, and the opportunities it brings, offers a way to bridge this gap before it becomes a global crisis. The World Economic Forum estimates that the renewables industry alone could generate more than 30 million jobs and mobilize $2.2-2.8 trillion annually. Embedding renewable technologies into other downstream sectors such as industry and agriculture could create a further 500 million new jobs and improve the quality of 700 million existing ones.

To succeed, we must align energy policies with broader development objectives, integrate renewables into local industries, and accelerate investment in the equipment and training needed to use it effectively.

Across Africa, this approach is already delivering tangible results. In Nigeria, farmers and traders are increasingly using solar-powered irrigation pumps, cold-storage facilities, and mills. These investments, in turn, have fueled a wave of distributed renewable-energy projects that are rapidly transforming local power systems.

In the Amazon, where COP30 is underway, the government of Brazil is investing $800 million to expand energy access and transition away from reliance on diesel. My organization is helping to ensure that this new renewable energy creates jobs and powers sustainable economic development for thousands of farmers and entrepreneurs.

India offers a useful model for emerging economies seeking to strengthen their power grids and absorb growing renewable capacity. In New Delhi, the country’s first commercial, utility-scale battery-energy storage system – the largest in South Asia – now guarantees a reliable supply of clean electricity to 100,000 low-income households and businesses. Meanwhile, solar plants in Rajasthan provide steady daytime power to 40,000 farmers. And in Uttar Pradesh, a women’s entrepreneurship program aims to help 500,000 women-owned businesses adopt clean-energy technologies by 2030.

Together, these examples show that the clean-energy transition is within reach. But with 685 million people worldwide lacking electricity, and more than a billion relying on unaffordable or unreliable supply, there is still a long way to go.

The choice before us is clear: continue investing in renewables or slide back into fossil-fuel dependence. By making clean energy the foundation for job creation and economic opportunity, we can turn today’s milestones into a future where clean power drives growth and ensures prosperity for all.",https://webapi.project-syndicate.org/library/c048b7cdf1aac36ce0acb52e1f091bd5.2-1-super.1.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 11:02:12.219780

Warner and Tim Kaine (both D-VA) slammed the Trump Administration after a new report showed that energy prices are increasing under the Trump Administration. In Virginia, households are paying on average $130 more– a 7.3 percent increase – in annual energy costs compared to last year. This comes after President Donald Trump declared an “energy emergency” to cancel clean energy projects across the country.

“President Trump promised Americans lower costs, energy independence, and more good paying jobs, yet he is canceling energy projects across Virginia and the country, triggering higher utility bills, weakening the American power grid, growing our reliance on foreign energy, and cutting jobs,” said Warner. “In the Senate, my Democratic colleagues and I are focused on diversifying America’s energy sources, and we’re going to continue doing everything we can to lower utility costs for families.”

“The U.S. was producing more energy than any country in the world, but on President Trump’s first day in office, he declared an ‘energy emergency’ to cancel clean energy projects across the country, including in Virginia. I’ve forced votes in the Senate to overturn this sham emergency, but my Republican colleagues have refused to do so,” said Kaine. “Now, Americans are paying the price. This new report underscores what I’ve been saying all along: we must stop President Trump’s war on American-made energy that is killing jobs and raising energy costs for Virginians.”

Democrats have made significant investments in clean energy, spurring the highest levels of factory construction in U.S. history with more than 400,000 new jobs announced across the country. However, Trump’s “energy emergency” and Republicans’ rollback of provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act are killing these new jobs, weakening the power grid, increasing our reliance on foreign energy, and raising energy costs.

Williams, added that the development could “transform the economy of Ynys Môn, particularly the north of the Island and North Wales,” but stressed that the council would “work to mitigate negative impacts” on local residents and ensure “the voices of north Anglesey are fully taken into account.”

Lib Dems: “Local jobs and training must come first”

Welsh Liberal Democrat Westminster Spokesperson David Chadwick MP said he welcomed steps to improve energy security but warned against the use of outside contractors.

“I welcome any moves to improve our energy security, but this must translate into real jobs for local people, not outside contractors flown in for a few years,” he said.

“The focus should be on training, apprenticeships, and long-term opportunities that strengthen communities. Wales has the natural resources to lead a green energy revolution through tidal energy and offshore wind, but we need to see this same level of investment extended to projects like the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon.”

Unite: “A step forward but a missed opportunity”

Trade union Unite said the announcement was welcome but criticised the government for not opting for a larger gigawatt-scale nuclear station at Wylfa.

General secretary Sharon Graham said: “Unite is a strong supporter of the development of SMRs, but a failure to support a giga-watt nuclear power station at Wylfa would be a huge missed opportunity in securing the UK’s energy security.

“The UK is crying out for a joined-up energy strategy that ensures long-term energy security while maximising well-paid, highly skilled jobs for British workers.”

Unite national officer Simon Coop added: “While there are several places where SMRs could be sited, Wylfa is by far the best placed for a giga-watt nuclear power station. This would bring substantial jobs and investment to Anglesey.”

Reform UK: “Long overdue”

Reform UK Wales also welcomed the news but accused successive governments of dragging their feet.

A spokesperson said: “This announcement is long overdue and, if the political will had been there, we could have been well on our way to generating nuclear power from Wylfa by now.

“With energy costs soaring and unemployment rising in Wales, we should be taking a lead on nuclear power, not dawdling as we have done now for many years. Sadly, lukewarm support from Plaid Cymru for nuclear has also played a role in slowing this down.”

A new chapter for Wylfa

The original Wylfa Nuclear Power Station, near Cemaes, provided stable employment from the 1960s until its decommissioning in 2015. If the new project goes ahead as planned, it would mark the revival of one of Wales’ most iconic industrial sites — bringing new life and purpose to Anglesey’s north coast.

However, with questions over scale, local employment, and community impact still to be resolved, the challenge now is to ensure that Wylfa’s future truly delivers for the people of Wales.",https://herald.wales/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wylfa-nuclear-power-station-e1758076733193.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 11:02:17.464757

Another partner in our un-evil empire!” Create Energy is aiming to establish a US solar and renewables manufacturing “one-stop-shop” for PV hardware, balance-of-system components, energy storage solutions and electric vehicle infrastructure.
US solar supply consolidation Create has established other partnerships with European manufacturers to establish US production lines.
Create’s ambitious plans to bring the US solar supply chain under one roof reflect a broader consolidation trend in the hardware and BOS sector.
In offering simplified procurement options – Solon’s “one-stop-shop” – firms such as Nextpower and Create Energy will anticipate strong positions in the US renewables market.","The company said the connector will be designed to withstand the mechanical stress and environmental conditions unique to solar trackers, and Create said it would harness Stäubli’s expertise and material strength to “enhance connector longevity, reduce maintenance costs, and improve overall energy yield”.

“The misuse of PV connectors in the tracker market has been a huge issue, compromising EBOS [electrical balance-of-system] integrity and long-term performance,” said Dean Solon, founder and CEO at Create Energy.

Production is slated to begin in 2026, Tennessee-based Create said, with distribution in North America and international markets.

“I have been friends with Ian Pratt and the North American Stäubli team for over 20 years,” Solon said. “This partnership with Stäubli allows us to deliver a purpose-built solution that not only solves this problem but also pushes the industry forward. Another partner in our un-evil empire!”

Create Energy is aiming to establish a US solar and renewables manufacturing “one-stop-shop” for PV hardware, balance-of-system components, energy storage solutions and electric vehicle infrastructure. Its OnTrack programme “allows customers to purchase everything they need directly from Create”, the company said.

Stäubli has also announced plans to expand its US manufacturing base, investing millions in its California and South Carolina manufacturing plants last year.

US solar supply consolidation

Create has established other partnerships with European manufacturers to establish US production lines. In September it unveiled a partnership with German solar inverter producer SMA Solar to establish US inverter production, specifically aiming to produce SMA’s Sunny Highpower PEAK3 string inverter and PowerSkid turnkey solution. If successful, this plan would result in the first US-produced SMA products since it abandoned its previous facility in 2016.

In comments to PV Tech, Solon outlined his plans for Create’s “one-stop-shop” supply model.

His aim is to change the current market landscape, where “the typical company buys this module, buys this tracker, buys this e-bos, buys this inverter, buys this blah, blah, blah, right?” And at each step of the procurement process, each supplier adds a profit margin. “The project becomes expensive as hell,” Solon said in an interview with PV Tech following the announcement of SMA partnership.

“So what we’re doing is… we have a menu board. Like McDonald’s. I want a burger, I want burger and fries, or I want a combo meal. You drive up, you order what you want, you pick it up at the window, right? So, with us, we have a menu board; take what you want.”

The “menu” in this case consists of modules, trackers, EBOS systems, connectors, inverters; any part of the solar array a developer might need.

“And then we’ll have a lot of this material just sitting in warehouses ready to ship,” he says.

Create’s ambitious plans to bring the US solar supply chain under one roof reflect a broader consolidation trend in the hardware and BOS sector. US tracker producer Nextracker announced a rebrand this week to reflect its shifting focus towards “full-platform” energy solutions.

Now known as Nextpower, the company has been on an acquisition spree in recent months, broadening its offering from tracker production to include module frame manufacturing, EBOS solutions and solar project foundations. Fellow US tracker firms, Array Technologies and FTC Solar have also made acquisitions in recent months.

The already complex US solar supply landscape became harder with the election of Donald Trump and the passage of the “One, Big, Beautiful” budget reconciliation bill, which introduced more stringent supply criteria for renewable energy projects alongside the US president’s imposition of global tariffs on imports.

The firms’ joint venture, RV Tech, is making advancements on an EV electrical and software platform for Volkswagen.

It has begun engaging third parties on its scalability.

RV Tech’s near-term focus is delivering the platform for Rivian and Volkswagen models, with testing scheduled on Audi, VW and Scout vehicles from the first quarter of 2026.

The partners set up the JV a year ago, combining developers and engineers from both companies.

They are adopting Rivian’s centralised electronics architecture with fewer computing units to simplify development and reducing expenses.

Rivian software chief and RV Tech co-chair Wassym Bensaid said: “We’re solving a problem for the larger automotive industry.

“That could become an opportunity.”

The technology is engineered to be scalable across multiple vehicle sizes and segments in Western markets.

It also shares elements that could be applied to combustion-engine models, RV Tech co-chair Carsten Helbing said.

The inaugural model to use the solution will be Rivian’s R2 SUV, due early 2026.

Volkswagen’s compact ID. EVERY1, anticipated to cost around €20,000 ($23,000), is slated for 2027, followed by Scout-branded models.

Volkswagen also maintains a separate partnership with Xpeng for China.

Volkswagen has previously licensed its first-generation EV platform to Ford and Mahindra & Mahindra.

The German group is turning to Rivian as it faces US tariffs, softer demand in Europe and declining deliveries in China, investing up to $5.8bn in the alliance under CEO Oliver Blume, as per the Bloomberg report.

For Rivian, which is loss-making, the deal provides critical funding amid a broader EV market slowdown.

“It was data centers that really brought it all together.” Olson’s organization is running a campaign to persuade Indiana lawmakers to place a moratorium on new data centers and to redesign electricity rates to protect residential consumers from rate increases related to data center development.
While much of the discussion is about data centers, the underlying issues are broader, touching on the power of tech companies.
For people who live near proposed data centers, there is an additional sense of powerlessness, which Inside Climate News has documented across the country, including the backlash to a plan for a huge data center in Bessemer, Alabama.
Olson said he agrees that there is some overlap between opposition to data centers and large renewable energy development, but he views the latter as more of a rural phenomenon, while concern about data centers is rising almost everywhere.","It’s not a novel observation to say that supporters of President Donald Trump and supporters of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders find common ground on many issues. They often share a skepticism of entrenched power and a desire to dismantle systems that they think have ceased to serve everyday people.

In Indiana, this agreement includes a distrust of data centers.

“The MAGA crowd and the Bernie bros have both figured out that they’ve been getting duped,” said Kerwin Olson, executive director of Citizens Action Coalition, an Indianapolis-based consumer and environmental advocacy nonprofit. “It was data centers that really brought it all together.”

Olson’s organization is running a campaign to persuade Indiana lawmakers to place a moratorium on new data centers and to redesign electricity rates to protect residential consumers from rate increases related to data center development.

He has received an emphatic response, with groups from the left, right and in-between booking him for speaking engagements and offering their assistance.

Election results last week confirm a similar dynamic in much of the country. Democrats won races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia and for two open seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission, campaigns in which data centers and rising electricity costs were issues. Media outlets noted this pattern, including in an insightful report from Jael Holzman of Heatmap and a look ahead to next year’s elections from Marc Levy and Jesse Bedayn of the Associated Press.

While much of the discussion is about data centers, the underlying issues are broader, touching on the power of tech companies. For people who live near proposed data centers, there is an additional sense of powerlessness, which Inside Climate News has documented across the country, including the backlash to a plan for a huge data center in Bessemer, Alabama.

“It’s about big tech,” Olson said. “To steal Bernie’s words, [it’s about] these big tech oligarchs that are calling all the shots at every single level of government right now.”

I also see some similarities with local opposition to large wind and solar projects, a subject I’ve written a lot about over the years. A common theme is that residents feel frustrated when powerful companies want to make changes that would alter local landscapes.

Olson said he agrees that there is some overlap between opposition to data centers and large renewable energy development, but he views the latter as more of a rural phenomenon, while concern about data centers is rising almost everywhere.

Google scrapped its plans for a large data center in Indianapolis in September amid local backlash. In northwest Indiana, residents in the small city of Hobart have organized to oppose two data centers, raising concerns about the projects’ electricity and water consumption.

It’s notable that the opposition tends to highlight concerns about high electricity bills, but doesn’t talk as much about data centers’ negative climate impacts. Indiana can see the ramifications as officials push to delay the retirement of coal-fired power plants so the state can meet an expected surge in electricity demand, driven, in part, by data centers.

Political candidates can harness this mounting opposition and data center companies will need to devote more resources to engaging with the public.

Vivek Shastry, a senior research associate at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, told me that it’s important for the AI and data center industries to find ways to provide local benefits to host communities and to minimize any negative effects on household electricity costs.

He touched on these subjects in a recent blog post, co-written with his colleague Diana Hernández. When I read this, my first thought was, “Wait, there are local benefits?”

He explained that there are opportunities in terms of energy and money. He pointed to examples in Denmark and Finland of data centers harnessing their waste heat to contribute to district heating systems for local communities.

Beyond that—which I think would be a challenge to do in the United States—he said AI and data center developers can make community benefits part of their proposals. This could mean working with local leaders to find ways to address local needs through philanthropy.

“To the extent that there is a partnership with communities, and there are these pathways to enable tangible co-benefits,” he said.

The opposite can also be true, with local communities feeling like they are bearing the burden of a data center with few, if any, benefits.

Shastry’s larger point is that government officials and corporate leaders need to make sure that development does not harm the most vulnerable consumers by driving up costs of water and electricity. To do otherwise would feed into consumer unrest.

“It’s important to get those processes and protections right early on, because the pace of this growth is such that once you lock into certain kinds of rates and other pathways, it then becomes harder to reverse,” Shastry said.

Voters are already getting upset about electricity rate increases that they blame on data centers, even though the AI industry is in its infancy. The negative effects, if left to fester, could get much worse.

But there also is evidence that state officials have a sense of the challenge before them. The NC Clean Energy Technology Center at North Carolina State University shows this in its most recent quarterly report, the 50 States of Power Decarbonization.

From July to September, state regulators or legislators took 55 actions in 29 states related to laws or rules for large electricity users, which were usually motivated by the growth of data centers.

Some highlights:

The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved a proposal from the utility American Electric Power to create a new rate category for data centers that have electricity demand of at least 25 megawatts. Businesses in this category have special requirements, including that they must sign a 12-year contract. The practical effect is that data centers that close or use much less power than planned will still need to pay, which can help to shield other customers from covering the costs of lines and other infrastructure built to serve these large projects.

Florida Power & Light, a utility, entered into a settlement with other parties in a rate case that includes new rate categories for large power users such as data centers. The rates would cover new projects that need at least 50 megawatts, with provisions requiring companies to pay even if they use less power than planned. The Office of Public Counsel has said the settlement is “disproportionately favorable” to corporate interests.

In Delaware, the Public Service Commission staff and the Division of the Public Advocate jointly requested that the utility, Delmarva Power and Light, institute a new rate category for customers that need at least 25 megawatts. Delmarva responded by saying it would like the commission to hold a hearing on the subject.

As recently as two years ago, there was almost no activity in this policy area. Next year at this time, I expect to see action in nearly every state.

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:

IEA Report Points to Oil Peak and Continuing Renewables Surge, But Trump Has Hurt Progress: The world remains on track to reach peak oil in about 2030 if countries stick to their stated policies, according to the new edition of the World Energy Outlook from the International Energy Agency. But this outlook is worse for the climate than the one issued last year, due in large part to changes in climate policy by President Donald Trump, as my colleague Blanca Begert reports. One key difference is that the drop-off from the peak would be more gradual than the agency had previously indicated. The peak and ensuing decline in fossil fuels would be driven by the rapid growth of carbon-free electricity sources such as wind and solar.

How the Trump Administration Is Seeking to Gut the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations: The Trump administration is proposing a $0 budget for the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, underscoring how far the office has fallen since it was a key part of planning for the country’s energy future, as Maria Gallucci reports for Canary Media. The office, which is part of the Department of Energy, was created by Congress in 2021 and received $27 billion to fund projects to scale up clean energy technologies. The sudden shift in funding priorities is ceding leadership to other countries, especially China, and is baffling to people who were connected to the office.

Sunrun Reports a Quadrupling of Participation in Virtual Power Plants: Sunrun, the rooftop solar and battery company, said 106,000 of its customers are now participating in home-to-grid virtual power plant programs, which is an increase of more than 400 percent from a year ago, as Brian Martucci reports for Utility Dive. Sunrun also said its business model, which encourages solar leasing and monthly subscription fees, positions the company to maintain growth even after an expected sales cliff in the rooftop solar industry when federal tax credits expire at the end of the year.

Green Steelmaking Advocates Look for Paths Forward Without U.S. Government Support: The Trump administration’s policies are reducing support for green steelmaking, leading companies and advocates to figure out how to maintain momentum in the short run, as my colleague Kiley Bense reports. The Ohio River Valley Institute, a nonprofit that promotes economic growth and clean energy in Appalachia, issued a report summarizing the effects of federal actions, such as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s phaseout of a tax credit for clean hydrogen in 2027 rather than the previous 2032. Despite the setbacks, companies are still moving forward with plans to use hydrogen to produce steel, including a plant in Louisiana being built by Hyundai.

It is Toyota’s 11th U.S. plant and the company’s first and only battery plant outside of Japan. The nearly $14 billion facility will create up to 5,100 jobs.

This will bring the company’s total U.S. investment to nearly $60 billion since beginning operations here nearly 70 years ago.

“Today’s launch of Toyota’s first U.S. battery plant and additional U.S. investment up to $10 billion marks a pivotal moment in our company’s history,” said Ted Ogawa, president and chief executive officer, Toyota Motor North America. “Toyota is a pioneer in electrified vehicles, and the company’s significant manufacturing investment in the U.S. and North Carolina further solidifies our commitment to team members, customers, dealers, communities, and suppliers.”

The 1,850-acre mega site can produce 30 GWh annually at full capacity, Toyota said. It will serve as Toyota’s hub for developing and producing lithium-ion batteries needed for its ever-growing portfolio of electrified vehicles.

The plant will house 14 battery production lines supporting hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), making it a historical investment for Toyota and a substantial economic impact on the Tarheel State.

Batteries assembled at Toyota North Carolina are set to power the Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, RAV4 HEV, and a yet-to-be-announced all-electric 3-row BEV — the first of its kind for Toyota to be built in the U.S. Currently, the plant ships HEV modules to Toyota Kentucky and Mazda Toyota Manufacturing in Huntsville.

Nationally, EV sales hit a record 10.5% of the market this past quarter, according to Cox Automotive.
Obviously, taking away a $7,500 tax credit doesn’t help,” Doll said of the auto market under the Trump administration.
“The other 92% of inventory that dealers sell isn’t affected by that tax credit,” he said.
Anecdotally, he said, he’s already hearing about a dropoff in EV sales at Illinois dealerships.","Illinois squeaked in a record share of electric vehicle sales last quarter, on par with a national trend tied to the Trump administration’s decision to end lucrative federal tax credits.

Still, the state remains far short of Gov. JB Pritzker’s ongoing push to get 1 million electric vehicles on Illinois roads by 2030.

“Sales definitely went up,” Jeff Foltz, president of the independent market analysis firm Auto Outlook, said of purchases both in Illinois and across the country as the end of the tax credit pulled demand forward. “We saw it measured here in market share, and to me, it does speak to demand for battery electric vehicles.”

The third quarter of this year saw EV sales grow to 8.4% of overall vehicle sales in Illinois, a record, according to data from Experian Automotive published in Illinois Auto Outlook, a local publication of Foltz’s group. That was up a percentage point from the same period last year and from 7.1% the previous quarter, the data showed.

The bump in EV purchases followed President Donald Trump’s administration and congressional Republicans’ decision to end federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles and $4,000 for used EVs at the end of September, part of a broader tax and spending plan signed over the summer.

Analysts had expected the looming deadline to drive up sales — and it did, in Illinois and across the U.S., as people on the fence about getting a new all-electric vehicle were incentivized to buy before the credit expired.

Nationally, EV sales hit a record 10.5% of the market this past quarter, according to Cox Automotive. But the group also forecast a sales slump in the current quarter as automakers pull back on their plans.

Early state data suggest that pattern is already playing out in Illinois. The secretary of state’s office recorded more than 4,100 EVs purchased in August and 5,400 in September — a sharp increase from earlier months — but only about 1,100 in October, after the federal tax credit expired, according to the office’s data of confirmed and pending vehicle titles.

While the federal tax credit is gone, Illinois still offers a state rebate of up to $4,000 on all-electric vehicles for low-income applicants, according to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. In addition, Commonwealth Edison, the state’s largest electric utility, offers rebates to commercial EV buyers and incentives for people charging EVs at home.

The EV purchases in Illinois overall remain about on par with the national average for EV adoption, which hovers around 8.5% to 9%. That national percentage has been pulled up by a few select states, such as California and Oregon, which have rates above 20%, said Foltz, who works on dozens of markets nationwide.

The goal of getting 1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030 is etched into Illinois’ Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, the ambitious climate legislation Pritzker signed in 2021 that also phases out fossil fuels over the next two decades.

But even with the recent uptick in EV purchases, Illinois is not on track to hit that goal.

The state has roughly 156,000 fully electric vehicles registered, up from about 33,000 the day Pritzker signed CEJA, but hundreds of thousands short of the 2030 goal, according to the secretary of state’s office data, and now without the benefit of a federal tax credit unless it’s reinstated.

The 156,000 EVs in Illinois, as tracked by the secretary of state’s office, do not include plug-in hybrids, which Pritzker spokeswoman Andres Correa said count toward the 1 million EV goal; however, the governor’s office was unable to provide a total count that includes plug-in hybrids. Nationally, plug-in hybrid adoption represents a far smaller share of the market than battery-only electric vehicles, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

There does not appear to be any consequence laid out in state statute if the state can’t reach 1 million EVs in the next five years. Correa said the state is still working toward the goal with or without buy-in from the federal government.

“Illinois has seen unprecedented growth of electric vehicles in 2025, thanks in part to the state’s leadership and incentives that make it easier for families to make the switch,” Correa said in a statement. “While Donald Trump and his allies have rolled back federal clean energy incentives, Illinois is moving in the opposite direction — continuing to invest in jobs, infrastructure, and consumer savings that come with a clean energy economy.”

Correa said Illinois is “strengthening our EV manufacturing base, maintaining some of the most generous state-level incentives in the nation, and keeping Illinois on the road to a cleaner, more affordable transportation future.”

Illinois’ EV rebate plan, which began in 2022, offers $4,000 to low-income applicants and $2,000 to others. The incentive is expected to drop in 2028.

The state this year restricted the rebate to middle-income and lower-income buyers at 500% or less of the federal poverty line, and it capped the price of eligible vehicles at $80,000, said Brian Urbaszewski, director of environmental health programs at Respiratory Health Association. The goal of that change was getting more EVs into lower-income communities that are disproportionately affected by climate change, he said.

As lower-income buyers are pulled to the front of the line to access a limited rebate pool, some people who apply each year for the state rebate may never receive it, he added.

There have also been bumps in the road as the Trump administration opposes what it describes as EV “mandates” and a rushed transition away from traditional cars.

The Trump administration earlier this year withheld more than $18 million in grants for EV charging stations in Illinois, according to the Pritzker administration, before Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and other state attorneys general successfully sued to restore the funds.

The most recent round of those grants announced in September will fund 167 chargers at 25 charging stations, according to the state. The administration has highlighted that many of the charging stations expected under the grant program are outside Cook County, as it seeks to expand EV adoption statewide.

There are 106 state-funded charging station locations currently online, with more public chargers expected next year through CEJA and federal funding, according to the governor’s office.

Making sure existing federal funds get out the door is a key priority for the Respiratory Health Association, which, as a member of the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition, helps shape state policy, Urbaszewski said. The association isn’t specifically pushing for more money in the EV rebate program at this point but is evaluating it and many incentives for EV chargers and adoption, he said.

Getting a million EVs on the road seemed like “a modest goal at the time,” Urbaszewski said, as the state looks to phase out fossil fuels. Now, the federal government is “stopping resources cold that were anticipated to still be there when that goal was set,” he said.

The Illinois Automobile Dealers Association is not currently pursuing any new state incentives to make up for the loss of the federal credit, legal counsel Larry Doll said.

“There are a lot of headwinds right now between the uncertain tariff situation. Obviously, taking away a $7,500 tax credit doesn’t help,” Doll said of the auto market under the Trump administration.

Still, dealers are more focused on other policies, such as a franchise tax issue, and some are readjusting their inventory after they sold off many of their EVs in August and September, he said.

“The other 92% of inventory that dealers sell isn’t affected by that tax credit,” he said.

Anecdotally, he said, he’s already hearing about a dropoff in EV sales at Illinois dealerships.

Despite Illinois’ lofty goals and the expected slump in EV sales nationwide, Foltz of Auto Outlook said he doesn’t think the data shows there’s no demand for EVs.

“If the price of broccoli was going to double next month, it would not make me buy any more broccoli today,” Foltz said, as a metaphor for something he has no desire to buy. But if the price of beer were going up, he said, “I would rush out.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ctc-l-ev-sales-bump-05.jpg?w=1024&h=655,N,,2025-11-13 10:00:31.250563

The program aims to attract $2.8 billion in private investment, add 2.8 GW of renewable capacity by 2028, and create 30,000 jobs.

Tunisia targets a 23% cut in power supply costs, improved STEG cost recovery from 60% to 80%, and a $698 million reduction in public subsidies.

The World Bank has approved $430 million in financing to support Tunisia’s energy sector reform and transition. The funding will go to the Tunisian Energy Reliability, Efficiency and Governance Enhancement Program (TEREG), designed to boost efficiency, governance, and renewable energy deployment, the bank said in a statement on November 11, 2025.

The five-year program includes $30 million in concessional financing from the Climate Investment Funds. It aims to help Tunisia establish a sustainable, reliable, and affordable electricity supply while cutting carbon emissions and improving sector governance.

TEREG will accelerate the development of renewable energy projects and strengthen the operational and financial performance of the Société Tunisienne de l’Électricité et du Gaz (STEG), the state-owned utility.

“By promoting renewable energy development, the TEREG program will help position Tunisia as a regional leader in clean energy, create economic opportunities, and secure long-term energy stability,” said Alexandre Arrobbio, the World Bank’s Country Operations Manager for Tunisia.

Tunisia, now a net importer of hydrocarbons, faces a widening energy deficit due to falling domestic oil and gas production. The country is intensifying efforts to diversify its energy mix and reduce dependence on imports.

The TEREG program is expected to attract $2.8 billion in additional private investments to install 2.8 gigawatts of new solar and wind capacity by 2028. It will also create more than 30,000 jobs while improving cost efficiency and reducing state subsidies.

According to the World Bank, the reforms will lower electricity supply costs by 23%, raise STEG’s cost recovery rate from 60% to 80%, and cut government subsidies by 2.045 billion dinars ($698 million).

The new funding complements ongoing initiatives such as the Tunisia–Italy power interconnection project (ELMED), the Energy Sector Improvement Project, and advisory services from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).

TEREG aligns fully with Tunisia’s updated national energy transition strategy, which seeks to establish a low-carbon, economically sustainable energy model. The government aims to raise the share of renewables to 35% of total energy generation by 2030.

The plant now has four production lines in operation making cells for the batteries in standard hybrid vehicles.

Eventually, the company expects it to have 14 lines, with some also producing cells for plug-in type hybrids and all-electric vehicles.

Hybrids are in heavier demand than all-electric vehicles, at least for now.

Company officials emphasized that Toyota wants to produce the full range of different types of electrified vehicles that customers desire. They said the Liberty plant was designed to be flexible so as the market shifts among different kinds of vehicles, the mix of cells can change.

EXPLORATION BET What perhaps best highlights Chevron’s long-term bullishness is its increasing investments in oil and gas exploration.
In recent months, Chevron expanded its exploration activity in several basins including Namibia, Egypt and South America.","When warnings abound about an imminent collapse in oil prices, one would not expect the CEO of a major oil company to boast that he has never been more confident.

Yet that was precisely the message conveyed in Chevron’s updated strategy, unveiled by CEO Mike Wirth on Wednesday. He shrugged off concerns about oversupply in the near term and exuded confidence in the sector’s long-term outlook, brushing aside doubts that hovered over the industry only a few years ago as momentum built for the transition away from fossil fuels toward low-carbon energy.

It appears that U.S. President Donald Trump’s strong support of the fossil fuel industry and his “energy dominance” agenda have provided Chevron – like its Big Oil peers – with a meaningful tailwind.

“Never in my career have I seen a higher confidence outlook,” Wirth told investors. “The best is yet to come.”

Such confidence is striking when the U.S. Energy Information Administration expects oil prices to average $55 a barrel next year, down from $69 this year.

NEAR-TERM RETRENCHMENT

What a company says is one thing, though. What it does is far more important.

Oil and gas companies’ spending plans are a strong gauge for their near- and long-term risk appetite as many energy projects such as offshore oilfields or liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants require billions of dollars and years to develop, and many more years to generate returns.

It is therefore notable that Chevron is paring back its capital expenditures by $1 billion from previous guidance to a range of $18 billion to $21 billion per year into 2030.

The U.S.’s second-largest oil company also appears to be retrenching – albeit modestly – in the face of significant uncertainty over the supply and demand balance in the global oil market.

The International Energy Agency is currently forecasting a huge oversupply next year of 4 million barrels per day, around 4% of global supply, which, if accurate, could cause oil prices to crater.

Chevron’s minor pullback, however, suggests its thinking may be more aligned with OPEC analysts, who expect supply to roughly match demand next year, or others who believe any oversupply will be modest and short-lived.

LONG-TERM BOOM

Further out, Chevron’s actions seem to more closely match its messaging, as the company is clearly betting on continued growth in oil demand and a race to offset shrinking supplies.

Chevron plans to grow oil and gas production by 2% to 3% per year through 2030. It currently produces around 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.

“There is need for significant investment to close the oil supply gap, equivalent to five Saudi Arabias” over the next decade, Wirth said.

Crucially, Chevron noted it plans to keep production in the U.S. Permian shale basin stable at 1 million bpd through 2040 while also reducing investment to around $3.5 billion per year from $4.5 billion to $5 billion currently.

Chevron argues that improved drilling techniques will enable it to maintain production without having to drill new wells at the current pace – a fairly bold forecast given standard practices for shale oil drilling, also known as fracking.

Chevron is not the only big shale producer to indicate that it can profitably sustain and even grow shale production for many more years. Both ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips suggest they can do the same, another indication of the industry’s growing confidence.

EXPLORATION BET

What perhaps best highlights Chevron’s long-term bullishness is its increasing investments in oil and gas exploration. This high-risk, high-reward business requires heavy investment, and it often takes over a decade or more to move from first drilling to the start of production.

In recent months, Chevron expanded its exploration activity in several basins including Namibia, Egypt and South America. The company plans to increase its annual exploration budget by 50% over the next few years. What’s more, it poached TotalEnergies’ exploration chief, Kevin McLachlan, in October to lead its exploration programme.

Does this mean we should expect a repeat of the start of this century, when huge, almost unimpeded investments in new oil and gas resources led to massive overspending and poor returns?

Probably not, as Big Oil companies are now hyper-focused on profitability and have instituted cost-saving practices that can allow them to generate profit even if oil prices hit $50 or below. Chevron aims to reduce structural costs by $3 billion to $4 billion by the end of 2026, including by laying off over 15% of its global workforce.

This spending discipline should enable Chevron and its peers to continue investing with greater confidence through peaks and troughs in the market over the coming years. That, in turn, also indicates that the market is apt to remain well supplied for the foreseeable future.

What is missing from all of this is a serious consideration of the energy transition. It is perhaps fitting that Chevron’s strategy update came on the day the IEA published a new long-term outlook that suggests oil demand may continue rising into 2050, having previously suggested it would begin to plateau in 2030.

This may be music to Big Oil’s ears, but if the energy transition picks up steam again – as many expect it will – Chevron and the rest of the industry could be in for a harsh reality check.

The suit alleges that the law, which restricts investor access to expert advice and penalizes consideration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, violates the First Amendment. It also contends that the law’s broad language may have a chilling effect on the investor community and related organizations.

COMPLAINT

1. Plaintiffs challenge a recently enacted Texas law, Senate Bill 2337 (“SB 2337” or the “Act”), which unconstitutionally chills shareholder advocacy, including research and analysis, that seeks to influence corporate behavior toward long-term value. For two of the three plaintiffs, SB 2337 also chills speech about value-based investing, including investing based on their religious beliefs.

INTRODUCTION

2. In enacting SB 2337, the Texas Legislature devised a solution in want of a problem. Institutional investors that partner with organizations to engage in shareholder advocacy and obtain proxy voting information do not require protection from the free flow of such information. But under the pretext of protecting Texas investors, the Legislature passed this law to suppress growing shareholder demands that companies consider important issues that can affect long-term performance. In doing so, SB 2337 attacks shareholder rights that are embedded in the relationship between our democracy and the free-enterprise system.

3. Central to an investor’s rights is the right to invest consistent with one’s goals, investment discipline, and values—and to gather information to meet these investment goals. Yet SB 2337 penalizes firms and non-profit organizations for providing this type of information and advice when it is inconsistent with the State’s beliefs. The State defines the type of speech it disfavors as “nonfinancial,” and requires that organizations that provide so-called “nonfinancial” information and advice publicly pronounce that this information and advice is not “solely in the financial interest of the company’s shareholders.”

4. Setting aside the wisdom of SB 2337, the law is indefensible because it violates the Constitution on three levels: first, it restricts speech on the basis of its content and viewpoint without a compelling state interest for doing so; second, it compels private actors to speak against their will and communicate messages reflecting the State’s viewpoint; and, third, its vagueness oversteps the limits of due process because, among other things, the Act could be construed to sweep in activity that is not by any objective definition proxy advising.

SUMMARY OF THE CASE

5. Plaintiffs are nonprofit organizations that, as part of their missions, partner with institutional investors to engage with companies to seek strong long-term financial performance. As part of seeking that performance, Plaintiffs consider the environmental and social impacts of company practices, as well as strong corporate governance and other factors, because they believe that these factors can be central to the long-term financial success of companies. Those considerations include sustainability and, for two of the Plaintiffs, their religious beliefs.

6. Plaintiff Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR) is a coalition of investors who believe their faith or their values should—and as fiduciaries must—guide their investing decisions, including their investment stewardship. Plaintiff United Church Funds (UCF) is a faith-based organization that provides investment services to United Church of Christ (UCC) churches and other faith-based nonprofit organizations nationwide. Plaintiff Ceres is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the notion that accounting for sustainability is a financial imperative for companies.

7. The State of Texas can disagree with Plaintiffs’ view that sustainability-related risks have financial effects on investment portfolios and corporate bottom lines, and Plaintiffs ICCR’s and UCF’s view that their values and religious beliefs are relevant to investment-related decisions. What it cannot do is compel Plaintiffs to speak in furtherance of Texas’s views about these issues. Yet the recently enacted SB 2337 does precisely that.

a) First, SB 2337 divides proxy voting advice into two arbitrary categories that are not used by organizations engaged in proxy advising—advice that is based solely on the financial interest of investors and advice that is based in whole or in part on nonfinancial factors. The Act does nothing to define what “financial interest” of the shareholders means.

b) Second, SB 2337 establishes a definition for “nonfinancial factors” that includes factors that are widely recognized in the financial sector as pertinent to financial interests, such as “environmental, social, or governance (ESG)” goals and “diversity, equity, or inclusion (DEI).” SB 2337 also fails to recognize that the terms “ESG” and “DEI” have a wide variety of meanings and applications to different entities within the investment community and fails to define them in the Act.

c) Third, the Act imposes burdensome disclosure requirements on organizations that render advice that is based to any degree on the consideration of “nonfinancial factors” as defined by the statute. Chief among them, the Act forces Plaintiffs to say something that is both contrary to their core principles and with which they disagree: that environmental and social risks are unrelated to financial interest. These disclosure requirements will undermine those organizations’ credibility with their clients and members, mandate that they disclose detailed financial analyses, and force them to report nonpublic communications with their clients to the companies being evaluated.

d) Fourth, the Act deems failure to comply with any aspect of SB 2337 as a violation of law that can be pursued by the State, shareholders who did not receive the advice, or the company that is the subject of the advice. Additionally, SB 2337 authorizes the Attorney General to pursue steep penalties—$10,000 per violation—under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act for any violation of SB 2337.

8. This Court has already found that SB 2337 is likely unconstitutional and unenforceable against the two firms that dominate the proxy advisory business: Glass Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis) and Institutional Shareholder Services, Inc. (ISS). See Glass Lewis & Co. v. Paxton, 25-cv-01153 (W.D. Tex. Aug. 29, 2025); Institutional S’holder Servs., Inc. v. Paxton, 25-cv-01160 (W.D. Tex. Aug. 29, 2025). But the Act’s definitions of “proxy advisor” and “proxy advisory service” sweep much broader than those two firms and include small organizations and non-profits that engage in shareholder advocacy, public education, investing consultation, and investment research. The “proxy advisor” definition does not define “compensation.” And the Act’s overbroad definition of “proxy advisory service” includes research and analysis (even without recommendations) and generic recommendations (not applied to a particular company). SB 2337 could therefore apply to Plaintiffs and many other organizations like them.

9. Because SB 2337 is written both so vaguely and so broadly, every application of the Act creates an impermissible risk of the suppression of ideas. Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief barring any enforcement of SB 2337.

PARTIES

10. Plaintiff Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization chartered in the State of New York. ICCR is a coalition of faith- and values-based investors that engage with corporations as shareholders on the impact of corporate policies and practices on people and the environment, and the risks and opportunities therein, with the goal of enhancing the long-term value of companies. Their membership includes faith communities, asset management companies, pension funds, foundation endowments, and other institutional investors engaging in sustainable investing strategies.

11. Following their guiding principle “that sustainable corporations must look beyond the next earnings report to account for the full impact of their business on society,” ICCR and its members believe that sustainability is integral to the long-term value of a company.

12. ICCR’s membership includes a broad range of both religious and secular organizations concerned with the impacts of corporate practices on people, communities, and the environment, and a collective commitment to bring these concerns to companies through direct, collaborative engagement. Approximately three hundred institutional investors currently belong to ICCR, including asset owners and asset managers holding or managing over $4 trillion in invested capital. These members make both the moral and business case for improved corporate performance along certain metrics, including some metrics that can be characterized as ESG.

13. ICCR’s faith-based members, which account for more than half of its total membership, have investment policies based on their faith and the values of their religious institutions. These members have a fiduciary obligation to invest in accordance with the principles of their religious denomination, including through shareholder engagement with companies. Shareholder proposals are a critical type of such engagement. ICCR views shareholder proposals as both a fundamental investor right and a critical tool to bring issues of concern to the boards and management of companies. ICCR members use the shareholder engagement process, including shareholder proposals, to be in dialogue with companies on issues of concern and advocate that companies consider their impact on stakeholders over the long term to build financial success.

14. ICCR members have engaged with publicly traded companies for more than 50 years through dialogue about issues important to their beliefs and in alignment with their fiduciary duties. Although ICCR does not recommend to its members how they should vote on specific shareholder proposals, ICCR’s activities are designed to make members aware of shareholder proposals of interest and assist with the shareholder proposal process. As part of those activities, ICCR publishes a proxy book containing all shareholder resolutions ICCR members have filed, disseminates information on shareholder proposals, issues press releases on resolutions deemed important to ICCR membership, and leads webinars where members can provide information to other shareholders about resolutions that they have filed. It also maintains a confidential database accessible only to its members that tracks company engagements and helps to evaluate the impact of those engagements.

15. Plaintiff United Church Funds (UCF) is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit affiliated with the United Church of Christ (UCC). For over 100 years, UCF has served churches and other faith-based nonprofit organizations, helping the faith community steward their financial resources in ways that align with their values. It seeks strong financial performance while advocating for ethical and just corporate behavior, including sustainability. For UCF, its investment work is an extension of its faith-rooted mission to care for creation, uplift human dignity, and ensure that capital serves the common good.

16. UCF provides investment services to over 1,100 local churches, judicatories, denominational ministries, seminaries, and healthcare institutions affiliated with the UCC, as well as to faith-based organizations beyond the UCC. UCF offers sustainable and responsible investments and maintains funds that enable clients to customize their portfolios according to risk tolerance and return objectives. It has over $1.3 billion in assets under management, held in 11 professionally managed and socially responsible funds.

17. UCF’s investment work is an extension of its faith-rooted mission. Since its founding, the ethical principles of the Christian faith have guided UCF, which believes that responsible investing should be connected to purpose. UCF is committed to seeking a more just and sustainable world and views that work as essential to its mission. As part of its mission, UCF engages in active ownership. It engages with companies in which it invests, votes its shares, files proposals, and works with others (including ICCR) to raise questions about sustainability, governance practices, and more.

18. UCF clients are unitholders in the organization’s pooled funds (not shareholders with voting rights), meaning UCF votes the shares in the pooled funds. Therefore, UCF does not recommend how its clients should vote on specific shareholder proposals. In explaining how UCF has voted its own shares, however, UCF includes analysis that considers a number of social, environmental, and economic issues. In addition, UCF signs investor letters and occasionally files exempt solicitations with the SEC (communications from one shareholder to others) describing how UCF itself has voted or intends to vote on particular proposals.

19. Plaintiff Ceres is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit advocacy organization working to accelerate the transition to a cleaner, more just, and resilient economy. It makes the business case for taking action on sustainability issues, including climate change, water scarcity, and pollution. As part of its work, Ceres engages with investors and companies to promote its belief that “sustainability is the bottom line.” That is, the organization views sustainability as a necessary component of business, and one that is critical to long-term profitability.

20. Because Ceres believes that sustainability financially impacts investment portfolios and long-term corporate profitability, the organization thinks it is critical that investors and companies address sustainability risks and opportunities as part of their financial analysis. Ceres believes that taking sustainability seriously presents a tremendous business opportunity to drive innovation and economic growth, and that investors and companies are well positioned to help further that innovation and growth.

21. Ceres thus engages with investors, companies, policymakers, and regulators to build responsible leadership that helps further the idea that sustainability is good for business. That engagement includes, among other things, providing data-driven research on the financial risks and opportunities associated with sustainability issues, supporting investors and companies as they set practical goals, developing transition plans, implementing strategies that boost profitability, and engaging policymakers across the political spectrum to advance market-based sustainability policies.

22. Defendant Ken Paxton is the Attorney General of Texas, sued here in his official capacity. The Attorney General leads the Consumer Protection Division. He is expressly charged with enforcing SB 2337. See S.B. 2337, 89th Leg., R.S., § 6A.201 (Tex. 2025); Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 17.47 (West 2025).

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

23. This action arises under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988; 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02, and the U.S. Constitution. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.

24. Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1)–(2). The Texas Attorney General resides in this District for purposes of official-capacity suits, and a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claims occurred in this District.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

25. Purchasing shares of a publicly traded company makes the buyer an owner of the company, even if the ownership is a very small percentage. Equity ownership entitles an investor to vote on matters required by state and federal law, stock exchange listing requirements, and a company’s organizational documents. It also confers the right to submit proposals for consideration by fellow shareholders and vote on company and shareholder proposals. Importantly, shareholders may exercise these voting and proposal rights consistent with their investment objectives, values, and beliefs regarding the factors that promote the creation of long-term value.

26. If a shareholder or group of shareholders wants a company to take some action—say, provide more transparency regarding its spending on lobbying to see if those dollars are consistent with public statements—they can introduce a resolution to do so, subject to certain regulatory limitations. After the resolution is introduced, the proponent can decide to engage with other investors to highlight the proposal or otherwise encourage support. Because institutional investor portfolios include hundreds or thousands of companies, institutional investors often rely on proxy advisors to review the shareholder and management proposals presented for vote and provide guidance according to objectives articulated by those institutional investors.

27. SB 2337 interferes with shareholder rights, making it harder for shareholders to obtain information from advisors and other investors or sources that would help them vote their shares. As discussed herein, the State’s mode of interference—chilling and burdening the speech of proxy advisors—violates the Constitution in several ways.

The Backdrop Behind Passage of SB 2337

28. In advocating for passage of SB 2337, legislators made clear that restricting certain viewpoints and repressing certain voices was the goal of the bill.

29. SB 2337 was meant to target “activist shareholders who bring resolutions that are opposed by the management of the company,” in the words of one of its sponsors. See Tex. Senate, Senate Session (Part II) at 1:35:07–1:35:14 (May 8, 2025), https://senate.texas.gov/videoplayer.php?vid=22094&lang=en (Statement of Sen. Hughes).

30. The Act also targets firms that—in its sponsor’s view—“are basing their advice to clients on factors other than shareholder return, such as in many cases environmental, social, and governance—political hot button issues—[and] DEI factors.” See Tex. H. Comm. on Trade, Workforce & Econ. Dev., Hearing at 1:13:57–14:09 (Apr. 23, 2025), https://house.texas.gov/videos/21855 (statement of Rep. Leach) (emphasis added).

31. “The point here is to make sure that proxy advisory firms, when they’re rendering advice . . . that they’re focused on economic factors. So, when they’re focused on non-economic-type factors, whether it’s ESG, whether it’s DEI . . . that’s what we want to prevent.” Texas H.R., 89th Leg., R.S., Floor Debate on H.B. 4079 (May 27, 2025), at 9:47:36-9:48:25 (video at https://house.texas.gov/videos/22298) (statement of Rep. Leach).

32. And as Senator Hughes stated in the Texas Senate, “proxy advisory firms have become increasingly political with a hard left bent. . . . Some are basing their advice on ESG standards, other times on DEI priorities.” Texas Sen. Comm. on State Affairs, 89th Leg., R.S., Debate on S.B. 2337, (Apr. 24, 2025), at 0:58:46-59:27 (statement of Sen. Hughes) (video at https://senate.texas.gov/videoplayer.php?vid=21888&lang=en ).

The Material Provisions of SB 2337

33. To accomplish the goals set out above, SB 2337 imposes burdensome requirements on proxy voting advice that is based in any part on what the Act calls “nonfinancial factors” or “in opposition to company management.”

Counter-factual and Overbroad Definitions and Undefined Terms

34. SB 2337 defines a “proxy advisor” as anyone “who, for compensation, provides a proxy advisory service to shareholders of a company or to other persons with authority to vote on behalf of shareholders of a company.”

35. “Compensation” is undefined.

36. “Proxy advisory service” is defined to include: 1) “advice or a recommendation on how to vote on a proxy proposal or company proposal”; 2) “proxy statement research and analysis regarding a proxy proposal or company proposal”; 3) “a rating or research regarding corporate governance”; or 4) “development of proxy voting recommendations or policies, including establishing default recommendations or policies.” As such, “proxy advisory service” is not limited to rendering actual proxy advice.

37. SB 2337 begins from the premise of protecting the “financial interest of the shareholders,” but never defines “financial interest of the shareholders.” Nevertheless, SB 2337 exempts from its requirements advice that is “provided solely in the financial interest of the shareholders of a company.”

38. SB 2337 declares that advice based on consideration of “nonfinancial factors” is, by definition of the Act, not provided solely in the financial interest of shareholders of the company. These “nonfinancial factors” specifically include “a commitment, initiative, policy, target or subjective or value-based standard” based on: “an environmental, social, or governance (ESG) goal, factor, or investment principle; diversity, equity, or inclusion (DEI); a social credit or sustainability factor or score; or membership in or commitment to an organization or group that wholly or partly bases its evaluation or assessment of a company’s value over any period on nonfinancial factors.” None of these terms are defined.

39. SB 2337 declares that voting recommendations that are “inconsistent with the voting recommendation of the board of directors or a board committee composed on a majority of independent directors” are not provided “solely in the financial interest of the shareholders of the company.”

40. For the purpose of determining the scope of SB 2337, the statute also defines “company” and “shareholder.” A “company” is a business that was formed in Texas, maintains its principal place of business in Texas, or has made a company proposal to become a Texas entity. A “shareholder” is a person who has any form of equity ownership in a Texas company, regardless of whether the shareholder lives in Texas or is otherwise connected to the state.

Compelled Statements About “Nonfinancial” Advice

41. Proxy advisors whose advice is deemed “not provided solely in the financial interest of shareholders” are compelled to issue a series of warnings to their clients or members and the Texas company that is the subject of their advice, as well as post that warning to their websites. As to the clients or members and the Texas company that is the subject of the advice, the proxy advisor must (1) “conspicuously state[] that the service is not being provided solely in the financial interest of the company’s shareholders because it is based wholly or partly on one or more nonfinancial factors”; (2) explain “with particularity” the basis of the advice; and (3) state that “the advice subordinates the financial interests of shareholders to other objectives, including sacrificing investment returns or undertaking additional investment risk to promote one or more nonfinancial factors.” Sec. 6A.101(b)(1). The proxy advisor must also “conspicuously disclose” on the front page of its website that its services “include advice and recommendations that are not based solely on the financial interest of shareholders.” Sec. 6A.101(b)(3).

Enforcement of the State’s Viewpoint

42. SB 2337 allows any “affected party” to seek declaratory and injunctive relief. An “affected party” is defined to include “any shareholder” of any Texas company that is the subject of a proxy advisor’s advice. Private plaintiffs must “provide notice to the attorney general, who may intervene in the action.” S.B. 2337 § 6A.202(b).

43. Any violation of SB 2337 is deemed a per se deceptive trade practice under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act (DTPA). SB 2337 explicitly authorizes the Consumer Protection Division of the Office of the Attorney General to seek both injunctive relief and civil penalties, which can be assessed in the amount of “not more than $10,000 per violation” under § 17.47 of the DTPA for violations of SB 2337. SB 2337 allows the Attorney General to seek penalties against organizations that fail to make these disclosures to sophisticated institutional investors.

The Harmful Impact of SB 2337

44. SB 2337 is facially unlawful. It violates the First Amendment and is unconstitutionally vague under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It will harm Plaintiffs and other organizations like them by depriving them of their constitutional rights.

Impermissible Vagueness in Covered Entities and Conduct

45. The definition of proxy advisor is vague with regard to any entity other than Glass Lewis or ISS. It is unclear under the language of the Act if any or all Plaintiffs qualify as proxy advisors subject to SB 2337, though both the language of the Act and its legislative history indicate that they very well might.

46. SB 2337 does not define compensation, so it is also unclear whether the word was intended to cover only fee-for-service engagements or if it could encompass membership fees or other payments Plaintiffs receive for the work they do, though they do not receive them for providing “proxy advisory services” specifically.

47. SB 2337 defines “proxy advisory service” and “proxy advisor” so broadly that it may apply to many of the informational services Plaintiffs provide. “Proxy advisory service” is not limited to advice and recommendations regarding specific proxy votes; it includes research, analysis, and generic recommendations and policies. Nor is it clear what constitutes “advice” or “a recommendation.”

48. Notably, the Act fails to exclude non-profits, either implicitly or explicitly. Prior to passage, the Texas House adopted an amendment to the Act that would have made the law inapplicable to certain charitable organizations, which the amendment defined to include certain Section 501(c)(3) and Section 501(a) organizations under the Internal Revenue Code. But the Senate did not concur in that amendment, and it does not appear in the text of the Act as passed.

Impermissible Vagueness in Key Definitions

49. The “financial interest” of shareholders in a single corporation is not uniform. For any publicly traded company, there will be shareholders with a financial interest in short-term gains, shareholders interested in future and long-term performance, and shareholders who are willing to accept short-term reduction in value if they think certain changes in policy, or capital outlays, for example, will lead to long-term success. These interests may be adverse to management or consistent with management plans. SB 2337 fails to account for these complexities, instead adhering to the fiction that there is only one right way to be interested in the success of a company—all without really ever saying what that way is.

50. This presumption infects the Act, which assumes that any proposal that could be labeled “ESG” or “DEI” is bad for business. Not so.

51. Environmental considerations can have a financial impact on company performance. Numerous studies demonstrate how sustainability initiatives and management of climate risk improve financial performance. Financially material climate risk factors encompass both physical and transition risk. As climate change leads to a higher risk of natural disasters like hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires destroying a company’s physical assets, that company will have to pay out more to repair the damage (and pay for insurance prior to the damage). As companies adjust to the new realities that climate change causes, they will also have to invest to mitigate harms, such as moving ports used for shipping, adapting to drought and floods, or investing in new technologies that are more climate-change resistant.

52. The risk to investor flows is equally real. Morgan Stanley recently discussed four risks that investors face because of climate change, including physical damage, stranded assets, reputational risk, and pressure on natural resources. See Emily Thomas, 4 Ways Investors Can Act on Climate Change, Morgan Stanley (Oct. 10, 2024), https://perma.cc/XV2E-43YX. Each risk presents an opportunity for investors, such as “investing in companies that support natural resource efficiency, resilient infrastructure, food and water security, and sustainable agriculture.” Id.

53. And sustainable investing can significantly outperform investing that fails to take sustainability into account. A Morgan Stanley report found that a larger proportion of sustainable funds had positive returns in the first half of 2025, at 92% vs. 85% for traditional funds; ninety percent of sustainable funds have positive returns. See Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing, Sustainable Reality: 2025 Report, https://perma.cc/3MVA-37GQhttps://perma.cc/T9Y6-XLWNhttps://perma.cc/8A3E-ZXPH.3MVA-37GQ. This makes sense, of course, because companies that consider sustainability can benefit from access to capital, positive brand reputation, and other market-based advantages, while companies that do not address material environmental risks that result from climate change and pollution will face increased costs.

54. Members of Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a global organization whose members have approximately 140 trillion dollars in assets under management, recently reaffirmed that they support “incorporating environmental, social and governance factors into their investment and ownership decisions,” Principles for Responsible Investment, Home, https://perma.cc/8JPJ-4Y5F (last visited Nov. 10, 2025), and are “deeply committed to the shared goal of responsible investment.” Principles for Responsible Investment, About the PRI, https://perma.cc/625X-NJAH (last visited Nov. 10, 2025).

55. Social considerations can also have a financial impact on company performance. For instance, labor practices and talent retention, which could be considered “social” factors that fall under SB 2337’s ESG rubric, can also directly affect a company’s financial performance. And companies that proactively seek to mitigate human rights risks in their operations and supply chains prevent the type of regulatory, legal, financial, and reputational risks that can negatively impact long-term performance.

56. So, too, with governance considerations. Independent board oversight, transparent executive compensation, and robust risk management are all indicators of good governance that can benefit a company’s long-term financial outlook. And one example of good governance is reflected in a recent survey, where 79% of corporate directors expressed the belief that board diversity is beneficial to a company, with over 68% believing it leads to better board performance. See Ray Garcia, et al., PwC’s 2024 Annual Corporate Directors Survey at 4, https://perma.cc/R6NB-VX2A.

57. It is not surprising, then, that the Teacher Retirement Fund of Texas has stated that its Investment Division considers “ESG factors that are material to long-term returns and levels of risk” when making investment decisions. See Teacher Ret. Sys. of Tex., Investment Policy Statement (June 3, 2025), https://perma.cc/98W4-DV3H. Or that the Texas Employees Retirement System notes that “[i]ntangible factors such as social and environmental issues are increasingly being incorporated into valuation models to better quantify the risks and opportunities of long-term investing in a company.” See Emps. Ret. Sys. of Tex., Investment Policy Statement, add. I, at 3 (Aug. 21, 2024), https://perma.cc/7Y77-23UP.

Impermissible Interference with First Amendment Rights

58. Plaintiffs face a difficult choice: SB 2337 forces them to make statements that they do not agree with, to stop speaking, or to speak knowing that they risk substantial fines and litigation in the form of public and private enforcement.

59. Forcing Plaintiffs to make government-preferred statements that run counter to their own beliefs is compelled speech and violates the First Amendment.

60. As Plaintiff Ceres notes, its entire model is based on proving that “sustainability is the bottom line.” Ceres, About (last visited Nov. 3, 2025), https://perma.cc/VAA3-W7RN. For Ceres, then, considering ESG factors is solely related to financial interest. ICCR similarly believes that taking environmental, social, and governance factors into account “is integral to long-term value.” That is, ignoring these issues is detrimental to a company’s value. And UCF believes that its funds deliver long-term growth not in spite of their religious mission, but because of it.

61. Texas can disagree with Plaintiffs’ views, but it cannot compel them to give voice to that disagreement without running afoul of the First Amendment, as SB 2337 does.

62. Complying with the Act’s mandated warnings will compel Plaintiffs to speak a message that they believe to be false, including that accounting for certain disfavored factors “subordinates the financial interests of shareholders.” The state’s mandatory disclosures would also require Plaintiffs to diminish the reliability and utility of their own research and analysis. Disseminating such disclosures would harm Plaintiffs’ reputations as trusted sources of information on those very topics the State restricts and will compromise and limit their relationships with their clients and members. Even if Plaintiffs were to moderate the descriptive disclosures required under SB 2337, they would still face other compliance burdens. Compliance with the additional requirements SB 2337 imposes, including the written economic analysis of the financial impact on shareholders of the proposal, would be cumbersome. The personnel required to satisfy these compliance needs are significant, all the more so given that Plaintiffs are non-profits.

63. If, on the other hand, Plaintiffs refuse to speak Texas’s mandated script, Plaintiffs face two unacceptable alternatives. Either they will be forced to be silent on issues in which they strongly believe, or they will face costly investigations, litigation, and fines.

64. The threat of investigation and prosecution from the Texas Attorney General, should Plaintiffs be deemed proxy advisors under the Act, also adds to the likelihood that Plaintiffs will have to expend additional resources should the Act be allowed to remain in place.

65. Under all of these scenarios, SB 2337 would prevent Plaintiffs from furthering their mission of aligning investing with beliefs, all because the State of Texas may not like their positions.

STANDING AND SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY

66. Each Plaintiff has standing. Chilling and compelling speech, as the Act does, are injuries in fact, even pre-enforcement, that are fairly traceable to the Attorney General. SB 2337 authorizes the Consumer Protection Division of the Office of the Attorney General to bring suit for a violation of the Act under Section 17.47 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code. See S.B. 2337 § 6A.201; Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 17.47. Only a ruling barring SB 2337 from remaining in effect can remove this threat from the Attorney General.

67. Nor is the Attorney General immune from suit. The Attorney General has both a particular duty to enforce the Act and a demonstrated willingness to do so. Indeed, he has made a variety of statements demonstrating a dislike of proxy advisors, making it almost certain that he will enforce the act absent Court intervention.

68. The Attorney General sent a letter to ISS and Glass Lewis in 2023, for example, accusing them of violating Texas’s “prohibition on unfair or deceptive trade practices” because, in language replicated in SB 2337, Attorney General Paxton believed they were issuing advice “contrary to the financial interest” of shareholders. See Letter from Office of the Attorney General of Utah and Office of the Attorney General of Texas to Gary Retelny and Kevin Cameron, at 2 (Jan. 17, 2023) (on file with author), https://perma.cc/85M7-78UC. The Attorney General has also made clear his willingness to use consumer protection laws to attack “a wide range of organizations with which he disagrees politically.” How Ken Paxton Is Stretching The Boundaries Of Consumer Protection Laws to Pursue Political Targets, Tex. Tribune (May 30, 2024), https://perma.cc/63D5-WQCB. There is no reason to believe that the past is anything but prologue here.

69. Even after the Court preliminarily enjoined the application of SB 2337 to Glass Lewis and ISS, the Attorney General nevertheless issued Civil Investigative Demands to both companies, presumably as part of a fact-gathering investigation that, on information and belief, is connected to potential suits under S.B. 2337.

CLAIMS

70. Plaintiffs raise a facial challenge to SB 2337.

Count I

42 U.S.C. § 1983

Violation of the First Amendment, as Incorporated Against the States Through the Fourteenth Amendment (Freedom of Speech)

71. Plaintiffs incorporate all prior paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

72. It is Texas’s burden to demonstrate that SB 2337 does not run afoul of the First Amendment guarantee that the government “shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.” U.S. Const. amend. I. Texas cannot meet that burden.

Content Discrimination

73. The Act is unconstitutional because it engages in content discrimination and cannot withstand strict scrutiny.

74. There is no compelling state interest that justifies the law, much less one that is narrowly tailored to serve any compelling state interest.

75. First, SB 2337’s stated goal of “prevent[ing] fraudulent or deceptive acts and practices in this state,” S.B. 2337 § 1(4), is mere pretext for regulating disfavored views, rendering the Act’s stated interest unlikely to be genuine.

76. There is no evidence of fraud by proxy advisors that justifies SB 2337, and the State has no genuine interest in combating fraud that does not exist.

77. Second, the Act fails strict scrutiny even if SB 2337 reflected a genuine interest in preventing fraud because it is not narrowly tailored to serve that interest. It only targets speech about Texas companies rather than speech occurring in Texas or by Texans or to Texans, requires no disclosures for conflicts of interest that could be an indicator of fraud, and has no provisions that regulate advice that aligns with company management. This all suggests that the Act’s true purpose has nothing to do with stopping fraud in Texas.

78. There is nothing inherently fraudulent about the targeted speech, making it impossible to reduce fraud by targeting it.

79. Nor does the Act’s regulatory structure, which forces Plaintiffs and others to disparage the advice they give, use the least restrictive means available to combat the imagined fraud. There is no evidence that any other means were even considered.

80. The Act discriminates based on the content of speech and is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest and thus violates the First Amendment.

Viewpoint Discrimination

81. Because it subjects only certain speech with a certain viewpoint to rigorous regulation, SB 2337 discriminates based on viewpoint, in violation of the First Amendment. Worse, it compels private speakers to adopt and parrot the government’s viewpoint on hotly contested topics and to align with management views.

82. The Act targets Plaintiffs’ particular views. SB 2337 punishes Plaintiffs for taking the view that ESG or DEI factors are relevant to a company’s financial performance, but not the opposite view. This is viewpoint discrimination.

83. The Act also discriminates on viewpoint when it compels Plaintiffs to speak the Texas government’s viewpoints, made all the worse because Texas’s view contradicts Plaintiffs’ beliefs.

84. The Act compels Plaintiffs to make disparaging disclosures and notices about their own beliefs to their members and clients. S.B. 2337 §§ 101(b), 102(b). It forces Plaintiffs to voice a government-drafted message advocating positions they vehemently oppose. Under the Act, Plaintiffs are required to convey the State’s view that any advice that contemplates “DEI,” or “ESG,” (however those terms may be construed by the State) is “not being provided solely in the financial interest of the company’s shareholders because it is based” on “nonfinancial factors.” S.B. 2337 § 6A.101(a). And this disclosure, which Plaintiffs do not believe to be true, must be made “publicly and conspicuously . . . on the home or front page” of their websites. Id. § 6A.101(b)(3). In short, Plaintiffs cannot express their views without being compelled under SB 2337 to state the Texas government’s preferred views.

85. SB 2337 also requires these disclosures when proxy advisors encourage or promote any proposal that is opposed by company management. This violates the First Amendment in a particularly skewed manner, mandating that shareholders in corporations toe the line on the positions of management, rather than management being accountable to shareholders through the company’s Board.

86. The Act’s viewpoint discrimination is inherent in its design and structure, which compels Plaintiffs to disparage their advice only when they engage in speech deemed “non-financial”—defined as related to ESG, DEI, or a view opposed to management. The purpose of the Act is to slant the public’s views in the direction the State wants.

87. This blatant viewpoint discrimination makes SB 2337 unconstitutional. Texas can view ESG and DEI both as terms and concepts as it wishes. But it cannot force Plaintiffs to express the State’s views or regulate their speech because Texas disagrees with their views, at least not without running afoul of the First Amendment.

Count II

42 U.S.C. § 1983

Void for Vagueness Under the Fourteenth Amendment

88. Plaintiffs incorporate all prior paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

89. The Act is unconstitutionally vague, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

90. It defines “solely in the financial interest of the shareholders,” through ipse dixit, to exclude ESG and DEI, terms that are subjective and subject to significant definitional debate. Plaintiffs are forced to guess when their conduct is subject to SB 2337’s disclosure requirements, with a wrong guess resulting in steep penalties.

91. And it is the Texas Attorney General whose subjective view of what ESG and DEI mean, not any objective standard, that will determine whether SB 2337 is enforced. Plaintiffs are thus left guessing not just what the ill-defined law means, but what the Texas Attorney General thinks it means. The double vagueness puts Plaintiffs in an untenable position.

92. Unless declared unconstitutional, SB 2337 will unlawfully deprive Plaintiffs of their Due Process rights and cause them harm.

Prayer for Relief

Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court:

A. Declare that SB 2337 is unlawful;

B. Declare that SB 2337 violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments, including the Free Speech Clause;

C. Declare that SB 2337 is void for vagueness under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment;

D. Enjoin Ken Paxton, in his official capacity as Attorney General of Texas—and his successors, officers, agents, and employees, including the Consumer Protection Division of the Office of the Attorney General, and all other persons who are in active concert or participation with Paxton—from enforcing SB 2337;

E. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiffs;

F. Award Plaintiffs their reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in bringing this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b) for successful 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claims against state officials; and

G. Award Plaintiffs all other such relief as the Court deems just and proper.

The 500,000-square-foot facility marks a strategic evolution from an application center to a full-scale production site, reflecting rising demand for advanced energy technologies in the United States.

The move represents a significant step from the company’s previous location in Orlando, Florida, which had become inadequate within five years due to rapid growth. The new facility is part of a collaboration with the Winston-Salem Technology Center, known for its strong manufacturing capabilities and advanced industrial infrastructure.

“We’re proud to have officially inaugurated our new Siemens Energy North American Additive Manufacturing Center,” said Quan Lac, Vice President of Additive Manufacturing at Siemens Energy. “In just five years, we outgrew our original location in Orlando. We’ve now consolidated our AM operations into the 500,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art Winston-Salem Technology Center in North Carolina. Partnering with WTC and leveraging their extensive manufacturing capabilities marks a major milestone for our North American AM operations as we transition from an application center to a full-scale production facility. The timing is critical, as additive manufacturing is poised to help meet the unprecedented surge in energy demand we’re seeing across the U.S.”

Technology expansion and support for the U.S. market

The Winston-Salem center builds on Siemens’ existing Charlotte Advanced Technology Collaboration Hub (CATCH), also in North Carolina, which was established in 2013 to serve as an ecosystem platform for AM machine builders, industrial users, and design engineers. Siemens aims to bolster U.S. manufacturing by offering end-to-end solutions spanning automation, digital simulation, and data-driven process optimization.

In general, Siemens Energy relies on technologies such as laser powder bed fusion (primarily through EOS DMLS) and wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) to develop high-performance parts, facilitate rapid prototyping, and provide on-demand spare parts. The company’s expertise also extends to advanced engineering services, including the design, simulation, and qualification of AM components.

Moving beyond prototyping to serial production

Siemens Energy’s AM efforts are built on more than a decade of experience and millions of operating hours within its own gas turbine fleet. Its technologies include Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) and Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM), used to produce high-performance parts, enable rapid repairs, and deliver on-demand spare components.

In 2017, working with EOS, Siemens successfully tested 3D printed gas turbine blades under full-load conditions. Today, the company is engaged in serial production of complex parts such as burner nozzles and turbine vanes, which have reduced lead times and improved system performance. Siemens also provides design, simulation, and qualification services for AM components.

To support industry-wide adoption, Siemens Energy has established an Additive Manufacturing Advisory Board composed of experts from various sectors, tasked with guiding the company’s AM strategy in response to growing U.S. market needs.",https://www.voxelmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Siemens-Energy-North-America_1762985496909.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 11:03:23.899835

That’s where public health comes in: strengthening the systems that keep communities healthy.

McHale now represents Gillings on the North Carolina Institute of Medicine’s new veteran health task force.","On a warm summer evening in Alamance County, veterans and community members gathered for an unexpected public health event: an art show. The walls displayed paintings, photography, and mixed-media pieces, each one telling a unique story. As veterans stood beside their work, talking with visitors about what inspired them, the atmosphere was alive with connection — a reminder that feeling seen, supported, and part of a community is essential for our well-being.

This art show was the product of a UNC-Chapel Hill initiative called the Healthy Vets Community Project, led by Vaughn Upshaw and Aimee McHale, professors in the Gillings School of Global Public Health.

The idea began in 2018, when Upshaw met Paul Crews, director of the Durham Veterans Affairs Health Care System, at a UNC-Chapel Hill public workforce conference. Their conversation highlighted a key challenge: the difficulty of connecting veterans with community-based mental health services. Upshaw quickly saw this wasn’t just a clinical issue; it was a public health one.

Veterans face distinct health challenges shaped by their service, transition to civilian life, and the communities they return to. Many experience higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, physical injuries, chronic pain, and exposure to environmental hazards. Some also grapple with deep psychological distress from actions during service that conflict with their personal values.

In rural counties, where many veterans live, limited public transit can make it difficult to attend medical appointments or social programs. Upshaw saw an opportunity to apply public health tools to address these barriers.

Today, that conversation has grown into a larger project. With McHale, Upshaw has developed the Healthy Vets Community Project into a phased initiative that partners with communities across North Carolina to strengthen the resources, networks, and conditions that affect veteran health.

The project’s early days were experimental. Upshaw and McHale didn’t begin with fixed goals, just a shared commitment to making a difference. They recruited Gillings students with military connections, using their lived experiences to help shape the initiative.

So far, these efforts have resulted in reduced bus fares in Rocky Mount, eastern North Carolina’s first veteran resource fair, the creation of all-in-one support service centers, and improved mental health hotline screening in Alamance County.

“The public health approach means you’re guided by the evidence,” McHale says. “From the beginning, it was: ‘Let’s start digging and see what we find.’”

A paradigm shift

Health is shaped by more than doctor visits. It’s influenced by housing, transportation, food access, and social support. That’s where public health comes in: strengthening the systems that keep communities healthy.

The Healthy Vets Community Project uses the vital conditions framework to examine these broader forces.

“We’re not working with veterans directly, but with the people who serve them,” Upshaw explains. “Our project is elevating their visibility.”

The project began with a comprehensive literature review exploring how social and structural determinants like housing stability, food access, and social support impact veteran health. This research helped ground the project in evidence, revealing where communities could intervene most effectively.

Then, they began creating visual resource maps by overlaying where veterans live with the presence, or absence, of resources to highlight community strengths and gaps.

Armed with data, the team partnered with three pilot communities — Alamance County, Rocky Mount, and Wake County — to build relationships, identify assets, align priorities, and launch community-led initiatives to address real, lived issues.

“You don’t have to be a psychologist or a psychiatrist to be able to help veterans and move people away from the cliff of mental health crisis,” Upshaw says. “People want to be seen, people want to be helped, and everybody wants to be a part of that picture.”

Insights to impact

With a $6.8 million grant from the Veterans Health Administration, the Healthy Vets Community Project is entering phase two, turning knowledge into action with four ambitious aims.

The first is to create a veteran registry guide, a practical tool to align referral systems and simplify access to services. The second will expand their resource maps to cover all 100 N.C. counties, giving leaders a clear picture of where veterans live and where resources are lacking.

The third goal, ecosystem mapping, paints a broader view to show how organizations, policies, and institutions interact. And the fourth will develop scalable tools to empower communities to build veteran-friendly environments and recognize sustainable efforts.

McHale now represents Gillings on the North Carolina Institute of Medicine’s new veteran health task force. The hope is that the project’s insights will inform not only local programs but also state-level policy decisions.

“The beauty of this project is it’s the kind of thing that can pull communities together, where people can work across partisan lines to serve the people who have served us,” McHale says.",https://research.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aimee-and-vaughn-lead.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 10:01:19.561046

Favorable natural gas prices also contributed to the momentum.

After its upbeat third-quarter earnings report and plans to expand capacity, Hallador Energy’s share price reflected renewed optimism, climbing over 8% in the past month and delivering a year-to-date share price return of 94%. Even more striking, its five-year total shareholder return sits above 2,400%, underscoring the powerful long-term momentum behind the stock.

If Hallador’s recent surge has you thinking about what else the market might be overlooking, now could be the right moment to explore

Yet with such rapid gains and another quarter of blockbuster results, the real question is whether Hallador Energy’s shares remain undervalued, or if today’s price already reflects most of its future growth prospects. Is there more upside ahead?

Price-to-Sales of 2.2x: Is it justified?

Hallador Energy’s stock is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.2x, which places it below several key comparables and suggests relative value at its last close of $22.72.

The price-to-sales ratio compares a company’s market value to its annual revenue, making it especially useful for evaluating firms where earnings can be volatile or negative, as is often the case in the energy sector.

In Hallador’s case, the 2.2x P/S ratio stands out as favorable when compared to both the peer group average of 3.1x and the North American Renewable Energy industry average of 2.9x. However, a closer look reveals that the estimated fair price-to-sales ratio is 1.5x. This suggests the market might have priced in more optimistic assumptions than historical norms would suggest, and that the ratio could revert toward those levels over time.

Result: Price-to-Sales of 2.2x (UNDERVALUED)

However, persistent negative net income and a possible reversion in price-to-sales ratio present real risks that could challenge Hallador’s current valuation momentum.

Another View: Our DCF Model Weighs In

The SWS DCF model provides a very different perspective. According to this approach, Hallador Energy’s shares are trading well above the DCF-derived fair value of $12.58, suggesting the stock is overvalued by this metric. Does this signal that the recent rally is stretched, or could the market know something the model does not?

“We have significant lending authority at the loan program office,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said at a Washington, D.C. event, according to CNBC.

“By far the biggest use of those dollars will be for nuclear power plants — to get those first plants built.”

The secretary, speaking at a conference held by the American Nuclear Society, noted that he expects electricity demand from artificial intelligence to attract billions of dollars from “very creditworthy providers,” CNBC reported. Wright was quoted as saying that his department could match those dollars by as much as four to one.

President Donald Trump directed the department in May to start building 10 large nuclear reactors by 2030. Wright reportedly added that he hopes there will be dozens under construction by the time the administration ends.

Trump also ordered the secretary to prioritize activities that support nuclear energy to help comply with his construction directive. The president told Wright to use his loan office to build new advanced reactors, finish those that were prematurely suspended, increase the power output of plants that are operating and make resources available to restart closed plants.

“Swift and decisive action is required to jumpstart America’s nuclear energy industrial base and ensure our national and economic security by increasing fuel availability and production, securing civil nuclear supply chains, improving the efficiency with which advanced nuclear reactors are licensed, and preparing our workforce to establish America’s energy dominance and accelerate our path towards a more secure and independent energy future,” Trump said.

The Atlantic Council, an international affairs think tank, said in a May report that Trump’s order addressed “well-trodden issues” but was “ambitious.”

The president’s other directives on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which are partially aimed at reducing the federal agency’s staff, also present issues for the country’s nuclear energy industry, according to the think tank.

“In the new orders, the Trump administration has articulated ambitious goals for rapid deployment of next-generation nuclear technologies; however, reducing personnel and funding for the NRC and the Department of Energy, along with weakening the NRC’s independence and global credibility, will make it challenging to realize the full potential of the US nuclear energy industry,” the Atlantic Council explained.

Europe is aiming to increase the standing and reputation of hydrogen across the region by allocating much-needed funds for substantial hydrogen projects across the EU bloc. The EU’s NetZero program is designed to assist the EU in reaching its clean energy goals by 2050, and enables the allocation of funds for projects that may help the region reach its lofty ambitions for clean energy production.

The European Commission has awarded billions to hydrogen and clean energy projects

The commission announced that it has awarded over $3.06 billion in funds for 61 large-scale climate tech projects, of which hydrogen is the main energy source. The funds are derived from the revenues generated under the EU Emissions Trading System, and follow the EU’s first-ever dedicated net-zero call (IF24). Applications for funds from clean energy projects totaled $22.9 billion, nearly ten times the amount planned to be allocated.

Hydrogen has long been overlooked as a potential long-term energy resource that could drive up renewable energy production as the world edges ever closer to the self-imposed 2030 clean energy target. Among the litany of projects that are set to receive funds from the EU Commission are:

Spain: Luxia will produce green hydrogen for ammonia and methanol

Denmark: Arcadia e-Fuels using hydrogen and biogenic CO₂ for eSAF and eNAP

Czech Republic: H2CWay will develop hydrogen fuel cell buses

Estonia: P2XH will produce e-methanol and green hydrogen for the maritime sector

Italy: H2EAT will use the funds to construct hydrogen boilers

Norway: ODIN will use the funds for retrofitting 15 Cessna 208Bs with H₂-electric powertrains

Norway(again): RjukanLH2 will use the EU funds to validate RFNBO-compliant LH2 bunkering for shortsea vessels

The grant agreement phase for the EU funds is currently underway

The EU is hoping that the allocation of funds will boost domestic hydrogen projects across the European continent, especially as the latest sanctions on Russian energy supplies come into effect. The grant agreement phase has commenced, with the contract confirmation process set for 2026.

“The response to this call demonstrates the strength of our innovators and the determination of our companies to lead the global race for net zero technologies.” – Wopke Hoekstra, EU Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth

The EU has noted that the grant process has been as smooth as a baby’s bottom, with no interruptions or issues facing the allocation of funds. Hydrogen has long been overlooked as a potential long-term energy resource that could completely alter the future of our planet. The EU has been on a hydrogen spree as of late, and has even granted renewable certification for a massive hydrogen project in China.

Europe’s proclivity for hydrogen is a welcome change to the conventional reliance on the fossil fuel sector, which has devastated the global environment, leading to disastrous climate change across the world. Luckily, nations have taken measures to reduce the impact of the energy sector.

BEV sales dropped 46.7% month-over-month in October after federal EV tax credits expired.

Incentives rose to $13,161 per unit, partially offsetting the decline, but uncertainty remains.

Full-year 2025 sales are expected to be flat or slightly higher than 2024, despite a slower Q4.

New light-vehicle sales in October 2025 recorded the lowest seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) in 15 months, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. The October SAAR of 15.3 million units represents a 4.8% decline year-over-year and a 5.9% drop from September 2025. The decrease was primarily driven by a sharp decline in battery-electric vehicle (BEV) sales following the expiration of federal EV tax credits on September 30.

BEVs accounted for just 5.9% of total new-vehicle sales in October, falling from a record 11.3% in September. Approximately 75,000 BEVs were sold, a 46.7% decrease from September and down 23.8% year-over-year. Automakers had pulled forward many EV purchases ahead of the credit’s expiration, which contributed to the steep drop in October.

To offset the loss of the federal incentive, several OEMs increased their own discounts. Average incentive spending on BEVs rose $2,047 from September to $13,161 per unit, according to J.D. Power. While these incentives softened the decline, it remains uncertain how quickly BEV sales will return to previous levels without federal support.

Industry analysts expect the slower sales pace to continue through the fourth quarter of 2025 compared with the third quarter. However, earlier “pull-ahead” sales this year suggest full-year totals will remain largely stable. Overall, 2025 new-vehicle sales are expected to finish flat or slightly higher than 2024.

The October results highlight the strong influence of federal incentives on EV adoption. BEV sales surged when credits were available, but the market remains sensitive to policy changes. Automakers may continue to rely on manufacturer incentives to sustain EV demand, and dealers may need to adjust strategies to navigate shifts in consumer behavior.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11132025-BEV-Sales-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 10:00:41.308467

It is Toyota’s eleventh U.S. plant and the company’s first and only battery plant outside of Japan. The nearly $14 billion facility will create up to 5,100 new American jobs.

Building on its unwavering commitment to the U.S., Toyota announced an additional investment of up to $10 billion over the next five years to support future mobility efforts. This will bring the company’s total U.S. investment to nearly $60 billion since beginning operations here nearly 70 years ago.

“Today’s launch of Toyota’s first U.S. battery plant and additional U.S. investment up to $10 billion marks a pivotal moment in our company’s history,” said Ted Ogawa, president and chief executive officer, Toyota Motor North America (TMNA). “Toyota is a pioneer in electrified vehicles, and the company’s significant manufacturing investment in the U.S. and North Carolina further solidifies our commitment to team members, customers, dealers, communities, and suppliers.”

United States Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy expressed support for manufacturing investments in the U.S., noting that Toyota North Carolina’s investment of nearly $14 billion and the creation of more than 5,000 new jobs marks a turning point for the Piedmont Triad region.

“Under President Donald Trump’s leadership, America is open for business,” said U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy. “Toyota’s move to expand production in North Carolina is the latest show of confidence in this administration’s efforts to reshore manufacturing, generate new, great paying jobs, and inject billions of dollars into the economy. We’re just getting started!”

The 1,850-acre mega site can produce 30 GWh annually at full capacity. It will serve as Toyota’s hub for developing and producing lithium-ion batteries needed for its ever-growing portfolio of electrified vehicles. The state-of-the-art plant will house 14 battery production lines supporting hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), making it a historical investment for Toyota and a substantial economic impact on the Tarheel State.

Batteries assembled at Toyota North Carolina are set to power the Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, RAV4 HEV, and a yet-to-be-announced all-electric 3-row BEV—the first of its kind for Toyota to be built in the U.S. Currently, the plant ships HEV modules to both Toyota Kentucky and Mazda Toyota Manufacturing in Alabama. Additional production lines at Toyota North Carolina are set to launch by 2030. Once construction is complete, the new facility will not just be a place of work, but also a vibrant community, featuring a range of amenities for team members, including on-site childcare, a pharmacy, a medical clinic and a fitness center.

The company remains steadfast in its commitment to being the best in town by supporting workforce development and educational initiatives. Through partnerships with schools and educators across the region, Toyota is developing the Triad’s future workforce with its time, talent and treasure.

Toyota has sold more than 6.6 million hybrid, plug-in hybrid, fuel cell and battery electric vehicles in the U.S. since 2000.

About half were in partnership with Amazon, which committed $3.6 billion in low-cost loans and grants for affordable housing projects in Washington, as well as Nashville, Tennessee, and the Puget Sound area in Washington state.
Almost all are within a half-mile of public transit.
More than 6,000 housing units are in development as a result.
“You put housing nearby public transit” Healey said.","BOSTON (AP) — After years of living on the street and crashing on friends’ couches, Quantavia Smith was given the keys to a studio apartment in Los Angeles that came with an important perk — easy access to public transit.

The 38-year-old feels like she went from a life where “no one cares” to one where she has a safe place to begin rebuilding her life. And the metro station the apartment complex was literally built upon is a lifeline as she searches for work without a car.

“It is more a sense of relief, a sense of independence,” said Smith, who moved in July. She receives some government assistance and pays 30% of her income for rent — just $19 a month for an efficiency with a full-market value of $2,000.

“Having your own space, you feel like you can do anything.”

Metro areas from Los Angeles to Boston have taken the lead in tying new housing developments to their proximity to public transit, often teaming up with developers to streamline the permitting process and passing policies that promote developments that include a greater number of units.

City officials argue building housing near public transit helps energize neglected neighborhoods and provide affordable housing, while ensuring a steady stream of riders for transit systems and cutting greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the number of cars on the road.

“Transit-oriented development should be one of, if not the biggest solution that we’re looking at for housing development,” said Yonah Freemark, research director at the Urban Institute’s Land Use Lab, who has written extensively on the topic.

“It takes advantage of all of this money we’ve spent on transportation infrastructure. If you build the projects and don’t build anything around the areas near them, then it’s kind of like money thrown down the drain,” Freemark said.

Transit housing projects from DC to LA

The Santa Monica and Vermont Apartments where Smith lives is part of an ambitious plan by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to build 10,000 housing units near transit sites by 2031 — offering developers land discounts in exchange for affordable housing development and other community benefits.

In Washington D.C., the transit authority has completed eight projects since 2022 that provided nearly 1,500 apartments and a million square feet of office space. About half were in partnership with Amazon, which committed $3.6 billion in low-cost loans and grants for affordable housing projects in Washington, as well as Nashville, Tennessee, and the Puget Sound area in Washington state. Almost all are within a half-mile of public transit.

“Big cities face the greatest challenges when it comes to traffic congestion and high housing costs,” Freemark said. “Building new homes near transit helps address both problems by encouraging people to take transit while increasing housing supply.”

Among projects Boston has built, the Pok Oi Residents in Chinatown is a 10-minute walk to the subway and a half-dozen bus stops. That’s a draw for Bernie Hernandez, who moved his family there from a Connecticut suburb after his daughter got into a Boston university.

“The big difference is commuting. You don’t need a car,” said Hernandez, who said he can walk to the grocery story and pharmacy. His 17-year-old daughter takes the subway to school. Now, his car mostly sits idle, saving him money on gas and time spent in traffic.

“You get to go to different places very quickly. Everything is convenient,” Hernandez said.

States take aim at zoning regulations

States from Massachusetts to California are passing laws targeting restrictive zoning regulations that for decades prohibited building multifamily developments and contributed to housing shortages.

Last month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a state law allowing taller apartment buildings on land owned by transit agencies and near bus, train and subway lines.

“Building more homes in our most sustainable locations is the key to tackling the affordability crisis and locking in California’s success for many years to come,” said State Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who authored the bill.

California joins Colorado, which requires cities to allow an average of 40 housing units per acre within a quarter-mile of transit, and Utah, which mandates about 50 units per acre. In Washington, the governor signed a bill this year allowing taller housing developments in mixed-use commercial zones near transit.

“We want to ensure that there are mixed-income, walkable, vibrant homes all around those transit investments and that people have the option of using cars less to improve the environmental health of our communities,” said Democratic Rep. Julia Reed, who authored the Washington bill.

“It’s about giving people the opportunity to drive less and live more.”

Housing takes center stage in Massachusetts

Massachusetts Democratic Gov. Maura Healey has made housing a priority.

Among her most potent tools is a 2021 law that requires 177 towns or communities nearby to create zoning districts allowing multi-family housing. The state provided nearly $8 million to more than 150 communities to help create these zones, while threatening to cut funding for those that don’t. More than 6,000 housing units are in development as a result.

“You put housing nearby public transit” Healey said. “It’s great for people. They can literally get up, leave their home, walk to a commuter rail and get to work.”

Among the first to comply was Lexington, which has approved 10 projects, including a $115 million complex with 187 housing units and retail space.

Walking past earth-moving equipment and dump trucks at the construction site earlier this year, project manager Quinlan Locke said: “This is a landscape yard. It’s commercial. It’s meant for trucking.”

But, he added, in “two years from now, it’s going to be meant for people who live here, work here and play here. This is going to become someone’s home.”

Opposition to zoning changes

Some advocates argue the lofty goals of transit housing are falling short due to fierce local resistance and lack of funding and support at the federal and state levels.

Higher mortgage interest rates, more government red tape, rising construction costs and lack of investment at transit stations also have contributed to a troubling trend — nine times more housing units built far from public transit versus near it in the past two decades, according to a 2023 Urban Institute study.

In Massachusetts, 19 communities still haven’t created new zones. Some unsuccessfully sued the state to halt the law, while residents rejected new zones in others. Lexington eventually shrank its zone from 227 acres to 90 acres after residents complained.

“If we allow the state to come in and dictate how we zone, what else are they going to come in and dictate?” said Anthony Renzoni, a selectman from the town of Holden, which sued the state and is drawing up a new zoning map after residents rejected the first one.

New housing, a new life

In Los Angeles, the six-story complex where Smith lives in East Hollywood is home to 300 new residents since opening in February. It’s revitalizing the area around the metro site, with a Filipino grocery, medical clinic and farmers market opening early next year.

Half the 187 units are reserved for formerly homeless residents like Smith, who had been living in a rundown motel paid for with a voucher and before that on the street. She’s been assigned a case worker and is getting help with basic life skills, budgeting and finding work.

Equally important: Smith, who can’t afford a car, doesn’t need one.

“I’m very very fortunate to be somewhere where the transit takes me where I want to go,” she said. “Where I want to go is not that far.”",https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/preview-906.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 08:03:04.211642

Both chambers of the state legislature voted to end the state’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative as part of the state’s budget, which cut funding for the program. The bill unwinds a 2019 decision by Pennsylvania’s former governor to join the cap-and-trade program.

The move comes as Shapiro pushes to transform Pennsylvania into a major hub for artificial intelligence. The AI boom is propelling the biggest buildout of natural gas-fired power plants in years, and Pennsylvania has long been a top producer of the fossil fuel. Consumer Energy Alliance, which represents businesses and fossil fuel generators, applauded the move, saying it will help reduce escalating utility bills, while climate group Evergreen Action called RGGI the state’s strongest tool for lowering energy costs.

While the exit is seen by some as a capitulation to Republicans and the fossil fuel industry, Shapiro said it removes a key barrier.

“For years the Republicans who’ve led the Senate have used RGGI as an excuse to stall substantive conversations about energy production; today that excuse is gone,” Shapiro said during a press conference minutes before signing the budget. “I am looking forward to aggressively pushing for policies that create more jobs in the energy sector, bring more clean energy onto our grid and reduce the cost of energy for all Pennsylvanians.”

Prospect welcomes the announcement of the SMR at Wylfa, which has a strong nuclear heritage, being home to a former nuclear power plant that is currently being decommissioned.

However, Prospect has expressed its hope that Wylfa would still be considered for a larger-scale nuclear power station in the future.

Prospect Senior Deputy General Secretary Sue Ferns OBE says:

“The nuclear renaissance can bring clean, reliable energy and good, secure jobs to all corners of the UK and it is welcome that government is pressing ahead with the SMR programme that will play a crucial role in the future of our energy mix.

“Wylfa has a proud nuclear past and a bright nuclear future, and is uniquely placed to play a key strategic role in the mission to become a clean energy superpower.

“The announcement of SMR deployment at Wylfa is welcome, but must not preclude the option of a gigawatt-scale nuclear project there in the future, and we hope and expect that the site will be included in the GBE-N study of potential sites for the next large nuclear project.

“Nuclear can support thousands of well-paid jobs and sustain local economies, and this announcement is the first page of the next chapter for Wales’ Energy Island.”",https://d28j9ucj9uj44t.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-469622213-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 11:02:33.894640

On the tech giant’s 500-acre campus in Redmond, Washington, teams began holding regular “triage” meetings to confront serious questions posed by the artificial intelligence boom: Where would the company find the gigawatts — just one gigawatt can power nearly 750,000 US homes — needed for data centers? And how could Microsoft possibly secure that extra energy while still making progress toward a long-standing goal of going carbon-negative?

The AI discussions were “interesting and terrifying all at the same time,” said Brian Janous, who served until August 2023 as Microsoft’s vice president of energy. Microsoft and other major tech companies, he said, had to “look at the climate commitments they set and say, ‘Can I still do this?’”

Article content

Nearly three years later, Microsoft and rivals including Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are still struggling to answer that question. On one hand, they’re trying to obtain every electron possible to power their trillion-dollar bet on AI. On the other, they’re trying to stay true to a goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 or sooner.

Article content

“There’s no question that the current push to develop AI infrastructure is putting a strain on the climate commitments of the big tech companies, all of which were made prior to the advent of AI,” Janous said in an interview. After leaving Microsoft, he co-founded Cloverleaf Infrastructure, which partners with utilities to develop clean-powered sites that supply the largest data-center providers.

US President Donald Trump isn’t making this challenge any easier. Since taking office, he’s slashed federal funding for green initiatives, such as wind and solar, and signaled his support for powering AI with generators that use fossil fuels, including aging coal-fired plants. Wary of irritating their biggest ally in Washington, tech leaders so far have refrained from publicly challenging the president over his campaign against renewables.

For now, the so-called hyperscalers continue to buy clean energy at a record pace, with Meta, Amazon, Google and Microsoft ranking as the biggest corporate signers of power purchase agreements with renewable suppliers. Together they accounted for 9.6 gigawatts of US clean energy purchases in the first half of 2025, amounting to 40% of the global total, according to the latest BloombergNEF data.",https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/financialpost/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/776373636.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 06:59:54.631262

(""Canadian Solar"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: CSIQ) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Third Quarter Highlights

Net revenues of $1.5 billion, at the high end of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion guidance.

17.2% gross margin, exceeding guidance of 14% to 16%.

e-STORAGE achieved record 2.7 GWh in quarterly battery energy storage shipments, above guidance of 2.1 GWh to 2.3 GWh.

e-STORAGE's contracted backlog increased to $3.1 billion, as of October 31, 2025.

Phase I of the solar cell factory in Indiana, U.S. is expected to begin production in March 2026.

Phase I of the lithium battery energy storage factory in Kentucky, U.S. is expected to commence production in December 2026.

Dr. Shawn Qu, Chairman and CEO, commented, ""Third quarter revenue was at the high end of guidance, while gross margin exceeded expectations, supported by strong energy storage deliveries and a high mix of module shipments to profitable markets. Demand for energy storage continues to grow, driven by emerging applications such as data centers. We are managing the business with discipline, prioritizing profitability and investing strategically to ensure the resilience of our operations. I am pleased to share that our residential energy storage business is on track to become profitable in 2025. At the same time, we are making strong progress on our manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Construction of our solar cell factory in Indiana and our integrated lithium battery cell, pack, and BESS factory in Kentucky is progressing as planned, with production expected to commence in the first and fourth quarters of 2026, respectively.""

Yan Zhuang, President of Canadian Solar's subsidiary CSI Solar, said, ""We delivered a sequentially higher share of module shipments to the profitable North American market. Our Mesquite factory, which has now successfully ramped up, contributed meaningfully to both shipment volume and profitability. In our energy storage business, earlier deliveries to two projects shifted certain volumes from the fourth quarter into the third, resulting in a record quarter of 2.7 GWh in shipments. While our $3.1 billion utility-scale storage backlog provides line of sight to future growth, we also continue to develop our offerings and capabilities in C&I and residential storage, segments which we expect will contribute more meaningfully to profitability next year. Looking ahead, we expect further profitability improvements, as we begin production of solar cells and lithium battery energy storage products in the U.S.""

Ismael Guerrero, CEO of Canadian Solar's subsidiary Recurrent Energy, said, ""Profitability improved sequentially, driven by higher margin contributions from this quarter's project sales. These included the profitable sales of an energy storage project in Italy and a hybrid project in Australia. Until our IPP business scales further—expanding electricity sales and power services as recurring revenue streams—near-term profitability will continue to depend primarily on global project sales. Maintaining financial discipline remains our top priority. We will balance the growth of our operating portfolio and selective project ownership sales to prudently manage cash flow and debt levels. Looking ahead to 2026, we expect to tip this balance more toward project ownership sales to enhance cash recycling and reduce leverage.""

Xinbo Zhu, Senior VP and CFO, added, ""In the third quarter, we achieved revenue of $1.5 billion, at the high end of guidance, and delivered a gross margin of 17.2%, exceeding expectations. Operating expenses normalized with the absence of one-time items, resulting in net income attributable to shareholders of $9 million. With continued discipline in working capital management and prudent pacing of project construction, we ended the quarter with a cash position of $2.2 billion.""

Third Quarter 2025 Results

Total module shipments recognized as revenues in Q3 2025 were 5.1 GW, down 35% quarter-over-quarter (""qoq"") and down 39% year-over-year (""yoy""). Of the total, 33 MW were shipped to the Company's own utility-scale solar power projects.

Net revenues were $1.5 billion in Q3 2025, down 12% sequentially and 1% yoy, mainly due to lower sales of solar modules partially offset by higher sales of battery energy storage systems.

Gross profit was $256 million, compared to $505 million in Q2 2025 and $247 million in Q3 2024. Gross margin was 17.2%, compared to 29.8% and 16.4%, respectively. The sequential decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the absence of a release of profit upon sales-type leasing of a U.S. project in Q2. The yoy increase was driven by a higher contribution from battery energy storage systems, which have delivered a more favorable margin profile than solar modules on a blended basis.

Operating expenses were $222 million, down from $378 million in Q2 2025 and $247 million in Q3 2024 due to ongoing cost reductions and absence of impairment charges related to certain solar and storage assets, as well as manufacturing assets. Operating expenses represented 14.9% of revenue, compared to 22.3% in Q2 2025 and 16.4% in Q3 2024.

Net income attributable to Canadian Solar in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (""GAAP"") in Q3 2025 was $9 million, or a net loss of $0.07 per diluted share, compared to a net income of $7 million, or a net loss of $0.08 per diluted share, in the Q2 2025, and net loss of $14 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in Q3 2024. Net loss per diluted share includes the dilutive effect of convertible bonds and Recurrent Energy redeemable preferred shares dividends, as applicable.

Adjusted net loss attributable to Canadian Solar Inc. (non-GAAP) was $26 million, and adjusted loss per share - diluted was $0.58 per share in Q3 2025, compared to an adjusted net loss of $23 million and adjusted loss per share - diluted of $0.53 per share in Q2 2025, and a net loss of $14 million or $0.31 per share in Q3 2024. Adjusted net loss attributable to Canadian Solar Inc. and adjusted loss per share - diluted in Q3 2025 and Q2 2025 exclude the recognition of income using hypothetical liquidation at book value (""HLBV"") method. The Company uses the HLBV method to attribute income and loss to its tax equity investors. Please see Recurrent Energy - HLBV for definition and About Non-GAAP Financial Measures for reconciliation to nearest GAAP measures.

Net cash flow used in operating activities in Q3 2025 was $112 million, driven by changes in working capital, specifically a decrease in inventories during the prior quarter, compared to net cash flow provided by operating activities of $189 million in Q2 2025 and net cash flow used in operating activities of $231 million in Q3 2024.

Total debt, including financing liabilities, was $6.4 billion as of September 30, 2025, including $2.7 billion, $3.5 billion, and $0.2 billion related to CSI Solar, Recurrent Energy, and convertible notes, respectively. Total debt rose from $6.3 billion as of June 30, 2025, mainly due to new borrowings for development of projects and operational assets. Total non-recourse debt as of September 30, 2025, was $2.0 billion.

Business Segments

The Company operates in two reportable segments: CSI Solar, focused on solar modules and battery energy storage manufacturing and products, and Recurrent Energy, focused on utility-scale solar power and battery energy storage project development and operation.

Recurrent Energy

As of September 30, 2025, the Company held a leading position with a total global solar project development pipeline of approximately 25 GWp and a battery energy storage project development pipeline of 81 GWh.

The business model consists of three key drivers:

Electricity revenue from operating portfolio to drive stable, diversified cash flows in growth markets with stable currencies, with some project ownership sales to manage cash flow and debt level;

Asset sales (solar power and battery energy storage) in the rest of the world to drive cash-efficient growth model, as value from project sales will help fund growth in operating assets in stable currency markets; and

Power services (O&M) through long-term operations and maintenance (""O&M"") contracts, currently with over 14 GW of contracted projects, to drive stable and long-term recurring earnings and synergies with the project development platform.

Project Development Pipeline – Solar

As of September 30, 2025, the Company's total solar project development pipeline was 25.1 GWp, including 2.0 GWp under construction, 3.4 GWp of backlog, and 19.7 GWp of projects in advanced and early-stage development, defined as follows:

Backlog projects are late-stage projects that have passed their risk cliff date and are expected to start construction in the next 1-4 years. A project's risk cliff date is the date on which the project passes the last high-risk development stage and varies depending on the country where it is located. Typically, this occurs after the project has received all the required environmental and regulatory approvals, and entered into interconnection agreements and offtake contracts, including feed-in tariff (""FIT"") arrangements and power purchase agreements (""PPAs""). A significant majority of backlog projects are contracted (i.e., have secured a PPA or FIT), and the remaining have a reasonable assurance of securing PPAs.

Advanced pipeline projects are mid-stage projects that have secured or have more than 90% certainty of securing an interconnection agreement.

Early-stage pipeline projects are early-stage projects controlled by the Company that are in the process of securing interconnection.

While the magnitude of the Company's project development pipeline is an important indicator of potential expanded power generation and battery energy storage capacity as well as potential future revenue growth, the development of projects in its pipeline is inherently uncertain. If the Company does not successfully complete the pipeline projects in a timely manner, it may not realize the anticipated benefits of the projects to the extent anticipated, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, the Company's guidance and estimates for its future operating and financial results assume the completion of certain solar projects and battery energy storage projects that are in its pipeline. If the Company is unable to execute on its actionable pipeline, it may miss its guidance, which could adversely affect the market price of its common shares and its business, financial condition, or results of operations.

HLBV

The Company applies the HLBV method to account for its contractual relationships with tax equity investors in U.S. solar energy and battery energy storage projects. This method which allocates income or loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests reflects the changes in the amounts that tax equity investors would hypothetically receive upon liquidation at the beginning and end of each reporting period, after considering any capital transactions, such as contributions or distributions, between the subsidiaries and tax equity investors.

The following table presents the Company's total solar project development pipeline.

Project Development Pipeline – Battery Energy Storage

As of September 30, 2025, the Company's total battery energy storage project development pipeline was 80.6 GWh, including 6.5 GWh under construction and in backlog, and 74.1 GWh of projects in advanced and early-stage development.

The table below sets forth the Company's total battery energy storage project development pipeline.

CSI Solar

Business Outlook

The Company's business outlook is based on management's current views and estimates given factors such as existing market conditions, order book, production capacity, input material prices, foreign exchange fluctuations, the anticipated timing of project sales, and the global economic environment. This outlook is subject to uncertainty with respect to, among other things, customer demand, project construction and sale schedules, product sales prices and costs, supply chain constraints, and geopolitical conflicts. Management's views and estimates are subject to change without notice.

In Q4 2025, the Company expects total revenue to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Gross margin is expected to be between 14% and 16%. Total module shipments recognized as revenues by CSI Solar are expected to be in the range of 4.6 GW to 4.8 GW. Total battery energy storage shipments by CSI Solar in Q4 2025 are expected to be in the range of 2.1 GWh to 2.3 GWh, including approximately 600 MWh to the Company's own projects.

For the full year of 2026, the Company expects CSI Solar's total module shipments to be in the range of 25 GW to 30 GW, including approximately 1 GW to the Company's projects. CSI Solar's total battery energy storage shipments are expected to be in the range of 14 GWh to 17 GWh.

Dr. Shawn Qu, Chairman and CEO, commented, ""We will continue to focus on profitable solar markets and to manage volumes in less profitable regions. In contrast, demand for energy storage remains robust, supported by healthy market fundamentals and growing applications. Our 2026 full year storage outlook reflects strong year-over-year growth, backed by contracted volumes and visibility into customers' development pipelines. We also expect to begin production of solar cells and lithium battery energy storage products in the U.S. next year. Financial prudence remains our top priority. Accordingly, Recurrent Energy will increase project ownership sales in 2026 to recycle capital and manage the overall debt level.""

(""Canadian Solar"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: CSIQ) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Third Quarter Highlights

Net revenues of $1.5 billion, at the high end of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion guidance.

17.2% gross margin, exceeding guidance of 14% to 16%.

e-STORAGE achieved record 2.7 GWh in quarterly battery energy storage shipments, above guidance of 2.1 GWh to 2.3 GWh.

e-STORAGE's contracted backlog increased to $3.1 billion, as of October 31, 2025.

Phase I of the solar cell factory in Indiana, U.S. is expected to begin production in March 2026.

Phase I of the lithium battery energy storage factory in Kentucky, U.S. is expected to commence production in December 2026.

Dr. Shawn Qu, Chairman and CEO, commented, ""Third quarter revenue was at the high end of guidance, while gross margin exceeded expectations, supported by strong energy storage deliveries and a high mix of module shipments to profitable markets. Demand for energy storage continues to grow, driven by emerging applications such as data centers. We are managing the business with discipline, prioritizing profitability and investing strategically to ensure the resilience of our operations. I am pleased to share that our residential energy storage business is on track to become profitable in 2025. At the same time, we are making strong progress on our manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Construction of our solar cell factory in Indiana and our integrated lithium battery cell, pack, and BESS factory in Kentucky is progressing as planned, with production expected to commence in the first and fourth quarters of 2026, respectively.""

Yan Zhuang, President of Canadian Solar's subsidiary CSI Solar, said, ""We delivered a sequentially higher share of module shipments to the profitable North American market. Our Mesquite factory, which has now successfully ramped up, contributed meaningfully to both shipment volume and profitability. In our energy storage business, earlier deliveries to two projects shifted certain volumes from the fourth quarter into the third, resulting in a record quarter of 2.7 GWh in shipments. While our $3.1 billion utility-scale storage backlog provides line of sight to future growth, we also continue to develop our offerings and capabilities in C&I and residential storage, segments which we expect will contribute more meaningfully to profitability next year. Looking ahead, we expect further profitability improvements, as we begin production of solar cells and lithium battery energy storage products in the U.S.""

Ismael Guerrero, CEO of Canadian Solar's subsidiary Recurrent Energy, said, ""Profitability improved sequentially, driven by higher margin contributions from this quarter's project sales. These included the profitable sales of an energy storage project in Italy and a hybrid project in Australia. Until our IPP business scales further—expanding electricity sales and power services as recurring revenue streams—near-term profitability will continue to depend primarily on global project sales. Maintaining financial discipline remains our top priority. We will balance the growth of our operating portfolio and selective project ownership sales to prudently manage cash flow and debt levels. Looking ahead to 2026, we expect to tip this balance more toward project ownership sales to enhance cash recycling and reduce leverage.""

Xinbo Zhu, Senior VP and CFO, added, ""In the third quarter, we achieved revenue of $1.5 billion, at the high end of guidance, and delivered a gross margin of 17.2%, exceeding expectations. Operating expenses normalized with the absence of one-time items, resulting in net income attributable to shareholders of $9 million. With continued discipline in working capital management and prudent pacing of project construction, we ended the quarter with a cash position of $2.2 billion.""

Third Quarter 2025 Results

Total module shipments recognized as revenues in Q3 2025 were 5.1 GW, down 35% quarter-over-quarter (""qoq"") and down 39% year-over-year (""yoy""). Of the total, 33 MW were shipped to the Company's own utility-scale solar power projects.

Net revenues were $1.5 billion in Q3 2025, down 12% sequentially and 1% yoy, mainly due to lower sales of solar modules partially offset by higher sales of battery energy storage systems.

Gross profit was $256 million, compared to $505 million in Q2 2025 and $247 million in Q3 2024. Gross margin was 17.2%, compared to 29.8% and 16.4%, respectively. The sequential decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the absence of a release of profit upon sales-type leasing of a U.S. project in Q2. The yoy increase was driven by a higher contribution from battery energy storage systems, which have delivered a more favorable margin profile than solar modules on a blended basis.

Operating expenses were $222 million, down from $378 million in Q2 2025 and $247 million in Q3 2024 due to ongoing cost reductions and absence of impairment charges related to certain solar and storage assets, as well as manufacturing assets. Operating expenses represented 14.9% of revenue, compared to 22.3% in Q2 2025 and 16.4% in Q3 2024.

Net income attributable to Canadian Solar in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (""GAAP"") in Q3 2025 was $9 million, or a net loss of $0.07 per diluted share, compared to a net income of $7 million, or a net loss of $0.08 per diluted share, in the Q2 2025, and net loss of $14 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in Q3 2024. Net loss per diluted share includes the dilutive effect of convertible bonds and Recurrent Energy redeemable preferred shares dividends, as applicable.

Adjusted net loss attributable to Canadian Solar Inc. (non-GAAP) was $26 million, and adjusted loss per share - diluted was $0.58 per share in Q3 2025, compared to an adjusted net loss of $23 million and adjusted loss per share - diluted of $0.53 per share in Q2 2025, and a net loss of $14 million or $0.31 per share in Q3 2024. Adjusted net loss attributable to Canadian Solar Inc. and adjusted loss per share - diluted in Q3 2025 and Q2 2025 exclude the recognition of income using hypothetical liquidation at book value (""HLBV"") method. The Company uses the HLBV method to attribute income and loss to its tax equity investors. Please see Recurrent Energy - HLBV for definition and About Non-GAAP Financial Measures for reconciliation to nearest GAAP measures.

Net cash flow used in operating activities in Q3 2025 was $112 million, driven by changes in working capital, specifically a decrease in inventories during the prior quarter, compared to net cash flow provided by operating activities of $189 million in Q2 2025 and net cash flow used in operating activities of $231 million in Q3 2024.

Total debt, including financing liabilities, was $6.4 billion as of September 30, 2025, including $2.7 billion, $3.5 billion, and $0.2 billion related to CSI Solar, Recurrent Energy, and convertible notes, respectively. Total debt rose from $6.3 billion as of June 30, 2025, mainly due to new borrowings for development of projects and operational assets. Total non-recourse debt as of September 30, 2025, was $2.0 billion.

Business Segments

The Company operates in two reportable segments: CSI Solar, focused on solar modules and battery energy storage manufacturing and products, and Recurrent Energy, focused on utility-scale solar power and battery energy storage project development and operation.

Recurrent Energy

As of September 30, 2025, the Company held a leading position with a total global solar project development pipeline of approximately 25 GWp and a battery energy storage project development pipeline of 81 GWh.

The business model consists of three key drivers:

Electricity revenue from operating portfolio to drive stable, diversified cash flows in growth markets with stable currencies, with some project ownership sales to manage cash flow and debt level;

Asset sales (solar power and battery energy storage) in the rest of the world to drive cash-efficient growth model, as value from project sales will help fund growth in operating assets in stable currency markets; and

Power services (O&M) through long-term operations and maintenance (""O&M"") contracts, currently with over 14 GW of contracted projects, to drive stable and long-term recurring earnings and synergies with the project development platform.

Project Development Pipeline – Solar

As of September 30, 2025, the Company's total solar project development pipeline was 25.1 GWp, including 2.0 GWp under construction, 3.4 GWp of backlog, and 19.7 GWp of projects in advanced and early-stage development, defined as follows:

Backlog projects are late-stage projects that have passed their risk cliff date and are expected to start construction in the next 1-4 years. A project's risk cliff date is the date on which the project passes the last high-risk development stage and varies depending on the country where it is located. Typically, this occurs after the project has received all the required environmental and regulatory approvals, and entered into interconnection agreements and offtake contracts, including feed-in tariff (""FIT"") arrangements and power purchase agreements (""PPAs""). A significant majority of backlog projects are contracted (i.e., have secured a PPA or FIT), and the remaining have a reasonable assurance of securing PPAs.

Advanced pipeline projects are mid-stage projects that have secured or have more than 90% certainty of securing an interconnection agreement.

Early-stage pipeline projects are early-stage projects controlled by the Company that are in the process of securing interconnection.

While the magnitude of the Company's project development pipeline is an important indicator of potential expanded power generation and battery energy storage capacity as well as potential future revenue growth, the development of projects in its pipeline is inherently uncertain. If the Company does not successfully complete the pipeline projects in a timely manner, it may not realize the anticipated benefits of the projects to the extent anticipated, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, the Company's guidance and estimates for its future operating and financial results assume the completion of certain solar projects and battery energy storage projects that are in its pipeline. If the Company is unable to execute on its actionable pipeline, it may miss its guidance, which could adversely affect the market price of its common shares and its business, financial condition, or results of operations.

HLBV

The Company applies the HLBV method to account for its contractual relationships with tax equity investors in U.S. solar energy and battery energy storage projects. This method which allocates income or loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests reflects the changes in the amounts that tax equity investors would hypothetically receive upon liquidation at the beginning and end of each reporting period, after considering any capital transactions, such as contributions or distributions, between the subsidiaries and tax equity investors.

The following table presents the Company's total solar project development pipeline.

Project Development Pipeline – Battery Energy Storage

As of September 30, 2025, the Company's total battery energy storage project development pipeline was 80.6 GWh, including 6.5 GWh under construction and in backlog, and 74.1 GWh of projects in advanced and early-stage development.

The table below sets forth the Company's total battery energy storage project development pipeline.

CSI Solar

Solar Modules and Solar System Kits

CSI Solar shipped 5.1 GW of solar modules and solar system kits to more than 60 countries in Q3 2025. The top five markets ranked by shipments were the U.S., China, Spain, Pakistan, and South Africa.

CSI Solar's revised manufacturing capacity expansion targets are set forth below.

e-STORAGE: Battery Energy Storage Solutions

As of October 31 , 202 5 , e-STORAGE contracted backlog, including contracted long-term service agreements, was $3 .1 billion. These are signed orders with contractual obligations to customers, providing significant earnings visibility over a multi-year period.

The table below sets forth e-STORAGE's manufacturing capacity expansion targets.

Business Outlook

The Company's business outlook is based on management's current views and estimates given factors such as existing market conditions, order book, production capacity, input material prices, foreign exchange fluctuations, the anticipated timing of project sales, and the global economic environment. This outlook is subject to uncertainty with respect to, among other things, customer demand, project construction and sale schedules, product sales prices and costs, supply chain constraints, and geopolitical conflicts. Management's views and estimates are subject to change without notice.

In Q4 2025, the Company expects total revenue to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Gross margin is expected to be between 14% and 16%. Total module shipments recognized as revenues by CSI Solar are expected to be in the range of 4.6 GW to 4.8 GW. Total battery energy storage shipments by CSI Solar in Q4 2025 are expected to be in the range of 2.1 GWh to 2.3 GWh, including approximately 600 MWh to the Company's own projects.

For the full year of 2026, the Company expects CSI Solar's total module shipments to be in the range of 25 GW to 30 GW, including approximately 1 GW to the Company's projects. CSI Solar's total battery energy storage shipments are expected to be in the range of 14 GWh to 17 GWh.

Dr. Shawn Qu, Chairman and CEO, commented, ""We will continue to focus on profitable solar markets and to manage volumes in less profitable regions. In contrast, demand for energy storage remains robust, supported by healthy market fundamentals and growing applications. Our 2026 full year storage outlook reflects strong year-over-year growth, backed by contracted volumes and visibility into customers' development pipelines. We also expect to begin production of solar cells and lithium battery energy storage products in the U.S. next year. Financial prudence remains our top priority. Accordingly, Recurrent Energy will increase project ownership sales in 2026 to recycle capital and manage the overall debt level.""

Regulatory cliff But a US-based SAF investor was downbeat about the SAF market in the US.
The SAF investor tells GCV that their portfolio companies do have enough liquidity for the next couple of years.
Tech advances While SAF policy is progressing by fits and starts, the technology to produce low carbon aviation fuel is making headway.","A year ago, the investment landscape for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) was buoyant on both sides of the Atlantic. Today, the prospects for the sector are more favourable in Europe.

While the SAF market in Europe has continued to gain momentum over the past year, sentiment in the US has cooled following the anti-climate stance of the Trump administration.

In Europe, visibility into revenues for SAF producers is getting clearer, while their US counterparts have spent 2025 shrouded in uncertainty.

Despite this, US corporates have been putting more money into funding initiatives for SAF. Just last month, a coalition of aviation players got together to launch the $150m Oneworld BEV Fund, anchored by American Airlines and Alaskan Airlines, and managed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures. That followed another group of corporates that backed the $100m United Airlines Sustainable Aviation Fund in 2023, which gained more LPs from the industry over the following year.

Regulatory cliff

But a US-based SAF investor was downbeat about the SAF market in the US. “It’s a different market from November of last year, that’s probably what the decisive turning point was,” says the investor, referring to Donald Trump’s election victory, which pulled a curtain down over sustainability initiatives backed by the US federal government, including subsidies for SAF developers.

“When the notion of the fund first got started, the regulatory environment, particularly in the United States, was much different,” says the SAF-focused investor.

“All this stuff takes lots of capital, and that capital really was going to be unlocked by virtue of government support, in one form or another, that was going to underpin the funding for it. That support has waned,” he says.

Federal tax credits in the US for sustainable fuels such as the 45Z credits under the Inflation Reduction Act which are given per gallon of SAF produced are less certain than they would have been when some startups last raised money. The new administration’s Treasury Department gave guidance earlier this year that softened expectations for the eligibility of certain feedstocks, and legislative proposals are in the works that might cap the credit-per-gallon below where it was expected.

45Z credits are meant to start this year but are set to expire in 2027 unless extended. That might change depending on the results of the mid-term elections.

At the state level, there are low carbon fuel standards (LCFS), which incentivise producers to lower the average lifecycle carbon intensity of their fuels below a declining annual target.

While LCFS rules are legally independent from federal regulations, the value of the credits is not unaffected by federal regulations. If 45Z support goes down, LCFS credits can actually become more valuable because there is less supply of credits overall, but any state-level increase would not likely compensate for the loss of federal support.

The SAF investor tells GCV that their portfolio companies do have enough liquidity for the next couple of years. For now, they’re in a holding pattern, watching to see how regulations evolve.

By contrast, European players are more confident. Both the UK and the EU have incremental blending mandates that are starting to kick in. The UK SAF mandate requires 2% of the UK’s aviation fuel demand to be met with SAF, ratcheting up to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040.

The EU’s ReFuelEU mandate starts slower but then accelerates faster than the UK’s, requiring 2% of member states’ fuel to be met with SAF this year, increasing to 6% by 2030, 34% by 2040, and 70% by 2050.

A European startup that recently raised funds is UK-based OXCCU, a company developing technology to convert carbon into fuels and chemicals. Its recent $28m series B saw more participation from corporates including Eni, Aramco, IAG, Safran, and Orlen compared with its series A. Encouraged by the success of its OX1 pilot plant at London Oxford Airport, it is seeking to open its second, larger demonstration plant next year.

Apart from OXCCU, other European SAF startups to get funded this year include Norwegian SAF producer Wastefront and Swiss SAF technology company Metafuels.

Tech advances

While SAF policy is progressing by fits and starts, the technology to produce low carbon aviation fuel is making headway. Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids and eSAF have expanded the feedstock landscape. A large amount of money is still needed to build out commercial-scale facilities, although it may prove to be cheaper to retrofit existing refineries that are not making money.

SAF producers are seeking to change the kind of feedstocks they are using. Regulators and entrepreneurs are prioritising carbon feedstocks such as biogas, waste wood, agricultural waste and captured CO2 because they don’t bring the challenges of food displacement that crop-based bio-fuels do.

“We can start from biomethane or CO2, and I don’t think CO2 is in short supply,” says Nacho Gimenez, COO at OXCCU, who previously considered investments in SAF while an investor at BP Ventures and energy investor DTEK. The problem becomes more a logistical one of capturing the carbon and transporting it than sourcing it in the first place, he adds.

Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) is increasingly popular because it takes waste products such as used cooking oil, fatty streams from industrial waste, and other fats and vegetable oils, and can heavily reduce the lifecycle emissions.

But the availability of sustainable feedstock for hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids compared with other feedstocks such as cultivated palm oil is not enough to meet demand. It is also more costly.

eSAF is also gaining popularity because it is made with renewable hydrogen and captured CO2, typically reducing emissions by at least 70% compared with jet fuel. It circumvents the supply constraints of hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids and benefits from a sub-mandate for synthetic fuels under ReFuelEU.

Wider outlook

The price of SAF production is still high, requiring economies of scale and large capex.

The price of jet fuel is tied to oil, while the ultimate price of SAF is determined by negotiated contracts.

The capex for building the production infrastructure will only come if investors see that offtake contracts are available at a good price. And at least in the US, where there is no federal blending mandate, that’s even harder to picture than in Europe. Some US investors are taking a step back to see where things go before committing more capital.

“We’ve laid our bets around the space [in terms of technologies], but the market kind of in a trough right now as it relates to climate tech, and sustainability in particular,” says the SAF investor.

“We’re being very prudent and measured with where we deploy capital going forward.”

But, even in Europe, if the costs aren’t brought down by the time the heavier mandates kick in, those costs will be passed on to consumers. Volume by itself is not enough, it will be the most cost-efficient startups that succeed.

“Once we get to those blending levels of 2040, it will not be the biggest SAF producers that thrive, but it will be the most economic producers,” says Gimenez.",https://globalventuring.com/content/uploads/2025/11/Feature-lead-image.png,N,,2025-11-13 06:59:36.396576

LNG And Natural Gas Prices U.S. natural gas spot prices moved less than 1% lower Wednesday to around $4.54 per million British thermal units.
An Enverus forecast Wednesday projected U.S. LNG prices to moderate significantly over the winter months, ""due to storage surplus and mild weather.""
For the first five months of 2025, U.S. LNG exports to Europe increased significantly, according to the EIA.
Exxon Mobil Stock Performance XOM stock declined around 1% to 118.70 in Wednesday's stock market action.","The U.S. is already the world's largest liquefied natural, or LNG, gas exporter but it's set to receive another boost with a major Exxon Mobil (XOM) LNG project set to come online at the end of 2025.

The Golden Pass LNG export terminal in Texas, which is owned by Exxon Mobil and QatarEnergy, is set to begin operations at the end of 2025 and will have export capacity of more than 18 million metric tons per annum when fully operational, according to Exxon. The project was originally expected to be an import terminal before plans changed.

Exxon in August published its global outlook through 2050, which forecasts global natural gas consumption increasing 20%, with LNG demand doubling over the next 25 years. The company also expects around 5% oil demand growth by 2050.

Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods told analysts on the Oct. 31 Q3 earnings call that the Golden Pass LNG project remains ""on track for start-up around year-end."" He said that it and other projects are expected to form ""an important foundation"" to ""2030 earnings and cash flow growth plans.

""They're expected to drive more than $3 billion in earnings contributions next year at constant prices and margin,"" Woods said.

""The growth in LNG is what underpins our continued interest in finding low-cost, advantaged LNG production. The recognition of economies growing and people's livelihoods improving and the energy demand required to facilitate that underpins continued growth in oil and gas,"" the Exxon CEO added on Oct. 31.

Golden Pass would become the 9th U.S. LNG export facility after it becomes operational. The U.S. is the world's top LNG exporter, ahead of Australia and Qatar, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

LNG And Natural Gas Prices

U.S. natural gas spot prices moved less than 1% lower Wednesday to around $4.54 per million British thermal units. Natural gas prices are effectively flat in what has been a volatile year.

An Enverus forecast Wednesday projected U.S. LNG prices to moderate significantly over the winter months, ""due to storage surplus and mild weather."" However, the firm acknowledged ""significant upside exists in our view.""

Meanwhile, Europe continues to scramble to shore up its gas inventories as the winter months roll in, attempting to make up the difference for Russian gas supplies lost at the upshift of Russia's attacks on Ukraine in 2022.

Enverus estimates natural gas futures for delivery at the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) in the Netherlands and Japan Korea Marker (JKM) (benchmark price assessment) will hold near $11 per MMBtu through 2030 ""despite global LNG oversupply concerns.""

The EIA reported last week average front-month natural gas futures for delivery at the TTF averaged $10.69 per million British thermal units for the week, down from $12.79 per MMBtu in the same week in 2024.

In late 2021 and early 2022, the Netherlands TTF market saw record-high prices, reaching an average of $30.94 per MMBtu in the first half of 2022. For the first five months of 2025, U.S. LNG exports to Europe increased significantly, according to the EIA.

The EIA estimates that U.S. LNG exports will rise from an average 11.9 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in 2024 to 14.6 Bcf/d in 2025, before growing to 16 Bcf/d in 2026.

Stored European Union gas supplies currently sit at 82.4%, according to Aggregated Gas Storage Inventory, which tracks the commodity.

Exxon Mobil Stock Performance

XOM stock declined around 1% to 118.70 in Wednesday's stock market action. Meanwhile, Chevron (CVX) stock edged down 1.4% to 154.06.

Chevron dipped below its 50-day moving average Wednesday but is in a cup-with-handle base and is 5% below a traditional 161.86 buy point, according to MarketSurge charts. The supermajor held its investor day presentation early Wednesday.

Exxon is up around 4% in November and technically in a 58-week consolidation with a 126.34 buy point, according to MarketSurge. However, XOM has traded mostly sideways for the past two years, finding resistance around the 120 level.

Chevron topped third-quarter earnings-and-revenue expectations while Exxon Mobil beat profit views on Oct. 31, even as both U.S. supermajors continued the trend of quarterly profit declines.

Collectively, the 22 stocks in IBD's Oil & Gas-Integrated industry group are up more than 4% in 2025. The group has produced a handful of winners this year.

BP (BP) is up about 25% since the start of the year. Shell (SHEL) has climbed around 22%. Canada's Imperial Oil (IMO) has a 55% gain and Eni (E), based in Italy, is up about 40%.

U.S. oil prices backed off nearly 3% Wednesday, holding around $59 per barrel. West Texas intermediate futures are down about 18% this year.

How To Read Stock Charts

ING analysts noted Wednesday that recently there has been strength in the oil refinery stocks, ""with gasoline and gasoil cracks surging amid concerns about supply.""

That stems from gasoline prices holding effectively flat vs. year-ago levels, while oil prices have dropped around 14%. That combination increases refinery profit margins. In addition, disruption of Russian exports of heavy oil and refined products continues to upend markets.

""Continued Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries are a concern for the market, particularly middle distillates. Meanwhile, U.S. sanctions on Lukoil and Rosneft, and what they mean for refining assets outside of Russia, is also a concern for broader product markets,"" ING analysts Warren Patterson and Ewa Manthey noted Wednesday.

""While the outlook for oil is bearish, the strength in the refined products market is proving to be a significant obstacle,"" according to ING.

The nearly $14bn facility, known as Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina (TBMNC), is expected to create up to 5,100 new American jobs as it ramps up operations. Spanning 1,850 acres, the site will eventually produce 30 GWh of lithium-ion batteries annually, supplying Toyota’s growing range of hybrid, plug-in hybrid and battery-electric vehicles.

Alongside the launch, Toyota confirmed an additional $10bn investment in U.S. operations over the next five years, bringing its cumulative investment in American manufacturing to nearly $60bn since establishing operations almost 70 years ago. Company executives described the development as a pivotal moment in Toyota’s electrification strategy, underscoring the company’s “multi-pathway” approach to mobility that blends hybrid, plug-in and full-battery technologies to meet diverse market needs.

The Liberty facility represents one of the most significant single manufacturing investments in North Carolina’s history, expected to catalyse economic growth across the Piedmont Triad region. State officials have highlighted the project’s role in shaping the area into a national hub for advanced automotive and clean-energy production. Governor Josh Stein called the launch a historic milestone, noting that Toyota’s presence will create thousands of new skilled jobs while bolstering the state’s leadership in the clean-energy economy.

The plant will serve as a key hub for developing and producing lithium-ion batteries for models including the Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV and RAV4 HEV, as well as a forthcoming three-row battery-electric SUV to be built in the U.S. Initial production lines are already shipping hybrid-electric modules to Toyota Kentucky and Mazda Toyota Manufacturing in Alabama, with full build-out planned by 2030.

Beyond its production capabilities, Toyota has invested in creating a modern workplace and community environment at the Liberty site. Planned amenities include on-site childcare, a pharmacy, a medical clinic and a fitness centre — part of the company’s wider commitment to being a “best-in-town” employer. Don Stewart, president of Toyota North Carolina, credited the plant’s progress to the dedication of its workforce and the collaboration of local and state partners, describing the facility as “a place we are all proud to call home.”

Toyota also announced new education and training initiatives to strengthen the regional talent pipeline. Through its Driving Possibilities program — a national STEM education partnership led by the Toyota USA Foundation — the company pledged an additional $2.7m grant to schools in Guilford County and Asheboro City. The program aims to expand access to science, technology, engineering and mathematics education while connecting students to future manufacturing and mobility careers. Regional education leaders praised the initiative for its role in bridging opportunity gaps and fostering innovation among North Carolina’s next generation of workers.

Josh Shapiro abandoned his predecessor’s effort to join a regional compact limiting power plant emissions.
Democratic political strategist Morgan Hook said cost-of-living issues, including energy affordability, are what voters care most about.
Gas power plant reversal On Friday, the same day the Hochul administration approved the pipeline project, the state also settled a lawsuit with a gas-powered cryptocurrency mining operation.
It was a double blow to climate advocates who had been organizing against the pipeline and energy-intensive cryptomining operations.","“She did not just approve a fossil fuel project. She made a moral choice,” Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado, who is primarying Hochul, said on Monday. “New Yorkers deserve a governor who does not treat the climate crisis as a PR problem, but as a test of moral leadership.”

Hochul says she is prioritizing concerns about energy affordability and reliability as she rejects more than a decade of climate orthodoxy in New York.

With Trump’s antipathy toward renewables like solar and wind, increasing energy demand and skyrocketing utility bills, moderate Democrats like Hochul are embracing an “all of the above” approach to energy policy.

“We need to govern in reality,” Hochul said Friday. “We are facing war against clean energy from Washington Republicans, including our New York delegation, which is why we have adopted an all-of-the-above approach that includes a continued commitment to renewables and nuclear power to ensure grid reliability and affordability.”

Hochul’s shift reflects a national realignment and recognition by many Democrats that ambitious climate targets are proving more challenging than they’d hoped, and near-term pocketbook concerns, including high energy costs, are a higher priority for voters.

Newly elected Democratic governors in New Jersey and Virginia also focused on energy affordability during their campaigns. Massachusetts Democrats are actively considering legislation to weaken the state’s emissions reduction targets. California has retreated on climate action this year. And Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro abandoned his predecessor’s effort to join a regional compact limiting power plant emissions.

Democratic political strategist Morgan Hook said cost-of-living issues, including energy affordability, are what voters care most about.

“The reality is, most people don’t think about their power until it is not there, until they lose it, or when they open their electric bills,” said Hook, a partner with Bluejacket Strategies. “Republicans are starting to talk about energy prices, and it is very clearly starting to become a political issue that is rising up the ranks of those issues that are most important.”

Labor and business support

Hochul’s actions Friday were a welcome signal for some, particularly powerful labor and business interests.

“This is a seismic change in policy direction,” said Gavin Donohue, head of the Independent Power Producers of New York, Inc., which represents power generators including gas plants in the state.

Hochul has been communicating more openness to gas for months as the state’s grid operator has escalated its warnings about potential reliability issues in the coming decade.

“No governor, Republican or Democrat wants to be sitting in their office and having blackouts,” Donohue said. “The reliability numbers… are a real, real eye opener to the governor and I think she’s exerted some political courage on this issue.”

Hochul has delayed mandates to electrify new buildings pending a court decision and wants to revise the state’s landmark 2019 climate law that requires steep emissions reduction New York is not on track to achieve. The governor incensed environmental groups at the beginning of the year when she put an indefinite hold on regulations to limit emissions and charge polluters — and Friday’s decisions reignited that anger.

Left-leaning environmental groups Food and Water Action, New York Communities for Change and Third Act’s New York chapters endorsed Delgado this week. They think Hochul took the wrong message from last week’s Democratic victories including that of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in New York City. Mamdani opposes the pipeline.

“From driving new investments in offshore wind, solar energy, and clean water, to cleaning up industrial waste sites in disadvantaged communities, Governor Hochul has shown that we can address climate change head-on while creating good-paying jobs and lowering costs,” Hochul campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement.

Pipeline project

The 24-mile Northeast Supply Enhancement pipeline that would bring gas to Long Island and New York City was also issued permits Friday by New Jersey. The project was revived in May by developer Williams Co. after receiving support from the Trump administration.

White House officials indicated Hochul agreed to consider new gas pipelines in New York in exchange for the federal go-ahead for an offshore wind project. Hochul’s office has denied there was any deal.

“She swears she wasn’t under pressure or making a deal with Trump, so to me it’s inexplicable,” Third Act founder and prominent environmentist Bill McKibben said in an email. “Signing up New Yorkers for decades of expensive gas-fired power is a serious loss.”

The project had support from business groups and unions. Proponents said it would lower electricity costs and ensure the reliability of the downstate gas system, which has supply constraints and currently relies on trucked-in gas on the coldest days.

“This approval is a significant milestone in boosting local communities by generating more affordable and reliable energy, lowering utility bills, and providing much-needed economic stimulus that will enable more families to ascend to the middle class,” said Gary LaBarbera, president of the NYC and NYS Building Trades.

Williams Co. also plans to continue working on another pipeline former Gov. Andrew Cuomo blocked on Earth Day in 2016 that would carry more gas into the New England region. The New York Department of Environmental Conservation had pushed Williams for more information on the 124-mile Constitution project and the company temporarily withdrew its application last week.

Williams has touted the potential for that project to lower bills for customers in New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island by more than $8.5 billion over 15 years.

Energy costs in the region have risen faster than in other parts of the country in recent years, in part because of the reliance on gas and limited supply coming from Pennsylvania and other gas-producing states.

The pipeline approval represents a dramatic departure from more than a decade of New York energy politics under Cuomo, who banned fracking after pressure from progressive environmental advocates, rejected permits for four interstate gas pipelines and signed New York’s 2019 climate law requiring the state to cut emissions to net zero by 2050.

Climate shift

Hochul says the law’s targets are no longer realistic. Some moderate Assembly Democrats, including in upstate New York and downstate suburbs, have similar concerns.

“We’re for decarbonization. We’re for green energy. We want to make it as clean and green as possible,” said Assemblymember Patrick Carroll, who represents part of Rockland County. “We just want people to not have to pay an undue cost to do so.”

Carroll signed on to a letter calling on Hochul to delay a mandate to electrify new buildings over grid reliability and cost concerns. He and some other signatories on that letter support potential changes to the climate law, as well.

Although Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, won big in New York City’s mayoral election, moderate Democrats prevailed in New Jersey and Virginia, Larry Levy, a suburban politics expert at Hofstra University, pointed out.

Suburban voters in places like Long Island will have outsize influence in the general election where Hochul is expected to face off against Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik or Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, Levy said. Long Island residents care about the environment but also reliability and keeping costs down.

“There’s support for what they would consider reasonable projects that can assure the supply of energy and possibly protect its costs, even as they still support green energy,” he said.

But environmental advocates are pushing back on the idea that affordability and decarbonization are at odds.

“We’re not doing enough to install cheap renewable energy,” McKibben said, pointing to a new program in Australia that is offering residents three free hours of power a day thanks to its abundant solar generation.

New York has continued to contract for new renewable energy projects, with ratepayers paying a premium on their utility bills to support the projects. Hochul has espoused continued commitment to advancing those projects before federal tax credits expire.

Gas power plant reversal

On Friday, the same day the Hochul administration approved the pipeline project, the state also settled a lawsuit with a gas-powered cryptocurrency mining operation. The Department of Environmental Conservation plans to issue a permit for the Greenidge plant with the caveat that it will reduce emissions over 5 years.

The state had denied an air permit to Greenidge in 2022, citing the state’s landmark 2019 climate law.

It was a double blow to climate advocates who had been organizing against the pipeline and energy-intensive cryptomining operations.

“This is a disgusting betrayal of New Yorkers and a slap in the face to everyone who fought for our climate law,” said Yvonne Taylor, Vice President of Seneca Lake Guardian.

The Greenidge deal is a stark reversal for the governor who cheered the rejection of permits for downstate gas plants in her first few months on the job. The DEC in those 2021 actions blocked two downstate gas projects that could have supplied additional energy at lower emissions rates than older plants.

Hochul’s administration at the time declared new gas plants incompatible with the state’s climate law. As circumstances and the political winds have shifted, the governor is now embracing new nuclear and potential gas generation to close projected energy shortfalls.

New York’s grid operator is keeping older fossil fuel plants targeted for retirement by state emissions rules online for reliability reasons. They’re likely to be retained to address a forecasted reliability issue in New York City and on Long Island in the next few years.

Hochul cited those reliability concerns as DEC approved the pipeline.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F48%2Fe2%2F65a6be154cf7b43c787326263615%2Fgettyimages-2243227447.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 06:00:34.712493

Question: How do you see the next decade of the European EV battery market, and how will CATL contribute to it?
For us, it is a strategic goal to become a European manufacturer with a localised workforce and supply chain.
In response, CATL Debrecen entered into partnerships with the Vocational Training Centre and University of Debrecen and the University of Miskolc.
We also welcome university interns at CATL Debrecen, and we are planning to open a training centre modelled on our German facility.","In this interview with Matt Shen (Feng), CATL’s Managing Director for Germany and Hungary, we explored CATL’s ambitious strategy to lead the EV battery revolution across Europe. Mr Shen emphasised that localising CATL’s supplier base is a key part of their strategy, and they see strong potential in Hungary, particularly for the Debrecen factory. The company also plans to launch its own university and vocational courses, along with scholarships, to attract local talent.

Regarding the local environmental concerns, the regional leader stressed that CATL is fully committed to meeting all environmental regulations and to operating a strict monitoring process. “Our goal is to provide clear, honest information and build trust through responsible operations,” stated Matt Shen. In five years, he hopes the Debrecen factory will produce CATL’s latest technology and make residents satisfied and proud of the company.

Matt Shen joined CATL in February 2012 as a Senior Manager. He has held the position of Program Management Director since March 2017 and has served as Overseas Car Business Executive President for Europe since 2019. He assumed the role of Managing Director of CATL Debrecen on 17 March, 2025. He was also a speaker at the 5th edition of the Hungarian Battery Days this November.

Question: How do you see the next decade of the European EV battery market, and how will CATL contribute to it?

Matt Shen: Increased investments and lower raw material costs are set to drive strong growth in EV battery manufacturing by the end of the decade. Ambitious goals to expand production, improve technology, and reduce costs will unlock major opportunities for the market in Europe. We expect most vehicles sold in Europe soon – across cars, vans, trucks, and buses – to be electric. Declining battery costs mean electric cars will soon match the total ownership cost of traditional vehicles, something that seemed unlikely just a decade ago.

After a slower growth in 2024, EV sales are picking up steadily. The global sales of EV batteries enjoyed substantial growth year on year in the second quarter of 2025, increasing by 33 per cent compared to the same time in 2024. This means that almost 19 per cent of sold cars in the second quarter of this year were electric. Europe has played a significant role in the growth, with the top five European markets growing by 25 per cent year on year in the first half of 2025.

This fierce competition among battery makers in Europe pushes everyone to deliver the best products for OEMs – those who fall behind risk being left out. CATL is ready for this challenge. We’re developing new battery models tailored to European customers, backed by the world’s leading battery tech and largest R&D team. We’re confident we’ll play a key role in Europe’s electric transition. Our commitment to innovation keeps our production flexible and adaptable, enabling us to quickly respond to market changes, new technologies, and customer demand

Q: Does the company plan to further expand in Europe? If so, along what strategy?

MS: Emission regulations are becoming increasingly strict in the EU, with the goal of a complete transition to electric vehicles. The 2035 deadline for banning the sale of internal combustion vehicles is approaching, leaving less than 10 years to complete the transition. CATL has clients everywhere in Europe, and we are proud of collaborating with over 200 OEMs worldwide, including all the long-standing European partners, who built the world’s first cars and started the development of the automotive industry.

We aim to become the most reliable partner of Europe in its energy transition journey. For us, it is a strategic goal to become a European manufacturer with a localised workforce and supply chain. Our factory in Germany is already operating. Within a few months, we plan to start cell production in Hungary, and we are working on establishing a new production base in Spain, which is a joint venture with Stellantis.

Q: How do you see the future of Chinese-Hungarian cooperation in the electric vehicle industry, especially in light of the EU regulations that are now more strictly reviewing Chinese investments in this sector?

MS: I can only speak on CATL’s behalf. The development of EU competition regulations and changes in international customs tariffs pose significant risks for all international manufacturing companies, regardless of the sector. CATL’s European strategy is to help Europe build an EV and clean energy ecosystem that is “in Europe, for Europe and of Europe,” and in the process, it is a priority for us to follow EU standards in the field of production, and ensure the compliance of new technology and product developments in the EU. It is necessary to see and understand that we are part of a huge global transformation. Allow me to make this easier to understand with a personal comment.

When I bought my first electric car in China, its range barely reached 150 kilometres, while now batteries that can store enough electrical energy allow cars to travel more than 700 kilometres or even 1,000 km, for example Zeekr 001 which is powered by CATL’s Qilin battery at an affordable price, thus breaking down all obstacles and contributing to the spread of electric cars. The future has essentially begun, and CATL is bringing it to Hungary and Europe. We will only help the transition to electric transportation by creating new, valuable jobs and supplier opportunities by installing the most modern manufacturing technology in Debrecen.

Q: What is your personal vision for the Debrecen factory, and what role does it play in CATL’s overall business strategy?

MS: Our goal is to provide high-quality solutions and services to customers around the world, and the new plant we’re building in Debrecen is a key step in that direction. It will help us better meet the growing battery demand across Europe, strengthen our global production network, and support the broader shift toward e-mobility and clean energy in Europe.

In terms of capacity, the Debrecen facility will actually be larger than our plant in Germany, which means we’ll be able to supply even more batteries to our partners. But it’s important to note that the two factories won’t be producing the same products. We plan to tailor production at each site based on customer needs. That means we’ll be working closely with our clients to log and schedule their orders accordingly. Ultimately, both plants are crucial for us to effectively serve the European market.

Q: CATL continuously develops its battery technology and regularly announces innovations. Recently, there have also been reports regarding the Hungarian factory, suggesting a review of the second plant’s technology. What kind of batteries will the facility produce? Will it be capable of switching to newer technologies? Do you plan to develop products specifically for the European/CEE/SEE markets?

MS: One of CATL’s core values is continuous innovation, so production lines are designed to be flexible and easily adaptable to technological innovations or new products. Our latest technologies, incorporating advanced automation and cutting-edge data utilisation, will be implemented across the plant. Artificial intelligence will play a pivotal role in enhancing these processes at our Debrecen facility, working in tandem with 5G connectivity, advanced automation, and robust data management systems.

At the IAA Mobility 2025, we introduced two Shenxing Pro LFP battery products designed specifically for Europe. These products provide groundbreaking solutions to the challenges of range, charging speed, and safety, while also being tailored to the diverse driving needs across the continent. With this approach, CATL demonstrates not only its ability to produce the most advanced battery technologies but also its commitment to developing products that meet the specific requirements of the European markets.

Q: How do you envision CATL building the European supply chain for the Debrecen facility, including Hungarian suppliers? What are your thoughts on the Debrecen region’s potential as a key European expansion hub for CATL?

MS: As I mentioned earlier, many of our automotive partners are based in Europe, and we’ve been working closely with them to deliver top-quality products to consumers. One of the key ways we’re doing that is by establishing a local battery supply here in Europe, which helps us respond faster and more efficiently to our customers’ needs. Currently, we have built a robust local ecosystem anchored by over 1,000 suppliers across the continent.

We strongly believe that shorter supply chains are not only more resilient but also more sustainable. That’s why localising our supplier base is such an important part of our strategy. Hungary, and especially the Debrecen region, really stands out in this regard. It has a rapidly developing industrial ecosystem and a great location within Europe. We see a lot of potential in partnering with local companies to build a strong, future-proof supply chain that supports our long-term growth across the continent.

Q: What conditions are necessary for Hungary to develop a meaningful battery industry R&D sector?

MS: In order to develop a meaningful battery industry R&D sector, it is essential to establish active dialogue and cooperation between government actors, companies, universities and other research organisations. It is vital that both business and scientific approaches are given due consideration, with the aim of facilitating localised R&D that will have a significant and positive impact on the Hungarian battery sector.

Already, CATL can demonstrate some good examples: last year, we signed partnerships with the University of Debrecen, the University of Miskolc, and the Vocational Training Centre of Debrecen. I know that other companies have also begun similar partnerships.

Q: Recruiting local talent can sometimes be challenging. In response, CATL Debrecen entered into partnerships with the Vocational Training Centre and University of Debrecen and the University of Miskolc. Could you tell us more about the details of these partnerships and how they are progressing today?

MS: Our purpose is to support the education system with unique and high-level technology in order to share this knowledge with young talents starting from their very first years at school. We have concrete plans on how to implement our strategy. We started career lectures, where students can get to know more about the company and career opportunities. During special lectures, we focus on knowledge sharing about battery manufacturing technology, while during factory visits, students can experience the working culture at CATL in Debrecen and have a deeper insight into battery production.

We also plan to create our own university and vocational school courses, which will last for one or two semesters and will be assisted by our experts. Our internship program is very successful, and a special scholarship program is on the way. Overall, we aim at creating valuable and unique programs for the future talents and hope that some of them will join our company and contribute to our success in Debrecen.

Q: Hungary has been coping with a growing labour shortage problem for a decade. How do you plan to meet the labour needs of the factory in Debrecen?

MS: As I mentioned, it is part of our strategic goal to develop future talent and support workforce development. We have signed partnerships with the Universities of Debrecen and Miskolc. We also began strategic cooperation with the Debrecen Vocational Training Centre last year to support the training of recruits. We also welcome university interns at CATL Debrecen, and we are planning to open a training centre modelled on our German facility.

CATL aims to be a long-term, responsible partner in Debrecen by investing in education, social responsibility, environmental sustainability, and local community life. Our vision is to grow together with the region by nurturing talent, protecting the environment, and being a good neighbour to local communities.

Q: Many people are concerned about the environmental footprint of battery production. Could you tell us more about how you plan to make production sustainable and environmentally friendly? What specific environmental solutions will the factory employ?

MS: I completely understand that people have concerns – it’s only natural, especially when you’re talking about a relatively new and rapidly growing industry like battery manufacturing. Questions about safety and environmental impact are valid and important. What I want to emphasise is that CATL is fully committed to meeting all environmental regulations.

At our Debrecen plant, we’ll be using a closed production system and implementing a strict monitoring process to ensure compliance with every environmental standard outlined in our permits. Our goal is to provide clear, honest information and build trust through responsible operations. We’ve recently applied for a revised environmental permit that reflects our commitment to sustainability in Debrecen.

One major upgrade is the use of adiabatic cooling towers, which are much more efficient and cut water usage for cooling by nearly a third. We’re also changing how we handle NMP. Instead of building our own regeneration facility, we’ll work with certified partners to manage it safely and sustainably, in line with environmental standards. On top of that, we plan to diversify production at the site – not just NCM batteries, but also LFP cells, which are known for their lower environmental impact.

With better design and tech upgrades, we expect to cut the plant’s energy use to about a third of what was originally planned. I believe that these measures demonstrate CATL’s strong commitment to lowering emissions, conserving resources, and embedding sustainability into every stage of production at the Debrecen plant.

Q: What are your three most important personal goals that you would like to achieve in five years in Debrecen as the General Manager of CATL Europe?

MS: In five years’ time, I would like to be able to tell journalists interviewing me that CATL’s largest and most efficient European production facility is in Debrecen, where it continues to operate to the great satisfaction of the city’s residents, providing valuable jobs and career opportunities for many local workers.

In addition, my goal is that batteries produced in Debrecen represent the latest technology of CATL, and the people living in Debrecen can be proud of our company. I would also very much like to achieve that people in Debrecen believe and accept CATL as a responsible international company that does a lot for sustainability goals and engages in valuable social activities.",https://ceenergynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Matt-Feng-Shen-eredeti.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 06:00:20.203754

Known as the “Public Lands Rule,” the regulations implement the “multiple use and sustained yield” framework adopted by Congress in the Federal Land Policy & Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). The 2024 regulations clarify BLM’s mission to focus on stewardship of public resources by managing for long-term ecological health and resilience, which will protect the interests of the American public in a sustained yield of renewable and non-renewable resources. The intent of the Rule is to ensure that BLM treats conservation of public resources on par with other multiple uses.

The Rule is well-grounded in FLPMA, which directs BLM to manage the public lands for the long-term interests of the American public without allowing for permanent impairment of the land and the quality of the environment. The Rule does not direct BLM to allow or disallow any specific uses at any particular place, but rather it sets forth a framework for how landscape health will be measured and tracked over time, and how natural resources will be protected when BLM considers potential uses of public lands.

With the change in Administration, BLM recently proposed to rescind the Public Lands Rule, asserting that it was conflict with BLM’s statutory authorities in FLPMA. The public notice did not provide much detail on the alleged statutory conflict, but BLM stated its intent to rescind the Rule in whole.

GWC recently submitted comments on the proposed rollback of the Public Lands Rule and worked with law professors across the west to ensure that BLM correctly interprets and applies the multiple use and sustained yield of FLPMA. When Congress passed this bedrock law in 1976, it clearly delegated to the Secretary of the Interior the discretion to decide which uses will be allowed to strike the correct balance between extraction and protection of natural resources.

The book, with a foreword by conservationist Tom Earnhardt, a North Carolina Coastal Federation board member, is the first in the “North Carolina Land of Water” book series and focuses on the Cape Lookout National Seashore.

The nearly 300 photographs, maps and illustrations of shifting dunes, barrier islands and coastal wildlife are interwoven with carefully crafted maps and drawings, “tracing our coast from its ancient past through the centuries to our modern present,” according to NCLOW, the nonprofit founded by Riggs and fellow coastal geologist Dr. Dorothea V. Ames.

NCLOW’s stated mission “is to sustain NC’s dynamic water, land and air systems for generations to come.”

Land-Water-Air Interface: Nature’s Coastal Systems

I like to think that actively evolving coastal systems are like the human body with its totally interdependent array of subsystems: skeletal, muscular, circulatory, pulmonary, nervous, and endocrine systems driven by the incredible brain, heart, and lungs. It is difficult to live a healthy life without all these bodily components working intimately together. Likewise, our coastal system is dominated by an interdependent array of complex subsystems: landscapes, waterscapes, and airscapes all interacting at the land-water-air interface. The geographic conditions, geologic dynamics, meteorologic forces, and chemical-biological characteristics are critical variables that interact to produce a living, breathing, and evolving coastal system. Major coastal system drivers are the Earth’s physical landscape dynamics (uplifting of mountains and opening of ocean basins), its space partners (creating climatic zones and setting the waterscape and airscape into motion), and the life-giving energy from the almighty Sun (driving the hydrologic cycle and atmospheric circulation that dictates the resulting biosphere).

Throughout the world, wherever a water body (ocean, sea, lake, or river) meets the surrounding land, a coastal system occurs. Because all water bodies and land masses are uniquely different, no two coastal systems are alike. Rather, they each display the influence of multiple variables producing continuums of coastal system types. The landscape may be mountainous or low flatlands dominated by hard rock, sand and mud sediment, or rich and black organic matter; located in the polar, temperate, or tropical regions; or it may occur in a stable tectonic zone, an active earthquake zone, or an area dominated by volcanic activity. Likewise, the size, location, and physical-chemical-biological characteristics of the water body are also determining characteristics. A critical third component also occurs at every land-water intersection; this is the overlying atmosphere and its climatic characteristics that help determine the ultimate character and are the drivers of change for each coastal system.

Like the human body, coastal systems tend to be extremely dynamic, changing in response to energy input at several different time scales. Volcanic activity (Hawaiian Island coasts) and earthquakes (US Pacific coasts), the dominant sources of energy, occur over decades, centuries, and millennia. However, the energy input from atmospheric storm dynamics affects all coastal systems and is the dominant energy source along the US Atlantic and Gulf coasts, occurring at irregular but frequent short-term time scales. An extremely active atmosphere with rapidly changing climatic conditions is the overwhelming cumulative force that routinely produces short-term changes and long-term evolution associated with most southeastern US coastal systems. The ultimate driver of these climate systems and associated storms is our space partner, the Sun.

Natural Function of Barrier Islands: Limits to Growth, Development

Barrier islands and their associated water bodies have a set of dynamics that are established by the natural functions of Earth’s systems. The word “function” relative to the interactions between the land-water-air interface means assigned actions, activities, duties, or role. The function of interstate highways is to get vehicles from point A to point B very fast. Yes, I can ride my bike or have a picnic on an interstate, but it is guaranteed suicide for me to do so. I might instead ride a bike on a dead-end backcountry road or on a former railroad bed that has been disconnected from the grid, as these now have totally different functions. Rest areas with picnic tables and dog parks are already major components of most interstate highways and they might have separately constructed bike lanes in the future, but not today.

Absolute limits exist as to the number, size, and speed of vehicles that can use a one-lane dirt road. Absolute but different limits occur when it becomes a paved two-lane road. Soon the two-lane road becomes overwhelmed, and it is expanded to a four-lane highway, and with continued growth and development in expanding urban areas, it will evolve into six- and eight-lane segments. At some point in the situation of unlimited growth and development the function of each system will break down. Then society is generally forced to come up with new rules or zoning conditions essential for developing an upgraded or new roadway system that requires new land and higher-grade building materials for new types of vehicles that need higher speed limits, and so on.

Similar rules, or zoning, what I call geo-zoning or eco-zoning, must now be considered for natural landscapes, waterscapes, and airscapes confronted with the pressures of unlimited growth and development. The problem is that society generally sets economic rules concerning natural dynamics that maximize profits and minimize the cost of living. For example, many laws require state and federal contracts to go to the lowest bidder or require projects to have a certain cost-benefit ratio.

Often this requires that new roadways go straight through natural areas or over waterways. These laws also often eliminate or divide impoverished and minority urban areas, as well as promote minimum water drainage structures and shorter project life expectancies. Rarely do they take into consideration the cumulative impact or unintended consequences on complex, interdependent systems. In addition, a general lack of understanding of the scientific dynamics of many Earth systems leads directly to minimizing the use of scientific data relative to the economic impact of a project. Good societal and natural reasons exist for limits and constraints on our riding bikes on interstate highways; the same is true for living in active riverine floodplains, discharging waste into waterways, or building houses on ocean shorelines.

Barrier islands and their beaches are only mobile piles of sand at the intersection of land, water, and air. Yes, this is real estate that can be subdivided into house lots and developed from shore to shore. However, shoreline lots are not equal to those in the middle of an island since they are direct products of regular storm dynamics on the adjacent water body. A waterfront house for living is like camping on the interstate. The only good news is that your eventual demise will be a bit slower on the beach. With unlimited growth and development, all possible island lots are plotted, sold, and built on. This increased growth soon pressures us to replace our ferry boats with two-lane bridges that quickly become overloaded. Then new four-lane bridges are justified on the premise of the need to get more people safely off the islands during storms. Family beach cottages are rapidly replaced by big businesses that rise vertically as rental McMansions, condominiums, hotels, and full urbanization sets in.

Because sea level is rising and storms continue to impact the barrier islands with more people and larger shoreline structures attempting to prevent the shorelines from moving, beach sand begins to disappear. Pumping new sand onto the islands becomes essential, but it is soon gone even as the islands continue to be developed. The natural coastal system is now destabilized, requiring construction of groins, jetties, and bulkheads to desperately hold a beach and stop shoreline recession. Ultimately, the islands will be encased in steel, concrete, and rock walls with little to no sandy beach along an increasingly steeper shoreface.

When economic development wins the battle, with permanently fixed commercial islands in the ocean covered with urban accoutrements ranging from shopping malls to freshwater parks, the islands will have new economic functions. What happened to the barrier island with its unique natural functions and ecosystems associated with high energy sand beaches, dune fields, tide flats, and marshes that harbored the ghost crabs, sea turtles, and shorebirds? Natural barrier island limits have been violated by unlimited growth and development, and once again the stage is set for the perfect conflict between humans and their natural environment.

Similar to barrier islands, other geographic basins on Earth’s surface and in wet climatic zones (swamps, ponds, lakes, or ocean) have a function of holding water. If the geographic basin is linear and open-ended, its function might be to carry a moving flow of water, generally known as a river. Each type of water system has its own specific functions, each dictating different limits to contiguous growth and development.

Absolute limits to growth and types of development exist for high energy and mobile barrier island sand piles, riverine floodplains, swamp-forest pocosins, and estuarine marshes. Similarly, limits pertain to other landscapes, including the savage clear-cuts of the northwest US rain forests, excavations of Appalachian Mountain tops for coal, the vast deforestation of the Amazon jungle—these are all tracts of insatiable consumption driven by the indigenous American spirit monster of self-destruction. “Unlimited” human consumption has consequences; infinite growth on a finite planet is generally not compatible with natural law. We must embrace the radical notion that all of Earth’s natural resources and crucial ecosystem services are essential if we are to maintain a sustainable and high quality of life in society’s future.

Fortunately, some barrier islands, estuarine water bodies, riverine floodplains, and pocosin swamp forests have been protected from the perils of total modification and urbanization by establishing different forms of protected status such as national seashores, wildlife refuges, coastal preserves, state parks, and conservancy lands. The preservation of Cape Lookout National Seashore, or CALO in 1976 clearly demonstrates the critical interdependence between storm dynamics and the barrier island buffer zone. For these intermediary habitats to continue functioning as nature’s speed bumps, storms must unleash tremendous energy across the coastal wetlands—flooding marshes, reshaping shorelines, and maintaining the shifting sands of healthy barrier islands that buffer the uplands from the sea.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that the $1.6 billion loan will ""ensure lower electricity costs across the Midwestern region of the United States,"" per TechCrunch.

This power project stands out for its continued momentum, despite so many other energy projects being canceled under the Trump administration.

People living in states that will benefit from the project already have some of the lowest energy prices in the country. Meanwhile, other states' projects were abruptly eliminated, hindering their residents' access to affordable energy rates and perpetuating excess pollution in local communities.

Government support for clean energy solutions is critical to helping people live more sustainably while reducing environmental harm. Regulatory changes that support sustainable energy practices can have a profound impact on how much residents pay for electricity and on the amount of pollution released.

However, every time you reject dirty energy in favor of more sustainable power, you make an impact on your community.

For example, installing solar panels will help reduce your monthly energy costs and lower planet-overheating pollution where you live. To make solar installations more affordable, TCD has put together a Solar Explorer to get trusted quotes from vetted partners in your area, such as EnergySage and Palmetto, enabling you to save thousands of dollars.

When you power your home with clean energy from the sun, it's also more affordable to use other money-saving, planet-saving appliances, like heat pumps. When you're ready to find a heat pump that works with your budget, Mitsubishi can help.

In a Department of Energy statement, Wright said: ""This loan guarantee will not only help modernize the grid and expand transmission capacity but will help position the United States to win the AI [artificial intelligence] race and grow our manufacturing base.""

Here are some key insights and examples:

District Energy Systems

District energy systems, which provide centralized heating or cooling to multiple buildings, have sparked mixed opinions:

Efficiency and Practicality: Some Redditors believe that while district energy systems can be more efficient in dense urban areas, they might not be practical for less dense regions. ""In areas like Universities and cities with buildings close together and a higher density it could be worthwhile to look into since it is more energy efficient and saves cost over the long run.""

Control and Maintenance: Concerns about individual control over home temperatures and the reliability of centralized systems are common. ""If it means each household can’t control the temperature of their home at any given time, most Americans will likely not be supportive of that.""

Solar and Renewable Energy

Door-to-Door Sales: Many Redditors warn about the aggressive and potentially misleading tactics of solar sales representatives. ""You promise to purchase power for the approximate cost of what the solar panels cost, except they own the solar panels and you're at their mercy if something breaks down.""

Scams: There are numerous reports of solar energy scams, where sales representatives misrepresent the benefits and costs of their programs. ""100% a solar scam""

Energy Efficiency Programs

State and local energy efficiency programs are also under scrutiny:

Skepticism: Some Redditors are skeptical about the authenticity and effectiveness of these programs. ""Yes it's a scam. There's no state program to 'weatherize homes'.""

High Energy Usage Flags: The idea of being flagged for high energy usage by a state program is often seen as a precursor to a sales pitch. ""The whole 'flagged for high energy usage' thing is complete bullshit.""

Innovative Storage Solutions

Energy storage solutions, such as sand batteries, are highlighted as promising technologies:

Sand Batteries: Finland’s deployment of the world’s largest sand battery is noted for its potential to store thermal energy efficiently. ""The massive 15-meter-wide system in Pornainen can store enough thermal energy to meet the town’s heating needs for an entire month during summer.""

Collaboration and Development

Collaboration between companies to bring innovative energy solutions to market is also a topic of interest:

Ascent Solar Technologies and NovaSpark Energy: Their agreement to combine lightweight solar technology with mobile hydrogen generation systems for drone powering and other applications is seen as a significant step. ""The agreement brings the two companies’ technologies together to achieve mutually beneficial goals.""

Community Efforts

Community-led initiatives to improve urban environments and energy efficiency are also celebrated:

Urban Compassion Project: This project’s efforts to clean up illegal dumping sites and provide support to unhoused individuals are seen as a positive example of community action. ""Since 2021, Urban Compassion Project has cleared over 3,000 tons of illegal dumping across the Bay Area, with most of our work centered in Oakland.""

T1 Energy positions itself as a key player for investors who see U.S. policy support and the clean energy demand surge as primary growth engines. The recent US$50 million equity raise addresses near-term funding commitments but highlights ongoing liquidity pressures, the largest current risk, while not yet altering the critical short-term catalyst: the successful launch of the new Texas solar facility.

Among recent developments, T1 Energy’s proposed bylaw changes to limit foreign ownership and create headroom for more shares stand out. These amendments could provide greater flexibility to secure additional financing if needed, directly linking to the ongoing challenges of scaling up major projects and maintaining liquidity as policy incentives and capital needs evolve.

In contrast, investors should also be aware that liquidity strains could affect...

The act drastically pares back the energy transition tax credits for wind and solar, made available under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended, Code) and further extended or created under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), while largely preserving those for clean energies and energy storage in the near future. Complex fiscal incentive rules are further complicated by far-reaching restrictions on foreign ownership and assistance (the so-called FEOC, or “foreign entity of concern”, requirements) that will reshape supply chains and financing across both renewable and clean energies. On the other hand, the OBBB presents clear wins for fossil fuels under a more permissive leasing and fiscal regime.

Incentives Rolled Back for Wind and Solar

The OBBB phases out the long-standing tax credits for wind and solar which were reinforced under the IRA regime, namely the clean electricity production credit under Section 45Y of the Code (Production Tax Credits) or the clean electricity investment credit under Section 48E of the Code (Investment Tax Credits). Under the OBBB, wind and solar projects may only retain eligibility for the Production and Investment Tax Credits if they begin construction before 5 July 2026 or are placed in service by 31 Dec. 2027. Developers are expected to rely primarily on the latter pathway, in which case they would have until the end of 2030 to place their projects in service to maximise their tax credits.

On 15 Aug. 2025, the US Department of Treasury further issued Notice 2025-42 (Notice) to tighten the criteria to determine when a wind or solar project is deemed to have begun construction for the purposes of the first pathway. In essence, developers of wind and solar projects with a maximum net output of more than 1.5 megawatts must demonstrate performance of physical work of a significant nature. Based on market experience, this requirement may be satisfied by performing off-site manufacturing work or ordering site-specific equipment such as main power transformers. In addition, once construction has begun, it must be continuous. This continuity test requires developers to place a project in service within four years after the end of the year in which construction starts or, failing that, demonstrate that construction has been continuous from the start.

The clearcut deadlines and short-term policy guidance are likely to accelerate pipeline wind and solar projects to lock in tax credits. The International Energy Agency estimates that U.S. renewable capacity additions will peak in 2027 before tapering in 2028 and levelling through 20301. At the peak of activity, however, developers may be asked to satisfy more stringent requirements of significant upfront physical work and continuity to lenders and insurance providers to demonstrate the project’s eligibility for tax credits (and thus its economic viability). Projects that begin construction after 2025 will also have to contend with FEOC constraints on supply chains, as explained below, adding significant procurement costs.

Extended Runway for Geothermal, Hydrogen, Nuclear and Energy Storage

The OBBB largely preserves the tax incentives for geothermal, hydrogen and nuclear in the near future. Full Investment and Production Tax Credits remain available for geothermal and nuclear projects that begin construction before the end of 2033, while hydrogen Production Tax Credits would still apply to projects that begin construction before the end of 2027. This extended runway is especially valuable for nascent technologies, such as small nuclear reactors, to develop and prove out before the incentives are withdrawn. Energy storage technologies, i.e. properties that receive, store and deliver energy for conversion to electricity such as battery storage, thermal batteries and hydrogen fuel cells will also retain Investment Tax Credits on a similar deferred phase-down schedule.

That said, clean energy and energy storage must still meet FEOC sourcing requirements. As explained below, this will strain supply chains for critical minerals and components, traditionally dominated by Chinese suppliers. Early BloombergNEF analysis indicates energy storage additions could fall about 7 percent versus prior expectations as FEOC limits narrow supply options2.

FEOC Requirements: Ownership/Control and Material Assistance

The OBBB conditions tax credits eligibility on compliance with more stringent foreign ownership/ control and material assistance rules. The latter stipulates that projects for which specified foreign or foreign influenced entities provide “material assistance” will not be eligible for the Production or Investment Tax Credits. “Material assistance” is determined based on the proportion of direct project or component costs attributable to the relevant entity. For example, starting in 2026, energy storage projects seeking to receive investment tax credits must ensure 55 percent or more of the total material costs are not sourced from specified foreign or foreign influenced entities. This threshold gradually increases for projects that begin construction in subsequent years, reaching 75 percent by 2030.

The designation of specified foreign and foreign-influenced entities include companies owned or controlled by the governments of China, Iran, North Korea or Russia, or by citizens of those countries or otherwise organised or having a principal place of business in one of those countries. For wind, solar and energy storage – sectors where Chinese inputs dominate key components – the “material assistance” restrictions threaten to further tighten already strained supply chains and elevate capex.

Clear Wins for Fossil Fuels

The OBBB is unequivocally supportive of oil and gas, primarily through mandating new lease sales across federal lands and waters. Under the IRA, offshore oil and gas lease sales are linked to those of offshore wind and, as a result, the administration only scheduled three offshore oil and gas lease sales for the 2024-2029 period. By contrast, under the OBBB, the federal government plans to add 30 oil and gas lease sales across the Gulf region over 15 years. In addition, the OBBB restores royalty rates to pre‑IRA levels, reinstates full deductions for intangible drilling costs and delays the methane emissions fee until 2035. As key fossil fuel incentives are reinforced while those of renewable and clean energy are over time withdrawn, it is predicted that U.S. capital and service capacity will soon pivot into upstream and midstream opportunities.

Where Next for UK and EU Energy Companies Operating in the U.S.?

The combination of tax credit rollbacks and surging material costs due to FEOC “material assistance” requirements may result in companies redirecting capital away from U.S. wind and solar. According to BloombergNEF, U.S. investment in solar and wind in 2025 amounted to $35 billion, down 36 percent from the second half of 2024 – in contrast to a 63 percent increase in the EU3. The Financial Times further reported that Germany’s RWE has halted U.S. projects, including three offshore leases, due to political developments, while TotalEnergies and Shell have also dropped planned U.S. wind investments since President Trump’s re‑election4. At the same time, Shell was reportedly planning to bid for new oil leases sale in December, the first under the new annual lease sale schedule set by Trump5. Despite the drastic shift in the U.S. energy policy, energy majors are swiftly following the lead of the administration’s agenda.

In theory, $80 billion can buy enough reactors to power all of Virginia’s Data Center Alley.
It’s possible the nuclear industry can meet Trump’s goal of starting construction on 10 big nuclear reactors by 2030.
“Nothing in nuclear happens overnight,” said Jeffrey Merrifield, a former commissioner with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
None of them have regulatory approval to build a commercial system, nor have they proven they can produce power at a commercial scale.","After a generation of stagnation, interest in US nuclear energy is sky high, thanks to artificial intelligence’s voracious energy needs. Nuclear companies are stock market darlings, and the Trump administration recently unveiled an $80 billion-plus commitment to help fund new reactors.

There’s just one problem: Hardly anything will be ready to to plug in for a decade.

In theory, $80 billion can buy enough reactors to power all of Virginia’s Data Center Alley. In reality, traditional reactors take 10 years or more to build, while a highly anticipated wave of small, modular reactors has yet to produce commercial power. That means the only plants that will go into service anytime soon are a handful of shuttered facilities that can be restarted.

“There’s a lot going on, and nothing is going on,” said BloombergNEF’s head nuclear analyst Chris Gadomski.

That dissonance underscores how radically, and rapidly, the US energy system has transformed in recent years. Not long ago, utilities were shutting down costly nuclear plants and replacing them with cheaper natural gas-fired and renewable plants. The AI boom has since supercharged electricity consumption, straining power supplies and driving up prices. But while nuclear is suddenly in demand again, logistics and technology constraints threaten to thwart development even with President Donald Trump’s moves to streamline permitting and commit billions of dollars in funding.

It’s possible the nuclear industry can meet Trump’s goal of starting construction on 10 big nuclear reactors by 2030. But there won’t be a lot of wiggle room, said Wyatt Hartley, head of North American asset management for Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. The company is emerging as a key player in the industry, in part because it’s the majority owner of Westinghouse Electric Co., which is expected to be a key beneficiary of the $80 billion reactor deal announced last month.

“Nothing in nuclear happens overnight,” said Jeffrey Merrifield, a former commissioner with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Besides permitting, developers must line up buyers for the power and hire thousands of skilled workers. And some of the most critical components of a plant, such as reactor vessels and steam generators, can take as long as four years to manufacture and deliver.

Hartley expects some of those orders to be placed “in the very near term” but, realistically, it will take 10 years to get just two plants up and running.

Until then, some reactor developers are relying on natural gas. Fermi Inc., an energy real estate investment trust co-founded by former Energy Secretary Rick Perry that is developing a massive data center in Texas, placed orders for reactor components last month, but doesn’t expect them to go into service until the early 2030s. Start-ups Blue Energy Global Inc. and First American Nuclear Co. also expect their reactors to be completed next decade. All three companies are installing gas systems to supply data center customers as soon as possible.

And there’s another wrinkle that could slow deployment of big reactors: The Trump administration hasn’t yet laid out how the $80 billion will be allocated. It’s also not clear who would be responsible for covering the costs for a project that goes significantly over budget. Cost overruns resulted in the 2017 abandonment of the two-reactor VC Summer project in South Carolina.

“What matters at the end of the day is who takes on the cost overrun risk,” said Jigar Shah, who headed the US Energy Department’s loan programs office under President Joe Biden.

Hyped Up

The buzz around nuclear is so cacophonous that simply announcing plans to develop reactors is enough to drive up company valuations. Fermi, which has yet to build any electricity generation and only listed on the New York Stock Exchange in September, is now valued at about $13 billion, more than Campbell’s Co. or Moderna Inc. Meanwhile, firms developing small, modular reactors have seen share prices skyrocketing in the past year.

Despite the hype around small reactors, which are designed to be produced in factories and assembled on site, actual progress is painstakingly slow. Shah and others think small reactors could come online sooner than big ones because they’re potentially cheaper and faster to produce, but only three companies have started construction: Oklo Inc., TerraPower LLC and Kairos Power LLC. None of them have regulatory approval to build a commercial system, nor have they proven they can produce power at a commercial scale.

Kairos may be the closest to delivering on its plans for commercial plant. It’s building a demonstration reactor to validate the technology but won’t generate electricity, and has permission to build a slightly larger version that will produce 50 megawatts. Once the company gets all regulatory approvals, it has a deal to sell that energy to the Tennessee Valley Authority for Google data centers, potentially as soon as 2030.

BloombergNEF’s Gadomski remains skeptical of the modular projects: “They’re just pushing bulldozers around.”

‘A Lot of Talk’

That means the fastest-moving part of the industry is restart projects.

More than a dozen reactors were shut down from 2012 to 2022, mostly for economic reasons, and three of them are now being revived. Holtec International expects the Palisades plant in Michigan to resume service early next year, and Constellation Energy Corp. is on track to switch on a reactor in 2027 at Three Mile Island, in Pennsylvania. NextEra Energy Inc. announced last month that it would bring the Duane Arnold plant in Iowa back online by 2029. Brookfield, meanwhile, is in talks to take over the abandoned VC Summer project, which could go into service in the early 2030s, Hartley said, though the deal is not yet finalized.

But the list of potential restart candidates is very short, and the three planned revivals would produce just 2.2 gigawatts of electricity at most, a fraction of the power Trump wants to generate from reactors.

“It’s a lot of talk,” said Scott Levine, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “Will we see anything soon? No.”

When conditions feel unpredictable, confidence drops, spending slows, and the economy loses momentum, regardless of what the hard data say.","Shoppers wandering store aisles this November still seem to feel the pinch as many North Carolinians plan to rein in spending this holiday season. We are posting the latest Carolina Journal poll in just a few hours, but here is a sneak peek: two-thirds (67%) of North Carolinians say they expect to spend less during the holidays, reflecting lingering anxiety after years of high inflation and economic uncertainty.

We also found that a majority of voters (58%) say they are not confident in the US economy, with 38% saying they are not confident at all (38%). Despite that low confidence level, most rate their own financial situation as either good (37%) or fair (34%).

So what is weighing on consumers? We can’t discount consumers’ economic scars of the last four years. With memories of double-digit inflation still fresh, even modest cost fluctuations feel threatening. Add recent warnings about tariffs triggering high holiday prices, and consumers are more likely to keep a much closer watch on their wallets.

In many ways, confidence often lags recovery. Beneath the caution, there are good reasons to believe that this holiday could mark a turning point in consumer confidence.

Let’s look at the actual data.

The national picture shows reason for cautious optimism. According to CBS News’ Price Tracker and the latest CPI data, inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target at 3.0% in September 2025. While that’s still elevated, it came in below forecasts, and the monthly pace of inflation has slowed. For the year ahead, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates at least twice, possibly three times.

Food and everyday goods, which hit North Carolina households the hardest, are showing signs of stabilization. Energy costs, which often set the pace for consumer prices, are finally easing. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the energy index rose only 2.8% over the 12 months ending in September 2025, a sharp slowdown from the spikes seen in previous years. Gasoline prices actually fell by 0.5% during that period. Because energy is a key driver in the cost of transporting goods and powering production, this decline is an early sign that price pressures on everyday items, from groceries to manufactured products, may continue to moderate in the months ahead.

In North Carolina, the state’s labor market remains strong, and companies continue to see opportunity in our state for sectors like advanced manufacturing and technology. The CJ Poll also found that younger adults (ages 18-34) were more likely than older cohorts to indicate they might spend more this season, a small but meaningful sign that some households feel their finances are stabilizing.

tariff passthrough pressures

Of course, caution is still warranted. Excluding food and energy, core inflation rose 0.2% over last month, a step down from the 0.3% increase in the two prior months, and according to analysis from TD Economics, tariff passthrough costs continued to materialize in core goods prices. Price gains were mostly in apparel, appliances, and hobby and sporting goods, with 75% of categories experiencing price gains last month, up from 67% in August.

The CJ Poll reveals how powerful predictability and psychology are in shaping consumers’ response to inflation amid what feels to be constantly changing economic policy. According to research from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, consumer confidence reflects not just the economy’s measurable strength but also people’s feelings about stability and direction. When conditions feel unpredictable, confidence drops, spending slows, and the economy loses momentum, regardless of what the hard data say.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shopping-venture-cart-4007474_1280.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 04:00:32.401181

Lithium-sulfur vs. lithium-ion

Any battery has three basic components: a positively charged region, called the cathode; a negatively charged region, called the anode; and a substance called the electrolyte in between, through which charged atoms, also known as ions, move between the cathode and anode.

In a lithium-ion battery, the cathode is made of a metal oxide, typically containing metals such as nickel, manganese and cobalt, bonded with oxygen. The materials are layered, with lithium ions physically between the layers. During charging, lithium ions detach from the layered cathode material and travel through the electrolyte to the anode.

The anode is usually graphite, which is also layered, with room for the lithium ions to fit between them. During discharge, the lithium ions leave the graphite layers, travel back through the electrolyte and reinsert into the layered cathode structure, recombining with the metal oxide to release electricity that powers cars and smartphones.

In a lithium-sulfur battery, the lithium ions still move back and forth, but the chemistry is different. Its cathode is made of sulfur embedded in a carbon matrix that conducts electricity, and the anode is made primarily of lithium itself, rather than graphite layers with lithium in between.

During discharging, the lithium ions travel from the anode, through the electrolyte to the cathode, where — rather than sliding in between the cathode layers — they chemically convert sulfur in sequential steps to a series of compounds called lithium sulfides. During charging, the lithium ions separate from the sulfide compounds, leave the cathode behind and travel back to the anode.

The charging and discharging process for lithium-sulfur batteries is a chemical conversion reaction that involves more electrons than the same process in lithium-ion batteries. That means a lithium-sulfur battery can theoretically store much more energy than a lithium-ion battery of the same size.

Sulfur is inexpensive and abundantly available worldwide, meaning battery manufacturers do not need to rely on scarce metals such as nickel and cobalt, which are unevenly distributed on Earth and often sourced from regions such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has limited worker safety regulations and fair labor practices.

Those advantages could deliver batteries with far more capacity and that are cheaper and more sustainable to produce.

Why aren’t lithium-sulfur batteries widely used yet?

The biggest obstacle to mass production and use of sulfur-based batteries is durability. A good lithium-ion battery, like those in an electric vehicle, can go through thousands of cycles of discharging and recharging before its capacity starts to fade. That amounts to thousands of car rides.

But lithium-sulfur batteries tend to lose capacity much more quickly, sometimes after fewer than 100 cycles. That’s not very many trips at all.

The reason lies in the chemistry. During the chemical reactions that store and release energy in a lithium-sulfur battery, some of the lithium sulfide compounds dissolve into the liquid electrolyte of the battery.

When that happens, those amounts of both sulfur and lithium are removed from being used in any remaining reactions. This effect, known as “shuttling,” means that with each round of discharging and recharging, there are fewer elements available to release and store energy.

In the past couple of decades, research has produced improved designs. Earlier versions of these batteries lost much of their capacity within a few dozen discharge–recharge cycles, and even the best laboratory prototypes struggled to survive beyond a few hundred.

New prototypes retain more than 80% of their initial capacity even after thousands of cycles. This improvement comes from redesigning the key parts of the battery and adjusting the chemicals involved: Special electrolytes help prevent the lithium sulfides from dissolving and shuttling.

The electrodes have also been improved, using materials such as porous carbon that can physically trap the intermediate lithium sulfides, stopping them from wandering away from the cathode. This helps the discharge and recharge reactions happen without so many losses, making the reactions more efficient so the battery lasts longer.

The road ahead

Lithium-sulfur batteries are no longer fragile laboratory curiosities, but there are significant challenges before they can become serious contenders for real-world energy storage.

In terms of safety, lithium-sulfur batteries have a less volatile cathode than lithium-ion batteries, but research is continuing into other aspects of safety.

Another problem is that the more energy a lithium-sulfur battery stores, the fewer cycles of charging it can handle. That’s because the chemical reactions involved are more intense with increased energy.

This trade-off may not be a major obstacle for using these batteries in drones or grid-level energy storage, where ultrahigh energy densities are less critical. But for electric vehicles, which demand both high energy capacity and long cycle life, scientists and battery researchers still need to sort out a workable balance. That means the foundation for the next generation of lithium-sulfur batteries is likely still a few years down the road.

That effort culminated in legislation heavily influenced by the utility that temporarily scaled back some fuel costs for customers, he said.
Riders for fuel costs and for high-voltage, long-distance electrical wires, by contrast, make up nearly half of the average household bill in southwest Virginia.
Fuel costs are closely tied to national markets for coal and gas, which make up over 80% of APCo’s power-generating capacity.
Passthrough of volatile fuel costs is a common problem for utility customers, Gilmore said.","Many households in rugged and rural southwest Virginia are already struggling to make ends meet. But they pay some of the highest electric rates in the nation, with prices that have risen at more than three times the pace of inflation over the last decade and a half.

Last week, residents of the Appalachian region voted to do something about it, joining Americans around the country in electing candidates who made affordability and spiking electricity bills central to their campaigns.

To wit: Voters in Montgomery and Roanoke counties elected Lily Franklin, a Democrat and former schoolteacher from Blacksburg, as their representative to the state House of Delegates. With 51% of the vote, she beat out a Republican incumbent in a district that voted for President Donald Trump three times in a row.

“It is a huge deal that we won this,” she told Canary Media.

The price of electricity wasn’t the only economic issue on voters’ minds as they cast their ballots across Virginia, giving Democrats the governor’s office, a larger majority in the House of Delegates, and a governing trifecta in Richmond. But Franklin said the topic came up again and again in her district, home to Virginia Tech as well as large swaths of mountain countryside.

“I talked to thousands of people across the district, and rising energy bills was a top concern,” she said. ​“I would hear it time after time — people were like, ​‘My bill is almost three times what it was last year, and I haven’t changed anything.’”

Franklin is determined to tackle the problem when she’s sworn in on Jan. 14. ​“I’m not fixing inflation as a state legislator,” she said, ​“but I can work on energy in Virginia and bring down people’s bills.”

Of course, that’s easier said than done. But Clean Virginia, a Charlottesville-based nonprofit with a research division and a campaign arm that endorsed Franklin and numerous other candidates, just issued a report that could serve as a guide. The study homes in on Appalachian Power Co., or APCo, the investor-owned utility that serves all but a few patches of southwest Virginia.

“The last General Assembly session on the energy front was really dominated by intensive focus on the cost crisis in APCo territory,” said Brennan Gilmore, executive director of Clean Virginia.

That effort culminated in legislation heavily influenced by the utility that temporarily scaled back some fuel costs for customers, he said. ​“But it was not a holistic look at what the actual drivers of the crisis were, [or] a holistic look at how to resolve those crises.”

So, Gilmore’s staff spent months digging into regulatory filings in both Virginia and West Virginia, where APCo is headquartered. What they found is that base rates aren’t the main problem. Instead, add-on fees known as riders are the real culprits — and they typically receive far less regulatory scrutiny.

Riders, especially to fund grid upgrades, are hardly confined to APCo territory, rising in multiple jurisdictions nationwide and even sparking a popular internet meme that cheekily sums up the charges: ​“Distribution fee. Processing fee. … Transmission fee. Fee fee. Fee fi fo fum fee. Might as well fee. … Another dollar won’t hurt fee.”

In deep-red Patrick County, south of Franklin’s district on the border of Virginia and North Carolina, the internet hive mind mostly blames the monopoly-utility model for these costs, with scores of commenters on a local Facebook page bemoaning bills that doubled and even tripled in the span of a month.

The Clean Virginia report authors tend to agree, saying the rising bills overall are propelled by a regulatory system that ​“incentivizes utility overspending, inflates utility profits, and puts disproportionate costs on residential customers.” But the study also drills down on specifics.

The researchers note that Virginia’s 2020 Clean Economy Act, which requires APCo to sell 100% renewable energy by midcentury, is causing some of these riders. But they’re relatively paltry: Solar and wind generation to comply with the law makes up less than 1% of households’ monthly bills today, the report found, and is expected to comprise just 3% of monthly costs next year.

Riders for fuel costs and for high-voltage, long-distance electrical wires, by contrast, make up nearly half of the average household bill in southwest Virginia. Fuel costs more than tripled between 2007 and 2024. Transmission fees rose fivefold from 2009, when regulators first allowed them as a separate line item.

Fuel costs are closely tied to national markets for coal and gas, which make up over 80% of APCo’s power-generating capacity. Coal prices more than doubled in 2021 alone, the report says. Likewise, natural-gas prices jumped 540% between 2020 and 2022. Since APCo customers pay 100% of fuel costs, they bear the full brunt of these increases, while shareholders bear none, Clean Virginia notes.

“If you’re using generation technology that requires a lot of fuel, customers are going to pay more than if you use a renewable source with no fuel,” Gilmore said. ​“Add the volatility and the spike in natural-gas prices because of global and other economic issues, then you see a direct correlation between increased bills and fossil-fuel prices.”

But fuel fees appear to be rising for other reasons, too, the study says. The charges include power purchases from other utilities, and last year, the report notes, the Virginia attorney general found that APCo was buying coal power at above-market rates from an affiliate company, Ohio Valley Electric Corp.

“Legislators should urge [regulators] to order refunds if APCo’s interaffiliate power purchases exceed market benchmarks,” the report suggests.

APCo may also be using more coal power than is cost-effective.

Across the country, plant operators have scaled back use of coal-fired units not just because the fuel itself is expensive, but because the aging plants cost a lot to operate and maintain. Last year, the average run time for U.S. coal plants was a little over 40%. But regulators in West Virginia — where APCo operates two coal plants — have ordered the utility to run the facilities at least 69% of the time, the report says, citing testimony from a recent rate case.

Passthrough of volatile fuel costs is a common problem for utility customers, Gilmore said. ​“But there are some specific APCo elements of this,” he said, ​“including uneconomic dispatch of their coal plants, and a sort of self-dealing with some of the APCo affiliate-owned coal plants.”

Perhaps the biggest challenge is the utility’s ballooning transmission fees. One problem, according to the study, is that the cost of building and maintaining these high-voltage electric lines in the area’s hilly terrain is spread among relatively few customers. The much larger Dominion Energy, for instance, charges less than half as much in transmission costs per household as does APCo.

Data centers could well be a factor, too. Though virtually none are in southwest Virginia, hubs in Ohio, northern Virginia, and elsewhere are crowding the grid run by the regional transmission organization PJM Interconnection. PJM allocates the resulting costs for upfitting lines across its member utilities, without factoring in where these large electric loads are located.

For its part, APCo said in an emailed statement that ​“investing in and maintaining [our] generation, transmission and distribution network is essential for minimizing and shortening outages, accommodating growing energy demands and integrating new energy sources.”

Like utilities nationwide, the statement continued, APCo faces high interest rates and inflation, driving up a number of the expenses associated with generating and delivering power, including ​“higher material and labor costs; … cost recovery for major storms; fuel-related costs not yet recovered through the fuel factor, and cost recovery for investments made in generating plants and distribution infrastructure.”

The company also touted its energy-efficiency programs and noted that a $10 decrease in fuel costs took effect Nov. 1.

The price cut grew out of the law Gilmore said inspired his group’s study, which notes, ​“given that methane gas prices are projected to double between 2024 and 2026, fuel costs are likely to increase again in the near future.”

Incoming Del. Franklin called the reduction woefully insufficient.

“It’s not a whole lot of relief when your wages haven’t gone up any, your groceries are still more expensive, and your rent’s really high — or your property taxes have gone up,” she said. ​“We have to have a more substantial plan to bring down rates.”

The recommendations in the plan by Clean Virginia, such as requiring utilities to pick up a share of fuel costs and reducing reliance on riders, echo a recent report that grew out of a bipartisan resolution from the 2024 General Assembly.

“There are folks that think if we have an all-of-the-above approach — that is how we bring down costs,” she said. ​“Then you’ve got some people on both sides that think nuclear is the direction.”

“And at the end of the day, we’ve got to help the people,” she said, ​“and that’s what I’m going to remind members of my party.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/lily-franklin.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=ccd2b6f0bac2cf8fdb582bd90665cd91,N,,2025-11-13 04:59:52.226952

Total sales fell 4.3% year-over-year to 1.28 million units, with a daily selling rate of 47,300 units—down from 52,100 in September. The annualized pace of sales dropped to 15.4 million vehicles, the lowest in three months.

While retail sales were nearly flat, rising 0.3% year-over-year to 1.13 million units, fleet deliveries plunged 28.8%, reflecting a sharp pullback in commercial demand.

GM maintained its lead with 219,000 units and a 17.2% market share, but Toyota closed the gap to its narrowest since April, selling 208,000 vehicles for a 16.3% share. Ford remained in third place with roughly 170,000 units and a 13.3% share. At the brand level, Toyota led with 178,000 units, followed by Ford (162,000) and Chevrolet (140,000). Stellantis’ brief surge faded, with its market share easing to 8.3% from 8.8% in September, GlobalData said.

Among individual models, Ford’s F-150 held the top spot at 40,700 units, narrowly ahead of the Toyota RAV4. The Chevrolet Silverado, Honda CR-V, and Toyota Camry rounded out the top five. The Tesla Model Y slipped from the rankings as the loss of EV tax credits weighed on demand.

Segment-wise, Compact Non-Premium SUVs continued to dominate, but their share fell to 21.4%, the lowest since June. Large Pickups gained the most ground, rising to 14.7% of total sales—their highest share of 2025.

“As the weather turned colder during October, the light vehicle market was also expected to cool down, and in general this proved to be the case,” said David Oakley, manager of americas sales forecasts at GlobalData. “The loss of EV tax credits was certainly a factor in a more subdued October, with some well-known EVs suffering a sharp reduction in sales, whether in year-on-year or month-on-month terms.”

He added that manufacturer incentives “failed to support demand in most cases,” suggesting the current pool of EV buyers “is depleted, as many pulled forward purchases into Q3.” Still, Oakley noted, “the broader picture is that most OEMs reported steady sales outside of EVs, as the industry continued to absorb tariff costs, shielding the consumer—for now—from the majority of their impact.”

From a financial perspective, the data highlight a market still outperforming early-year expectations, even as sales momentum moderates and smaller, import-heavy brands face tougher conditions.

Battery-electric vehicle (BEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) sales were the hardest hit, dropping 47 per cent overall. BEVs were down 43 per cent from a year earlier, representing 5 per cent of total retail sales, while PHEVs fell 62 per cent to a 1 per cent share.

“Following months of significant growth in August and September, when shoppers bought EVs at record rates, the BEV market is experiencing a pullback in October,” said Tom Kondrat, global lead for advanced analytics at Urban Science, in a statement.

He added that the situation is not unexpected, since the termination of U.S. federal tax credits “pulled BEV buyers ahead” as they wanted to take advantage of the incentive before it expired — much like the situation in Quebec.

Kondrat said BEVs accounted for only 5 per cent of total retail sales in October, roughly half their year-to-date share of 8.4 per cent. He expects BEV sales to remain below last year’s levels through the fourth quarter and into early 2026, with a possible recovery next spring as seasonal demand returns.

The amendment would ban donations from within Michigan’s campaign finance system and also so-called issue advertisements funded through the nonprofit accounts that are the most common avenue for “dark money” in Michigan’s political system.

The Michigan Chamber, which opposes the new ballot initiative, has described issue advocacy as a tool “used extensively to educate the public.” By avoiding a few key phrases that would explicitly support or oppose a candidate or ballot proposal, political groups can spend unlimited amounts to advertise without having to follow any campaign finance rules.

The ballot proposal aims to cast a light on some of that spending, by requiring any outside spending group making even tangential reference to a candidate or ballot issue to report their spending totals and donors to the state in the months leading up to an election.

First Amendment rights?

Business groups argue it amounts to an attack on free speech.

“This ballot petition disenfranchises over 900 state contractors — picking winners and losers in who can and cannot express their freedom of speech through transparent political activity,” Consumers Energy spokesperson Katie Carey told Bridge in a statement.

The type of nonprofit accounts used by Consumers and others for issues ads in the past are not required to disclose who funds them.

Michiganders for Money out of Politics is itself so far largely funded by dark money. It received $115,000 from the California-based Tides Foundation, a clearinghouse for liberal donor-advised funds through which hundreds of millions of dollars pass each year.

The group is currently circulating petitions to try to make the 2026 ballot. It will need to collect valid signatures from at least 356,958 voters to qualify.

The proposal wouldn’t impact political spending at the federal level, which regularly dwarfs state-level election spending.

Protect MI Free Speech’s treasurer is the head lobbyist for the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, Wendy Block. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment for the story.

BCBS noted in a statement that their PAC is “funded entirely by employees, who represent all political viewpoints and voluntarily contribute their own money to our collective work in advancing quality health care in our state” and argued the ballot proposal “silences their voices.”

Consumer Energy also alleged employees “may lose their right to association and to engage in the political process as they do today” under the legislation.

The ballot initiative’s language however, does not appear to block regular employees from contributing to campaigns and political action committees.

“Rank-and-file employees are not touched by our proposal, it’s only c-suite executives,” Sean McBrearty, one of the coalition’s organizers, said in an interview.

Under the language, that includes a company’s president, CEO, treasurer, officer with similar responsibilities, a person with “substantial” ownership or is on the board of directors.

Large-scale solar projects in the United States are experiencing a notable decrease in commissioning delays, based on the latest data compiled from multiple Preliminary Monthly Electric Generator Inventory reports. In the third quarter of 2025, around 20% of planned solar capacity reported a delay, compared to 25% during the same period in 2024.

Strong increase in installed capacity despite deferrals

Solar energy remains the leading source of new electricity generation capacity in the United States, driven by utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) projects developed by independent power producers and public utilities. In 2024, despite a high level of reported delays, the country recorded a record 31 gigawatts (GW) of new large-scale solar capacity, representing a 34% increase in total national capacity.

According to data collected through the Annual Electric Generator Report (EIA-860) and updated monthly via the Preliminary Monthly Electric Generator Inventory, delays are generally short in duration. Less than 1% of planned capacity is fully cancelled each month. Most reported delays concern projects in the final stages of construction or testing.

2025–2026 forecasts and gap between projections and actuals

For the period from October 2025 to September 2026, power plant developers plan to bring 32 GW of solar capacity online, 5 GW of which are projects already delayed from their initially declared timelines. These figures confirm a persistent trend: installed capacity at year-end is often lower than initial projections.

In January 2024, developers anticipated 36 GW of solar capacity additions for the year, but only 31 GW were actually connected to the grid. This discrepancy is mainly due to late-stage scheduling adjustments, which are difficult to anticipate in developers’ initial declarations.

Development stages and delay dynamics

In the monthly data collection, companies are also required to indicate the stage of development: planning, permitting, construction or testing. Delays mainly affect projects in the final phases, confirming that they are typically short-term technical deferrals rather than structural or financial obstacles.

With strong growth momentum and a declining delay rate, the U.S. utility-scale solar sector continues to expand while adjusting its targets to on-the-ground realities. These adjustments remain a key indicator for market participants and investors monitoring alignment between announcements and actual commissioning.

“In Spite of Ourselves” was written by John Prine and appears as the 15th song on his 13th studio album of the same name.
It was the first song Prine recorded after battling throat cancer in 1998.
Personnel on the record were: John Prine (vocals, acoustic guitar), Iris DeMent (vocals) and Marty Stuart (acoustic guitar).
“In Spite of Ourselves” was the only Prine song on the LP.","Let’s start with a quick refresher on carbon capture. When carbon dioxide (CO2) is captured and stored, and that’s all, the process is called carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and requires a Class VI injection well for long-term storage in deep geologic formations. If the CO2 is used for some other process before it’s stored, it is called carbon capture, use and sequestration (CCUS) and for certain applications requires a much-easier-to-permit Class II injection well — the most common example being the type used in enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Permitting for Class VI wells is typically handled by the EPA, although a few states have gained control over that process, something referred to as primacy, and several others, including Texas, are attempting to do the same (more on those states later).

There are plenty of CCS projects in the works nationwide, driven at least in part by improvements made to the 45Q tax credit for permanent CO2 sequestration as part of 2022’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and this year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). Under the budget law passed in July, the tax credits for CCS and CCUS/EOR are now equal at $85/MT for most carbon-capture facilities and $180/MT for direct air capture (DAC). Before the changes this year, the tax credits for CCUS/EOR were lower than for CCS. The blue bar sections in Figure 1 below indicate the credit rates under the IRA; the orange bar sections show the increases under the OBBBA.

“In Spite of Ourselves” was written by John Prine and appears as the 15th song on his 13th studio album of the same name. The song features Iris DeMent on vocals with Prine. Dement sang on four other tracks on the LP. Prine wrote the song for Billy Bob Thornton’s film, Daddy and Them. It’s about two lovers who look past each other’s imperfect ways, to a love that will last despite themselves. It was the first song Prine recorded after battling throat cancer in 1998. Personnel on the record were: John Prine (vocals, acoustic guitar), Iris DeMent (vocals) and Marty Stuart (acoustic guitar).

The album, In Spite of Ourselves, was recorded between August 1997 and December 1999 at Country Arms and Jack’s Tracks in Nashville. The album featured duets of classic country songs with female country artists, including Connie Smith, Lucinda Williams, Trisha Yearwood and Iris DeMent. “In Spite of Ourselves” was the only Prine song on the LP. Produced by Jim Rooney and John Prine, it was released in September 1999 and went to #21 on the Billboard Hot Country Albums chart and #197 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart.

John Prine was an American country/folk music singer, songwriter and musician. Working as a mailman in Chicago in the late 1960s, he began writing songs and performing at coffeehouses in the area. After Steve Goodman told Kris Kristofferson about Prine, Kristofferson began using him as his opening act, leading to a deal with Atlantic Records in 1971. He released 18 studio albums, six live albums, three compilation albums and eight singles. He won four Grammy Awards and is a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Prine died in Nashville in April 2020 at 73.

Market Outlook:

The third quarter of 2025 presented a distorted view of the automotive market, driven by a last-minute rush for electric vehicles (EVs) ahead of an expiring federal tax credit. This surge, a 72% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase in new EV sales, represents a pull-forward of demand rather than organic growth, with EVs still comprising just over 5% of total Q3 sales across brands represented in Vincensus.

While overall new vehicle sales rose 11% QoQ and used sales increased 3%, the underlying data suggests a more price-sensitive and competitive landscape ahead. Inventory levels are stabilizing after years of volatility, exposing challenges for brands with older or mispriced vehicles. Lotlinx anticipates a highly competitive Q4, characterized by increased manufacturer incentives, deeper markdowns, and aggressive year-end sales events as automakers seek to clear aging 2025 model-year inventory.

Key Findings

Inventory and Pricing Trends

New vehicle day supply increased by 5 days QoQ to 62 days (up 1 day YoY)

Used vehicle day supply increased by 1 day QoQ to 40 days (up 4 days YoY)

Carryover for new vehicles decreased 2% QoQ to 52%; used increased 7% QoQ to 50%

Aged ending inventory decreased 3% QoQ to 42% for new vehicles and held steady at 48% for used

Units sold with a markdown increased by 1% QoQ for new vehicles and 3% QoQ for used

EV, Hybrid, and ICE Performance

New EV sales surged 72% QoQ, while hybrids rose 7% and ICE vehicles 9%

EVs made up just 5% of all sales, signaling that the surge is short-term and incentive-driven

New EV day supply dropped to 61 days and used EV day supply to 36 days — both below ICE averages

Average list price of sold new units: EVs $55,510; hybrids $44,100; ICEs $41,857

For used vehicles, EV prices fell 3% QoQ to $28,888, while ICE and hybrid prices remained stable

Market Dynamics and Competition

The stabilization of inventory has introduced new challenges, particularly for brands with aging 2025 stock

Dealers are expected to face the most aggressive pricing environment in years, with manufacturer incentives rising sharply to move inventory

Markdown strategies and real-time decisioning are becoming critical for profitability

Lotlinx Dealer Performance

Lotlinx dealers continued to outperform the broader market during Q3. On average, Lotlinx dealers had 1% less aged inventory for new vehicles and 4% less for used vehicles compared to the market. Additionally, 59% of new vehicle brands and 92% of used vehicle brands leveraging Lotlinx outperformed their respective market benchmarks.

“Dealers are navigating a new chapter of hyper-competition, where every VIN decision matters,” said Len Short, Executive Chairman of Lotlinx. “Our data shows that Lotlinx-powered dealers are winning by acting faster and smarter, using VIN-specific insights to reduce aging, optimize pricing, and preserve profitability, even as the market becomes more volatile.”

Wylfa on the island of Anglesey, or Ynys Môn, will be home to three small modular reactors (SMRs) to be built by British manufacturer Rolls-Royce SMR. The government said it will invest £2.5bn.

SMRs are a new – and untested – technology aiming to produce nuclear power stations in factories to drive down costs and speed up installation. Rolls-Royce plans to build reactors, each capable of generating 470 megawatts of power, mainly in Derby.

The government also said that its Great British Energy – Nuclear (GBE-N) will report on potential sites for further larger reactors. They would follow the 3.2GW reactors under construction by French state-owned EDF at Hinkley Point C in Somerset and Sizewell C in Suffolk.

The Labour government under Starmer has embraced nuclear energy in the hope that it can generate electricity without carbon dioxide emissions, while also providing the opportunity for a large new export industry in SMRs.

However, it faced the prospect of a row with the US, piqued that its ally had overlooked the US’s Westinghouse Electric Company when choosing the manufacturer for the Wylfa reactors.

Ahead of the publication of the UK announcement, US ambassador Warren Stephens published a statement saying Britain should choose “a different path” in Wales.

“We are extremely disappointed by this decision, not least because there are cheaper, faster and already-approved options to provide clean, safe energy at this same location,” he said.

The Trump administration last month signed an $80bn (£61bn) deal with Westinghouse, which had been struggling financially, to build several of the same larger reactors proposed at Wylfa. Under the terms of that deal, the Trump administration could end up taking a stake in the company.

A source close to the UK government said: “This is the right choice for Britain. This is our flagship SMR programme, producing homegrown clean power with a British company and we have chosen the best site for it.”

While the ambassador’s intervention is unlikely to change the future of Wylfa, it may put pressure on the UK to choose Westinghouse if it does go ahead with future large reactors.

It is understood that Torness, to the east of Edinburgh, and Hunterston, to the west of Glasgow, would be considered for future large reactors. A source close to the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, said the government wants to generate nuclear power in Scotland, despite the opposition of the ruling Scottish National party.

Wylfa generated nuclear power from 1971 until 2015, when its last reactor was shut down. Japan’s Hitachi tried to build a new plant there, but these efforts collapsed in 2019 after it failed to agree funding with the government. GBE-N bought the site from Hitachi.

Starmer said: “Britain was once a world leader in nuclear power, but years of neglect and inertia has meant places like Anglesey have been let down and left behind.

“This government isn’t just reversing decline, it’s delivering thousands of future-proofed jobs, driving billions in investment and providing cheaper energy bills in the long term.”

However, Sharon Graham, general secretary of Unite, said that building three smaller reactors rather than one larger one at Wylfa would be a mistake because it would not maximise the number of jobs for British workers. The union represents some workers in the nuclear industry.

“Failure to support a gigawatt nuclear power station at Wylfa would be a huge missed opportunity in securing the UK’s energy security,” she said.

Nevertheless, the confirmation of a UK site will be another welcome step for Rolls-Royce, the FTSE 100 maker of jet engines that was chosen as the government’s preferred developer in June.

It owns the majority of Rolls-Royce SMR, alongside Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, France’s BNF Resources, US energy company Constellation, and the Czech utility CEZ, which could order as many as six of the reactors.

Rolls-Royce SMR has more than 1,000 employees, who are racing to produce technology that will also be installed at Temelín in the Czech Republic.

Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, a lobby group, said the Wylfa project was “an exciting opportunity for a UK technology, our domestic supply chain and skilled workforce”.

He added: “To achieve the amount of nuclear capacity the country needs for a secure, reliable and price-predictable electricity mix, we will need reactors large and small.

“There will be other projects using different reactor technologies, and potentially further gigawatt-scale plants beyond Sizewell C. Partnership with like-minded allies, including the US, will be a part of delivering that ambition.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd0d67bd71875cc05e13b88746ec07e7bbf4b885/363_0_2108_1688/master/2108.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a8546080980e35ac995c6cb7adbe9991",N,,2025-11-12 22:59:29.131842

Perhaps the most significant change EPA is now proposing is exempting articles importers from reporting.

The prior rule expanded the scope of PFAS subject to the rule, included no de minimis volume threshold, and lacked typical TSCA exemptions, such as for research and development, byproducts, and impurities.

EPA now proposes to exempt:

PFAS imported as part of an article

PFAS manufactured or imported in a mixture or article below a 0.1% de minimis concentration

PFAS that are impurities

PFAS that are byproducts not used for a commercial purpose or PFAS that are manufactured upon incidental exposure or end use of another substance (referring to the exemptions in EPA’s premanufacture notice (PMN) regulations at 40 C.F.R. § 720.30(h));

PFAS that are non-isolated intermediates

PFAS that are manufactured or imported in small quantities for research and development (R&D) purposes

In addition to adding these typical TSCA exemptions, EPA is proposing to delay the reporting submission window (currently April 13, 2026 – October 13, 2026), requesting comment on whether a production volume threshold should be considered, and requesting comment on whether it should limit reporting to only PFAS with a Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number (CASRN), TSCA Accession Number, or LVE number. The proposed rule does not revise the original reporting lookback period of January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2022.",https://www.pierceatwood.com/themes/custom/pierce_theme/images/pierce-social.png,N,,2025-11-13 06:00:49.856978

This partnership marks a step forward in Sustainea’s efforts to promote sustainable practices across its supply chain.

The project will support around 1,000 acres of farmland near Lafayette, Indiana. That’s a key region within the U.S. Corn Belt known for high corn productivity. The focus is on implementing regenerative agricultural techniques that aim to improve soil health, increase carbon sequestration, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and lessen environmental impact.

Gustavo Sergi, CEO of Sustainea, commented, “Regenerative agriculture offers a way to address climate change while supporting rural communities in the Midwest. Working closely with local farmers and trusted partners, we aim to promote practices that contribute to long-term industry resilience. We’re proud to collaborate with Primient and local farmers in Indiana to build a low-carbon future.”

This initiative builds on Sustainea’s ongoing partnership with Primient, which includes collaboration on the development of the first U.S. Bio-MEG facility. The project aims to promote large-scale adoption of regenerative practices in the Lafayette area and ensure responsible sourcing of corn—the raw material used in Sustainea’s Bio-MEG production.

Laura Kowalski, Head of Sustainability and Marketing at Primient, stated, “Since 2018, Primient has been working to increase regenerative agriculture practices in the U.S. Midwest. Using advanced technology, we help farmers monitor and measure their environmental outcomes, contributing to a more resilient supply chain.”

Sustainea’s Bio-MEG, produced from renewable, plant-based feedstocks, offers a way for customers to reduce their carbon footprint without sacrificing quality. As the company prepares to expand its operations in the U.S., local regenerative sourcing is central to its sustainability strategy.

The Bio-MEG facility is projected to begin operations in 2028, processing the equivalent of 42,000 bushels of corn daily. This capacity could prevent up to 400,000 tons of CO₂e emissions annually by replacing petroleum-derived MEG with Sustainea’s low-carbon alternative.

Gustavo Sergi concluded, “This initiative reinforces our commitment to creating value at every level; from how we source raw materials to the products we deliver. It provides our partners and customers with greater transparency and measurable ways to reduce their environmental impact.”",https://worldbiomarketinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sustainea-launches-regenerative-agriculture-project-with-Primient-.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 04:01:37.931179

We Energies is planning an expansion to add nearly 3 gigawatts of energy capacity, including renewable energy, battery storage, and modern natural gas facilities, to strengthen Wisconsin’s power grid.

The expansion is anticipated to help drive economic growth by creating construction jobs and supporting data centers and other energy-intensive customers without shifting costs to residential or business customers.

A We Energies customer protection plan ensures data centers pay their full share of energy costs, while federal tax credits may help its customers save on electricity expenses.

We Energies announced an expansion plan last week aimed at adding nearly 3 gigawatts of new energy capacity to Wisconsin’s power grid.

The proposal, filed with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, includes a mix of renewable energy projects, battery storage, and modern natural gas facilities designed to meet growing energy demands while supporting economic development across the state.

A Boost for Wisconsin’s Economy and Energy Security

The expansion plan is set to power data centers and other energy-intensive customers, driving economic growth and creating thousands of construction jobs. The renewable energy facilities will provide clean energy on a daily basis, while the natural gas plants will operate during peak demand to ensure reliability.

Details of the Expansion

The announced We Energies plan includes:

Seven solar projects

One battery storage project

Two modern natural gas plants

Upgrades to existing power facilities to enhance reliability

The renewable energy and battery storage projects are expected to qualify for federal tax credits, potentially saving customers in long-term costs, according to officials.

“These new power plants reflect our commitment to reliability, economic growth, and putting our customers first,” said Mike Hooper, president of We Energies.

“Together, these projects and the data centers they support will energize Wisconsin’s workforce, creating thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of full-time high-tech and energy careers.”

In addition to job creation, the projects will strengthen Wisconsin’s power grid, add thousands of megawatts of locally produced electricity, and enhance energy security for customers statewide.

More than 12 million gallons of liquid waste from Smitty Supply had been recovered from impacted areas as of Oct. 28.
The liquid waste is pumped through the tubing and into the ground, filling the tiny spaces in porous rock underground.
As for the kinds of solid waste River Birch will accept from Smitty’s Supply, LDEQ officials wouldn’t provide any specifics when reached for comment Wednesday.
Lisa Karlin, a River Ridge resident and longtime citizen watchdog of Jefferson Parish government, raised several concerns about River Birch accepting waste material from Smitty’s Supply.","Millions of gallons of oily water and spilled petrochemicals from the Smitty’s Supply fire and explosion have been handled at three different sites, but state officials have granted an emergency request to bring some of the liquid and solid waste to a Jefferson Parish landfill.

River Birch LLC, which operates a landfill in Avondale, received a permit exemption last month from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality to accept waste recovered after the Aug. 22 fire disaster in Tangipahoa Parish, according to LDEQ records the agency published this week.

Although River Birch’s Class 1 injection wells are permitted for only non-hazardous materials, a 1996 federal law allows them to be used to dispose of certain hazardous materials mixed when with water. River Birch uses its injection wells for petrochemical wastewater, industrial sludge, oily waters, solvents, acids, contaminated groundwater and stormwater, and other liquid wastes that would otherwise be considered hazardous, according to the company’s website.

River Birch’s injection well permit allows it to accept liquid waste statewide, but its solid waste permit is limited to a 13-parish area that doesn’t include Tangipahoa. The company requested the emergency solid waste exception on Oct. 13, and the state approved it two days later.

“This is a unique opportunity for Smitty’s to manage all of its contaminated waste at a properly permitted facility,” Chris Casteix, River Birch’s environmental compliance manager, wrote in the company’s emergency request to the agency.

In its approval letter to River Birch, the Department of Environmental Quality said the waste from Smitty’s Supply “will have no significant adverse impact on the public health, safety, welfare, and the environment.”

It’s unclear how much waste Smitty’s Supply will send to the River Birch landfill. Neither company has responded to calls or emails.

More than 12 million gallons of liquid waste from Smitty Supply had been recovered from impacted areas as of Oct. 28. Roughly half of that amount has already been disposed of at other facilities, according to information from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state.

As of Oct. 16, EPA contractors brought 2.7 million gallons of recovered waste to Preston Environmental Solutions in Baton Rouge for recycling and 3.7 million gallons to Woodside Landfill in Livingston Parish for solidification.

Another 595,000 gallons has been taken to a landfill in Liberty, Mississippi, and injected underground, according to LDEQ records.

Underground injection of liquid waste is an accepted disposal practice under state and federal laws.

Whether it’s an injection well for waste disposal or an oil well for extraction, the structure is mostly the same. A hole is drilled to a desired depth, typically around 4,000 feet for Class 1 wells, and supported with long sections of pipe cemented in place to prevent cave-ins. Often an additional layer of tubing lines the inner walls of the pipe to prevent leaks. There is no encasement or container at the bottom of the well. The liquid waste is pumped through the tubing and into the ground, filling the tiny spaces in porous rock underground.

The EPA requires a Class 1 well to extend below the lowermost formations containing drinking water within a quarter-mile vicinity. Patrick Courreges, spokesman for the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy, said there must be a good enough barrier of impervious rock to prevent any of the waste from seeping upwards. He said the injection pressure at the wellhead is constantly monitored to prevent fractures and blowouts.

River Birch’s website says its wells are positioned 6,500 feet underground.

Injection wells are generally the cheapest option to dispose of contaminated liquid waste, but they do carry some risks such as well leaks and groundwater contamination, according to the EPA and other sources. The federal agency says underground injection is safe when the wells are placed at an appropriate site and properly maintained.

As for the kinds of solid waste River Birch will accept from Smitty’s Supply, LDEQ officials wouldn’t provide any specifics when reached for comment Wednesday.

“River Birch will be disposing of non-hazardous solid waste that they are already permitted to dispose of,” LDEQ spokeswoman Meagan Molter said.

YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.

Lisa Karlin, a River Ridge resident and longtime citizen watchdog of Jefferson Parish government, raised several concerns about River Birch accepting waste material from Smitty’s Supply. She wants to know who determines whether the waste going to River Birch is hazardous or not and if any kind of testing is required to make that determination.

“Even if it’s technically OK, should the parish take in waste from Smitty’s?” Karlin said. “Everything I’ve seen suggests that the Smitty’s waste is likely highly toxic.”

Members of the Jefferson Parish Council have not responded to her questions about River Birch’s permit, she said.

Jefferson Parish President Cynthia Lee Sheng and Councilmembers at-large Jennifer Van Vrancken and Scott Walker have not responded to a reporter’s request for comment.

Karlin also questioned whether River Birch’s permit exemption warranted expedited approval when waste from Tangipahoa Parish was already going to other landfills that were closer in distance.

“Why drive over an hour to get to River Birch?” Karlin asked.

The 180-day emergency permit exemption will remain in effect until mid-April.

Smitty’s Supply faces a lawsuit from the state and EPA that seeks fines and penalties that could exceed a billion dollars for years of environmental violations.

The offices of Bacon and Hurd did not respond to inquiries about next steps now that the government seems likely to reopen imminently.","WASHINGTON — With the federal government appearing to be on the precipice of reopening without an agreement on extending the soon-to-expire health care tax subsidies at the center of the shutdown fight, attention is likely to turn to the fate of the Affordable Care Act credits that have helped lower the cost of insurance for millions of Americans.

In particular, as federal employees get back to work and government programs return to normal operations, eyes may turn to the trickle of bipartisan proposals to extend them and the handful of Republican lawmakers who have joined Democrats in calling for action.

The credits, which were established under Democrats’ American Rescue Plan in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic and extended in the party’s Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, are set to lapse at the end of the year, threatening to raise the cost of health coverage plans for Americans across the country.

Democrats, who say they were standing up to the “health care crisis” in America created by Republicans, made an extension of the subsidies the key tangible focal point of their demands in exchange for joining with the GOP in voting to reopen the government.

The eventual agreement to end the record-long, 40-plus-day shutdown that appears likely to become law was worked out by Republicans and a handful of Democratic senators and promises the party a vote on extending the credits by the second week of December but makes no commitments it will result in the outcome those on that side of the aisle want. And given the GOP’s yearslong battle against the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare and the ACA for short, it is unlikely it will. Also, no parallel commitment to a vote was made in the House, where an extension would also have to pass to become law.

Throughout the shutdown, Republican leaders argued they would be open to conversations on the subsidies only once Democrats voted to reopen the government but Speaker Mike Johnson in particular also said there would have to be reforms.

The bipartisan proposals and vocal Republicans

But as the shutdown dragged on, a collection of Republican lawmakers has emerged to express concern about the expiration of the credits and call for Congress to address it, with a few even joining Democratic colleagues to propose solutions.

In perhaps the most notable instance, a bipartisan pair of House members representing California introduced a bill this week that seeks to extend the premium tax credits for another two years while implementing an eligibility cap at six times the poverty level and moving to crack down on what they say is fraud by insurance brokers and waste in Medicare Advantage.

“Our bipartisan legislation will assure Americans are spared from a massive increase in health care costs that is just around the corner,” said Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley, who joined with Democratic Rep. Sam Liccardo, in introducing the bill. “This will provide short-term relief while we tackle broader reforms to lower the cost of care.”

A week earlier in what marked the first instance of a bipartisan group teaming up to propose a tangible plan to address the credits amid the shutdown, Republican Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Jeff Hurd of Colorado, along with Democratic Reps. Tom Suozzi of New York and Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, banded together to offer a “statement of principles.” Although not legislation, the statement proposed a two-year extension of the subsidies with an income cap phased out between $200,000 and $400,000.

”Our hope is that this shared statement of principles will inspire bipartisan collaboration across Washington and help get Congress back to work for the American people,” the lawmakers wrote.

The offices of Bacon and Hurd did not respond to inquiries about next steps now that the government seems likely to reopen imminently.

Meanwhile, a group of more than a dozen House Republicans, led by Reps. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey and Jen Kiggans of Virginia, spoke out last month urging Johnson to ensure action is taken on health care once the shutdown is over. In a letter to the speaker, the House Republicans urged him to “immediately turn our focus to the growing crisis of healthcare affordability and the looming expiration of the enhanced Affordable Care Act premium tax credits” once the government is reopened, warning that allowing them to lapse “without a clear path forward would risk real harm to those we represent.”

Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a well-known conservative firebrand, has also been vocal on the issue throughout the shutdown, noting that her own adult children are set to see their insurance premiums double next year if the credits expire.

For his part, President Donald Trump — who has long railed against the ACA and unsuccessfully sought to get rid of it in his first term — vowed in a recent interview with CBS News to “sit down with the Democrats” and work to “fix” the health care situation in the U.S. when they vote to reopen the government.

Asked about such a pledge from the president at Wednesday’s White House briefing, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump is “absolutely open to having conversations about health care” once the shutdown is officially over.

She added that Trump would be “putting forth some really good policy proposals the Democrats should take very seriously.”

House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York vowed Wednesday to introduce legislation to extend the subsidies for three years.

The impact of the credits expiring

With the ACA open enrollment period already underway, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health estimated consumers buying insurance through the program are seeing their premiums rise by up to 59%. An analysis from independent health policy organization KFF estimated that the enhanced premium tax credits saved certain enrollees an average of $705 a year in 2024 and would have been more than 75% higher without the subsidies.

The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, meanwhile, estimated that the end of the enhancements will raise the cost of coverage for enrollees previously receiving the credits by an average of $1,000 a year. And it notes the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found 1.5 million more people will be uninsured in 2026 if Congress waits until the end of the year to take action on their extension.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/capitol_AP_25310656691923_NAT_1109_crop,N,,2025-11-12 22:59:42.605250

“I want to thank Crain’s for recognizing Dr. Tony Reames. His commitment to community-driven climate action, neighborhood resilience and regeneration is transforming how Detroit advances equity, innovation, and sustainability from the ground up. This recognition is so well deserved,” Madison said.

As founder of the Urban Energy Justice Lab and the Energy Equity Project, and as Director of the SEAS Detroit Sustainability Clinic, Reames has shaped national conversations on equitable access to clean energy. From 2021 to 2023, he served as a Presidential appointee in the Biden-Harris Administration, where he established and led the first-ever Office of Energy Justice Policy and Analysis at the U.S. Department of Energy, overseeing research and federal energy programs to embed racial and socioeconomic equity into policy. Later, as Principal Deputy Director of the Office of State and Community Energy Programs, he partnered with state and local entities to implement place-based clean energy strategies through collaboration among government, community, business, and other stakeholders.

His leadership continues to bridge research, policy, and practice—advancing sustainability solutions rooted in equity and community partnership.

“It’s an honor to be recognized among leaders across Michigan who are advancing sustainability through innovation and collaboration,” said Reames. “This acknowledgment reflects the work of our incredible partners—across communities, government, and the University—who are building a more just and sustainable future together.”

In addition to Reames, other 2025 Crain’s Notable Leaders in Sustainability from SEAS include Patrick Judd (MLA ’92), CIS LLC; Madeline Miller (PhD ’25), Nextiles LLC; and Brittany Szczepanik (MS/MEng ’17), Positive Scenarious Consulting.",https://seas.umich.edu/sites/default/files/styles/open_graph/public/2024-09/tony-reames-02-dsc3410.jpg?itok=NSlc3_Pp,N,,2025-11-13 02:59:11.990242

North Carolina Toyota battery manufacturing facility grand opening sparks economic promise for U.S.

Toyota North Carolina officially began production on their electric vehicle battery plant in Liberty, Randolph County, with a grand opening event. Local, state and federal officials joined Toyota leadership at the 1,850-acre megasite (the equivalent of 120 football fields) for an official tour and welcome party. The battery facility marks the first of its kind operation in the United States for the company.The Toyota plant brings a $14 billion investment to North Carolina, with an additional $10 billion promised in the next five years in the United States. As of 2025, Toyota has invested $60 billion in the energy and transportation sector in the United States. ""Americans love cars because a car means freedom,"" said US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who spoke before a crowd of thousands at the event Wednesday. ""When companies invest in America, that means great American jobs. And I think the example here is the families sustaining great American jobs that Toyota has made for this community comes from that $14 billion investment.""The new facility hosts 2,000 employees and is set to hire 3,000 more employees in the next phases of development. The current capacity of the megasite can create 150,000 batteries per production line that could power 600,000 vehicles. Last year, Toyota said it sold 1 million vehicles with electric battery capabilities. ""There's going to be a good chance that your new Toyota hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or electric vehicle will be powered by a battery that comes off the line in this facility,"" said North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein.

In October 2023, EPA finalized a one-time PFAS reporting and recordkeeping regulation requiring manufacturers and importers of PFAS and PFAS-containing products between 2011 and 2022 to report certain data to EPA.
In addition, EPA seeks to revise the reporting deadline under the rule.
The current reporting deadline is October 13, 2026.
Thus, if the rule is finalized after May 2026, this would result in an extension of the reporting rule’s deadline.","On November 10, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a pre-publication copy of its proposed rule to significantly reduce the scope of its Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) reporting requirements under Section 8(a)(7) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Most significantly, the proposed changes seek to exempt imported articles from the reporting requirement. According to EPA, the proposed rule aims to make PFAS reporting under TSCA more practical and easier to implement by reducing unnecessary or duplicative requirements for businesses, while ensuring EPA continues to receive essential information on PFAS use and safety.

In October 2023, EPA finalized a one-time PFAS reporting and recordkeeping regulation requiring manufacturers and importers of PFAS and PFAS-containing products between 2011 and 2022 to report certain data to EPA. The rule aimed to improve EPA’s understanding of PFAS use and exposure, and potential environmental and health effects. The previous rule did not include traditional TSCA exemptions, raising concerns among regulated entities about significant compliance costs, implementation challenges, and impacts on small businesses—particularly importers of finished products containing PFAS.

Under the proposed rule, EPA now seeks to add key reporting exemptions including: (1) mixtures or articles containing PFAS in concentrations less than 0.1%; (2) PFAS imported as part of an article; (3) certain PFAS that are byproducts not used for a commercial purpose or PFAS that are manufactured upon incidental exposure or end use of another substance; (4) PFAS that are impurities; (5) PFAS that are manufactured or imported in small quantities for research and development purposes; and (6) PFAS that are non-isolated intermediates.

In addition, EPA seeks to revise the reporting deadline under the rule. The current reporting deadline is October 13, 2026. EPA is proposing to alter the deadline for reporting, by having the submission period begin 60 days after the rule is finalized and to run for three months.

Unlike other massive EV battery plants that have been built in the last five years, this plant is dedicated to smaller batteries for hybrids and plug-in hybrids, in addition to some for full EVs. The $14b investment is Toyota's largest in a single site, and part of the reason this campus cost them so much (others have built 30 GWH for $2b-$3b) is that it's really three battery plants on the same grounds. Each product, whether for hybrids, PHEVs or EV, needs it own manufacturing line(s). Until this plant, Toyota made batteries only in Japan, where it previously had a decades long partnership with Panasonic before taking full control of the production. In North Carolina, they're running 4 of 14 possible production lines, making batteries for 600,000 hybrids annually such as Camry in Kentucky and Corolla Cross in Alabama. They're building space for PHEV and EV batteries, but those plans are fairly limited currently, enough to support 74,000 PHEVs and 45,000 EVs. Roughly half of Toyota's sales in the U.S. are hybrids or EVs, and the goal is to push that to 70% by 2030, U.S. sales chief David Christ.

“We have significant lending authority at the loan program office,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said at a Washington, D.C. event, according to CNBC.
President Donald Trump directed the department in May to start building 10 large nuclear reactors by 2030.
Trump also ordered the secretary to prioritize activities that support nuclear energy to help comply with his construction directive.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which was established in the 1970s, oversees power plants and other uses of nuclear materials.","The Department of Energy will lend most of its loans for nuclear power plant projects, its secretary announced Monday.

“We have significant lending authority at the loan program office,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said at a Washington, D.C. event, according to CNBC.

“By far the biggest use of those dollars will be for nuclear power plants — to get those first plants built.”

The secretary, speaking at a conference held by the American Nuclear Society, noted that he expects electricity demand from artificial intelligence to attract billions of dollars from “very creditworthy providers,” CNBC reported. Wright was quoted as saying that his department could match those dollars by as much as four to one.

President Donald Trump directed the department in May to start building 10 large nuclear reactors by 2030. Wright reportedly added that he hopes there will be dozens under construction by the time the administration ends.

Trump also ordered the secretary to prioritize activities that support nuclear energy to help comply with his construction directive. The president told Wright to use his loan office to build new advanced reactors, finish those that were prematurely suspended, increase the power output of plants that are operating and make resources available to restart closed plants.

“Swift and decisive action is required to jumpstart America’s nuclear energy industrial base and ensure our national and economic security by increasing fuel availability and production, securing civil nuclear supply chains, improving the efficiency with which advanced nuclear reactors are licensed, and preparing our workforce to establish America’s energy dominance and accelerate our path towards a more secure and independent energy future,” Trump said.

The Atlantic Council, an international affairs think tank, said in a May report that Trump’s order addressed “well-trodden issues” but was “ambitious.”

The president’s other directives on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which are partially aimed at reducing the federal agency’s staff, also present issues for the country’s nuclear energy industry, according to the think tank.

“In the new orders, the Trump administration has articulated ambitious goals for rapid deployment of next-generation nuclear technologies; however, reducing personnel and funding for the NRC and the Department of Energy, along with weakening the NRC’s independence and global credibility, will make it challenging to realize the full potential of the US nuclear energy industry,” the Atlantic Council explained.

One of the trickiest questions for FERC to iron out is whether it actually has the authority to regulate interconnection to the transmission system.","Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s directive to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to standardize large load interconnections landed last month with a bang.

The unusual move — delivered via advanced notice of proposed rulemaking — would dramatically expand FERC’s authority over interconnection to the transmission system, which has traditionally been left up to the states. And it bolstered the industry’s growing enthusiasm for load flexibility for data centers by encouraging FERC to offer expedited interconnection for curtailable loads (as well as colocated facilities that agree to be both curtailable and dispatchable).

But the ANOPR leaves open many critical questions. And with the ambitious — arguably to the point of improbable — six-month timeline that Wright set for the rulemaking, FERC doesn’t have much time to answer them.

Allison Clements, former FERC commissioner and current partner with digital infrastructure advisory firm ASG, and Tyler Norris, a researcher at Duke University who authored a seminal paper on load flexibility last February, unpacked some of these considerations on a recent episode of the Catalyst podcast with Shayle Kann. For instance: What are the technical parameters of flexibility? How many total hours of curtailment will be required each year? How will FERC value different approaches to flexibility, from batteries to backup generation? And how to ensure loads actually curtail when they’ve committed to doing so?

One of Clements’ primary concerns is that answering these questions with sufficient specificity will be impossible, given both FERC’s typical approach to these kinds of rulemakings, and the timeline at play.

“Ever since standard market design failed in 2000, the agency has been really skittish about requiring standardized anything across the board….So my instinct, without getting into the politics, is they’re not going to get that specific on first take,” Clements told Kann. “And that’s my biggest concern here. We don’t want something rushed that ends up failing to really take advantage of the opportunity that these flexibility alternatives provide and incentivize them in a way that works for the providers.”

For more of Allison Clements and Tyler Norris’ takes on the ANOPR, listen to this recent episode of Catalyst with Shayle Kann:

In the next five and a half months, FERC will have to take comments on the ANOPR, then write its own notice of proposed rulemaking — an outline of the proposed regulation — then take comments on that NOPR, all before issuing a final rule. According to Clements, accomplishing that by the April deadline would be “rocket speed in FERC world.”

The rulemaking process for FERC’s Order 1920, a landmark long-term transmission planning and cost allocation rule, Clements added, took four years and was 1,200 pages long. The Wright ANOPR, in contrast, was 14 pages. “It’s not realistic,” Clements said of the April deadline. And Wright’s authority to require that six-month speed rulemaking, she added, is simply “the bully pulpit, political pressure.”

“But I think when that letter came out, there were a lot of FERC staffers who were thinking, oh no, my Thanksgiving and holiday plans,” she added.

What kind of load flexibility?

There’s also the question of what kind of load flexibility FERC should push for. The concept has gathered steam in the last year, but there are several ways a large load could be flexible: for instance either throttling down their use during moments of peak demand (as Google has done for several years) or relying on backup generation or batteries. However, there is also a growing move to redesign data centers themselves to serve as flexible grid assets, as the startup Verrus is doing.

Norris argues, however, that ideally FERC would structure its regulation to cover any approach to flexibility that a large load may want to take, rather than picking winners by endorsing a particular one.

“Ultimately you want it to be as sort of generalizable as possible so that you can sort of represent any load that is utilizing this type of flexibility for all these purposes,” he said. “Then we can actually create a market where a variety of different options can compete either onsite — or even to some extent offsite.” While it’s even more nascent, there is a move toward procuring flexibility from other loads in the same balancing authority, he added, including via a virtual power plant program announced by WattCarbon last week.

But the technical specifications still need to be worked out. In the wake of the proposal, a collection of researchers at the Duke Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment, and Sustainability joined Clements and the lawyers of Roselle LP in outlining FERC’s considerations for the rulemaking.

The brief argued that if FERC wants to make the most of large load flexibility — and ideally free up grid capacity at the same time — the commission will need to structure flexibility commitments “as transactions with clearly defined terms.” And in doing so, the group said FERC will need to evaluate rules that:

Enable large load flexibility commitments to avoid or defer transmission upgrades

Enable large load flexibility commitments to reduce capacity procurements

Enable flexible large loads to obtain non-firm withdrawal and, as applicable, injection rights

Clarify study timelines, queue priority, and interconnection process for large load customers, as well as load-supply hybrid facilities and pairings

The response so far

The docket for the proposal is open now; in light of stakeholder requests, the comment period has already been extended from November 14 to November 21, with reply comments due December 5.

So far, most respondents have filed motions to intervene — essentially requests to become an official party to the proceeding, via arguing that they will be directly impacted by the outcome. This group includes both the PJM Power Providers Group and the organization of PJM states, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, and Southwest Power Pool Market Monitoring Unit, as well as companies like Mainspring Energy and Vitol. No company or organization has yet expressed opposition or support for the specifics of the ANOPR.

Utilities, some of the most important stakeholders in this rulemaking, have yet to weigh in.

One of the trickiest questions for FERC to iron out is whether it actually has the authority to regulate interconnection to the transmission system. Clements said on Catalyst that the legal arguments that Wright makes in his filing are strong, but said “I’m not sure if it’s by tradition, by culture, experience or practice that it actually hasn’t been asserted in the past.” Norris added that he anticipates concerns on the jurisdictional question especially from some state commission officials “and certainly the investor-owned utilities.”

So far, the Edison Electric Institute, the trade group representing the country’s large, investor-owned utilities, has remained mostly quiet on the ANOPR. The group’s sole statement on the proposal could be characterized as damning-with-faint-praise: “We share the Administration’s commitment to American energy dominance and appreciate their leadership to accelerate energy to win the AI race and fuel our economy,” EEI president and CEO Drew Maloney said. “We look forward to working with FERC to strengthen the grid, drive down costs for customers, and improve reliability across our country.”",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-11-12T171849.189.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 22:59:36.420931

Prices are then forecast to hold near $4.00/MMBtu in 2026 as U.S. LNG exports continue to grow and domestic production levels off.
“Flat production and strong export growth are expected to tighten natural gas balances,” the agency said.
While oil prices ease, electricity demand continues to grow—particularly in Texas and neighboring states.
Oil and refined fuel prices are poised to soften amid growing inventories, but natural gas remains on a firmer trajectory as export capacity expands and new LNG projects ramp up.","Global oil markets are expected to ease in 2026, but the U.S. natural gas sector continues to tighten as liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports expand and domestic production growth slows, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) latest Short-Term Energy Outlook.

The EIA projects Henry Hub natural gas prices will average about $4.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2026, up 16% from this year, reflecting stronger LNG exports and steady winter heating demand. In contrast, global oil inventories are rising, putting downward pressure on crude prices even as gas markets strengthen.

Gas prices firm as exports expand

The EIA expects Henry Hub spot prices to rise to an average of $3.90/MMBtu this winter (November–March), following typical seasonal patterns of higher heating demand. Prices are then forecast to hold near $4.00/MMBtu in 2026 as U.S. LNG exports continue to grow and domestic production levels off.

“Flat production and strong export growth are expected to tighten natural gas balances,” the agency said.

U.S. LNG terminals are exporting gas at record levels. The EIA expects average LNG exports of 14.9 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in 2025, up 25% from last year, driven largely by rapid commissioning of the Plaquemines LNG facility in Louisiana. That project has come online faster than expected, prompting the EIA to raise its fourth-quarter export forecast by 3% from the prior month.

Exports are projected to increase another 10% in 2026, underscoring the U.S. role as the world’s leading LNG supplier.

In contrast to the tightening gas market, the EIA expects global oil inventories to build through 2026, exerting downward pressure on crude prices. Brent crude is forecast to average $54 per barrel in the first quarter of 2026 and $55 per barrel for the year, about $3 higher than last month’s forecast due to revised assumptions about Chinese stockpiling and ongoing Russian sanctions.

Lower crude prices will filter through to the retail level, with U.S. gasoline prices projected to fall below $3.00 per gallon in 2026 and diesel prices averaging $3.50 per gallon, both declines from 2024 levels.

While oil prices ease, electricity demand continues to grow—particularly in Texas and neighboring states. The EIA expects U.S. electricity sales to rise 2.4% in 2025 and 2.6% in 2026, led by demand from data centers and cryptocurrency mining facilities in the West South Central region.

Coal production, meanwhile, is forecast to remain steady above 500 million short tons (MMst) in 2026, buoyed by the reopening of several Appalachian mines and slower stock drawdowns at coal-fired power plants.

Outlook

The EIA’s forecast highlights diverging trends across the U.S. energy landscape. Oil and refined fuel prices are poised to soften amid growing inventories, but natural gas remains on a firmer trajectory as export capacity expands and new LNG projects ramp up.

By late 2026, the United States is expected to solidify its position as the world’s largest LNG exporter, even as domestic producers face limited output growth and infrastructure planners balance expanding export demand with system reliability.",https://www.compressortech2.com/Images/1260x628/index-20251112-214759-Henry-Hub-graph.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 18:00:58.605395

Dive Brief:

Toyota Motor Corp. announced Wednesday that it will invest an additional $10 billion in its U.S. operations over the next five years to support mobility efforts. Additional details were not disclosed.

The automotive manufacturer also began production at its electric vehicle battery plant in Liberty, North Carolina, the first and only such facility outside Japan, the company said in the release.

The 7-million-square-foot Liberty factory is Toyota’s 11th and can produce 30 gigawatt hours of batteries annually at full capacity. The site is expected to create up to 5,100 jobs.

The company announced it’s spending an additional $8 billion, bringing the total investment to $13.9 billion

The new plant will serve as Toyota’s hub for developing and producing lithium-ion batteries for its growing EV portfolio, according to the Nov. 12 press release.

The facility will house 14 production lines supporting hybrid, battery-powered and plug-in hybrid EVs.

The facility currently has “all different stages going,” Don Stewart, president of Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina, said in a video on Wednesday. Four of the hybrid lines are currently operational while its first BEV line is in its trial phase. “So we’re actually producing batteries, but they’re not sellable,” Stewart said.

The Liberty plant assembles battery modules specifically for HEV models of Toyota’s Camry, Corolla Cross, RAV4 and an undisclosed BEV that Toyota said will be the first of its kind to be built in the United States. The company plans to add more production lines, set to launch by 2030.

Stewart added that the North Carolina facility is helping Toyota become a mobility company through its various EV battery efforts. In April 2023, the company introduced a mobility strategy to accelerate EV production and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, according to its media channel, Toyota Times. The strategy also includes improving the energy density of its lithium-ion batteries.

“As [the electrification age] continues to ramp up, we’re right to the leading edge of that,” Stewart said.

In June, the facility beganshipping HEV modules to the company’s Georgetown, Kentucky, plant as well as its joint venture assembly factory with the Mazda Motor Corp. in Huntsville, Alabama, according to the automaker’s website.

Toyota Motor Corporation takes a significant step forward in its electrification strategy with the commencement of production at its new $13.9 billion battery plant in Liberty, North Carolina. This facility, the first of its kind for Toyota outside Japan, plays a crucial role in the company’s efforts to enhance its electric vehicle (EV) production capabilities. Designed to produce lithium-ion batteries with an annual capacity of 30 GWh, the plant is poised to support Toyota's growing lineup of hybrid and electric vehicles, aligning with the global automotive industry's shift towards electrification. The establishment of this facility not only reinforces Toyota's commitment to sustainability but also positions the company as a key player in the rapidly evolving EV market.

The Liberty plant is expected to create approximately 5,100 jobs, contributing significantly to the local economy and supporting the workforce in the region. President and CEO of Toyota Motor North America, Ted Ogawa, emphasizes that this investment reflects Toyota's dedication to its workforce, customers, and local communities. Additionally, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy commends the investment for its potential to reshape the Piedmont Triad region’s economy and stimulate job growth. This development aligns with the current administration's efforts to reshore manufacturing and promote economic revitalization, showcasing the broader implications of Toyota's investment beyond its corporate interests.

Toyota’s commitment to electrification extends beyond the Liberty plant. The company has pledged an additional $10 billion in U.S. investments over the next five years, bringing its total commitment in the U.S. to nearly $60 billion since its inception nearly 70 years ago. As part of its comprehensive electrification strategy, Toyota aims to sell 3.5 million electrified vehicles annually by 2030. This ambitious target underlines the company’s proactive approach to securing a competitive edge in the evolving automotive market while addressing environmental concerns. The Liberty facility is a pivotal element of this strategy, enabling Toyota to meet the increasing demand for sustainable transportation solutions.

In addition to its advancements in battery production, Toyota faces scrutiny from significant shareholders regarding governance practices related to a proposed transaction with Toyota Fudosan. Elliott Investment Management, a substantial stakeholder in Toyota Industries Corporation, raises concerns over the potential undervaluation of the company and emphasizes the need for transparency in corporate transactions. This highlights the ongoing challenges that Toyota navigates in balancing shareholder interests with its strategic goals in the rapidly changing automotive landscape.

Overall, Toyota's establishment of the Liberty battery plant marks a transformative moment for the company, reinforcing its leadership in the electrified vehicle market while demonstrating a commitment to sustainable practices and technological innovation.

,Louisiana Environment,2025-11-12 22:11:06+00:00,NOLA.com,A new report card on Louisiana infrastructure is in. The grades aren't good.,"David Mitchell, DAVID J. MITCHELL, Staff, DAVID GRUNFELD, HILARY SCHEINUK",,,,,https://www.nola.com/news/louisiana-infrastructure-roads-bridges/article_5ea54fb5-0087-5219-97ca-72fedf4cebdb.html,"The American Society of Civil Engineers reached this conclusion and rated all state infrastructure with a ""C-"" in its new report card, though roads and drinking water systems were given a ""D"" and bridges a ""D+"" grade.
Grades for Louisiana aviation, coastal areas and drinking water improved compared with the 2017 grades, but the state’s dams, ports and wastewater systems received lower marks.
The report noted that Louisiana has spent $1.62 billion annually to fight coastal erosion on a combined 150 projects to try to protect 2 million coastal residents and oil and gas infrastructure.
In that same time period, the share of bridges rated in ""good condition"" has steadily fallen, pushing the majority of state bridges into ""fair"" condition.
""This trend means the overall condition of bridges continues to decline, reflecting the increasing overall aging of our infrastructure and the need for continual maintenance,"" the report says.","Extreme weather, chronic underfunding and age are conspiring to keep Louisiana's infrastructure falling behind ""current and future needs"" despite recent federal investments, a national engineering society analysis released Wednesday says.

The American Society of Civil Engineers reached this conclusion and rated all state infrastructure with a ""C-"" in its new report card, though roads and drinking water systems were given a ""D"" and bridges a ""D+"" grade.

The overall ""C-"" represents a slight improvement from what the society concluded in its 2017 analysis, but the group said the 2025 grade still means ""Louisiana’s built environment is not keeping pace,"" as infrastructure continues to age and is affected ""by limited resources and increasingly frequent severe weather events.""

The national average was a ""C.""

The society noted that the state has experienced 36 extreme weather events over the past decade that resulted in $200 billion in damages statewide. While the society acknowledged that some areas have made strides, a member of the engineering society argued more needed to be done.

""The people of Louisiana require infrastructure networks that are as resilient as the people they serve, to keep families safe and businesses operational,"" Katherine Castille, an engineer who is the society's Louisiana president, said in a statement Wednesday.

""The improved grade in this report demonstrates the hard work our public and private sectors have done to modernize our built environment, but we know Louisiana is capable of far better than a ‘C-’ when provided additional resources and a dedicated workforce.""

In 2017, the society gave Louisiana a ""D+"" grade.

State highway officials and Gov. Jeff Landry's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

'Need for continual maintenance'

The society analysis detailed in the 140-page report looked at a wide sweep of public and private infrastructure, from the familiar roads and bridges to ports, airports, dams, levees, drinking water and sewage treatment systems, as well as coastal protection work.

Grades for Louisiana aviation, coastal areas and drinking water improved compared with the 2017 grades, but the state’s dams, ports and wastewater systems received lower marks. None was higher than a ""C+"" grade.

Since the 2017 report, Louisiana has been the beneficiary of post-COVID economic stimulus packages under President Biden that have sent $750 million for public water and sewer systems and $5.9 billion for roads and bridges.

Funding, however, remained a problem in all the categories analyzed. The society also concluded that without enough money to go around, the state needed to find a way to be selective and impactful.

In trying to build in greater resiliency to storms, for instance, the society said the state should improve currently lacking data ""that could guide the best use of limited funds.""

The report noted that Louisiana has spent $1.62 billion annually to fight coastal erosion on a combined 150 projects to try to protect 2 million coastal residents and oil and gas infrastructure. But millions of wetland acres still need restoration, with the billions related to the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon spill set to expire in six years.

The state has major road and bridge projects under construction, including improvements on I-10 and at the I-10/I-12 split in Baton Rouge.

But the society pointed out that Louisiana roads and bridges still have a $33 billion maintenance and capital improvement backlog combined, a rising figure affected not only by continuing demands but also by inflated material and other costs over the past several years.

The society noted that 11.5% of Louisiana's nearly 12,700 bridges are rated as being in ""poor"" condition, which is an improvement since 2018 due to maintenance and repair efforts, but the figure is still nearly double the national average.

In that same time period, the share of bridges rated in ""good condition"" has steadily fallen, pushing the majority of state bridges into ""fair"" condition.

""This trend means the overall condition of bridges continues to decline, reflecting the increasing overall aging of our infrastructure and the need for continual maintenance,"" the report says.

Congestion hits drivers

Louisiana highways and bridges rely on a 20-cent-per-gallon state sales tax that has lost two-thirds of its purchasing power since it was last raised in the late 1980s. The state road tax has seen total revenues decline due to greater gasoline engine efficiency and electric vehicles.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/df/adf53a0b-7d57-5767-afbd-2a75a4d6983b/691504a497a65.image.jpg?crop=1732%2C910%2C0%2C59&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-12 18:00:52.433694

This surge is being driven by transport and industrial electrification, heating, cooling, data centers, and rising demand in emerging economies.

The report shows both the opportunities presented by the global energy transition as well as the risks of inaction.

Following is a statement from Taryn Fransen, Director of Global Research and Data, WRI Polsky Center for the Global Energy Transition:

“A clean, reliable, affordable, and abundant energy future is possible – but we need to make smart investments today to get on the right path. The IEA projects rapid growth of electricity demand driven by electric transport, data centers, and air conditioning. Power systems around the world could struggle to keep up – but with the right policies, this challenge could become an opportunity to accelerate the global energy transition.

“Investments in grids are critical. Strengthening and modernizing transmission, distribution and storage will make power systems more reliable and enable clean energy to scale to meet growing demand. Global investment in grids is rising, but more is needed, especially for high-voltage transmission.

“Policymakers and regulators should work with large buyers of electricity – particularly in countries with rapidly growing data centers – to find ways to meet demand without falling back on dirty fuels or driving up costs.

“The clean energy transition depends on critical minerals, but there are risks as countries rush to expand the currently concentrated mining supply chain. Reducing the need for mining through better design and improving recycling and circularity can help manage these risks as we take steps to ensure mining is done responsibly.

“The global energy transition should ensure no one is left behind – from the hundreds of millions of people who still lack electricity and clean cooking to consumers facing rising bills. Policymakers can also embrace new economic opportunities through workforce development and clean energy jobs.

“As world leaders gather at COP30, the choices made today will determine the future of our energy system. Without careful management, households will face higher energy bills, communities and businesses will see more blackouts and emissions will continue to climb. But with the right decisions, we can cut emissions, further unleash the benefits of a booming clean energy sector, and bring reliable, affordable power to households and communities around the world.”",https://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-12 18:00:25.109855

Democrats are expected to oppose the package en masse, though a few centrists may vote for it, despite party leaders whipping against the measure. The House action will be the first time members, who left town while the Senate struggled to pass a stopgap spending bill and curtail the shutdown, have voted since Sept. 19.

House Republican leaders need nearly all of their members to back the deal after the balance of power in the House shifted to 219-214 once Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., swore in Arizona Democratic Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva.

Two GOP lawmakers — Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie and Indiana Rep. Victoria Spartz — voted against the original version of the short-term spending bill when it passed the House in September. Democratic Rep. Jared Golden of Maine voted for that bill, the only member of his party to do so.

The Senate significantly reworked it into what is now a 394-page package, adding in three of the full-year government funding bills and changing the date of the stopgap measure to Jan. 30, among many other provisions. The original stopgap was set to last through Nov. 21.

The change will give Congress a couple more months to work out agreement on the remaining nine appropriations bills that were supposed to become law before the start of the current fiscal year on Oct. 1.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a briefing that Trump “looks forward to finally ending this devastating Democrat shutdown with his signature and we hope that signing will take place later tonight.”

Health care costs

Trump will then turn his attention toward the rising cost of health care that Democrats highlighted during the shutdown, Leavitt said, though she didn’t put a firm timeline on when he’ll release any plans.

“Once the government reopens, the president, as he’s always maintained, is absolutely open to having conversations about health care,” Leavitt said. “And I think you’ll see the president putting forth some really good policy proposals that Democrats should take very seriously to fix, again, the system that they broke.”

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters following a closed-door meeting that Democrats will try to get the necessary signatures on a discharge petition to force a floor vote on legislation to extend tax credits for three years for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

The New York Democrat said the extension mirrors how long the enhanced tax credits were set to last initially in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

Temporary health care subsidies were originally passed as part of the COVID-19-era American Rescue Plan in 2021 for two years. The Inflation Reduction Act, the signature climate policy bill from the Biden administration, then extended those health care subsidies for three years, expiring at the end of December 2025.

“The legislation that we will introduce in the context of a discharge petition will provide that level of certainty to working-class Americans who are on the verge of seeing their premiums, co-pays and deductibles skyrocket,” Jeffries said.

Democrats will need the support of at least a handful of Republicans in order to get the 218 signatures needed to force a vote on the bill. The discharge petition was released mid-afternoon.

Senate floor vote pledged on ACA tax credits

Democrats said for weeks ahead of the Oct. 1 shutdown deadline they wouldn’t provide the support needed to move the House-passed, short-term spending bill over the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster unless GOP leaders negotiated over the ACA tax credits.

Speaker Johnson said those talks wouldn’t happen during a shutdown and referred to it as an end-of-year issue, though he has repeatedly declined to say if he’ll hold a floor vote on the expiring subsidies in the weeks ahead.

Ramifications of the shutdown worsened the longer it went on through flight cancellations, delayed payments to U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrition programs and no pay for federal workers, just to name a few.

Seven centrist Senate Democrats and one independent, concerned about the shutdown’s impact on their constituents, broke with party leaders this weekend to advance the reworked spending package and then voted to approve the legislation Monday.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who said throughout the shutdown he was interested in a bipartisan path forward on health insurance costs after the shutdown ended, committed to hold a floor vote on a Democratic bill “no later than the second week in December.”

What’s in the new bill

The spending package wraps in several different bills and provisions, such as the three full-year funding bills that cover the Agriculture Department, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Legislative Branch, military construction projects and Department of Veterans Affairs.

Included are:

A stopgap spending bill that will keep the rest of the federal government running through Jan. 30;

$30 million for the U.S. Capitol Police to enhance protections for lawmakers, $30 million for the U.S. Marshals Service to bolster security for members of the judicial and executive branches, and $28 million for enhanced safety for Supreme Court justices;

Language requiring the Trump administration to reinstate the thousands of workers it sent layoff notices to during the shutdown and preventing officials from firing those workers through January;

Provisions mandating the Trump administration provide back pay to all federal workers, including those furloughed during the shutdown. Trump at one point during the shutdown had threatened to yank that back pay, though it is required by law.

The Trump administration issued a Statement of Administration Policy a few hours before the House was scheduled to vote, saying the administration strongly supports the bill, describing the measure as “a fiscally responsible package that provides the full-year funding necessary to support the Nation’s veterans, farmers, and rural communities.”

The package also “ends disruptions to programs the American people rely on and ensures the thousands of Federal employees who have been forced to work without a paycheck, such as air traffic controllers, will be promptly paid,” the administration added.

The Agriculture and Military Construction-VA spending bills include tens of billions of dollars in earmarks requested by lawmakers from both political parties, important to them as midterm elections loom in 2026.

Separate vote planned on senators and subpoenas

But not every Republican on Capitol Hill is happy with how the full-year bills turned out.

Speaker Johnson announced mid-afternoon that the House would take a separate vote later this month to remove language from the package that will allow senators to file suit against the federal government if their data is subpoenaed.

“We are putting this legislation on the fast track suspension calendar in the House for next week,” Johnson wrote in a social media post.

The provision, tucked into the full-year Legislative Branch spending bill, is retroactive to January 1, 2022 and would apply to the eight senators who had their cell phone records subpoenaed during a 2023 investigation into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.

The FBI reportedly obtained data for cell phone use between January 4 and January 7, 2021 for Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, as well as Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania.

Congress will likely try to finish work on the remaining nine full-year government spending bills by the Jan. 30 deadline set in the new stopgap spending bill.

Failure to broker a bipartisan deal that can pass both chambers of Congress before that deadline would lead to another government shutdown, though that would be partial and only affect the agencies included in those nine bills.

The announcement was made as Toyota, the world's largest automaker by volume, opened its first overseas plant dedicated to battery production in North Carolina. It aims to bring its cumulative investment total in the United States, a key market, to $60 billion.

Tetsuo Ogawa, president and chief executive officer of a Toyota unit in charge of North America, said the new factory and investment mark a new historical milestone for the company and show its unwavering commitment to local communities, dealers and suppliers.

Toyota invested around $13.9 billion in the new North Carolina factory, which will produce lithium-ion batteries for hybrids, EVs, and plug-in hybrids. The automaker plans to employ up to 5,100 people there.

The move comes after Washington imposed a 15 percent tariff on Japanese car imports in September, down from the 27.5 percent initially set by President Donald Trump. The figure, however, remains six times higher than the 2.5 percent rate that applied before April.

There are certain agencies that are not viewed favorably by President Trump, and they have a significant number of their workforce on furlough.
The Internal Revenue Service, for example, has had only about half of its workforce active through the shutdown.
For workers whose jobs are deemed essential for the nation, it should also be essential they get paid.
The goal of a smaller government is reasonable, with the number of government employees mostly flat over the past half-century.","The current government shutdown is now the longest on record, surpassing the 34-day shutdown during President Trump’s first term. More than 700,000 government employees are on furlough, and not being paid. Those deemed essential have remained on the job, but without a paycheck to show for it.

What the Department of Government Efficiency attempted to do with a sledgehammer, Congress succeeded in doing with gridlock and an unwillingness to compromise.

On the surface, a smaller government workforce appears to be working. But is it really?

Government has two basic functions. It provides services for the population, and it collects data that informs such services. With the government shutdown, both of these functions are compromised.

There are certain agencies that are not viewed favorably by President Trump, and they have a significant number of their workforce on furlough. The Internal Revenue Service, for example, has had only about half of its workforce active through the shutdown. As an organization, they oversee the collection of tax revenue. If such revenue slows, then less money comes into the federal Treasury. Whether the current non-furloughed employees are sufficient to fulfil their mission remains to be seen.

The Environmental Protection Agency has around 90 percent of its workforce on furlough, effectively bringing all of its research and data collection activities to a standstill. NASA has also seen more than 80 percent of its workforce furloughed. Both of these agencies play an active role in monitoring factors that relate to the environment. Given that Trump believes climate change is a “con job,” starving these agencies of human capital is something he most likely enjoys.

The Department of Commerce has about 80 percent of its workforce on furlough. This, too, is not surprising, since it is a highly data-centric unit within the government. It contains the Bureau of Economic Analysis and International Trade Administration, both of which are equipped to collect data that exposes flaws in the president’s tariff policies.

The U.S. Census Bureau, also housed within the Department of Commerce, collects and analyzes data that capture the economic condition and societal metrics of the nation. It is also responsible for overseeing the decennial census and apportionment, which determines which states gain or lose House seats — something Trump is keenly interested in.

The Department of Labor has more than three-quarters of its workforce on furlough. It contains the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects data surrounding the labor force and the economy, exposing potential flaws in the president’s economic agenda. The firing of its commissioner back in August indicated the president’s interest in suppressing such data.

Though essential workers like Transportation Security Administration officers and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers continue to show up for work, the fact that they are not being paid is de facto slave labor for the government. For workers whose jobs are deemed essential for the nation, it should also be essential they get paid. The forced reduction in flights by the secretary of Transportation will cost the airlines and the government billions of dollars in lost revenue.

Yes, the country continues to function. But is the level of function during this shutdown making the nation better? Ruptures in the foundation of our nation may not be visible for quite some time. And any time data is being suppressed by not being collected, or tasks that contribute to the stability of the nation are not being executed, we as nation are weaker for it.

The goal of a smaller government is reasonable, with the number of government employees mostly flat over the past half-century. Yet, the U.S. population has grown by around 10 percent on average per decade over this time period. This means that the number of people served per government employee has grown over time. Thus, the government has already been shrinking for many years. With the proliferation of technology and the growth of artificial intelligence, there is every reason to believe that this downward trend will continue.

The government shutdown may give the illusion that workers on furlough are not needed. Undoubtedly, some of these people are expendable. The challenge is identifying who they are, as would also be the case in the private sector. Attrition over time can organically address this issue.

Indeed, the tasks that federal workers perform, the services they provide, and the data they collect are all vital to keep the foundation of our nation strong and safe, both today and into the future. Over time, this shutdown will provide evidence to support this statement, as the carnage left in its wake is assessed.

TAGANGA, Colombia – On Colombia's Caribbean coast, a fishing village lies in a cove where green hills meet the turquoise sea.

A few years ago, oil companies found natural gas off the coast and now plan to drill Colombia's deepest gas wells there.

It's been more than a century since Colombia began drilling for petroleum. But the country's president, Gustavo Petro, wants these wells off the coast to be among Colombia's last.

Petro is one of the world's most outspoken leaders on the need for urgent climate action. Key to his administration's climate agenda is transitioning the country away from fossil fuels, the single-biggest driver of global warming.

In 2023, Petro pledged to stop approving new exploration contracts for oil, gas, and coal. On the world stage, this was a big deal. Colombia is the biggest coal producer in South America and one of the region's largest oil producers. Scientists say that to reach global climate targets, some fossil fuel producers will have to leave oil, gas and coal in the ground. Stopping new fossil fuel exploration is a pivotal step.

Now the question is: how is Colombia's energy transition going?

When it comes to growing its renewable energy sector, the country has made progress, says Margarita Nieves Zárate, director of the Colombian Offshore Wind Research Network, a research group. Meanwhile Colombia's government oil company, Ecopetrol, is continuing its multi-year strategy of diversifying away from oil.

But Colombia's energy transition has also faced obstacles - some external, and some of Petro's own making, says Ana Carolina González Espinosa, senior director at the nonprofit Natural Resource Governance Institute. While Colombia has become a global poster child for saying no to fossil fuels, it isn't such a simple story, González Espinosa says.

""I remember the international community, and especially the climate community, clapping,"" she says. ""But maybe they didn't look at all of the challenges that this government would have to overcome.""

""It is not a happy story, it is not a sad story, it's just a real story,"" she says.

Why Colombia is doing this

Many in Colombia's government see the transition away from fossil fuels not just as good for the climate, but as a prudent economic strategy.

Colombia is not a petrostate with extreme reliance on fossil fuels like its neighbor, Venezuela, is. It has manufacturing and tech industries, agriculture, and a growing tourism sector.

But the oil and coal industries are still critical sources of taxes and export revenues. Demand for fossil fuels is expected to fall over time with the global energy transition, and that poses serious risks for the country, according to a study from insurance broker WTW and the Universidad de los Andes. The study found that if Colombia is too slow in transitioning away from fossil fuels it could face lost economic output equivalent to around 27% of its GDP between now and 2050.

Also, Colombia's oil sector isn't very competitive compared to some regional neighbors, says Guy Edwards, who researches Colombia's energy transition at the University of Sussex. He points to Colombia's declining oil reserves, and how – even before Petro pledged not to award new oil and gas exploration contracts – the country wasn't seen as a great place to find oil. A recent oil industry bright spot was the major gas discovery in the Caribbean, but it's deep and expensive to develop.

"" If we don't think about how to diversify the economy,"" González Espinosa says, ""then we are going to be in trouble.""

Today Colombia's national oil company, Ecopetrol, is diversifying, says Julián Lemos, corporate vice president of strategy and new business at Ecopetrol.

The year before Petro took office, the company acquired an electricity transmission company. In recent years, they've acquired more solar and wind projects. And they're investing in geothermal energy, drilling deep into the earth to create electricity.

""The hydrocarbon business will remain as part of our company,"" Lemos says, ""but we will gradually increase the participation of businesses that are not related to crude oil, such as renewable power, transmission.""

""We need to, as a company, be prepared to lead the country in the transformation of our fuel system. And in the transformation of our energy supply matrix.""

Renewable progress and failures

A key part of Colombia's transition away from fossil fuels is growing the renewable energy sector. Much of that growth has come from solar, says Andrés Camacho, the former minister of mines and energy under Petro.

Solar made up around 9% of the country's total installed power capacity in 2024, according to data from XM, Colombia's electricity market operator. That's up from roughly 1.5% in 2022.

Petro's government has introduced something called ""energy communities,"" funding solar and battery projects for Colombian communities that lack regular electricity. The government is trying to attract international financing for some of these community-scale renewable projects. And the government recently streamlined the environmental licensing process for solar making it more efficient, says Manuel Schulte, chief executive of Colombian renewable developer Colibri Energy.

But Colombia's renewable energy sector has faced challenges. In some parts of Colombia the grid still isn't big enough to handle many of the new renewable projects. And many of Colombia's big wind, solar and transmission projects are on land belonging to indigenous communities. The government and private sector still haven't done enough to involve indigenous groups in planning, Nieves Zárate, the renewable energy researcher, says.

Struggles with local communities are among the reasons why some foreign investors have given up on renewable projects, particularly wind projects. The national oil company, Ecopetrol, has acquired some of these abandoned wind projects.

Losing the messaging fight

Petro's energy transition policies haven't been popular with many Colombians. According to Susana Muhamad, former environment minister in Petro's cabinet, the government often encountered the ""myth,"" she says, that the country's energy transition ""will be an economic hindrance.""

"" The opposite,"" Muhamad says. ""What we see is that making [an energy transition] that is planned will be economically beneficial.""

Edwards says a lot of opposition to Petro's energy transition agenda was stirred up in the Colombian press. His research finds several Colombian newspapers and magazines have mostly framed the pledge not to award new oil and gas contracts as ""disastrous for the Colombian economy.""

Still, González Espinosa thinks Petro's government fumbled the ball on messaging. She says the government didn't focus enough on the local benefits of the energy transition, like how it will help the Colombian economy, and the health advantages of moving away from fossil fuels.

"" They didn't resonate with the national audience,"" González Espinosa says in an email. ""It was all about climate and that argument is not always very easy to sell without connecting it to local realities.""

Looking to the future

Petro's term ends in 2026. Looming over next year's election is a question: Will Petro's policies around stopping fossil fuel expansion outlast his administration?

Colombia's president is a vocal opponent of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a type of oil and gas extraction. Many of the presidential candidates have indicated they'll authorize fracking. While Petro's government has put forward legislation in congress to ban fracking, they haven't been able to get it to a vote.

As for Petro's pledge to stop awarding new exploration contracts for oil, gas, and coal, Estefanny Pardo, mining attorney at Holland & Knight, says a right wing government could reverse it.

""The current government has made a mistake, which is that instead of processing everything as a law to be approved by the congress of the republic, they have issued their own decrees and resolutions that could be repealed or changed by the next government,"" Pardo says in Spanish.

An upcoming conference

Andrés Gómez is Latin America coordinator of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation treaty, an initiative to make a global treaty to phase out fossil fuels. Colombia was one of the first oil-producing countries to join the movement in 2023.

Modeled after treaties to stop nuclear proliferation and landmines, the goal is to create a binding international agreement to stop expanding fossil fuel production.

Next spring, before the country's presidential election, Colombia will host the first international conference for the phase-out of fossil fuels.

If the upcoming conference marks the formal beginning of the treaty-making process, Gómez says in Spanish the incoming Colombian government may still be interested in seeing it through.

""Steps are being taken that have never been taken before.""

The land trusts will purchase new conservation easements that will protect air and water quality, preserve wildlife habitat and biodiversity, support sustainable forest management, and increase outdoor recreation opportunities for the public.

“Under Governor Hochul’s leadership, DEC continues to protect forests and bolster climate resiliency, quality of life for all communities, and the economy,” said Commissioner Lefton. “With approximately 73 percent of New York State’s forests being privately owned, this $1.72 million in FCELT Grant Program funding will help landowners keep their forests as forests and maintain working forest landscapes. Through partnerships with land trusts and dedicated landowners, we’re adding protections that keep trees standing, wildlife thriving, watersheds intact, and communities resilient.”

The grants, administered by the Land Trust Alliance in partnership with DEC, were made available through the Forest Conservation Easements for Land Trusts (FCELT) Grant Program and contribute to the State’s goal of conserving 30 percent of New York’s lands and waters by 2030. These grants are intended to provide community benefits, advance ecosystem benefits and climate resilience, and work towards goals identified in the New York State Open Space Plan, the New York State Wildlife Action Plan, the New York State Forest Action Plan, and/or other local, regional or statewide land protection plans. Environmental justice and climate resilience are key components for project selection.

New York Senior Program Manager for the Land Trust Alliance Jamie Brown said, ""Protecting forests offers so many benefits to all New Yorkers. The FCELT Grant Program is a vital tool that assists land trusts to do this important work. We are grateful to the State’s support and leadership in protecting our natural resources and important places.”

COAST20 was selected for an award to be partially funded by the US Department of Energy. The programme includes design of a 20,000-tonne liquefied CO2 tank vessel which will be the first built in the United States, the Port Tampa Bay intermodal hub site collecting captured CO2 from emitters across Florida, and the LBC receiving port on the Mississippi River near Baton Rouge, adjacent to an existing dedicated CO2 pipeline system for delivery to permanent underground storage sites. Port Tampa Bay and LBC are partners in the COAST20 project.

Knut Egil Pedersen, vice president of hydrogen and CO2 at Aker Solutions, expressed excitement about bringing pioneering expertise in designing and building CO2 terminals and first-of-their-kind carbon removal projects to Florida. He stated that having advised on optimised solutions in early development phases, Entr will now execute these in a cost-effective, industrialised project environment, combining North American team expertise with global experience to support safe processing, storage, and transport of CO2 from Tampa Bay to Louisiana.

Jeffrey Ross Williams, president of Aptamus, stated that Aptamus has strategically expanded capabilities to offer Florida’s largest CO2 emitters a supply chain solution for safe and efficient removal of captured CO2 from the state. He characterised Entr’s development of the Port Tampa Bay hub and LBC Tank Terminals site as offering the ideal solution for managing captured CO2 in Florida. Williams noted that COAST20 will allow power generation companies to meet increasing electricity demand in Florida whilst managing carbon output to meaningfully impact the environment and human health.

The COAST20 programme addresses emerging requirements for CO2 transport and storage infrastructure supporting carbon capture deployment. Florida’s CO2 emitters lack proximate geological storage formations suitable for permanent sequestration, necessitating transport solutions connecting emission sources with suitable Gulf Coast storage sites.

The maritime transport approach utilises purpose-built liquefied CO2 carriers connecting Florida collection points with Louisiana delivery terminals adjacent to existing CO2 pipeline infrastructure. Port Tampa Bay serves as collection hub enabling aggregation of CO2 from multiple Florida sources, with temporary storage and liquefaction processing preparing CO2 for ship loading.

LBC Tank Terminals’ Baton Rouge location provides strategic positioning on the Mississippi River with existing liquid bulk storage infrastructure and proximity to established CO2 pipeline systems. The discharge and regasification terminal will receive liquefied CO2 from vessels, return it to a gaseous phase, and inject it into pipelines for delivery to permanent storage sites.

US Department of Energy funding support reflects federal policy priorities for carbon capture, utilisation, and storage infrastructure development. Aker Solutions’ experience in CO2 handling infrastructure from North Sea projects provides relevant technical expertise for COAST20.

FEED work establishes detailed technical specifications, equipment selections, process designs, safety systems, and cost estimates supporting final investment decisions. The project exemplifies emerging carbon management infrastructure connecting emission sources lacking proximate storage with suitable geological formations via multimodal transport, potentially establishing models for similar regional approaches addressing commercial-scale CCS deployment requirements.",https://tankterminals.com/wp-content/themes/tankterminals/src/img/favicon/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-12 21:01:22.018519

That could spell the end for North Carolina’s booming businesses that sell the intoxicating products.

Over the past five years, stores selling hemp-derived products have flourished, selling products like smokable THC-A flower, gummies, candy and drinks infused with THC. Some businesses have billboards along interstates.

The products contain Delta-8 and THC-A, which are close derivatives of Delta-9 THC, the chemical in marijuana that gets you high.

Matt Mitchell, owner of Hemp and Barrel in Pineville, has a wide array of products on display.

“This will be all our flowers,” he said, pointing to plants kept behind a glass case. On the wall, the store has a board showing the percentage of THC-A contained in each product. When eaten, THC-A has no effect. But when burned, it converts to regular Delta 9 THC, and has the same effects you would get from smoking pot. The cigarettes produce a high just like a joint — and it's legal.

Mitchell continues the tour.

“Here’s your CBD, your concentrates,” he said. “Pet stuff over here. Tea. Topicals. Edibles. Chocolate. Gummies.”

Mitchell has been in business for six years, but the upcoming year could be his last.

The Senate continuing resolution that funds the government would also revamp the 2018 Farm Bill. One provision in that earlier law allowed for a proliferation of hemp-derived products that are being sold in places where marijuana is still illegal, like North Carolina, Texas, Georgia and Wisconsin.

The new restrictions would take effect in a year, severely limiting the amount of THC-like chemicals in products and effectively outlawing the dried plants, edibles and other items in his shop.

“It would shut everything down,” he said. “There’s just no way to get [my products] to that level. It just wouldn’t be beneficial.”

Phil Dixon with the UNC School of Government is an expert on North Carolina’s hemp industry, which he has called the “Wild West.” The General Assembly has debated bills to regulate the market, but hasn’t approved any.

Now, Congress could be doing their work for them, Dixon said.

“It would be a big change on the federal definition of hemp and it would vastly constrict the industry if not effectively shutting it down altogether,” he said.

That wouldn’t just affect the THC-selling stores such as CannaBuddy, Blue Flowers and Apotheca that have become ubiquitous. It also would mean pulling products from stores big and small, from gas stations to major retailers like Total Wine that sell THC-infused drinks.

The Trump administration has said it approves of the new regulations.

On Monday, Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, pleaded unsuccessfully with his colleagues to remove the provision. Kentucky is a large hemp-producing state.

“Instead of a clean CR, this bill contains language that has been air-dropped that will destroy hemp farming and the United States,” he said on the Senate floor.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2b8506e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/818x429+0+25/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F99%2Fce%2Fd41c97b741e29921c1164c4a2e73%2Fhemp-barrell.png,N,,2025-11-12 19:59:05.114481

PMI warns of skills gap; 2.1M project managers needed for transition by 2035

African governments and industries must make major investments in renewable energy manufacturing and deployment. According to George Asamani, the Project Management Institute’s (PMI) regional director for Sub-Saharan Africa, such efforts could unlock millions of new jobs.

In an analysis published Thursday, November 6, on Engineering News, Asamani said that up to 30 million new green jobs could be created by 2030, but that will depend on local production and technical training.

To meet this challenge, Asamani noted that African universities and technical institutes are steadily adapting to the needs of the energy transition. In Nigeria, petroleum and gas engineers are being retrained for solar energy and energy efficiency roles. Similar initiatives are expanding across the continent. In Kenya, geothermal energy is creating new opportunities for former thermal technicians. Programs in Rwanda, Morocco, and Ghana are reorienting fossil fuel engineers toward hydropower, wind, and hybrid projects. These efforts aim to build a talent pool capable of driving the deployment of renewable energy while retraining workers from legacy industries.

Urgency to Act

Asamani emphasized that Africa must move quickly to address its energy transition challenges. The continent still has 600 million people without access to electricity, while coal remains a cheap and reliable source of power, highlighting a stark paradox. South Africa illustrates this clearly. Research from the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) shows that nearly 100,000 coal miners and power plant workers risk losing their jobs as mines close. The SARB noted that their mostly semi-skilled profiles rarely align with the demands of renewable energy projects.

According to PMI’s Talent Gap Report 2025-2035, between 1.6 million and 2.1 million additional project management professionals will be needed by 2035 to support transition infrastructure and technologies, representing a 75 percent increase over current levels. The report also estimates that 10 percent of global project investments are lost annually due to poor performance, an inefficiency especially costly for Africa’s infrastructure portfolio.

Asamani’s warning comes amid high youth unemployment across Africa. The International Labour Organization (ILO) reported that nearly 62 million young people in Sub-Saharan Africa were not in employment, education, or training in 2023, representing more than a quarter of the region’s youth population. Among those who are employed, nearly three-quarters hold precarious jobs, often informal or low-skilled.",https://www.ecofinagency.com/media/k2/items/cache/0915b09c6ab1f1fe19371d9e00de18da_S.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 19:58:41.510647

First promulgated in 2023, the PFAS Reporting Rule in its current form is wide-sweeping, applying to all companies that domestically manufactured PFAS or imported PFAS-containing items during 2011-2022. The current rule includes essentially no exemptions, and now EPA is proposing to change that.

EPA’s proposal would incorporate exemptions for imported articles; de minimis concentrations of PFAS at 0.1% or lower; byproducts, impurities, and non-isolated intermediates; and for research and development (R&D). EPA is also proposing certain clarifications, technical corrections, and to key the submission period to the effective date of the finalized revisions. The most prominent of these proposed revisions is the imported articles exemption, which would remove from the rule’s scope the large majority of companies subject to the regulation in its current form. Affected stakeholders should consider submitting public comments on the proposed revisions, and these comments will be due 45 days after the proposed revisions are published in the Federal Register.

Background

EPA first finalized the PFAS Reporting Rule (40 C.F.R. Part 705) in October 2023 pursuant to Section 8(a)(7) of TSCA, which was added to TSCA by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020. Section 8(a)(7) requires EPA to promulgate a reporting rule applicable to “each person who has manufactured a chemical substance that is a [PFAS] in any year since January 1, 2011.” EPA applied Section 8(a)(7) through the October 2023 rule to impose a one-time reporting requirement on all companies that manufactured PFAS between 2011 and 2022 or that imported PFAS in any amount during that period (even in articles). EPA has since delayed the submission period for this rule twice, and that submission period is currently set to open on April 13, 2026, and close (for most manufacturers) on October 13, 2026.

As explained in our previous alert, EPA’s proposed revisions to this rule are not completely unexpected. EPA under the Trump administration has previously indicated that revisions were on the horizon, including through an April 28, 2025 press release where EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin committed the agency to implementing TSCA section 8(a)(7) “to smartly collect necessary information, as Congress envisioned and consistent with TSCA, without overburdening small businesses and article importers.”

The Proposed Exemptions

EPA is proposing to add exemptions to the rule for the following:

Imported articles. “Article” is defined in the rule at 40 C.F.R. § 705.3 and can generally be described as a finished good or component thereof with a definitive shape or design. EPA justified this exemption in the preamble by explaining that article importers are unlikely to have known or reasonably ascertainable information about the PFAS in the articles they imported during the lookback period. EPA also reasoned that Congress did not intend Section 8(a)(7) to apply to article importers and that the agency will nevertheless receive information on PFAS in articles by upstream PFAS manufacturers who will still be required to report under the rule.

De minimis PFAS concentrations. EPA explained in the preamble that the agency is “proposing a de minimis concentration exemption for reportable PFAS in mixtures or articles under which PFAS concentrations below 0.1% would be exempt from reporting.” EPA reasoned in the preamble that this exemption is justified in part because, during the lookback period, “reporters are unlikely to have records of PFAS amounts below 0.1% due to U.S. and international requirements at the time.” EPA also noted that the agency is interested in comments on whether a 1.0% de minimis exemption or another de minimis level would be more appropriate.

Byproducts, impurities, and non-isolated intermediates. EPA explained in the preamble that these exemptions would “align with existing exemptions under TSCA for substances not manufactured and used for a separate commercial purpose and is consistent with the approach taken in EPA’s [Chemical Data Reporting] rule.”

R&D chemicals. This exemption would apply to PFAS manufactured solely for R&D purposes. EPA explained in the preamble that this exemption is justified since “information on PFAS manufactured solely for R&D purposes would be limited and would provide minimal information regarding PFAS exposures and quantities in commerce.”

EPA also offered other justifications for the revisions in the preamble, including how TSCA Section 8(a)(5)(A)-(C) directs EPA, to the extent feasible, to not require unnecessary or duplicative reporting, minimize compliance costs on small manufacturers, and apply reporting obligations only to companies likely to have information relevant to the effective implementation of TSCA. EPA likewise pointed to TSCA Section 2(c), which directs EPA to carry out TSCA “in a reasonable and prudent manner” and to “consider the environmental, economic, and social impact of any action.”

Proposed Revision to the Submission Period, Clarifications and Technical Corrections

EPA is proposing that the submission period begin 60 days after the effective date of the finalized revisions and then last for three months. As EPA explained in the preamble, this revision to the submission period will “allow[] reporters to familiarize themselves with the amended rule and ensure their data are responsive to the amended rule and EPA to modify the reporting application as needed.”

EPA is also proposing a few clarifications and technical corrections to the rule, including for the scope of environmental health effects information that must be reported and the consumer and commercial product categories to be used for reporting purposes.

EPA Requests for Comment

In addition to public comments on the revisions mentioned above, EPA is soliciting comments on the following questions:

Should EPA amend the scope of reportable chemicals? For instance, EPA indicated in the preamble that the agency is receptive to feedback on the possibility of limiting reporting to PFAS with Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Numbers (CASRNs) and adding a production-volume threshold to the rule.

Should EPA modify any assumptions or cost savings calculations in its Economic Analysis? For instance, in the preamble, EPA estimated that a certain percentage of industry costs has already been accrued in preparation for reporting under the October 2023 rule. EPA is seeking comments on these types of assumptions, including sunk cost estimates.

Upon publication of the proposed revisions in the Federal Register, EPA will accept comments on the proposed changes for 45 days. Given that the impact of the proposed revisions will span across industries – especially for article importers – all affected stakeholders are encouraged to comment.",https://www.bdlaw.com/content/uploads/2024/10/Diamond-Only-Web-Size-default-social-share-social-sharing-image-23338.png,N,,2025-11-12 21:01:04.905961

The overlap of clean energy and innovation is becoming more evident every day.","There’s a YouTube video I’m embarrassed to admit I’ve watched one too many times. It’s a compilation of cuts from President Trump’s first term of him saying the word “China.”

As it reveals, he says the word a lot. Normally in a mocking tone, sometimes threatening, and often derisive. In fact, Trump’s main nemesis throughout his two presidencies has been the world’s second most populous country.

He’s blasted China for what he’s characterized as bad trade deals and blamed the country for ruining the United States’ steel, manufacturing, and auto industries. More recently, Trump blamed China for profiting disproportionally from global free trade and instituted significant tariffs that escalated into a game of trade-war chicken.

But for all of his strong-arming with the country, Trump isn’t trying to compete with China on a key area where they’ve come out far ahead globally–clean energy.

China currently produces over 80% of the world’s solar panels. It surpassed Tesla as the leading producer of electric vehicles in 2023 and is now responsible for producing more than 70% of the global EV market. After vowing in 2021 to end (with some veracity) new overseas coal projects, China invested heavily in clean-energy projects in more than 50 countries. The country now has the most new nuclear power plants under construction, and dominates the market for rare earth metals—an important component of battery storage.

China, like the U.S., signed the international Paris Climate Agreement 10 years ago in a commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

The U.S., by comparison, removed itself from the agreement twice: both times under Trump. While former President Joe Biden championed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, intending to boost U.S. manufacturing in clean energy and an investment in clean-tech jobs, Trump pushed Congress this year to shrink those initiatives.

At the U.N. General Assembly this past September, Trump called climate change a “con job,” and pressured diplomats at the White House last month to table plans to create a global shipping climate tax. The U.S. is now re-embracing fossil fuels, announcing executive orders focused on expanding natural gas drilling and opening up more offshore oil exploration. This is happening at the same time offshore wind projects are halted, solar grants ended, and electric vehicle subsidies pulled.

With COP30 as the backdrop, China—once considered a climate boogeyman as the source of the largest share of annual greenhouse gas emissions—is now demonstrating an incredible investment in clean energy technologies while situating itself as a global leader on the green transition … just as the U.S. is turning away.

China is far from a perfect leader when it comes to climate commitments. For one, its motives aren’t humanitarian, nor apologetic: They’re economical.

In a Yale Environment 360 analysis, Isabel Hilton writes:

“There are many ways to judge climate leadership: They include the quality and consistency of policy, the speed and effectiveness of carbon reduction, and the role a country plays in the global effort, including in support to less developed countries.

When China became the biggest carbon emitter by volume in 2005, its leadership did not contest the science. Importantly, they understood climate change as a severe threat but also as an enormous industrial opportunity. If the world needed to transition away from fossil fuels and towards clean energy, China resolved to be the supplier of the enabling goods and technologies.”

China is now leading where more traditional climate champions—namely, the most industrialized nations—are faltering.

Instead of sending delegates to COP30, the White House sent Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to a different conference.

The two flew last week to Athens, Greece, to promote fossil fuels. “There is no energy transition—there is just energy addition,” Burgum told reporters there.

The European Union also scaled back its leadership capacity on climate initiatives, as several member countries faced tough elections with populist parties championing fossil fuels. The EU further disappointed environmentalists after softening an anti-deforestation law and moving to push its start date. The EU also failed to finalize its own climate-mitigation targets by COP’s September 30 deadline.

It’s part of a trend that André Corrêa do Lago, the president of this year’s COP and a Brazilian diplomat, framed as the wealthiest global countries losing interest in climate change.

Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping told delegates at the U.N. General Assembly in September that the “green and low-carbon transition is the trend of our time.” The focus is already giving China wins: A new study found that China’s CO2 emissions have been flat or falling for 18 months, thanks in part to its “rapid adoption of electric vehicles.”

China’s investment in renewable energy also helps other countries approach their own climate targets.

As Somini Sengupta and Brad Plumer write for The New York Times:

“Having saturated its own market with solar panels, wind turbines and batteries, Chinese companies are now exporting their wares to energy-hungry countries in the developing world. What’s more, they’re investing billions of dollars in factories that make things like solar panels in Vietnam and electric cars in Brazil.”

“China is coming up with solutions that are for everyone, not just China,” Corrêa do Lago told The Guardian. “Solar panels are cheaper, they’re so competitive [compared with fossil fuel energy] that they are everywhere now.”

Newsom was blunt when he said how China’s dominance looked for the U.S.:

“The United States of America is as dumb as we want to be on this topic,” he told Reuters in Belem, adding that Republicans were letting China take ownership of the growing market and that the country “will dominate in the next great global industry.”

During Trump’s recent Asia trip, he signed a flurry of deals with countries that indicate the U.S. is jockeying for a stronger hold on rare earth minerals to stay competitive in electricity and tech innovation—to say nothing of the materials required for expanding renewable energy capabilities, such as solar or wind.

While climate change might be a backburner issue for some developed nations, electricity capacity is not. With the rise of AI and data centers and the subsequent battle of tech giants to come out on top, there’s a projected global energy rush.

The overlap of clean energy and innovation is becoming more evident every day. The economic and business opportunities around embracing renewable energy are what former Secretary of State John Kerry says could be what brings the U.S. back to the table on climate.

Kerry told NPR:

What I’m banking on is showing people that the transition to a clean energy economy is, in fact, the greatest economic opportunity the world has ever known. There are 8 billion people who want electricity, need electricity in the world today—1 billion of them actually don’t have it yet—and it’s going to go up to 10 billion in the next 20 or 30 years. So that’s a huge marketplace … And by the way, the best of capitalism—you can make a lot of money as that transition is implemented.

Time will tell whether that potential money speaks to the White House.

While there’s been progress at past COP conferences, it hasn’t been enough to slow down the impacts of greenhouse gases. Going into this year’s meeting, some modeling shows that the world is already likely to blow past the Paris Agreement’s target, projecting the globe to warm between 2.3-3.4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial averages by the end of the century.

During opening remarks on Monday, Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said the world needed a roadmap to “overcome” fossil fuel dependence.

Here’s what could be on the table:

● A forest fund: Brazil wants a major focus on this year’s meeting to be a plan that protects the Amazon rainforest. The country aims to create a multibillion-dollar fund that would pay countries to keep their forests intact at around $1.60 per acre.

● Climate finance: Leaders last year set a target, called a New Collective Quantified Goal, to deliver at least $300 billion annually for developing countries to partake in climate action by 2035. This year’s COP kicked off with a roadmap target that increases funds to $1.3 trillion, in part by increasing taxes on polluting activities.

● Adaptation: Another area of focus will be a sobering one: preparing the world for the impacts of climate change through adaptation. The U.N.’s environmental arm released an Adaptation Gap Report this year that found the private sector could provide around $50 billion annually in adaptation finance, if backed by policy. Delegates are working toward codifying “indicators” of adaptation from a list of 10,000 different options and eventually creating a global adaptation scorecard.",https://atmos.earth/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1237358959_hor-1280x720.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 17:00:11.229800

Sign up for our free newsletters.

HARRISBURG — Environmental advocates and a handful of Democratic lawmakers are lambasting legislative leaders for agreeing to pull Pennsylvania out of an interstate cap-and-trade program as a part of the state’s long-awaited $50.1 billion budget.

The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) would have capped the amount of carbon that companies in Pennsylvania are allowed to emit. Lawmakers and advocates who spoke with Spotlight PA said pulling out was a major capitulation to state Senate Republicans that leaves the commonwealth without a clear path forward to combat climate change.

Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf directed the state to join the initiative in 2019 through an executive order. However, litigation from Republican lawmakers and energy producers prevented the state from participating in the program. A case is currently pending before the state Supreme Court.

Molly Parzen, executive director of environmental advocacy group Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, called leaving RGGI a “devastating, self-inflicted setback in addressing affordability, clean energy, and pollution.”

“Their capitulation means that Pennsylvanians will now be robbed of more than $1 billion annually to lower electricity prices through investments in clean energy,” Parzen said in a statement, referencing the potential revenue that would have been funneled to the state.

Republicans have long criticized the program, saying that it would stymie the state’s powerful energy industry and raise consumer bills at a time of increasing costs.

Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro has been vocally skeptical of the program since he announced his run for governor in 2021. He introduced his own state-based alternative to RGGI as legislation that would require GOP support.

However, state Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R., Indiana) previously told Spotlight PA that he would not move on any energy policy as long as the state was still in RGGI.

Language pulling Pennsylvania out of RGGI was included in the budget-enabling fiscal code bill. It passed the state House 189-14 and the state Senate 43-6.

State Rep. Greg Vitali (D., Delaware), a longtime environmental advocate and chair of the Environmental and Natural Resource Protection Committee, voted no.

“Democrats and the governor have ceded to this, along with other environmental asks, as a way of coming to a budget agreement and getting other things they deem important,” Vitali told Spotlight PA.

Vitali called RGGI the “only serious thing” that the legislature could have done to address climate change, calling Shapiro’s policy plan “dead on arrival” in the state Senate.

“This is our one opportunity, even though this was an uncertain opportunity. And unfortunately, we are caving in,” Vitali said.

The budget does include an additional $25 million for a popular grant program that provides schools with money to install solar panels and authorizes the spending of federal funding for solar panel construction.

Still, Vitali called those provisions “minuscule” compared to RGGI’s impact.

State Sen. Carolyn Comitta (D., Chester), the minority chair of the chamber’s Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, voted for the bill, despite her concerns regarding “taking RGGI off the table.”

Instead, she called on the legislature to pass Shapiro’s energy plan, which would create a state-level cap-and-trade program and increase renewable energy usage requirements for utilities.

“I fought for RGGI for years. I support RGGI. I still think RGGI would be a good idea for Pennsylvania,” Comitta said on the floor of the state Senate on Wednesday. “But I’m also realistic, and I’m willing to vote yes to end this impasse.”

Atlanta is one of 81 metro areas and 45 states that received funding from the federal Environmental Protection Agency to develop comprehensive climate action plans.

The plan features 24 measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across a range of sectors, including transportation, industry, residential and commercial buildings, energy, waste & materials, and trees & greenspaces.

These measures include:

Encouraging fleet transitions to electric vehicles

Providing more options for people to walk, bike, or take public transportation

Making buildings more energy efficient

Increasing use of renewable energy sources

Protecting and restoring natural lands.

“This landmark plan will help build our region’s resilience to extreme weather events, like intense storms, flooding, heat waves, and droughts,” said Anna Roach, ARC’s Executive Director & CEO. “We know that action is needed to better prepare our region. The Metro Atlanta Climate Action Plan provides strategic options for local governments, businesses, and residents throughout the region to consider that can make a real difference.”

For next steps, ARC will be engaging organizations across the region to help move this plan toward action and implementation. Activities may include a MACAP “roadshow” to inform stakeholders and the general public and sector-focused training seminars. ARC may also consider incorporating policy recommendations into future regional planning efforts.

ARC developed the plan with feedback from a series of online stakeholder webinars, one-on-one conversations with stakeholders, existing community events, and online surveys.

The plan builds on existing climate-related work of ARC, including the Green Communities program, Livable Centers Initiative, and the ongoing transportation planning and policy work undertaken by ARC.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in August urged engine and equipment manufacturers to revise system software to prevent sudden loss of power from engine derates related to aftertreatment problems. The Cold Weather Diesel Reliability Act of 2025, co-sponsored by Republican Senators Dan Sullivan (Alaska) and Cynthia Lummis (Wyoming), however, hones in Arctic temps at which diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) is known to freeze.

The Senators contend that automatic engine shutdowns and power reductions due to emissions control malfunctions in extreme cold pose ""serious, life-threatening risk,"" and that DEF systems are ""frequently unreliable and logistically impractical"" in prolonged freezing conditions.

The bill does not waive compliance with any emissions standards under the Clean Air Act yet contends that ""emissions safeguards under the Clean Air Act were never intended to jeopardize human safety or impede critical mobility,"" the bill reads.

The bill, which would apply to on- and off-highway diesel vehicles and equipment, outlines two primary mandates for the EPA, each to be enacted within 180 days of the bill's passage.

Temporary cold weather mitigation

The EPA would be required to revise regulations to allow manufacturers to suspend engine derate or shutdown functions. This temporary mode would be allowed when an emissions control fault is triggered at or below freezing (0°C/32°F).

This function would only be authorized if ""continued maximum engine performance... is necessary to prevent occupational danger, equipment failure, or loss of essential transportation functionality in remote areas.""

The engine must return to normal emission control operation once temperatures rise above freezing.

Regional exemption

The bill also grants a year-round exemption from DEF system requirements for specific vehicles – ""primarily operated north of 59 degrees north latitude"" or those that encounter operational conditions where prolonged low temperatures make using the DEF system ""impractical."" The area north of 59 degrees north latitude is primarily Alaska.

BEAVER DAM, WI. NOV. 12, 2024 – Gov. Tony Evers, company leaders, and state and local partners announced today that Meta is investing more than $1 billion in an artificial-intelligence-optimized data center campus located in Beaver Dam.

“Wisconsin is a leader when it comes to biohealth and advanced manufacturing industries, and we’re excited to keep building upon this tradition as we become the home to new world-changing technology,” said Gov. Evers. “This investment will help ensure Wisconsin is meeting the demands of the 21st Century and creating good, family-supporting jobs to support the workforce in the Beaver Dam community and across the greater region. Wisconsin must stay one step ahead in harnessing AI technologies to remain a national and international leader in this work, and this announcement will help us continue to do just that.”

“We’re thrilled to announce Meta’s first Wisconsin data center in Beaver Dam. This is the perfect home for Meta for several reasons, including great local talent, strong community partnerships, and reliable infrastructure,” said Brad Davis, director of data center community and economic development at Meta. “We are excited to become part of the Beaver Dam community, and we look forward to a strong partnership with the city and the state for years to come.”

Meta anticipates the project will result in more than 1,000 skilled trade jobs on site at peak construction. The data center is expected to come online in 2027, after which it will support more than 100 operational jobs.

“I’m excited for the positive things this project brings to Beaver Dam, including the increased tax base and additional jobs,” said Mayor Bobbi Marck. “I am pleased to partner with a company that has a strong commitment to environmental stewardship and charitable giving, and I also look forward to building a strong partnership with Meta so that together we can continue to enhance our community.”

The data center campus will span over 700,000 square feet, with its operational buildings set to achieve LEED Gold certification. Meta officials said the project will be designed and built with efficiency, flexibility, and sustainability in mind, and the site’s electricity use will be matched with 100% clean and renewable energy. As part of its commitment to cover infrastructure costs to support the data center, Meta will underwrite nearly $200 million in energy infrastructure investments including network upgrades, utility substations, and transmission lines.

Alliant Energy, the energy utility serving Beaver Dam, continues to develop renewable energy generation sources across Wisconsin and energy storage that will serve increased energy demands and ensure reliability. Over the next ten years, Meta will also donate $15 million to Alliant Energy’s Hometown Care Energy Fund, aimed at providing direct energy cost assistance for families in need.

Meta has a goal to be water-positive in 2030, meaning the company will restore more water than it consumes. As part of this, Meta will restore 100% of the water consumed by the Beaver Dam data center to local watersheds. Additionally, the facility will use dry cooling, which means that there will be no water demands for cooling once it is operational.

In partnership with Ducks Unlimited and local conservation partners, the project will also restore 570 acres of biodiverse wetland and prairie surrounding the data centers. Of this, 175 acres of greenspace will be deeded to Ducks Unlimited and its partners for conservation work that will provide flood storage, filter nutrients before they enter the watershed, create new opportunities for wildlife viewing (particularly migratory birds and pollinators), and offer a place for visitors to recreate.

“Strong partnerships are at the core of successful conservation projects,” said Brian Glenzinski, manager of conservation programs for Ducks Unlimited. “We are excited to join Meta, the city of Beaver Dam, and the many other organizations that are prioritizing wetland habitat through this project.”

Located in Alliant Energy’s Beaver Dam Commerce Park, the location is Wisconsin’s largest certified site and has been shovel-ready for development since it was designated by the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation in 2019.

“The Midwest is emerging as a hub for expanding large industrial businesses, from data centers to manufacturing and other cutting-edge industries,” said Becky Valcq, assistant vice president regulatory & data center services, at Alliant Energy. “Our Beaver Dam Commerce Park provides strong infrastructure and was specifically intended to facilitate economic development opportunities like this. We are proud to welcome Meta to the community. As the communities we serve grow, energy demand grows too. New and expanding businesses play a key role in helping to keep energy bills more affordable. We are moving at the speed of our customers – big and small – to help them thrive and improve the communities we call home.”

“Six years ago, leaders from Beaver Dam, WEDC, and Alliant Energy celebrated that the Commerce Park had been designated a WEDC certified site,” said Sam Rikkers, deputy secretary and chief operating officer of WEDC, the state’s lead economic development organization. “We knew that the combination of a great workforce, central location, and incredible infrastructure would attract a world-class investment. Meta’s decision to locate in Beaver Dam affirms the vision the partners had. Together, we are delivering a win for Meta, for Beaver Dam and for Dodge County, and for entire the state of Wisconsin.”",https://wedc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Default-web-news-blog-image.png,N,,2025-11-12 16:00:46.552940

It’s day 43 of the U.S. government shutdown, but an end is finally in sight. On Sunday night, the Senate voted to move forward with funding for the federal government through Jan. 30. That vote, in which eight Democrats joined the vast majority of Senate Republicans, is expected to be followed by approval from the Republican majority in the House of Representatives and President Donald Trump. With many Democratic officials condemning the capitulation of their Senate colleagues, a revival of the shutdown is a distinct possibility after funding expires again next year.

One of the many adverse effects of the current shutdown is that, for weeks now, the nation’s top environmental cop has been off duty. While it’s too early to know the exact consequences of the dysfunction, analogous situations in the recent past indicate that polluters often increase their emissions during periods of relaxed enforcement. With such periods becoming regular features of the U.S. political process, the cumulative environmental fallout could be significant.

The Environmental Protection Agency’s enforcement division is responsible for making sure the country’s cornerstone environmental laws — the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and hazardous waste laws among them — are followed. From Washington, D.C., and 10 regional offices across the country, these staffers police some of the nation’s biggest polluters. They conduct surprise inspections at refineries, power plants, and factories. They review data and reports to check compliance. And, when they find violations, they issue fines and work with the Justice Department to take offenders to court until they course correct.

But since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, the EPA has gradually furloughed most of its civil enforcement staff. At first, only a handful of employees were sent home at the start of the month, and the agency kept most workers on using unspent funds from previous budget years. As that funding ran out, however, the agency furloughed most of its workforce. Since only essential staff that protect the public from imminent threats are retained during furloughs, the vast majority of enforcement staffers had been ordered to stay home by the end of the month.

“The inspection and enforcement arm of the agency has largely been shuttered,” said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, the union that represents agency employees. “The large majority of inspectors and enforcement officers, along with attorneys who work with them to conduct the settlements and other legal actions against regulated entities, are all furloughed right now.” Chen himself was furloughed on Oct. 20.

Previous pauses in enforcement indicate that a lack of federal oversight can embolden polluters. Researchers at Pennsylvania State University examined emissions data from 204 coal-fired power plants from across the country during the last major federal shutdown at the end of 2018. They found that the coal plants released 15% to 20% more particulate matter during the 35 days when the government was shut down and EPA enforcement officers were furloughed. When the shutdown ended and the inspectors returned to their jobs, emissions returned to pre-shutdown levels. The findings were robust even though the researchers controlled for changes in weather, use of more polluting coal varieties, and other factors. That suggests that the plants were less likely to operate their pollution controls when they knew they were unlikely to get caught.

“The only possibility is a temporary change of the end-of-pipe pollution abatement device,” said Ruohao Zhang, a professor at Penn State and lead author of the study, which was published last month. Zhang and his colleagues relied on data reported by the coal plant operators to the EPA as well as satellite data from NASA. They examined particulate matter levels in a 1.8-mile radius around the coal plants.

While Zhang was not able to comment on the legality of such moves on the operators’ part, he said that it indicated there was a higher possibility of a violation. The current shutdown creates similar incentives as the last time around, he said. “Now without the EPA’s watching, this increased possibility [of being cited for violating environmental laws] is no longer there,” he said.

Researchers found a similar trend in the spring and summer of 2020 during the COVID-19 shutdown. At the time, the EPA announced that facilities that weren’t able to monitor and report their emissions would be excused from compliance. Companies took the EPA up on the offer. Self-reported data from polluting facilities showed that companies conducted 40% fewer emission tests at smokestacks in March and April of 2020 compared to the same time period in 2019. American University researchers also found that counties with six or more polluting facilities reporting to the EPA saw a 14% increase in particulate matter pollution after the EPA announced its enforcement policy in 2020.

Shutdowns ultimately send the message that nobody is watching, said Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit founded by former EPA enforcement staffers.

“It means that communities may be more exposed to pollution,” she said, “if companies do break the laws, and there’s no one from EPA working to be able to respond.”

The EPA’s regional offices each have about 18 staffers dedicated to handling each of the three main enforcement areas: air, water, and hazardous waste and toxics. Chen estimated that roughly 600 EPA employees were responsible for enforcement at the regional level. In part, these employees supervise the many environmental enforcement activities delegated to individual states. Additionally, the EPA has also assigned staff to enforce environmental laws in consultation with tribes, since many federally recognized tribes haven’t been granted authority to implement environmental laws.

The near-complete halt of inspections and case processing activities is likely to have significant implications for the EPA’s enforcement work. For one, any administrative settlements the agency might want to enter into with a polluter are contingent on utilizing evidence not more than a year old, unless the agency secures a waiver from the Justice Department. As a result, staff tend to front-load the work at the beginning of the fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1, Chen said. But given that they’ve been furloughed for the past several weeks, it “makes it very difficult timing-wise to do some sort of administrative settlements to get a quick resolution on certain things,” Chen said.

The furloughs are the latest setback to hit EPA staff. The Trump administration has conducted multiple rounds of layoffs and offered buyouts to workers this year. While it’s unclear exactly how many EPA enforcement staffers were let go or resigned, the EPA is in the process of reducing its headcount by nearly 25%. The Department of Justice, or DOJ, has also lost at least 4,500 workers to layoffs and buyouts. As a result, the Justice Department’s environmental enforcement arm has shrunk by about half.

Once the EPA identifies environmental violations, the Justice Department pursues cases against polluters and enters into legal settlements with them. According to an analysis by the Environmental Integrity Project first reported by the Washington Post, the DOJ has brought just nine major civil cases against polluters in the first eight months of the Trump administration. That’s a major decrease compared to Trump’s first term, when the DOJ brought 53 cases during the same time period.

An EPA spokesperson told the Post that the number of civil cases did not reflect relaxed enforcement on the Trump administration’s part, citing other metrics in which she claimed Trump had outperformed the Biden administration, but Duggan, the Environmental Integrity Project’s executive director, disagreed.

“That’s a significant slowdown of the enforcement process,” she said. “If you are cutting the staff that are doing that job, you know that’s going to have an impact.”

The steady stream of good EV charging news keeps on coming — this time in the state of Michigan. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) has awarded $1.84 million dollars in funding for the installation of 201 new EV chargers at 31 multifamily properties in Michigan.

The new chargers will be installed in such locations as: Taylor, Allen Park, Lincoln Park, Dearborn Heights, and Southfield. Other sites include Kalamazoo, Flint, and Lansing. They will be Level 2 chargers, which is just fine because residents at multifamily complexes who drive electric vehicles and plug them in at night can get a full charge while in their homes doing other things. In other words, it is not necessary to fast charge to 80% in 35 minutes for EV owners when they are at home. Some residents also may work remotely so they can charge at home while working and have their batteries ready to go when they need to drive somewhere.

Many EV owners have single family homes and home chargers, which makes home charging convenient and easy. However, most apartment and condo complexes do not yet have their own home chargers, so people who live in such dwellings do not yet have the same easy access to home charging.

Some critics, trolls, and haters might poo-poo the news of this number of EV chargers being installed as too little, but they are actually part of a much larger plan. “The grants expand charging access for residents throughout Michigan and move the state closer to the MI Healthy Climate Plan (MHCP) goal of sufficient infrastructure to support 2 million EVs in Michigan by 2030. Awardees are listed below. The MHCP is Michigan’s roadmap to a healthy, prosperous, carbon-neutral future for all Michiganders by 2050.”

Electric vehicles don’t directly generate toxic air pollution because they don’t burn gasoline or diesel fuel. Some areas of Detroit have too much air pollution. “The 48217 zip code in Southwest Detroit has the most air pollution of any community in the state, which can have devastating impacts on our health. Residents in the 48217 zip code — a community that is majority Black and Latino residents — experience disproportionately high rates of cancer and asthma. Investing in 100% clean energy will significantly reduce our carbon emissions and protect the health of communities across the state.”

Climate change impacts may also become more harmful. “A University of Michigan study projects deaths and emergency department visits caused by weather events during the time period 2041 to 2070 compared to a historical period of 1971 to 2000. Deaths from extreme heat are likely to increase from 33 deaths annually to 240 in the projected time period, the researchers report. Emergency department visits are expected to increase from 1,200 to 7,800, and hospitalizations from 28 to 185. Illness caused by extreme precipitation may increase from 170 ER visits per year to 220 visits per year.”",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ChatGPT-Image-Nov-12-2025-12_46_41-PM-800x533.png,N,,2025-11-12 16:01:00.194401

The Dalles, Ore., Nov. 12, 2025 — Oregon homeowners are facing a critical deadline to maximize savings on energy-efficient home improvements by stacking federal tax credits with local cash offers. The federal tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are set to expire at the end of 2025, making the remaining months of this year the final opportunity to complete eligible projects.

Homeowners can claim these federal tax credits when filing their taxes in early 2026 for any qualifying projects completed in 2025. Many of these upgrades also qualify for cash incentives from Energy Trust of Oregon, a nonprofit that helps people, businesses and communities use less energy and save money. Combining tax credits and incentives allows homeowners to get the deepest possible savings.

Along with lowering energy bills, these changes help make your home more comfortable inside. Energy efficiency improvements eligible for both the federal tax credits and Energy Trust incentives include:

Insulation: Adding or updating insulation on your attic, walls and floors can keep your heated or cooled air inside, meaning your system doesn’t have to work as hard.

Windows: Replacing older windows with energy efficient ones can keep your home more comfortable by keeping the air in and preventing drafts.

Heating and cooling: Heating and cooling your home is likely one of your biggest home energy expenses, so upgrading to modern, energy efficient units like heat pumps are a great way to keep energy costs low.

Water heating: Switching from a traditional water heater to a more efficient heat pump water heater uses much less energy to heat your water (often the second largest energy expense after heating and cooling).

Home energy audit: Credits can cover the cost of a professional energy “check-up” for your home. During the audit, an energy auditor uses tools to monitor temperature and moisture in your home and advises on the best upgrades to make, where your home is using energy efficiently and where energy may be wasted.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement federal tax credit offers two separate caps for tax credits, allowing homeowners to claim a total of up to $3,200 on their 2026 taxes from projects finished before December 31, 2025. The general cap with a maximum of $1,200, covers upgrades like insulation, windows, doors and home energy audits. Additionally, there’s a separate cap of $2,000 for installing an electric heat pump or heat pump water heater.

To claim the federal tax credits when filing a 2025 tax return, homeowners must have receipts and the manufacturer’s certification statements for all upgraded products. The process involves filling out a Form 5695 through the IRS website or tax prep software and filling in the details of energy-efficient improvements made at home in 2025 that qualify. Afterward, consult a tax professional to ensure everything is correct and ensure you’re able to qualify for as many savings as you’re eligible to claim.

Energy Trust does not give tax advice. Consult your tax professional for current information on credits available and how to apply.

DALLAS, TEXAS (November 12, 2025) – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a final rule approving the State of Texas’ request to administer permitting for Class VI underground injection wells under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). With this approval, Texas will implement Underground Injection Control (UIC) programs covering all well-types (Class I-VI), allowing better coordination and improved efficiencies.

This action recognizes that Texas is best positioned to protect its underground sources of drinking water while bolstering economic growth and energy dominance. It supports EPA’s Powering the Great American ComebackInitiative, which prioritizes clean and safe water for Americans, restoring American energy dominance, and advancing cooperative federalism.

“Approving Texas’ request to be in charge of this critical program is a big step forward for cooperative federalism—as big as the state of Texas,” said Regional Administrator Scott Mason. “The Railroad Commission of Texas has demonstrated that the state is ready, willing, and able to add Class VI wells to its underground injection control program, and the Trump Administration is proud to support Texas as it shows once again that you can protect natural resources and grows our nation’s energy economy at the same time.”

“Obtaining Class VI primacy marks an important step forward for our state’s energy sector and our citizens by recognizing the Railroad Commission’s unmatched expertise when it comes to matters of energy production, geological knowledge, and safety,” said Railroad Commission of Texas Chairman Jim Wright. “I want to thank the Trump Administration and the leadership of EPA Administrator Zeldin and Region 6 Administrator Mason for their efforts to work with states to reduce regulatory overlap and for understanding that the permitting of Class VI wells can be accomplished both safely and efficiently under the Railroad Commission’s oversight.”

“Texas is a leader in energy production, and part of that is pioneering carbon capture and storage practices,” said Senator John Cornyn (R-TX). “The EPA’s final approval of Texas’ application for primacy over underground water injection wells under the Safe Drinking Water Act will allow the Lone Star State to have more control over its own permitting process and improve efficiency, and I thank the Trump administration and EPA Administrator Zeldin for prioritizing this effort.”

“I applaud and strongly support Administrator Zeldin and the EPA for this decision. Texas is the energy capital of the world, Class VI wells are critical to energy innovation in the Lone Star State and beyond, and providing certainty about their development in the permitting process will help spur new investment. This decision reaffirms that the Railroad Commission of Texas, not the bureaucracy in D.C., is best equipped to manage the permitting of wells in the Lone Star State. I look forward to working with Administrator Zeldin and my colleagues in the Senate to ensure that regulations don’t unnecessarily hinder Texas energy development, and that Texas remains the top energy producer in the nation,” said Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX).

“Texas has always led the way in responsible energy development, and today’s decision affirms that leadership. By granting Texas primacy over Class VI wells, EPA is recognizing what we already know: no one is better equipped to protect our drinking water, advance American energy independence, and streamline permitting than the great State of Texas,” said Congressman Brian Babin (R-TX-36). “I was proud to support this effort, and I applaud Administrator Zeldin for finally clearing the way for Texas to do what it does best: grow our economy, safeguard our communities, and strengthen America’s energy future.”

“I want to thank EPA Administrator Zeldin for this approval, which will keep Texas a leader in energy innovation,” said Congressman John Carter (R-TX-31). “This decision is a win for Texas, our environment, and our economy. With this approval, Texas can move faster, attract new investments, and create good-paying jobs, leading the way for Texas energy to flourish responsibly.”

“Giving states the authority to regulate Class VI wells will cut down lengthy review times and redundant bureaucratic red tape. Carbon capture should not be mandated, but if market forces demand it, duplicative regulations should not stand in the way. This is also why I introduced the Primacy Certainty Act of 2025—so other states can benefit from what Texas energy projects now enjoy thanks to the EPA’s actions under Lee Zeldin’s leadership. President Trump is delivering on his promise to allow our energy industries to thrive, and Texas is leading the way,” said Congressman Dan Crenshaw (R-TX-2).

“I want to thank Administrator Zeldin for recognizing Texas’ leadership and granting our state primacy over Class VI well permitting. Delays at the federal level have slowed down critical carbon capture projects. As a result, this has held back innovation, investment, and job growth across Texas,” said Congressman Jake Ellzey (R-TX-6). “By empowering the Texas Railroad Commission to oversee these permits, we’re cutting through red tape and putting decisions back in the hands of experts who understand Texas’ geology, economy, and commitment to protecting our water resources. I’m grateful to my Texas colleagues who joined me in urging this action, which strengthens both environmental stewardship and American energy leadership.”

“I’m glad to see the Environmental Protection Agency, now run by the Trump Administration, finally cut red tape and streamline the permitting process for Class VI underground injection wells,” said Congressman Craig Goldman (R-TX-12). “This improved process not only safeguards our drinking water but also promotes economic growth in Texas and across the nation.”

""This is a crucial step by Administrator Zeldin and the EPA to safeguard our drinking water while advancing technologies that keep Texas and America energy dominant. This America First policy will protect our water sources and draw new jobs and investment to Texas,” said Congressman Lance Gooden (R-TX-05).

“In February, I signed onto a letter expressing strong support for the Texas Railroad Commission’s (RRC) application for primary enforcement responsibility over Class IV Underground Injection Control (UIC) wells” said Congressman Wesley Hunt (R-TX-38). “With final rule approval from the EPA, Texas will be able to implement this initiative. This will incentivize economic growth and ensure that underground water sources are properly utilized, providing clean, safe drinking water for Texans. I applaud all efforts to protect public health and the environment. Thank you to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for taking key steps to delegate and approve this rule, which will benefit and strengthen communities across Texas.”

“Texas is the epicenter of our nation’s energy industry, leading the charge on carbon capture and responsible permitting. Today’s final rule announcement will continue our state’s incredible work and streamline its efficiency and innovation. I applaud EPA Administrator Zeldin’s leadership which benefits not only Texas, but also creates jobs, boosts manufacturing, and encourages energy dominance,” said Congressman Morgan Luttrell (R-TX-8).

""For far too long, bureaucratic red tape has delayed critical energy projects and slowed innovation. Texans lead the way in responsible, efficient production, and no one understands our geology better than the experts at the Railroad Commission. I applaud the EPA's decision in granting Texas primacy over Class VI wells, which will streamline the permitting process and allow energy producers to move forward with confidence. I want to thank Administrator Zeldin for recognizing Texas’s leadership and taking this important step to advance American energy security,"" said Congressman August Pfluger (R-TX-11).

“I applaud the Trump Administration EPA decision to grant the Texas Railroad Commission primary enforcement responsibility (or “primacy”) for Class VI underground injection wells to help expand American energy dominance and support tens of billions of dollars of investment, economic growth, and job opportunities for the Lone Star State,” said Congresswoman Beth Van Duyne (R-TX-24). “The Texas Railroad Commission is fully capable of evaluating and overseeing the development and operation of carbon capture and storage wells. I am thankful the Trump Administration is, once again, working to get the federal government out of the way and allow states to best manage energy production, storage, and innovative new technologies to secure a stronger energy future for our nation.”

“I was proud to support Texas’ request for primacy over Class VI injection wells, and I applaud EPA Administrator Zeldin for acting quickly and decisively to move this process forward,” said Congressman Randy Weber (R-TX-14). “Texas’ standards align with the Safe Drinking Water Act, and this decision helps streamline the permitting process to reduce unnecessary delays. It keeps projects moving, supports investment, and ensures decisions are made closer to home. This is a positive step for Texas and America’s economic future.”

After conducting a comprehensive technical and legal review, EPA determined that Texas’ UIC Class VI program meets all requirements for approval and that the state will implement and enforce the program consistent with the Safe Drinking Water Act. Today’s action marks the sixth time a state has received primacy for Class VI wells and the fifth approval under President Trump’s leadership.

Under the leadership of Administrator Zeldin, EPA is streamlining processes for issuing permits and reviewing applications for primacy. This work includes reducing the time to permit UIC wells and eliminating the backlog of applications.

The final rule will become effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register. Publication is expected to be delayed due to a lapse in government funding.

Background

The UIC program under SDWA plays a key role in our nation’s economic future by protecting underground water supplies and ensuring that materials from industrial and energy projects are stored underground safely.

US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy; US Sen. Ted Budd, R-NC; Gov. Josh Stein; Japanese ambassador to the US Shigeo Yamada; state Sens. Dave Craven, R-Randolph; Amy Galey, R-Alamance; state Reps. Brian Biggs, R-Randolph; Neal Jackson, R-Moore; officials from the Town of Liberty, Randolph County, and Guilford County; officials from the Greensboro-Randolph County Megasite Foundation; president and CEO of Toyota Motor North America, Tetsuo “Ted” Ogawa; and Toyota North Carolina president Don Stewart, were on hand to mark the occasion.

US Rep. Richard Hudson, NC-09, who was also supposed to be in attendance, was in Washington, DC, voting on a bill to end the federal government shutdown.

Stewart and Budd also acknowledged Jim Melvin, the late mayor of Greensboro, for his involvement in helping the plant come to fruition.

The company announced in 2021 that it planned to open the plant megasite, which spans 1,850 acres and is Toyota’s largest investment in the United States, at nearly $14 billion.

It currently has more than 2,500 workers, but the plans are to hire a total of 5,100 employees.

The plant, which is Toyota’s 11th manufacturing facility in the US, will feature 14 production lines, including four dedicated to supporting battery production for hybrid electric vehicles and 10 dedicated to supporting battery production for battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.

The state-of-the-art facility features several shops that specialize in various stages of the lithium-ion battery manufacturing process. Production is divided into three main parts: electrode manufacturing, cell assembly, formation, and module.

According to a press release, batteries assembled at Toyota North Carolina are set to power the Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, RAV4 HEV, and a yet-to-be-announced all-electric 3-row BEV — the first of its kind for Toyota to be built in the US. Currently, the plant ships HEV modules to both Toyota Kentucky and Mazda Toyota Manufacturing in Alabama. Additional production lines at Toyota’s North Carolina facility are scheduled to launch by 2030.

The plant also has an on-site childcare center, medical clinic, and pharmacy for its employees.

Toyota “no stranger” to North Carolina

Ogawa noted that the company is no stranger to North Carolina, with its Racing Development Team in Salisbury, Rowan County.

“So, we are putting even deeper roots in North Carolina,” he said, adding that the launch of the plant marks a pivotal moment in the future of electrification for Toyota and for US auto manufacturing and that over the next five years, the company is planning an additional investment of $10 billion, for a total of over $60 billion in the US to further grow its manufacturing capabilities.

“The almost $14 billion investment in this state-of-the-art facility is not just about building batteries, it’s about building a future, a future that reflects our deep belief in America, in North Carolina, and in creating a more sustainable world,” Ogawa said.

He said President Donald Trump acknowledged Toyota’s commitment to North Carolina and recognized the importance of continued growth and partnership between the company and the US economy.

Duffy said an announcement will be made in the near future about the US Department of Transportation’s new “very reasonable fuel efficiency standard,” which will allow auto manufacturers to produce more vehicles that are more cost-effective for the American consumer.

He also applauded Toyota for listening to the consumer about what they want in a vehicle.

“Sometimes political pressure tells companies what they are supposed to do, but Toyota didn’t listen to political pressure,” Duffy said. “They listened to consumer pressure… I think the American people want hybrids, they want electric, but they also want the backup of a combustion engine, and those two things together to drive fuel efficiency is what Toyota has done and done it very well.”

Both Budd and Stein touted why Toyota and many others have selected North Carolina as the No. 1 state to do business.

“Those who have come in from out of state for a very special day, this is what the No. 1 state in the country for doing business in feels like,” Budd told the crowd.

Stein, a Democrat, mentioned his recent trip to the Southeast United States (SEUS)/Japan Annual Joint Meeting in Tokyo, Japan, and said he met with officials from at least 29 other Japanese companies in addition to meeting with executives from Toyota.

“We’re seeing our state become a national leader in the clean energy economy with Toyota leading the way,” he said. “To maintain this momentum, earlier this year I established an energy policy task force, which I’m proud to say Toyota is a part of. It’s about figuring out how we, as a state, can build on our economic momentum, keep electricity affordable as we meet growing energy demands, and maintain our goals to reduce carbon pollution.”

The governor noted that more than 100,000 North Carolinians are employed in clean tech jobs.

“Toyota is not alone here in North Carolina,” Yamada told those in attendance. “More than 400 Japanese companies are operating here. Japan is proud to be the leading investor and leading employer in this state.”

He also mentioned that President Trump had a highly successful meeting with the new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, the first woman to hold the position in the country’s history, when he visited two weeks ago.

“The president’s visit underlined that Japan and the United States, our relationship is stronger than ever,” Yamada said. “We are steadfast security allies, and we are dynamic economic partners, and we are natural collaborators in advancing our economic security. And in that partnership, this facility stands as a proud symbol of our joint work: driving innovation, sustainability, and resilience.”

Stewart also announced that the Toyota USA Foundation will give a $2.7 million grant to the second phase of Driving Possibilities in Guilford County Schools and the Asheboro City School District.

HARRISBURG — Environmental advocates and a handful of Democratic lawmakers are lambasting legislative leaders for agreeing to pull Pennsylvania out of an interstate cap-and-trade program as a part of the state’s long-awaited $50.1 billion budget.

The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) would have capped the amount of carbon that companies in Pennsylvania are allowed to emit. Lawmakers and advocates who spoke with Spotlight PA said pulling out was a major capitulation to state Senate Republicans that leaves the commonwealth without a clear path forward to combat climate change.

Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf directed the state to join the initiative in 2019 through an executive order. However, litigation from Republican lawmakers and energy producers prevented the state from participating in the program. A case is currently pending before the state Supreme Court.

Molly Parzen, executive director of environmental advocacy group Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, called leaving RGGI a “devastating, self-inflicted setback in addressing affordability, clean energy, and pollution.”

“Their capitulation means that Pennsylvanians will now be robbed of more than $1 billion annually to lower electricity prices through investments in clean energy,” Parzen said in a statement, referencing the potential revenue that would have been funneled to the state.

Republicans have long criticized the program, saying that it would stymie the state’s powerful energy industry and raise consumer bills at a time of increasing costs.

Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro has been vocally skeptical of the program since he announced his run for governor in 2021. He introduced his own state-based alternative to RGGI as legislation that would require GOP support.

However, state Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R., Indiana) previously told Spotlight PA that he would not move on any energy policy as long as the state was still in RGGI.

Language pulling Pennsylvania out of RGGI was included in the budget-enabling fiscal code bill. It passed the state House 189-14 and the state Senate 43-6.

State Rep. Greg Vitali (D., Delaware), a longtime environmental advocate and chair of the Environmental and Natural Resource Protection Committee, voted no.

“Democrats and the governor have ceded to this, along with other environmental asks, as a way of coming to a budget agreement and getting other things they deem important,” Vitali told Spotlight PA.

Vitali called RGGI the “only serious thing” that the legislature could have done to address climate change, calling Shapiro’s policy plan “dead on arrival” in the state Senate.

“This is our one opportunity, even though this was an uncertain opportunity. And unfortunately, we are caving in,” Vitali said.

The budget does include an additional $25 million for a popular grant program that provides schools with money to install solar panels and authorizes the spending of federal funding for solar panel construction.

Still, Vitali called those provisions “minuscule” compared to RGGI’s impact.

State Sen. Carolyn Comitta (D., Chester), the minority chair of the chamber’s Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, voted for the bill, despite her concerns regarding “taking RGGI off the table.”

Instead, she called on the legislature to pass Shapiro’s energy plan, which would create a state-level cap-and-trade program and increase renewable energy usage requirements for utilities.

“I fought for RGGI for years. I support RGGI. I still think RGGI would be a good idea for Pennsylvania,” Comitta said on the floor of the state Senate on Wednesday. “But I’m also realistic, and I’m willing to vote yes to end this impasse.”

Now, as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) moves to revoke the backbone of federal climate rules — the scientific finding that greenhouse gases threaten human health — one of the state’s top climate officials is weighing a provocative idea put forward by environmental law experts: If Washington retreats, California could lead on carbon-controlling regulation.

Absent what’s known as the endangerment finding, the EPA may soon consider abandoning the legal authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases from vehicles, power plants and other sources, furthering the Trump Administration’s stated aim to dismantle U.S. climate policy.

While decrying the prospect of such a move, climate advocates say a repeal would yield a silver lining: California and other states could in theory set their own greenhouse gas rules for cars and trucks, regulations previously superseded by federal authority.

Cars and trucks represent more than a third of California’s greenhouse gas emissions. A long shot regulatory gambit could clean some of the nation’s dirtiest air – and keep the state’s clean-car transition alive.

“All options are currently on the table,” Lauren Sanchez, chair of the California Air Resources Board, told CalMatters in an interview.

Authority States Have Never Had Before

A former federal official and expert on the Clean Air Act – who is also a law professor at UCLA – first floated this idea.

Ann Carlson wrote in the law journal Environmental Forum that an aggressive federal action against climate policy “could, ironically, provide states with authority they’ve never had before.”

The Trump administration now argues that greenhouse gases do not endanger health and that regulation is more harmful — a claim widely rejected by scientists, businesses and environmental groups, as well as states, including California.

“If greenhouse gases aren’t covered by the Clean Air Act,” Carlson told CalMatters, “then California could presumably regulate them — and so could every other state.”

Carlson, who ran the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration until last year and has written extensively about the landmark law, argues that the act only preempts state rules for pollutants it actually covers. States “have a pretty strong legal argument” to regulate greenhouse gases, she said.

The EPA, for its part, argues that states would still be barred from setting their own standards, arguing that its broad authority over air pollution covers even emissions the agency chooses not to regulate. That’s a view shared by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association and lobbying group, which supported overturning California’s phaseout of new, gas-powered cars, as well as the American Trucking Associations, which has opposed some of California’s rules on trucks.

Carlson said that argument doesn’t hold up. In her Environmental Forum article, she wrote: “If Congress didn’t intend the act to cover greenhouse gases, as the administration argues, then it’s hard to believe Congress intended to preempt states and localities from regulating them.”

In other words, she says, preemption has its limits.

Other experts agreed the idea is worth considering.

Ethan Elkind, who directs the climate program at UC Berkeley’s Center for Law, Energy and the Environment, said that states are free to “do whatever they want,” as long as the federal government hasn’t preempted them.

Not a Slam Dunk for California to Step in

For the better part of a century, California has worked to curb air pollution at the state and local level. The state’s vanguard status positions it well to test Trump’s move to curb federal climate regulation, say experts.

“I personally would be advocating that they move ahead,” said Mary Nichols, a former air board chair. “And if I were there, I would be looking to gain support for doing it.”

California holds a unique status under federal law. It can set tougher tailpipe-emission standards than the rest of the country — a recognition of its early leadership in fighting smog. Since 1968, the state has obtained more than 100 federal waivers for its vehicle rules, and other states can adopt California’s standards under certain conditions.

UC Berkeley law professor Daniel Farber said the state could even take a dual-track approach. “We don’t really think we need a waiver,” he would argue after EPA abandons the field, “but just in case we do: yes, give us one.”

California’s latest clash with Washington stems from a decades-long dance over who sets the nation’s toughest clean-car rules.

The state’s strict vehicle rules have helped spur innovations from catalytic converters to cleaner fuel to electric cars. The regulatory push began in Los Angeles after skies grew so smog-choked they stung people’s eyes.

In 1966, California adopted the nation’s first tailpipe standards. When Congress passed the 1970 Clean Air Act, it gave the state rare authority to set tougher rules — making California both a laboratory and a trailblazer, so long as it secured a federal waiver.

In 2002, California passed the nation’s first law regulating greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. The Supreme Court’s 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA ruling confirmed those gases are pollutants under federal law, leading to the Obama administration’s 2009 “endangerment finding” that they harm public health.

Such a move would fit California’s pattern of pushing first and asking permission later. In 2005, the state adopted its greenhouse-gas standards for vehicles and sought a waiver before it was even clear whether carbon qualified as pollution under federal law. The EPA initially denied that request in 2008 but reversed course a year later, granting the waiver in 2009.

“So this wouldn’t necessarily be a slam dunk approach for the state to take, but I think the legal avenue is now there,” said Elkin, of UC Berkeley.

Targeting Cars with New Regulation

If California tried to regulate greenhouse gases on its own, it would have both experience and infrastructure to rely on. The process would look a lot like how the state has written past clean-car rules — except this time, the target would be carbon itself.

California’s clean-car rules have operated within the permission-seeking framework set up by the Clean Air Act — until this year, when Trump and Congress moved to block the state’s plans to phase out gas cars and tighten diesel-truck standards. Trump’s EPA then went further by proposing to repeal the 2009 endangerment finding, framing it as a win for “consumer choice.”

Most of the state’s climate programs already run under authority of California’s own groundbreaking state laws: clean-energy mandates for utilities, a carbon-trading program for businesses, even standards to cut the carbon in fuels.

Cars are different. They’re sold into a national market, and tailpipe emissions have long been federally preempted — one reason California has needed Washington’s permission to go its own way.

If the state decides to test those limits, regulators would need to draft new rules and open them to public review — a process that could take years.

California has already started down the path of new rules for clean cars and trucks. Last month, the Air Resources Board began the process of crafting clean car rules in response to the Trump administration’s rollback of the state’s new gas-car ban — a revocation the state is also fighting in court. In December, the board plans to begin the process of writing new emissions rules for trucks.

The automobile association declined to comment on the new rulemaking effort. Patrick Kelly, vice president of energy and environmental affairs for American Trucking Associations, said the group would work with its state affiliate to “respond to specific proposals.”

“More broadly, (our group) supports achievable national standards and opposes a patchwork of state and local standards that Congress sought to avoid,” Kelly wrote in an email.

Asked by CalMatters whether the new rulemakings could become the vehicle for California to go its own way under Trump, Sanchez, the air board chair, said it’s an option staff is studying.

“It’s something that staff is looking into, and I look forward to digging into myself,” Sanchez said.

No Downside to Trying, and Some Upsides

Even if legal experts like the idea in theory, UC Berkeley’s Dan Farber says California going forward alone is a longshot in practice.

“There’s a chance you would win,” Farber said, of the argument that the state could directly regulate greenhouse gas emissions from cars. “You’re buying a lawsuit, but other than litigation expenses, I don’t think there’s much downside in trying to do it.”

Farber and others point out that the Trump administration and car and truck manufacturers would almost certainly sue to block state-level efforts to regulate greenhouse gases.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation warned, in comments to the EPA, that if states were not preempted, any unregulated emission “would then become fair game,” creating conflicting standards across the country. Automakers have long argued that letting states write their own climate rules would create a costly patchwork of standards, raising prices for consumers and complicating production for a national market.

California is in somewhat of a legal quandary. The Clean Air Act requires California to meet national pollution standards, and the state still has some of the most air-polluted regions in the country.

The state’s solutions rely heavily on clean-car and truck rules to meet those requirements. If California falls short, it could lose federal highway funding, a situation that Sanchez called a “no-win, Catch 22.”

After decades of regulation and incentives, California has built a reputation as a leader in electric cars, and experts said if the state pushes further on policy, that could help keep California’s clean-car transition alive and its electric-vehicle goals within reach.

Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy, said California could also risk getting ahead of consumers if it goes it alone. Electric cars proved less popular than policymakers expected when it originally passed its goal to do away with sales of new gas-powered cars.

“What is clear is that the program was not overwhelmingly popular amongst the public, even in California, right?” Nigro said. “That’s usually a flag for policymakers.”

Craig Segall, an independent consultant and former state air board deputy, said there’s another factor to consider: by preserving demand and infrastructure for EVs, the state could maintain a beachhead for innovation that a future president might build on.

With no coherent federal policy to compete in the global EV market, California could again use its regulatory and investment muscle — just as it once did in helping spawn electric car maker Tesla — to push the market forward.

“What the feds are basically signaling here is that the field is open for anyone who’s serious about being a competitive car or truck company in five years,” Segall said. “One of those paths is: the world’s fourth largest economy figures out ways to take its manufacturing economic capacity and just plow ahead.”

“We’re excited that you’re revitalizing an iconic American brand and building the next generation vehicle company right here in the Carolinas,” Stein said.

Why Scout Motors chose Charlotte for HQ

Scoutt Motors President Scott Keogh talked about the reasons the company landed on Charlotte.

He cited the talent pool, local universities and a reputation as a launchpad for bold ideas.

“Charlotte offers the momentum we need to scale quickly and sustainably,” Keogh said. “We’ll build a headquarters that reflects our culture, empowers our team and connects us to a region that’s fast becoming a national hub for mobility and manufacturing.”

Scout Motors will establish its Charlotte presence gradually. Its plans for initial staffing and office development will start next year, with full headquarters operations scaling up over several years.

Scout Motors in South Carolina

In February 2024, Scout Motors broke ground on a production center in Blythewood, South Carolina, off Interstate 77 and just outside of Columbia. It covers about 1,600 acres, with the main plant taking up 1,100 acres, according to a Scout Motors news release.

This location gives Scout Motors easy access to highways, shipping ports in Charleston and Savannah, and colleges known for automotive engineering.

Scout plans to start making vehicles by the end of 2026, with trucks and SUVs expected to go on sale shortly after production begins. Over 14,000 people already have expressed interest for the 4,000 jobs, the Columbia State reported.

Plans are also underway to build a Supplier Park on the site of its Blythewood production center. Located next to the main production center buildings, the Supplier Park spans nearly 200 acres and will feature more than 2.3 million square feet of specialized manufacturing and logistics space.

About Scout Motors

The Scout was first made by International Harvester from 1961 to 1980. It was the world’s first vehicle designed for both off-road and family use, earning a reputation as a tough, all-purpose truck.

In 2022, Volkswagen introduced Scout Motors, a new company founded to bring back the iconic Scout brand by building a fresh line of all-electric trucks and SUVs.

Scout currently operates 1.3 million square feet of assembly space and body shops, according to its website. The company has more than 4,000 workers for production jobs.

EV manufacturer Scout Motors’ decision will bring a new industry to Charlotte

By Ashley Fahey and Tony Mecia

Scout Motors is planting its headquarters in Charlotte, bringing 1,200 jobs and an expected investment of $207M to the Plaza Midwood neighborhood.

The N.C. Department of Commerce’s Economic Investment Committee on Wednesday afternoon voted to approve a Job Development Investment Grant for Scout’s local expansion. An announcement that includes Gov. Josh Stein, the city, the county and the Charlotte Regional Business Alliance is scheduled for 2 p.m. today at the Commonwealth development in Plaza Midwood. Local incentives of about $20M are expected to be offered by the City of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County.

The investment is expected to run through Dec. 31, 2029. The positions are expected to pay an average wage of $172,000. Scout also considered sites in South Carolina and Virginia for its headquarters.

The project is a significant one for Charlotte, in terms of job count, investment and industry diversification.

Who is Scout Motors?

In starting to manufacture cars and trucks, Scout Motors is reviving a brand from the 1960s and 1970s that is thought of as helping create the SUV segment. Scout off-road vehicles were made by International Harvester from the 1960s until 1980.

The new Scout Motors is a subsidiary of Volkswagen Group that was founded in 2022. It plans to make off-road capable electric trucks and SUVs at a manufacturing facility in Blythewood, S.C., just north of Columbia, which is under construction.

Scout Motors CEO Scott Keogh said in a May interview that the company is going to “restore an American icon for this American moment.”

The company does not currently have vehicles available for sale, though it is accepting reservations for its first two models: the Scout Traveler SUV and the Scout Terra pickup truck. Production is expected to begin in 2027, and analysts estimate the first models will be available in 2028. The company says entry-level models will start at “under $60,000.”

Since Scout selected the site for its $2B plant in South Carolina in 2023 — which is expected to employ as many as 4,000 workers — it has been searching for a headquarters location to consolidate its operations. Scout has said it preferred a spot close to the plant. Blythewood is about 1 hour, 15 minutes south of Charlotte, off I-77.

Keogh said in May that the company was searching for a site that is “a great place to live, and that’s a big spectrum. Can our employees afford it? Do they get good health care? Do they want to move here? We’re going to have to convince an awful lot of people to say this is a great place to raise your family and build a home and all of that.”

The announcement also represents a continued shift of automotive jobs to the South. For years, North Carolina had been bypassed for other states, but that is starting to change — especially with electric vehicle-related projects. Toyota announced a battery manufacturing plant near Greensboro in 2021, and Vietnamese automaker VinFast announced a battery plant west of Raleigh in 2022 (though construction has been delayed).

South Carolina has been stronger at attracting automotive investments, with BMW opening a plant near Spartanburg in 1994 and Volvo opening one outside of Charleston in 2018. Isuzu said this year it would open a plant near Greenville, S.C.

Both states have quietly nurtured the growth of automotive suppliers as well.

Scout’s unique choice in HQ location

The arrival of Scout is also distinctive in that it chose to locate its headquarters in Plaza Midwood, a neighborhood east of uptown that is not known as an office employment hub.

Scout’s future home at the Commonwealth project, spearheaded by Charlotte developer Crosland Southeast and Nuveen, is part of a 12-acre redevelopment at Central and Pecan avenues that was once home to a Family Dollar-anchored strip center. Crosland and Nuveen have built hundreds of apartments, and a substantial amount of retail space — more than 100,000 sq. ft., for both existing and new businesses — is entitled for the property. Already, several ground-floor retail tenants, including Van Leeuwen, Yonder Yoga, Solidcore and bootmaker Lucchese, have opened. Several more, including Japanese restaurant Uchi, have been announced.

The project’s six-story, 145,000 sq. ft. office building finished construction in the second quarter. An undeveloped portion of the site — the side closest to Independence Boulevard, at the intersection of Commonwealth and Pecan avenues — could accommodate a future phase of development.

The Commonwealth project is perhaps the most visible example of the change Plaza Midwood has undergone in recent years, as more developers and new businesses have moved in, and longtime neighborhood staples have relocated to more affordable areas of Charlotte.

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a critical source of energy for meeting exploding future global energy needs. It can also assist in achieving climate goals through replacing more emissions-intensive sources (such as coal). The United States is by far the largest producer and exporter of LNG, with new facilities coming online (including many along the Texas coast) which will enhance future capacity.

In essence, LNG facilities compress natural gas into a liquid form which can be transported by tanker and regassified at locations around the world. It is rapidly transforming the market for natural gas, which was once dictated almost entirely by pipeline routes, into a global phenomenon.

Under a variety of alternative scenarios regarding economic growth, costs of zero-carbon energy sources, energy prices, and other relevant parameters, continued expansion is anticipated. International demand for natural gas is increasing due to its favorable environmental properties as well as its potential role as a backup fuel to intermittent renewable energy. Developing economies around the world are also in need of low-cost, environmentally friendly fuels to facilitate growth, expand production, and alleviate extreme poverty.

Natural gas is also essential to electric generation capacity for the foreseeable future across the world. While renewable sources clearly have a vital and, indeed, essential role to play, their intermittent nature and ongoing lack of sufficient battery storage capacity requires backup generation capacity primarily fueled by natural gas. This requirement has been further enhanced of late by the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), massive data centers, and other emerging technologies (including those related to carbon capture and other emissions-reducing methods) which require unprecedented levels of power consumption. In Texas alone, requirements for power generation are expected to double over the next five years.

Beyond supplying needed energy, the LNG industry has a significant impact on the economies of the United States and Texas. Through their construction and operations, LNG facilities provide jobs, economic activity, and fiscal benefits. We have studied the effects on numerous occasions and found that construction and operations lead to billions in economic activity as well as substantial tax receipts to federal, state, and local government entities. They also support development of natural gas resources, which brings additional investment and employment opportunities.

US LNG exports are crucial to meeting future demand, and Texas is able to provide the necessary gas production, pipeline infrastructure, LNG facilities, ports, and terminals. In addition to ensuring sustainable global energy supplies, the industry provides a substantial economic and fiscal stimulus. It must be implemented in a responsible manner that recognizes and embraces climate realities, but the sheer quantities of energy that will be required mandate that an “all-of-the-above” strategy be implemented. Stay safe!

About International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Climate Action, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety Since 2008, the German government has been promoting climate action and biodiversity conservation in the Global South through the International Climate Initiative (IKI).
Within the Federal Government, the IKI is anchored in the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Climate Action, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMUKN).","Belém, Brazil (November 12, 2025) – Today at the COP30 UN climate conference, leaders from governments, businesses, civil society and philanthropy launched a new global effort that puts people’s jobs and skills at heart of the transition to a low-carbon and resilient economy.

Developed in collaboration with the COP30 Presidency and a broad coalition of international partners, the Global Initiative on Jobs & Skills for the New Economy aims to accelerate investment in human capital, foster social inclusion, and align workforce development with national climate and economic strategies. The Initiative responds to growing demand for practical solutions that make climate action work for people — creating jobs, developing skills, and ensuring social protection as economies transform.

“Here in Belém, we must show that climate action is not only about emissions and technologies, but about people and their future,” said COP30 CEO Ana Toni, who co-hosted the event launch. “Let us come together in the spirit of mutirão — the collective energy of communities working together — to build a fairer and more prosperous future for all.”

The Initiative builds on new global research from Systemiq and World Resources Institute (WRI) which shows that the climate transition could create an estimated 375 million new jobs over the next decade, particularly in renewable energy, construction and nature-based solutions. Adaptation activities, such as building resilient infrastructure, are expected to be a major source of employment as well, generating an estimated 280 million jobs worldwide.

Realizing the potential for new jobs will require unprecedented coordination among governments, business and international financial institutions. The new analysis sets out an Action Agenda across three key pillars:

Intentionality: Embed jobs and skills strategies in national climate and industrial plans, backed by data-driven workforce intelligence and local transition pacts.

Innovation: Build modern, modular training systems and industry-led consortia to align skills with emerging green sectors.

Investment: Treat spending on human capital as investment, not consumption, mobilizing domestic revenues, business incentives, and international finance for long-term workforce development.

“The transition to a new economy is not a burden, but a historic opportunity to create jobs, empower youth and drive inclusive growth,” said Hon. Dr. Eng. Festus K. Ng’eno, Principal Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Climate Change, and Forestry, Kenya. “With over 40% of Kenyans employed in agriculture and a rapidly growing youth population, investing in our people’s skills for sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, and transport is essential to building a more resilient, competitive and equitable economy for generations to come.”

“The data is clear — the skills needed for jobs are changing faster than ever,” said Allen Blue, Co-Founder of LinkedIn. “Our research shows demand for green talent continues to grow at twice the pace of skills in the workforce. Closing this gap will only happen with urgent, coordinated action to put green training at the core of every climate and business plan. Doing so not only accelerates progress, it connects people to economic opportunity.”

To deliver impact, the Initiative will work across different tracks to bring together knowledge and learning, help to establish country and industry action partnerships and build a movement. Early engagement is underway with countries including Brazil, Cambodia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Africa, Senegal, Uzbekistan and Vietnam, and partnerships are forming with leading development institutions and private-sector coalitions. As a foundation for further cooperation, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH commissioned and published three country case studies (Brazil, Kenya and Pakistan), while the International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German government funded a case study on the impact of skills shortages on global power emissions.

Leaders supporting the new Initiative underscored how the transition to a low-carbon and resilient economy will succeed only if it is powered by skilled, secure and supported workers. They called for a new compact between climate and development actors, positioning human capital as a central pillar of economic and climate transition strategies:

“A people-centered transition is both a moral imperative and an economic necessity,” said Jochen Flasbarth, State Secretary at the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Climate Action, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Germany. “Social protection, opportunities for retraining and job transition policies are key to ensuring that climate ambition remains both politically and socially sustainable.”

“Business and industry have a crucial role to play in this transformation,” said Ricardo Mussa, Chair of Sustainable Business COP30 (SB COP). “Investing in green skills and workforce transformation is not just good for the planet — it’s good for business. By building the talent base for the low-carbon economy, companies can unlock new markets, strengthen supply chains, and deliver sustainable growth.”

“We need a coordinated, whole-of-economy approach with investments in skills and workforce development at the center,” said Dr. Liesbet Steer, Executive Director at Systemiq and lead author of the report. “Our report shows that a people-centered transition can deliver a powerful triple dividend — stronger economies, greater social cohesion, and faster environmental progress.”

“The transition to a low-carbon economy will only succeed if people are positioned to benefit from it and equipped to drive it forward,” said Ani Dasgupta, President & CEO of WRI. “By investing in people’s skills and potential, we turn the challenge of decarbonization into an engine for growth and shared prosperity.”

“Skills shortages put global climate goals at risk. There can be no climate transition without a skills transition,” said Ingrid-Gabriela Hoven, Managing Director at GIZ. “Accelerating green jobs and skills will yield a triple dividend: stronger and more resilient economies, more social cohesion, and faster progress to a low-carbon economy.”

“Philanthropy and private investors are key to unlocking the potential of the new economy,” said Michelle Armstrong, Managing Director at Ares Management and President of the Ares Charitable Foundation. “Catalytic investments in people’s skills, resilience and potential can help empower communities, expand access to good jobs, and build a more inclusive and sustainable economy.”

""As countries implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the right tools and partnerships are essential to build capacity for climate innovation — unlocking the social and economic transformation these commitments aim to deliver,"" said Pablo Vieira, Global Director of the NDC Partnership. ""The Global Initiative on Jobs & Skills for the New Economy will play a key role in expanding this support, helping countries fast-track NDC implementation and investment for a green and just transition.”

“Over the next five years, we are planning an additional investment of $10 billion in the US to further grow our manufacturing capabilities, bringing our total investment in this country to over $60 billion,” said Toyota Motor North America president Ted Ogawa.

Toyota’s 11th US factory, on a 1,850-acre (749-hectare) site, will be able to produce 30 GWh annually at full capacity and house 14 battery production lines for plug-in hybrids and full EVs. It will eventually employ 5,000 workers.

Momentum is a crucial factor in success in all walks of life. In sports, a high-performance team builds confidence and enthusiasm, often leading to a string of wins. In politics, legislative victories or a growing list of endorsements pressures others to line up in support of a cause or candidate. And in business, a rising stock or product often continues to climb because its momentum attracts attention and leads to growing demand.

In the energy business, momentum in recent years was on the side of renewables, primarily thanks to government subsidies financing wind and solar initiatives and regulations designed to erect roadblocks to legacy energy enterprises.

Clearly, things have changed. The momentum has shifted. Thanks to the Trump administration removing barriers for our most affordable and reliable energy sources, a whirlwind of activity designed to deliver natural gas to consumers across the nation is underway at a frenetic pace.

Just during the last couple of weeks of October alone, various companies announced a flurry of activity. To highlight just a few:

In Louisiana, Williams Companies unveiled a strategic partnership with Woodside Energy “to advance Louisiana pipeline and liquefied natural gas projects,” leading to more capital investment.

The deal involves an investment in the Louisiana LNG project in which Williams “will acquire 80% ownership in and become operator of Driftwood Pipeline LLC, which includes the construction of Line 200, a fully permitted greenfield pipeline connecting Woodside’s Louisiana LNG facility to multiple pipelines, including Transco and Louisiana Energy Gateway.”

Williams said it expects its investment “will total $1.9 billion in capital for development of the pipeline and LNG facilities.”

In Tennessee, East Tennessee Natural Gas, owned by Enbridge, announced that “construction on the 122-mile pipeline through the Upper Cumberland for the Ridgeline Expansion Project will begin soon.” The company said it received a notice to proceed on Oct. 7 from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Construction was expected to begin Nov. 1, according to Enbridge. “The pre-construction activity began on Oct. 20,” according to the report. The pipeline “will supply natural gas to the new Tennessee Valley Authority Kingston Energy Complex.”

In Ohio, a new bill, SB 294, mirrors federal legislation recently introduced by U.S. Rep. Troy Balderson (R) aimed at qualifying natural gas as clean energy and designed to “compel the Ohio Power Siting Board to favor energy projects it deems both ‘clean and reliable,’” as one industry site described it.

The bill would also “declare renewable sources like wind and solar ‘unreliable.’”

In Texas, Phillips 66 and Kinder Morgan Inc. announced “the commencement of a binding open season for transportation service on the Western Gateway Pipeline (Western Gateway), a newly proposed refined products pipeline system.”

The project “will facilitate the transportation of refined products from origin points in Texas to key downstream markets in Arizona and California, with connectivity to Las Vegas, Nevada via Kinder Morgan’s CALNEV Pipeline.”

A press release spelled out an impressive delivery network across parts of Texas, Arizona, Missouri, California and Nevada.

Compare the level of excitement and activity for legacy energy with the worries and warnings coming from the renewables industry about its own state of play, including on the world stage.

BloombergNEF recently held a London summit with renewables leaders to address the fact that “the European renewables boom is colliding with growing systemic pains. Record levels of negative power prices, particularly in Spain, are reshaping how risk is distributed across producers and buyers of renewable electricity.”

One of the topics was Europe’s Contract for Difference (CfD) model, which amounts to a contract between a renewables company and a government-backed counter-party agreeing on a fixed price for wholesale electricity. The idea is to stabilize revenues for renewables while encouraging investment by removing fear of volatile electricity prices. In other words, it’s one more way for the government to artificially prop up the renewables industry.

Encouragingly, one panelist at the summit seemed impressively grounded in reality. Dr. Alexandra von Bernstorff, managing partner for Luxcara, a German-based company specializing in renewable energy investments, said she was not a fan of CfDs because “they made the industry lazy.”

“We need to face the fact that we have a product and we have to sell the product like everyone else,” she said. “And I need to think about, do I have connections or not? Do I have customers or not? Can I produce cheap enough or not? As an industry, we should have gotten into these questions much earlier. So I’m a big fan of having free market negotiations. And if it’s difficult, then become creative.”

Wow. Such refreshing economic practicality almost provides hope for the renewables industry after all. Sadly, as Dr. von Bernstorff noted, her opinion on CfDs is not widely shared across the European renewables industry.

The renewables industry is dealing with “systemic pains” and second-guessing its approach in Europe, despite the overwhelming support of government leaders, as Europeans nervously face an uncertain energy future. In the U.S., meanwhile, new projects and improved delivery networks for our most affordable and reliable energy sources are being regularly implemented across multiple states.

Nissan Leaf

The pioneer of the mass-market EV industry remains, for now, the most affordable way into a new electric vehicle. The third-generation Nissan Leaf is still holding the line on price, reducing entry barriers to EV ownership for USA buyers.

Starting at an MSRP of around $29,990 USD, the Leaf is undeniably the cheapest electric car on this list. Despite its low price, there’s no compromises when it comes to range, with even the entry level S+ trim offering an EPA-estimated range of 303 miles thanks to a large 75 kWh battery.

This entry model still packs a decent list of standard equipment, including wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, remote climate control, a 28-inch driver display, and more. With the front-driven electric motor offering up 214 horsepower, it’s got more than enough power to easily merge onto highways too.

Chevrolet Equinox EV

For those in the market for a compact SUV that’s also fully-electric, Chevrolet’s latest Equinox EV is another strong choice. Prices for the entry-level LT1 start at $35,100 USD, and it’s no surprise that this car is Chevrolet’s best selling electric car.

This EV delivers an EPA-estimated range of up to 319 miles, making it the longest range EV available at this price point. It’s a no-compromise replacement for a similarly sized gasoline option, offering ample space inside and strong on-road performance thanks to its 220 horsepower electric motor.

For the 2026 model year, the Equinox EV also comes with a native NACS charging port, further future proofing this American-made EV by offering a seamless gateway to Tesla’s Supercharger network.

Fiat 500e

With its iconic European styling and small form factor, the Fiat 500e is the style icon on this cheap EV list, offering bags of personality for an MSRP starting price of $30,500 USD. With an EPA-rated range of around 153 miles, the 500e is more suited for urban driving, as opposed to the mile-munching capabilities of other cars on this list such as the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Equinox EV.

DC fast charging capability means the Fiat 500e can also be recharged in a flash, on the correct public charger – allowing for 40 miles of range to be added in as little as five minutes.

Hyundai Kona Electric

The Kona Electric is another affordable compact SUV on this list, offering a compelling blend of range, tech, and utility in a segment-favorite crossover package.

The entry-level Kona Electric SE starts at approximately $32,795 USD. With an EPA estimated range of 261 miles, and standard equipment such as Hyundai’s dual-screen infotainment setup, connectivity features, and a spacious cabin, this is a great affordable all rounder.

Given data centers’ exceptionally large electricity demands and 24-hour use times, projects are sited with numerous large diesel generators.
There isn’t a consensus on how many hours of backup power a data center needs, Limandibhratha said.
The public debate about such issues is new for the data center industry, which hasn’t been accustomed to such scrutiny.
“Maybe you can’t do it all with battery storage, but you also don’t need to just rely on diesel generators,” Wamsted said.","“Five nines.”

In the world of data centers, ensuring a facility will be online 99.999 percent of the time, is everything. Access to power is the number one priority when developers are trying to figure out where to build the warehouses storing supercomputers that in recent years have grown beyond what was previously imaginable.

In order to ensure five nines, data center developers secure power in various ways: They’ll seek to connect to the grid, build out or buy their own behind-the-meter power supply—typically in the form of gas-fired generation—and lastly, host multiple backup generators on site.

These generators commonly run on diesel. The refined crude oil has become the industry standard to ensure around-the-clock access to power as developers in Texas await a new state regulation that empowers the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the state’s grid operators, to disconnect large power users like data centers at times of peak demand. Backup generators have also become vital to developers as slow supply chains delay onsite gas turbine installations.

The preferred backup power source for data centers are big air polluters, which environmentalists and industry experts say could be highly problematic unless clear rules are established and enforced for limiting diesel generator use.

While these backup generators are meant to be used rarely outside of maintenance testing, there is concern that as ERCOT employs its new powers to force data centers off the grid in times of peak demand, the diesel generators will run more frequently.

Diesel generators are rife with environmental issues. They are expensive to run and face limits from federal, state and local regulators on noise and air pollution. Diesel emits harmful pollutants that the American Cancer Society links to heart and lung disease and cancer.

Yet despite such obvious health impacts, those operating diesel generators are typically only required to self-report emissions to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA may issue compliance inspections and facility evaluations to ensure that projects are abiding by the rules for regulated pollutants.

Diesel generators used as backup power in Texas are most commonly permitted by the TCEQ, as long as the hours they run don’t exceed 10 percent of the annual operations of the primary power source. TCEQ grants those operating diesel generators either a standard permit or a case-by-case new source review permit.

With some data center developers looking to build single projects that consume more electric power than cities, there’s concern that the self-reported emissions from diesel generators used to provide backup power will exceed limits under the Clean Air Act.

Federally, there are no time limits on the use of these diesel generators during emergencies. The EPA sees emergencies as situations resulting from sudden and reasonably unforeseeable events, like a grid power failure, gas plants unexpectedly shutting off or natural disasters. Under such circumstances, the operator of the generator is responsible for logging the emergency and reporting which steps were taken to mitigate emissions.

But for non-emergencies, like machine testing, diesel generators are federally limited to 100 hours. Fifty of those 100 hours can be used for demand response programs—grid or transmission operators paying large load users like data centers to switch to backup generators to reduce stress on the grid.

This comes as Texas’ largest metropolitan areas—Houston-Galveston-Brazoria, Dallas-Fort Worth, El Paso and San Antonio— already violate air quality standards, according to the EPA.

There are companies in gas-rich Texas promoting a switch to portable natural gas generators, which burn cheaper fuel that is better suited for long-term use with less air pollution. One gas generator company, Generac, said in a white paper that its gas generators emit 95 percent less nitrogen oxides, a significant contributor to smog and acid rain; 98 percent less non-methane hydrocarbons and 59 percent less carbon monoxide. But natural gas, unlike diesel fuel, can’t be stored on site.

Because diesel can be stored on site and is readily available, it has become the preferred energy source for most backup or emergency generators, said Brandon Seale, a longtime gas executive and former president of West Texas Gas, recently rebranded as WTG Energy.

“You can find it in a bunch of different places,” Seale said to a crowd at a data center conference in October. “And so people like that.”

Diesel generators are regularly used in mining, agriculture and energy. Given data centers’ exceptionally large electricity demands and 24-hour use times, projects are sited with numerous large diesel generators.

While data centers already use all sources of redundancy in order to maintain their reliability, as more grid operators around the country like ERCOT trend toward curtailing data centers at times of peak demand, the facilities will likely need even more backup systems, said Nathalie Limandibhratha, BloombergNEF’s U.S. power analyst.

There isn’t a consensus on how many hours of backup power a data center needs, Limandibhratha said. But given the shifting rules regarding large loads in ERCOT, some business leaders are considering having 50 to 100 hours of backup generation onsite, she said.

Diesel generators are the cheapest way for data centers to meet shifting industry standards for on-site backup with on-site fuel supply, said Chris Miller, president of The Piedmont Environmental Council, a Virginia-based nonprofit that has been tracking the environmental impacts of the data center industry across Virginia, home to the largest concentration of data centers in the world. But these generators also produce the most toxic air pollution.

In any other industry use, generating as much power from diesel as is required by data centers in any metropolitan area in the U.S. would trigger Clean Air Act violations, he said. However, by using emergency permitting, the pollution is allowed, Miller said.

“Diesel combustion is one of the dirtiest forms of generation we know,” Miller said. “It’s only supposed to be for emergency use.”

But conversations happening at both the federal and state levels consider allowing waivers from the Clean Air Act for an expanded range of grid scenarios, he said. His concern is that while grid and data center operators try to solve for grid reliability by curtailing and using backup power, air quality impacts are not being considered.

His fear is that the default will become using these diesel generators for longer and longer periods of time.

The public debate about such issues is new for the data center industry, which hasn’t been accustomed to such scrutiny. For years, the industry operated in relative secrecy, building big warehouses to support everyday internet functions like Gmail, iCloud and Amazon Prime.

But as the industry transforms grids across the country and drives electricity demand to record levels, it finds itself at the center of a storm of protest in communities nationwide. Residents across the country are becoming increasingly concerned about rising power costs, pollution, zoning and water usage related to data centers, many of which are massive in size.

As Texas follows in the footsteps of Virginia’s so-called “Data Center Alley,” building out huge amounts of infrastructure and incorporating these large loads onto its grid, Miller warns about the looming consequences of allowing the industry to steam ahead before rules are settled.

In attempts to get online faster as interconnection queues grow, Miller said some data centers are getting permits for a power generation unit they claim is temporary and will be used as backup power once they’re connected to the grid, but end up using it as the primary power source as they wait to get on the grid.

“We’re starting to see specific proposals that say, ‘Well, don’t worry about the air quality effects. We’re just trying to come online in a timely fashion,’’’ Miller said. “But what they’re really saying is, ‘We want to operate outside the rules.’”

Some big tech companies say they are looking to reduce their growing emissions while trying to stay competitive in the race to develop artificial intelligence. While Microsoft’s emissions grew by nearly 25 percent from fiscal years 2020 to 2024, the company has committed to becoming carbon negative by 2030. To get there, Microsoft says it plans to phase out the use of petroleum-based diesel generators as a backup power for its data centers by 2030, partly by adopting “renewable diesel variations” and procuring hydrogenated vegetable oils to reduce their emissions.

An alternative future to diesel generators could include diversifying backup power options to include battery storage, renewables, natural gas or cleaner diesel products, Duke University’s Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability concluded in a February report.

Dennis Wamsted, an energy analyst at the nonprofit Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, warned against the widespread use of diesel generators. “On a 30,000-foot level, it’s a terrible idea,” Wamsted said. “They’re noisy, they have to be tested all the time if they aren’t running. They are not very friendly, if you will.”

The local air pollution undoubtedly will lead to issues, he said.

Wamsted said that large-scale battery storage has great potential in this application and could be used even in combination with diesel generators to lower a site’s overall environmental and noise pollution, as well as running costs.

“Maybe you can’t do it all with battery storage, but you also don’t need to just rely on diesel generators,” Wamsted said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2194970695-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 14:03:37.724633

Donate to sustain Prism’s mission and the humans behind it.

The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), India’s largest Hindu far-right organization, initiated a well-funded lobbying effort in the U.S. earlier this year, a Prism investigation has found.

Prism is the first news outlet to report that Squire Patton Boggs, one of the top lobbying firms in the U.S., registered as a lobbyist on Jan. 16 for the RSS, according to lobbying disclosures. In the first three quarters of 2025, Squire Patton Boggs received $330,000 to lobby officials in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives on behalf of the RSS, according to lobbying reports. This marks the first time the RSS has hired lobbyists in the U.S., according to public records.

In September, the RSS marked 100 years since its founding in 1925. The organization was established to promote what critics and human rights groups describe as a Hindu state; its followers have been accused of targeting Muslims and other minorities with discrimination, harassment, and violence. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s political party emerged from the RSS, and Modi himself was once a worker for the organization.

The RSS’s lobbying efforts in Washington, D.C., raise questions among experts on foreign influence operations about how the RSS has been able to conduct its activities without identifying as a foreign entity or without Squire Patton Boggs registering under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), a 1938 law that requires transparency from representatives of foreign interests. Public records confirm that neither Squire Patton Boggs nor any other organization is registered as an agent for the RSS under FARA. It is unclear whether Squire Patton Boggs is required to register as a foreign agent of the RSS.

The RSS and Squire Patton Boggs did not respond to Prism’s requests for comment.

The paperwork—filed under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (LDA), a transparency law for activities to influence the federal government—does not list the RSS as Squire Patton Boggs’ direct client. Rather, the client is State Street Strategies doing business as the lobbying firm One+ Strategies on behalf of the RSS.

In Squire Patton Boggs’ lobbying registration form for the RSS, the general lobbying issue is noted as foreign relations, and the specific lobbying issue is “U.S.-India bilateral relations.” The focus on relations between the two countries strongly suggests that the firm’s activities should be registered under FARA, experts told Prism.

“Registering under the LDA and not FARA really keeps this influence campaign in the shadows,” said Ben Freeman, director of the Democratizing Foreign Policy program at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and a leading expert on lobbying and foreign influence in the U.S. “And so, we really don’t have much idea at all about what [the lobbyists] are doing for the RSS.”

In India, the RSS has grown its influence in part by providing social services for local communities through charity programs, schools, and environmental disaster relief. In the U.S., however, the group has been the subject of political and media scrutiny in recent years over its ties to Modi, whose Hindu nationalist, anti-Muslim politics have turned the secular democracy into an “electoral autocracy.”

Raqib Hameed Naik, the founder and executive director of the Center for the Study of Organized Hate, a D.C.-based think tank that researches political extremism, said the RSS’s lobbying activities in the U.S. could be part of a campaign to alter how it is perceived outside of India.

“The RSS might have become a mainstream force in Indian politics, but globally, it is still seen as a fascist paramilitary group,” he told Prism. “So what they’re trying to do right now is to invest in changing the perception of the policymakers.”

Who are the RSS’s lobbyists?

Over the past century, the RSS has grown from a small, fringe volunteer paramilitary group into the most influential right-wing Hindu organization in India. The early leaders of the all-male organization praised Nazi Germany and fascist Italy, and a member of the RSS assassinated Mahatma Gandhi in 1948. Today, RSS members participate in drills and marches at training camps, and critics say the group’s methods of mass mobilization and targeting of minorities are rooted in its fascist origins.

The RSS serves as the ideological fountainhead of the broader Sangh Parivar, a network of Hindu right-wing organizations encompassing education, social services, and labor. A few years after India’s independence from British colonial rule in 1947, the Sangh developed a political wing in order to enter electoral politics. In 1980, erstwhile members of the political wing formed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Critics accuse the RSS, the BJP, and its affiliates of instigating harassment and violence toward Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities. Notably, those groups led a campaign to build a Hindu temple at the site of the Babri mosque in Ayodhya that culminated in the destruction of the mosque by activists in 1992, triggering a series of communal riots that were among the deadliest in Indian history. Last year, Modi attended the consecration ceremony for the newly built temple.

Since Modi and the BJP’s ascent to power in 2014, Indians have witnessed major democratic backsliding and a cascade of anti-minority politics and policies. The RSS remains closely linked to the BJP: Several of the party’s top leaders, including Modi, emerged from the RSS’s rank and file. “Their only interest has always been love towards the nation,” Modi said of the RSS at a centenary event in October.

While U.S. nonprofits have spread the RSS’s ideology among Hindu communities domestically, the RSS has now turned its attention to lawmakers.

According to quarterly lobbying reports, Squire Patton Boggs received payments totaling $330,000 during the first three quarters of 2025 for its work with the RSS.

Four Squire Patton Boggs lobbyists are listed in the reports: Bradford Ellison, Ludmilla Kasulke, Bill Shuster, and Rebekah Sungala. Ellison and Kasulke have experience lobbying Congress on behalf of foreign governments: Ellison previously represented Ethiopia and Benin, and Kasulke has represented South Korea and the umbrella organization for the Syrian opposition, according to FARA filings. Shuster served as a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania from 2001 to 2019; Sungala was a congressional staffer in his office. Bill Shuster’s brother Bob Shuster is a co-founder of One+ Strategies, the firm listed in the disclosures as working on behalf of the RSS. Neither the lobbyists nor One+ Strategies responded to requests for comment.

Email communications obtained by Prism, along with an article in an RSS publication, shed light on how Squire Patton Boggs and One+ Strategies have engaged with the RSS this year.

On Jan. 16, Ellison reached out to Audrey Truschke, a historian and professor at Rutgers University–Newark. Truschke, who has extensively researched the Hindu right, was contacted as part of the lobbyists’ efforts to conduct research about the RSS, according to an email obtained by Prism.

“Our team was recently retained by Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to educate lawmakers about RSS’s mission and impact, as the organization marks its centenary. This effort calls for us to develop a comprehensive understanding of RSS’s history, including historical controversies associated with the group,” Ellison wrote. “Accordingly, we would appreciate meeting with you in February to understand your perspective on the RSS’s history and current impact.”

Truschke’s reply was short. “Thanks for reaching out. Please let me know your status under FARA (Foreign Agents Registration Act) for this advocacy work.”

“I never heard back from them,” she told Prism.

In June, the Shuster brothers and Ellison were among the guests at an RSS event in Nagpur, India, where the group is headquartered. Neither the RSS nor local news reports indicated that the Shusters and Ellison are the RSS’s lobbyists.

The lobbyists visited an RSS training camp and met with members, according to an article in an RSS publication. The article called the visit “a significant moment in Indo-US civil society engagement, signaling growing interest among American policymakers in understanding India’s indigenous institutions beyond government and corporate corridors.” The article noted that the visit came weeks after a military conflict between India and Pakistan.

Also part of the “high-profile United States delegation,” according to the article, were Walter Russell Mead, a columnist at The Wall Street Journal, and Bill Drexel, a think tank specialist on U.S.-India relations. Mead and Drexel are both fellows at the Hudson Institute, a right-wing think tank based in Washington, D.C. Mead and Drexel did not respond to requests for comment.

The RSS also appears to have enlisted a pharmaceutical executive based in Massachusetts to help promote the group during its centenary.

The lobbying registration between Squire Patton Boggs, One+ Strategies, and the RSS lists Vivek Sharma as “an entity other than the client that contributes more than $5,000 to the lobbying activities in a quarterly period” and either participates in or supervises the registrant’s lobbying activities. Sharma is the executive chair of Cohance Lifesciences, a drug manufacturer based in Boston with major operations in India. The address given for Sharma on the form matches that of his company’s financial filing. Sharma has also been listed as a mentor of Ekal Vidyalaya, a U.S.-based nonprofit that reportedly has links to the Sangh Parivar and runs a network of schools in rural India that have been accused of imparting divisive teachings that preach Hindu superiority to children. Sharma did not respond to a request for comment.

In October, Jim Geraghty, a contributing columnist at The Washington Post, attended an RSS event in Nagpur marking the group’s 100th anniversary. Geraghty, who is a political correspondent for the conservative magazine The National Review, wrote in his column, “My trip was sponsored by the Hudson Institute and the Foundation for India and Indian Diaspora Studies, whose president is affiliated with RSS.”

The Foundation for India and Indian Diaspora Studies (FIIDS) is a U.S.-based nonprofit that regularly hosts events to “strengthen the U.S.-India partnership,” according to its website, featuring high-ranking Indian officials such as the country’s foreign minister and the ambassador to the U.S. FIIDS also brings together U.S. lawmakers to “underscore the deepening strategic and bilateral relationship between the two nations.” FIIDS is not registered under FARA.

The nonprofit’s president, Khanderao Kand, was reported as being a member of the Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh (HSS), an organization that has been likened to being the RSS’s branch in the U.S. Kand also reportedly served as HSS’s national public relations coordinator.

Hudson Institute, FIIDS, and Kand did not respond to requests for comment.

The RSS’s lobbying efforts have raised concerns among multiple experts about whether the activities fall under the purview of FARA.

Legal questions over foreign lobbying status

After reviewing the lobbying disclosures, three experts on foreign influence in U.S. politics told Prism that per lobbying regulations, the RSS would be considered a foreign entity and Squire Patton Boggs should be registered as a foreign agent for the RSS.

The registration form under the LDA asks if there is any foreign entity that holds at least 20% equitable ownership in the client or “directly or indirectly, in whole or in major part, plans, supervises, controls, directs, finances or subsidizes activities of the client or any organization.” In Squire Patton Boggs’ registration, there is a check in the box next to “No,” despite the RSS employing One+ Strategies, the listed client, to act on its behalf.

“This is clearly, just unquestionably, a foreign entity as far as the LDA is concerned. They should have checked ‘yes’ in that foreign entities box,” said Freeman of the Quincy Institute. “What matters is who the ultimate client is. And the ultimate client here, according to this document, is the RSS, which is a foreign entity.”

Squire Patton Boggs did not respond to a question from Prism about why the firm had not listed RSS as a foreign entity.

Dan Auble, a senior researcher at OpenSecrets who oversees the watchdog group’s lobbying database, told Prism that according to LDA guidelines published by Congress, the RSS should disclose itself as a foreign entity. “The guide is actually quoting the law itself,” said Auble, who also directs OpenSecrets’ Foreign Lobby Watch program.

The section in the guidelines on “Listing Foreign Entities” provides more specific guidance on what constitutes an indirect client. “The purpose of the disclosure is to identify the interests of the foreign entity that may be operating behind the registrant,” the document explains.

“If the RSS in India is funding or controlling the lobbying effort, or if they are affiliated and have a direct interest, then there should be disclosure of [Squire Patton Boggs’] ties to a foreign entity,” Auble told Prism.

When Squire Patton Boggs registered as a lobbyist for the RSS under the LDA, the firm entered the code for foreign relations as the “general lobbying issue area.” The “specific lobbying issues (current and anticipated)” is “U.S.-India bilateral relations.” In the subsequent quarterly filings, however, the specific lobbying issue is to “introduce the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to U.S. officials.”

“My conclusion is that ‘U.S.-India bilateral relations’ is within the FARA rules. RSS should have been registered under FARA instead,” said James Thurber, distinguished professor of government emeritus at American University and a co-editor of the book, “Congress and Diaspora Politics: The Influence of Ethnic and Foreign Lobbying.”

Freeman agreed. “To me, what jumps out is that line in the registration statement where it does say their activities are U.S.-India bilateral relations,” he told Prism. “I can’t think of any exemption that they would fall under.”

Some firms registered under LDA can qualify for a FARA exemption. However, if a foreign government or a foreign political party is the principal beneficiary, this exemption does not apply. Because the disclosure mentions “U.S.-India bilateral relations” and the RSS has a close proximity to the ruling regime in India, Freeman said, “that raises a very important question of whether they should be registered under FARA and not the LDA for this work.”

The lobbying classifications matter, experts say, because registrants under FARA have to publicly disclose significantly more about which lawmakers they engage as well as other particulars, such as details of meetings, emails, texts, calls, receipts, transactions, and disbursements. Under the LDA, the RSS’s lobbyists do not need to disclose any such details.

The Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives, which administer the LDA, did not respond to requests for comment.

This is not the first time the lobbying activities of a Hindu nationalist organization have raised concerns over federal violations.

After operating in the U.S. for almost 30 years, Overseas Friends of the BJP-USA (OFBJP-USA) registered as a foreign agent of the BJP under FARA in 2020. OFBJP-USA has reportedly campaigned for the BJP, including during Indian elections. The group has also facilitated trips to the U.S. for BJP leaders, hosted them at events, and promoted them through social media initiatives.

In August 2020, an Indian news website reported that a member of OFBJP-USA criticized Joe Biden’s presidential campaign and his selection of Kamala Harris as his running mate. As questions were raised about the propriety of the member’s statement as a part of OFBJP-USA, the group clarified that his views did not reflect its own. Less than 10 days later, the group registered under FARA.

The Indian government, too, has hired lobbyists in Washington. India has long been represented by BGR Government Affairs, and this year, it contracted with two more lobbying firms. In April, the Indian Embassy signed a contract worth $1.8 million annually with SHW Partners. The firm’s activities for India include government relations and perception management, according to FARA filings.

Less than 10 days after President Donald Trump imposed a 50% tariff on India in August as alleged retaliation for India purchasing Russian oil during the Ukraine war, the Indian Embassy hired another lobbying firm, Mercury Public Affairs. The Indian government is paying Mercury $75,000 a month, per FARA filings, for services that include federal government relations, media relations, and paid advertising. The government of India did not respond to a request for comment about Squire Patton Boggs’ lobbying on “U.S.-India bilateral relations” on behalf of the RSS.

In February, the Trump administration took aim at FARA with a memo from Attorney General Pam Bondi that pared back enforcement of the law and disbanded the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force.

“The problem right now is that with Trump as the new president, he’s explicitly announced that he’s not going to actively enforce the Foreign Agents Registration Act,” Thurber said. The Department of Justice, which administers FARA, did not respond to a request for comment.

Despite the RSS lobbyists’ efforts to change the group’s image among U.S. lawmakers, Naik, of the Center for the Study of Organized Hate, said the influence campaign could easily be challenged by decades of publicly available information about the RSS.

“Documentation of a century of all their activities is literally available to anyone,” he said.

Market Outlook:

The third quarter of 2025 presented a distorted view of the automotive market, driven by a last-minute rush for electric vehicles (EVs) ahead of an expiring federal tax credit. This surge, a 72% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase in new EV sales, represents a pull-forward of demand rather than organic growth, with EVs still comprising just over 5% of total Q3 sales across brands represented in Vincensus.

While overall new vehicle sales rose 11% QoQ and used sales increased 3%, the underlying data suggests a more price-sensitive and competitive landscape ahead. Inventory levels are stabilizing after years of volatility, exposing challenges for brands with older or mispriced vehicles. Lotlinx anticipates a highly competitive Q4, characterized by increased manufacturer incentives, deeper markdowns, and aggressive year-end sales events as automakers seek to clear aging 2025 model-year inventory.

Key Findings

Inventory and Pricing Trends

New vehicle day supply increased by 5 days QoQ to 62 days (up 1 day YoY)

Used vehicle day supply increased by 1 day QoQ to 40 days (up 4 days YoY)

Carryover for new vehicles decreased 2% QoQ to 52%; used increased 7% QoQ to 50%

Aged ending inventory decreased 3% QoQ to 42% for new vehicles and held steady at 48% for used

Units sold with a markdown increased by 1% QoQ for new vehicles and 3% QoQ for used

EV, Hybrid, and ICE Performance

New EV sales surged 72% QoQ, while hybrids rose 7% and ICE vehicles 9%

EVs made up just 5% of all sales, signaling that the surge is short-term and incentive-driven

New EV day supply dropped to 61 days and used EV day supply to 36 days — both below ICE averages

Average list price of sold new units: EVs $55,510; hybrids $44,100; ICEs $41,857

For used vehicles, EV prices fell 3% QoQ to $28,888, while ICE and hybrid prices remained stable

Market Dynamics and Competition

The stabilization of inventory has introduced new challenges, particularly for brands with aging 2025 stock

Dealers are expected to face the most aggressive pricing environment in years, with manufacturer incentives rising sharply to move inventory

Markdown strategies and real-time decisioning are becoming critical for profitability

Lotlinx Dealer Performance

Lotlinx dealers continued to outperform the broader market during Q3. On average, Lotlinx dealers had 1% less aged inventory for new vehicles and 4% less for used vehicles compared to the market. Additionally, 59% of new vehicle brands and 92% of used vehicle brands leveraging Lotlinx outperformed their respective market benchmarks.

“Dealers are navigating a new chapter of hyper-competition, where every VIN decision matters,” said Len Short, Executive Chairman of Lotlinx. “Our data shows that Lotlinx-powered dealers are winning by acting faster and smarter, using VIN-specific insights to reduce aging, optimize pricing, and preserve profitability, even as the market becomes more volatile.”

“Over the next five years, we are planning an additional investment of $10bn in the US to further grow our manufacturing capabilities, bringing our total investment in this country to over $60bn,” said Ted Ogawa, president of Toyota Motor North America.

Toyota’s 11th US factory, on a 1,850-acre (749-hectare) site, will be able to produce 30 gigawatt-hours of energy annually at full capacity and house 14 battery production lines for plug-in hybrids and full EVs. It will eventually employ 5,000 workers.

Last month in Japan, US President Donald Trump said Toyota planned a $10bn investment in the United States.

“Go out and buy a Toyota,” said Trump, who has been critical of Japanese and other auto imports and has imposed hefty tariffs on imported vehicles.

Toyota has been one of the slowest carmakers to move to full EVs, but has rapidly moved to convert its best-selling vehicles to hybrids.

“We know there is no single path to progress”, Ogawa said on Wednesday.

“That’s why we remain committed to our multi-pathway approach, offering fuel-efficient gas engines, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery electronics and fuel cell electronics.”

Other car companies like Volkswagen have said they will add more hybrids as the Trump administration has rescinded EV tax credits and eliminated penalties that incentivised EV sales.

US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at the event that the administration plans to soon propose to ease fuel economy standards, saying prior rules were too aggressive.

Duffy in January signed an order to direct the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to rescind fuel economy standards issued under former US President Joe Biden, a Democrat, for the 2022-2031 model years that had aimed to drastically reduce fuel use for cars and trucks.

Gov. Josh Stein plans to attend an economic development announcement at 2 p.m. today at the Commonwealth development, where Scout is establishing offices. The Charlotte Ledger was first to report Scout’s interest in the site.

Scout has said it will invest $2 billion in the Blythewood, South Carolina, plant with a goal of making 200,000 vehicles annually once it is fully operational. The company has said it expects to start production in 2027 and eventually employ as many as 4,000 people.

“That’s kinda neat to have that kind of auto business in our neighborhood,” says Wilson, who owns the Wiloe Home & Gift store in Plaza-Midwood. “We are an evolving, established neighborhood that appreciates history and our small businesses and closeness as neighbors. We want anyone who comes here to be part of that.”

“We think it’s a great sign for neighborhood development and economic growth in our area,” says Castelloe, who with his wife Michelle owns the Moxie Mercantile shop in Plaza-Midwood. “We’re absolutely thrilled to welcome them.”

The company says it is planning to make electric SUVs called “Travelers” and “Terra” trucks priced at $60,000 or less. Plug-in hybrid versions of Scout’s models are also planned. Blythewood is about 70 miles south of Charlotte and the North Carolina border.

A $5 million training hub at Midlands Tech Northeast, a community college in the Columbia area, recently opened to help train workers for the new plant. More than 14,000 people have sent emails expressing interest in working at Scout, Tim Hardee, president of South Carolina’s Technical College system, told The State newspaper in Columbia this week.

Scout CEO Scott Keogh told the Carolina Business Review TV program in Charlotte that the company’s headquarters could have “upwards of 1,000 high-paying jobs.” He is a veteran VW executive.

Elimination of tax incentives for electric vehicles and relatively high vehicle prices has prompted General Motors and other manufacturers to pull back on some of their EV plans. But Scout says it anticipated the changes and is ready to compete as more consumers favor EVs over gas-powered vehicles.

“We’re able to operate in this current environment because we’re set from the ground up to build in America, at our new facility in Blythewood, South Carolina,” Keogh told Car and Driver in September.

“Our intent always was exactly what we are seeing now with the administration and everything else. … Our product is coming in 2027 and 2028. The incentives were always going away in 2032. So there’s no way in the world we would build a so-called 50-year factory like we are in Blythewood based on a four-year window.”

Scout plans to sell vehicles directly to consumers, without a dealer network, which has sparked some lawsuits from some trade associations. North Carolina lawmakers have shown limited interest in allowing manufacturers to sell cars without dealer involvement, with the exception of EV pioneer Tesla.

Beyond its assembly plant, Scout this year announced a $300 million investment for a “supplier park” for smaller parts manufacturers to service the South Carolina factory.

Volkswagen Group had revenue of $353 billion in 2024. It sells more cars globally than any other company except Toyota.

The Commonwealth development is owned by Charlotte developer Crosland Southeast and asset manager Nuveen Real Estate, which is a subsidiary of TIAA. Crosland Southeast bought the mostly undeveloped 12-acre site in 2020 from a local real estate investor. It has built the Rowe apartment development there.

Parts of Plaza-Midwood are designated as historic by the city of Charlotte, which leads to more rigorous vetting of renovations in most Queen City neighborhoods.",https://images.businessnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Scout-Motors-3.png,N,,2025-11-12 14:04:00.509703

Jon Husted, R-Ohio, on Newsmax Wednesday praised Republicans and President Donald Trump for delivering tax relief, reviving American energy production, and lowering gas prices, saying those results are now clear for working families.

Husted said on “National Report” that Republicans “gave working families the largest tax cut they’ve ever had in American history … eliminated taxes on tips and overtime [and] cut taxes on Social Security.”

He added, “So we’re letting people keep more of what they earn.”

Husted also credited renewed energy production for easing costs at the pump.

“One of the things you see dramatically gone down since last year are gas prices because we eliminated all the [former President Joe] Biden-era prohibitions on drilling and so forth on energy,” Husted said.

Husted argued that Republicans have kept their promises, while Democrats “didn’t accomplish anything other than put people through 43 days of pain and unnecessary suffering” during the recent government shutdown.

“We finally, as Republicans, did what we said we would do,” he said.

Husted also criticized Democratic Party leadership, saying Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and his allies “got the Democrats into a shutdown that they could not get their way out of.”

He said it took “more moderate Democrats” to cross over and work with Republicans to reopen the government.

“The Democrats have been taken over by the radical left,” Husted said.

“Since Obamacare was put in place, healthcare inflation has been the number one driver of inflation in this country,” he added. “And the Democrats put that in place, not Republicans.”

He argued that Republicans can now show they are the party of affordability.

“We want to make healthcare more affordable,” Husted said. “We want to empower consumers, stop sending payments directly to insurance companies, and give consumers the ability to shop for their healthcare and drive down the cost.”

Husted said the GOP’s record proves its economic approach works.

“We’re responsible,” he said.

“We’re letting people keep more of what they earn. We’re attacking the bad policies that Democrats put in place and showing that there’s a pathway forward to make things more affordable.”

Meeting that demand while reducing emissions requires expanding every viable source of clean, firm energy. Nuclear power, with its ability to deliver reliable, firm zero-carbon electricity and heat at scale and speed, remains indispensable to that strategy.

At COP28 in Dubai, 22 nations pledged under the Net-Zero Nuclear (NZN) initiative to work toward tripling global nuclear capacity by 2050, marking a historic recognition of nuclear energy’s central role in achieving a clean energy future. Two years on, as the world attends COP30 in Belém, that commitment offers an opportunity to take stock of progress made.

From Washington to Brussels, governments are increasingly placing nuclear energy at the heart of their clean energy and industrial strategies. Yet progress since COP29 toward the NZN goal continues to face persistent hurdles, chiefly around financing, regulatory modernization, and supply chain readiness.

U.S. leads with ambitious federal push for nuclear expansion and innovation

The United States has made nuclear energy a pillar of its domestic and international climate and energy policy. The Trump 2.0 Administration’s “Make Atoms Great Again” agenda has reaffirmed the federal government’s commitment to scaling the sector, with executive orders aiming to quadruple U.S. nuclear capacity by 2050. The policy focus includes:

Accelerating the licensing and construction of new reactors, including advanced and small modular designs;

Modernizing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to accommodate next-generation technologies while maintaining independence and transparency;

Strengthening U.S. nuclear fuel supply chains to reduce reliance on foreign enrichment;

Expanding reactor exports to bolster U.S. global competitiveness; and

Building the American nuclear workforce to meet the growing demand for skilled engineers and operators.

These steps mark a clear ambition to deploy nuclear energy but, as we’ve previously outlined, achieving the Administration’s targets will require a far more muscular approach to deployment and financing. While the retention of key tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act is valuable, large-scale deployment will not happen without deeper federal involvement to reduce risk, streamline project delivery, and promote investment.

Specifically, the U.S. needs to focus on establishing clear “orderbooks” of standardized reactor builds that enable cost reductions through economies of scale, rather than focusing on isolated projects. Federal cost-overrun insurance and expanded use of tools like loan guarantees and power purchase agreements could help de-risk early projects. Without these measures, the Administration’s goal of quadrupling U.S. nuclear capacity will remain aspirational. Beyond policy, the U.S. Army’s plan to deploy microreactors to power domestic bases illustrates nuclear energy’s growing appeal for energy security and resilience applications.

In a historic first, Palisades nuclear plant set to restart operation

The Holtec Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan is entering the final phase of a historic restart, with commercial operations expected by late 2025. Following NRC approval and fuel delivery, Palisades will become the first U.S. nuclear plant ever restarted from decommissioning.

This milestone underscores the value of extending and revitalizing existing nuclear assets, opening new possibilities for other prematurely shuttered plants.

Europe’s political realignment anchors nuclear as key part of its energy strategy

Across Europe, political attitudes toward nuclear power are shifting rapidly. Once considered peripheral, nuclear energy is now seen as essential for decarbonization, competitiveness, and energy security.

The European Nuclear Alliance among Member States creates a powerful bloc pushing for technology-neutral policies across EU institutions. Even Germany’s participation as an observer marks a tentative but notable potential recalibration in its stance toward EU-wide nuclear policymaking.

Recent policy updates are also laying the foundation for a European nuclear resurgence:

Revised State Aid Rules from the European Commission have clarified how Member States can support nuclear energy through subsidies, contracts-for-difference (CfDs), and other mechanisms, recognizing nuclear’s strategic value to the bloc.

The Programme for Nuclear Energy (PINC) update assesses national commitments to deploy at least 60 GW of new large-scale nuclear capacity by 2050, which could be supplemented by dozens of gigawatts of SMR capacity depending on market conditions (See our recommendations here).

The European Industrial Alliance on SMRs released its Strategic Action Plan, advancing standardization, regulatory alignment, and supply chain development to accelerate deployment.

Meanwhile, the UK’s Final Investment Decision on Sizewell C and its selection of the Rolls-Royce SMR design for further development signal that Europe’s nuclear ambitions are translating into action.

Together, these steps are laying the foundation for nuclear energy to fulfill its role in delivering a secure, low-carbon energy mix across Europe, but concrete and actionable plans on financing, bolstering supply chains, readying the workforce, and standardizing regulatory frameworks are crucial to building on this momentum.

COP30 ambitions

At COP30, global ambitions to triple nuclear capacity remain strong, but implementation and financing lag behind political momentum. The past year has seen a remarkable convergence of political will in both the U.S. and Europe. The challenge now is to translate commitments into concrete deployments, ensure fit-for-purpose regulatory environments, and mobilize capital at scale.

With climate finance again high on the COP agenda, world leaders have an opportunity to anchor nuclear energy within broader climate investment frameworks, helping nations secure reliable, zero-carbon power while strengthening economic resilience.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/03150558/nuclear-playbook.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 13:02:45.772289

This evolution highlights an important principle: tax incentives should be temporary, targeted, and tied to performance, not permanent giveaways.","One of COP 30’s top priorities is boosting climate finance from both governments and private investors. Why is this especially crucial for emerging and developing economies?

Despite record-high investment in renewable energy last year, emerging and developing economies (EMDEs) face a USD 2.2 trillion financing gap each year through 2030 to meet their goals under the Paris Agreement. Countries need to attract investments that can lower emissions while expanding access to affordable energy and creating jobs. Unlike major emerging economies, such as China, India, or Brazil, which attract the majority of global renewable energy investment, the climate transition of many lower-income EMDEs continue to be held back by limited access to affordable finance, perceived country or sector-related risks, and weaker policy frameworks.

In response, mobilizing both public and private finance is crucial. Public financial support is needed to crowd in larger private investment, such as through targeted subsidies including incentives, budget transfers, concessional lending, and market mechanisms that reduce investment risks. This must go hand in hand with phasing out inefficient tax incentives for fossil fuels to level the playing field and encourage a shift by consumers and investors toward less polluting alternatives. Raising taxes on fossil fuels to reflect their social costs—through excise or carbon taxes can also accelerate the transition in an economically efficient way, provided that protections are in place for vulnerable groups.

What have governments already committed to in terms of renewable energy capacity?

At COP 28, 133 governments agreed to the collective goal to triple the world’s installed renewable energy generation capacity by 2030, taking into consideration different starting points and national circumstances. Limited fiscal space and rising debt require that public support be used strategically such as by lowering investment financing costs. The global FfD4 process has underscored the mounting pressure on public budgets and the need for more efficient deployment of resources.

Without this combination of public and private finance, emerging and developing economies cannot accelerate the energy transition in line with the COP 28 commitment.

What mechanisms at COP 30 could help scale green investment and turn commitments into action?

COP 30 has been framed by the Brazilian Presidency as a COP for implementation, where countries work to turn their climate commitments into action. This could be achieved through the Baku to Belém Roadmap to 1.3T, which sets out a plan for how climate finance from all sources can be scaled up to USD 1.3 trillion annually by 2035.

However, as IISD has noted, while the Baku to Belém Roadmap recognizes that phasing out environmentally harmful subsidies, including fossil fuel subsidies, can have long-term benefits, these points are not reflected in recommendations. This means we risk COP 30 becoming a missed opportunity for redirecting public finance from fossil fuels to renewables.

Ambitious reforms also require financial backing. At COP 30, a decision on Article 2.1(c) (the Paris Agreement’s goal on aligning financial flows with climate-resilient, low-carbon development pathways) is expected. For the past three years, the Sharm el-Sheikh dialogue on Article 2.1(c) has taken place, leading to greater understanding of what the Article means. However, more work remains to be done, and COP 30 could establish negotiations towards a framework for Article 2.1(c), perhaps under a work programme. A decision on Article 2.1(c) could contain a commitment to phase out public finance for fossil fuels to ensure investment is climate compatible.

COP 30 could also move the dial on strengthening public finances and growing governments’ fiscal space for climate action, for example through advancing the conversation on ambitious debt relief.

Tax policy is one tool for leveraging public resources to scale private investment. What role can the tax incentives play towards closing the green investment gap, especially in emerging and developing economies?

Tax incentives that target green investment, if strategically designed, can help lower the cost of capital for climate projects, unlocking private finance and accelerating renewable energy deployment. They already have in countries that use them well.

Designing strategically means shifting away from broad profit-based tax holidays toward incentives that address real investment constraints. Targeted tools like allowing businesses to write off the cost of renewable energy capital faster (“accelerated depreciation”), partial relief from import duties for certified green technologies, or time-limited tax credits for investment in energy grids and storage can really move the dial on climate projects through reducing upfront and operating costs.

What other levers should governments be using to mobilize private finance?

Incentives work best as part of a broader policy mix that includes planning, regulation, and infrastructure development. Without clear energy targets, ready energy grids, and streamlined permitting for energy projects, even generous incentives will fail to attract investment.

Tax policies are only one tool among many.

Countries also use many non-tax instruments to encourage clean energy investment, particularly for technologies that are already cost competitive, such as solar and onshore wind. Market-based mechanisms can provide the certainty that investors need without a large net impact on public finances.

These include measures that stabilize prices such as feed in premiums, contracts for difference, and auctions for long term power purchase agreements. Domestic and international public financing can reduce the high cost of capital that is common in many EMDEs. While some of these mechanisms can be more complex to administer than broad based tax incentives, they have proven effective in large EMDEs that are rapidly scaling up clean energy including Brazil, China, India, and Vietnam.

Policy stability and an enabling regulatory environment are also key to attracting investment.

How can countries ensure that green tax incentives achieve results for climate without eroding the tax base unnecessarily?

Our research shows that tax incentives deliver the strongest results in sectors with high upfront costs, such as early-stage renewables, storage, industrial efficiency, and mini-grids, rather than in mature technologies that already attract private investment. Focusing on these areas is where countries are most likely to see tangible results.

Countries can ensure that green tax incentives support climate goals without undermining revenues by focusing on efficiency, effectiveness, and targeting. Incentives should directly address barriers such as high upfront costs or technology risks, be time-bound and performance-linked, and include clear monitoring and review mechanisms.

Shifting from broad profit-based tax holidays to cost-based measures such as accelerated depreciation, which I explained earlier, or investment tax credits, makes sure the support catalyzes new investment rather than rewarding activity that would occur anyway. This is a strategic use of public resources, maximizing climate impact while maintaining fiscal sustainability.

Additionally, one of the key elements is tying tax incentives to real economic outcomes, like new capacity or job creation; or to environmental goals, with priority going to projects that fit a national green taxonomy and meet environmental and community consent standards.

Transparency throughout the process is also essential. Tax expenditure reporting at the economy-wide level helps governments track the fiscal cost of incentives by clearly presenting revenue forgone across sectors and bring other benefits. The Coalition on Tax Expenditures Reform launched by IISD and partners seeks to support countries in increasing reporting and evaluation of incentives.

You analyzed 35 different countries for the report ""The Use of Green Tax Incentives for Renewable Energy Deployment."" What trends did you spot in terms of countries’ use of tax incentives to drive green investment?

Our analysis reflects trends among smaller emerging and developing economies (excluding larger emerging economies such as China, India, or Brazil), where governments are increasingly using tax incentives to attract private investment into clean energy but are often challenged by limited fiscal space, weak targeting, and inconsistent implementation.

These countries continue to rely on profit-based tax holidays, which tend to be less effective in stimulating renewable energy investment. These incentives only apply once firms become profitable, yet in many lower-income markets, renewable projects often face long development timelines, grid connection delays, and high financing costs, which postpone or reduce taxable profits.

However, we also observe a gradual shift toward targeted, cost-based measures, with more countries adopting investment tax credits, accelerated depreciation, VAT exemptions and import duty relief for renewable energy components—policies that are more likely to be cost effective and better aligned with climate objectives.

What did you find on the design of these tax incentives?

The design of these tax incentives varies widely, and policy fragmentation remains a major issue. In many countries, incentives are scattered across investment laws, tax codes and special economic zone legislation, creating complexity for investors, and tax administration, and increasing the risk of overlapping or duplicate incentives. Very few countries include clear eligibility criteria, performance conditions or sunset clauses.

Most incentives we analyzed were open-ended and did not require any reporting on energy generation, job creation or emissions reductions. Without reporting requirements, governments have no reliable basis to assess whether tax incentives are delivering value for money or contributing to climate and development goals. As a result, it becomes difficult to evaluate tax expenditures, compare their cost-effectiveness against other policy tools, or justify their continuation when public finances already are squeezed.

Fresh data shows that, at the global scale, investment in renewable technologies and projects reached a record. To what extent have tax reforms helped make that happen, and what can EMDEs learn from it?

Indeed, global investment in renewable energy reached a record USD 2.1 trillion in 2024, up 11 percent from the previous year. Much of this growth came from large emerging economies.

China alone accounted for over one-third of global clean energy investment in 2024, and India is consistently among the top ten countries for renewable energy investment.

While it is difficult to isolate the specific impact of tax incentives, countries that combine fiscal measures with broader policy frameworks such as clear renewable energy targets, grid investments, and stable power purchase mechanisms tend to attract the highest levels of renewable energy investment. This has been an instrumental strategy in China, the European Union, and the United States, where extensive renewable energy support measures are in place.

Other successful strategies include India, which used accelerated depreciation, GST reductions for renewable components, and tax holidays in earlier phases to rapidly scale wind and solar, and South Africa introduced a 125 percent tax deduction for businesses investing in renewables, helping unlock new private-sector projects during its energy crisis. This measure complements the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme, which awards long-term power purchase agreements through competitive auctions to provide investment certainty. Together with other renewable energy fiscal policies, these initiatives illustrate how combining fiscal incentives with clear procurement frameworks can effectively mobilize private investment and advance broader development goals.

The United States showed how powerful tax incentives can be when combined with industrial strategy through the Inflation Reduction Act, which used production and investment tax credits to crowd in manufacturing and deployment.

The global trend also shows that successful countries adapt their tax incentives over time. China initially relied heavily on VAT rebates and tax holidays to build its solar manufacturing base but has gradually phased these out as the industry became globally competitive. India has taken a similar path unwinding broad tax breaks as its renewables market matured and shifting toward more targeted measures, like reverse auctions for deployment of renewables and production linked incentives, viability gap funding, and concessional lending for manufacturing.

This evolution highlights an important principle: tax incentives should be temporary, targeted, and tied to performance, not permanent giveaways. For emerging and developing economies, this is especially critical given limited fiscal space and competing public priorities. Incentives must therefore be designed to catalyze private investment without compromising revenue sustainability, ensuring that scarce public resources are used efficiently and can continue to support essential development and social spending.",https://www.iisd.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/2025-11/solar-energy-kenya.jpg?itok=78Agcr4K,N,,2025-11-12 13:02:49.261652

The event was held nearly four years after Toyota unveiled plans to build a hybrid and electric battery factory on an 1,800-acre megasite near the small Randolph County town of Liberty, about 20 miles south of Greensboro. The automaker started its first production line in January and shipped its first car batteries from the Liberty facility in the spring.

Toyota says it currently employs around 2,500 workers and runs four hybrid battery production lines at the facility. Company officials say that by 2034 the local headcount should exceed 5,000.

The site is the largest economic project North Carolina has ever backed with state incentives, in terms of capital investment. Under its job development investment grant, Toyota targets spending $13.9 billion on the facility. Toyota aims to eventually operate 14 lithium-ion battery production lines across seven buildings at the site called Toyota Battery Manufacturing, North Carolina. Per its grant, Toyota must pay workers an average wage of at least $62,234.

Between state and local incentives, Toyota is poised to receive around $439 million in payroll tax breaks if it meets its minimum investment and job creation targets by 2029.

Specific production lines will be tailored to support hybrid, plug-in hybrid and all-electric vehicles. Toyota has prioritized hybrid vehicles over fully-electric cars — both globally and at its North Carolina factory — a decision company officials say has been advantageous as electric vehicle demand in recent years has weakened and federal EV tax credits ended this year under the Republican-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

“We’ll follow market demand,” said Don Stewart, president of Toyota North Carolina.

Toyota shipped its first hybrid batteries to a Mazda Toyota plant in Huntsville, Alabama for the Corolla Cross SUV. It also supplies batteries for the Camry in Georgetown, Kentucky, and will eventually send them to Canada for the RAV4.

Among the speakers in Randolph County were Gov. Josh Stein, U.S. Sen. Ted Budd, and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.

During the ceremony, Toyota announced it would invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years, a move Duffy credited to President Donald Trump’s trade policy approach. “President Trump has asked the world to make investments in America, because when companies invest in America, that means great American jobs,” he said.

Toyota officials later told reporters they were not aware of how much, if any, of this additional Toyota spending will be in North Carolina.

Slowly but surely, China will be replaced by India, Southeast Asia, Latin America and a few other emerging countries.

“None of these countries alone will replace China, but together they will be the drives of global energy demand growth in the years to come.”

Unsurprisingly, solar PV looks set to be a key component in meeting this shifting energy demand in the years to come.

The IEA report sets out four scenarios, which Birol highlighted are not forecasts, but potential scenarios, that could determine global power demand and usage: the Current Policies Scenario (CPS), the least ambitious scenario that takes into account policies and regulations already in place in the energy sector; the Stated Policies Scenario (SPS), which takes into account policies that have been announced but not yet implemented; the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, which includes measures necessary to reach net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2025; and the Accelerating Clean Cooking and Electricity Services Scenario (ACCESS), which provides a roadmap to achieve universal access to electricity and clean cooking.

The graphs below demonstrate the potential energy mix, for selected technologies, in both the CPS and SPS cases, with oil set to lead the world in energy generation in both cases. However, the SPS case suggests an additional seven exajoules (EJ) of solar will be in operation by 2040, and an additional 13EJ by 2050, compared to the CPS case. In both scenarios, the world’s solar generation is expected to outpace its combined wind and hydro generation by 2050.

A key driving force behind this trend will be the continued low levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) for the solar sector. The report notes that, since 2010, the LCOE of solar PV has fallen by 90%, in line with a 90% decline in battery energy storage systems (BESS) and greater than the 70% decline in wind. Between 2024 and 2035, the IEA report expects solar costs to decline by a further 40%, compared to 30% for BESS and 10% for wind, suggesting that solar PV will continue to be the most cost-effective form of electricity generation in the decade to come.

Crucially, the report adds that in the SPS case, the projected cost for new solar PV and wind projects have “similar or lower average generation costs” than new coal, gas and nuclear projects in the US, EU and China, suggesting that renewables will soon be on par with conventional fossil fuels in regions with some of the largest energy generation systems in the world.

The report also notes that the co-location of BESS and solar PV is likely to be the most financially viable clean energy technology in the years to come, which echoes a sentiment expressed by others in the sector. The rapid deployment of PV capacity has led to grid curtailment challenges and price collapses in several markets, and many commentators have suggested that better integration of BESS can help sidestep grid issues and improve the bankability of solar projects.

Indeed, the IEA report notes that, by 2035, pairing solar PV with a 4-hour BESS will be “more competitive than standalone PV in major markets, as the added value of dispatchability outweighs the additional cost”.

Growing electricity demand

The increasing cost-competitiveness of solar PV comes as the world’s energy demand is likely to grow and change. The report notes that in the CPS scenario, total energy demand will grow by 14% by 2035, while in the SPS scenario it will grow by 8% by the same year, and Laura Cozzi, IEA director of sustainability, technology and outlooks, said today that in all scenarios, demand for electricity “accelerates significantly”.

“Electricity demand growth from now to 2035 is nearly identical in our two SPS scenarios [to] 10,000TWh, [which is] the electricity that is consumed today in the US, Canada, all of Europe, Japan, Korea and Australia,” said Cozzi. “This will be added in just ten years, and is a very big shift that will demand a lot of investments and planning.”

“We can comfortably say that the age of electricity has arrived,” added Birol, who went on to suggest that the “spectacular” growth in energy demand could create opportunities for the solar sector in particular, as many countries with growing electricity demand have significant potential for new solar deployments.

“Solar is going to play a pivotal role,” he said. “It is also important to see that the bulk of the electricity demand growth will come from the countries where we see a huge amount of solar radiation—they are solar-rich countries—and we see solar electricity playing an important role here, together with other renewables, such as wind, geothermal and hydropower.”

A combination of an ageing and declining population in China will also limit the growth of electricity demand. The report notes that, between 2010 and 2024, China’s total final energy consumption increased by over 2EJ; this is projected to fall to less than 1EJ between 2024 and 2035 in the SPS case, and then decline into the negative between 2035 and 2050.

The decline is even more stark in the “advanced economies” category, which saw negligible year-on-year increases in final energy consumption between 2000 and 2010, and has seen year-on-year declines in energy consumption since 2010, which the IEA notes could persist until 2050 in the SPS case.

Data centres an ‘important driver’ of power demand

The report’s authors also highlighted that data centres are likely to be significant contributors to changing energy demand; this year, the world is expected to invest US$580 billion into data centres, compared to US$540 billion in oil.

“Data centres are an important driver, especially in the US, where they account for more than 50% of demand growth in the next decade,” explained Cozzi. The report adds that globally, data centre electricity consumption is expected to double by 2030. While they will only account for less than 10% of global electricity demand growth between 2024 and 2030, the doubling of consumption is a striking trend.

The graphs above, from the IEA, show how the US and advanced economies will drive electricity demand growth from data centres in the next five years for the SPS case, and how data centres will see greater growth in electricity demand than sectors such as heating, which in this case refers to space and water heating in buildings.

The IEA report notes that, in the SPS case, renewable power will account for 45% of the growth in electricity supply to meet data centre demand through to 2035, totalling nearly 40TWh. This percentage is slightly power in the CPS case, of just 40%, but this is still a larger percentage than any other fuel type.

Solar under-production

While the report points to several examples of significant potential for growth in the renewable energy industry in general, and the solar sector in particular, it notes that current economic systems do not facilitate the kind of growth in renewable energy deployment necessary to meet the more ambitious scenarios.

The report points to “significant surplus capacity” for module manufacturing in China, which has contributed to a downturn in both module manufacturers’ profits and significant reductions in manufacturing output. The IEA report notes that, in 2024, Chinese module manufacturers had a nameplate production capacity of over 1,000GW, accounting for the majority of the world’s nameplate production capacity, but actually produced closer to 600GW. The same trend is true for other clean energy technologies—battery cells saw production drop to less than half of its nameplate capacity—and this highlights the challenges associated with generating profits in the current economic climate.

“Market forces alone are not going to deliver that resilience and diversity that we need [in supply chains],” said IEA chief economist Tim Gould during the launch of the report. “There is a need for coordinated, determined policy action to enhance preparedness against potential disruptions, but also to build up new partnerships and projects that diversify supply chains more quickly, and this will continue to be a very important focus for the IEA.”

Cozzi noted that there are “at least 42 countries” currently implementing or changing energy regulations to better position renewables to deliver profits in the coming years, and Birol explained that challenges in “the political domain” will need to be overcome in order to meet some of the world’s more ambitious clean energy deployment targets as the 2050 goals loom ever larger.

“When we look at climate change, I see two trends, both of them in the political domain,” said Birol. “I talked with several government leaders, business leaders and others, and I see that the priority given to climate change at the national level is at a decline in most cases. At the same time, of course, we know that 2024 was the hottest year in history. The current policy scenario is almost in line with a [temperature rise] of three degrees Celsius.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iea.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 14:03:13.144569

The federal tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are set to expire at the end of 2025, making the remaining months of this year the final opportunity to complete eligible projects.

Homeowners can claim these federal tax credits when filing their taxes in early 2026 for any qualifying projects completed in 2025. Many of these upgrades also qualify for cash incentives from Energy Trust of Oregon, a nonprofit that helps people, businesses and communities use less energy and save money. Combining tax credits and incentives allows homeowners to get the deepest possible savings.

Along with lowering energy bills, these changes help make your home more comfortable inside. Energy efficiency improvements eligible for both the federal tax credits and Energy Trust incentives include:

Insulation: Adding or updating insulation on your attic, walls and floors can keep your heated or cooled air inside, meaning your system doesn’t have to work as hard.

Windows: Replacing older windows with energy efficient ones can keep your home more comfortable by keeping the air in and preventing drafts.

Heating and cooling: Heating and cooling your home is likely one of your biggest home energy expenses, so upgrading to modern, energy efficient units like heat pumps are a great way to keep energy costs low.

Water heating: Switching from a traditional water heater to a more efficient heat pump water heater uses much less energy to heat your water (often the second largest energy expense after heating and cooling).

Home energy audit: Credits can cover the cost of a professional energy “check-up” for your home. During the audit, an energy auditor uses tools to monitor temperature and moisture in your home and advises on the best upgrades to make, where your home is using energy efficiently and where energy may be wasted.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement federal tax credit offers two separate caps for tax credits, allowing homeowners to claim a total of up to $3,200 on their 2026 taxes from projects finished before December 31, 2025. The general cap with a maximum of $1,200, covers upgrades like insulation, windows, doors and home energy audits. Additionally, there’s a separate cap of $2,000 for installing an electric heat pump or heat pump water heater.

To claim the federal tax credits when filing a 2025 tax return, homeowners must have receipts and the manufacturer’s certification statements for all upgraded products. The process involves filling out a Form 5695 through the IRS website or tax prep software and filling in the details of energy-efficient improvements made at home in 2025 that qualify. Afterward, consult a tax professional to ensure everything is correct and ensure you’re able to qualify for as many savings as you’re eligible to claim.

Energy Trust does not give tax advice. Consult your tax professional for current information on credits available and how to apply.

Think of it as bringing together great minds, passionate about providing safe drinking water, wastewater services, and more from around North Carolina.

Let’s set the scene: The convention center was transformed with signs featuring large arrows directing attendees to classrooms and various halls to hear from speakers. In the main exhibition hall, rows of booths snaked through the room, each focusing on a different aspect of water. In addition to the numerous opportunities to meet other like-minded water professionals, several competitions were held among municipalities, including ""Best Tasting Water,"" Hydrant Hysteria, and Pipe Tapping

Of course, our Raleigh Water teams participated in the friendly challenges, and here’s how we ranked:

Hydrant Hysteria:

A fast-paced competition where two-member teams race to assemble a specific hydrant as quickly as possible. Teams are also judged on whether all parts are assembled correctly and function properly. Yes, a loose bolt can cost your team precious time.

This year, Raleigh Water’s women’s team was coached by Meriam Manuel, a five-year veteran of the competition, though this was her first time coaching. The two-person team consisted of Jennifer Anderson, who has participated for three years, and Sarah Calverley, a rookie this year. The women’s team placed second.

The men’s team was led by Josh Bennett, who has competed for two years and was also coaching for the first time. The team included Jeffrey Tennant, returning for his second year, and Jason Talton, a first-time competitor. The men’s team placed third.

Pipe Tapping:

In this timed competition, teams of three workers and one coach compete to tap a pressurized ductile iron pipe and install a water service line.

Raleigh Water’s team consisted of Kyle Bates (first-year competitor), Myles Dawson, Ricky Shanks (both returning for a second year), and coach Jeremy Isgrigg, who has been with Raleigh Water since 2005. The men’s team placed third with a time of 2:18.3.

Isgrigg was proud of his team, saying, ""Every team always puts in so much effort. It’s clear to see that many members put in double duty outside of their everyday work to commit to the team and practice, going above and beyond.”

Best Tasting Water Competition:

Utilities submitted two-liter water samples drawn from their distribution systems for judges to taste and evaluate against other utilities.

This year, the E.M. Johnson Water Treatment Plant secured third place in the state water-tasting competition.

Raleigh Water is dedicated to providing our customers with the highest standards of water quality, and we are proud of the hard work from our teams this year. Congratulations to all!",https://raleighnc.govcover.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 15:03:39.197106

NESE is a 25-mile natural gas pipeline expansion project certificated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that is intended to deliver 400,000 dekatherms per day of natural gas produced in Pennsylvania to local distribution company customers in New York City through new facilities in Middlesex County, New Jersey and an underwater segment traversing the Raritan and Lower New York Bays.

NESE initially received a certificate of public convenience and necessity from FERC for the project in 2019 under the Natural Gas Act (NGA), but its project sponsor ultimately canceled the project without initiating construction due to an inability to secure CWA and flood hazard permits from New York and New Jersey that were required by FERC. In 2025, following the President’s declaration of an Energy Emergency in Executive Order No. 14156 (E.O. 14156), Transco applied to reinstate the 2019 certificate, relying on FERC’s prior environmental analysis. FERC granted the requested relief on August 28, 2025, and reauthorized the project under NGA section 7.

New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, stated that the NYSDEC’s decision is consistent with her administration’s “all of the above approach” to addressing grid reliability and affordability. State officials also may be concerned about future actions by the federal government to force infrastructure development in the Northeast region in line with statements made in E.O. 14156, and seek to take greater control to maintain a level of state autonomy for federally permitted projects. Additional Northeast pipeline projects are anticipated to materialize.

Toyota opens its first EV battery plant in the US

After the first batteries rolled off the production line at its new facility in Liberty, North Carolina, on Wednesday, Toyota said today marks a “pivotal moment” in the company’s history. The facility is Toyota’s 11th plant in the US and its first battery plant outside of Japan.

Toyota first announced plans to build EV batteries in the US almost four years ago. The nearly $14 billion facility will create up to 5,100 jobs in the area.

In addition, the Japanese auto giant announced plans to invest an additional $10 billion in its US operations over the next five years. Since it first arrived in the US nearly 70 years ago, Toyota has invested close to $60 billion.

“Today’s launch of Toyota’s first US battery plant and additional US investment up to $10 billion marks a pivotal moment in our company’s history,” Toyota Motor North America’s CEO, Ted Ogawa, said at the event.

The mega site spans 1,850 acres, or about the size of 121 football fields, and can produce up to 30 GWh annually. Toyota will use the hub to develop and build lithium-ion batteries for its growing lineup of “electrified” vehicles, including battery electric (EV), plug-in hybrid (PHEV), and hybrid (HEV) models.

Batteries from the plant will power the new Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, RAV4 HEV, and Toyota’s yet-to-be-announced three-row electric SUV.

The North Carolina battery plant houses 14 production lines, but Toyota said it plans to add more to the facility by 2030.

Toyota is already shipping HEV modules to its plant in Kentucky and Mazda Toyota Manufacturing in Alabama. It currently assembles 11 HEVs and PHEVs in the US.

In addition, the company throughout November will provide another $500,000 to at least 60 feeding programs statewide amid funding uncertainties as colder weather and the holiday season approaches

Since 2021, Duke Energy and the Foundation have dedicated more than $2.6 million to support the efforts of these agencies

Duke Energy and Duke Energy Foundation are contributing $100,000 to the One SC Fund recently activated by Gov. Henry McMaster to support food banks across the state.

Why it matters: As colder weather and the holidays approach, many South Carolina families turn to assistance programs that help support those facing hunger. But those programs are facing challenges of their own to support this tremendous need. That is why it is important to support the organizations that do this great work.

What they are saying

Gov. Henry McMaster: ""Duke Energy's contribution to the One SC Fund highlights the very best of South Carolina. At a time when many families are facing uncertainty, Team South Carolina is coming together to support our food banks and put food on the table. I'm grateful for their generosity and hope it will encourage others to join our effort to help families in need.""

Tim Pearson, Duke Energy's South Carolina president: ""These organizations are fighting the good fight every day in communities across our state, but they cannot do it alone. Duke Energy is happy to stand with the governor, and we encourage other corporate entities, organizations and citizens across the state to help support the fight against hunger.""

Bottom line: Duke Energy's support of these organizations and the issue of hunger in the Palmetto State is nothing new. Starting next week, Duke Energy, with support from Duke Energy Foundation, will kick off the company's monthlong annual campaign to support organizations in South Carolina that address food insecurities and inequities. The fifth year of the initiative will provide over $500,000 to more than 60 feeding programs leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday and culminate in final surprise grant announcements on Giving Tuesday.

Zoom in: This campaign is in addition to the support of the One SC Fund and will highlight critical community partners that do this incredible work to fight hunger, including Harvest Hope Food Bank, Mill Village Farms, Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina, FoodShare South Carolina and AIM, among many others. Duke Energy employees will also provide their time and talents volunteering with organizations throughout the month.

Go deeper: Customers struggling to put food on the table are also likely making decisions about what bills to pay at home, including their electricity bill. That is why it is important to also offer information that can assist families to manage their energy bills when times are tough.

EPA specifically asked for comments on the elimination of reporting requirements for four categories: suppliers of carbon dioxide, geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide, injection of carbon dioxide and geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide with enhanced oil recovery.
But ethanol producers say if finalized, the proposal could wreak havoc with carbon capture projects that can significantly lower ethanol's carbon intensity.
Also, it would be more difficult to make use of the $85-per-ton 45Q tax credit in the IRA for permanently stored CO2.
The company’s efforts have stalled, in large part because South Dakota approved a law prohibiting use of eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines.","Carbon capture advocates are objecting to an EPA proposal to scrap a greenhouse gas reporting requirement for dozens of industrial sectors, arguing that energy tax credits would be negatively affected.

“The potential wholesale rescission of the [Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP)] threatens to destabilize the fuels market, disrupt ongoing and planned projects, and ultimately undercut the significant investments that are helping to revive America's energy dominance,” Wayne Garrett, general manager of Chief Ethanol Fuels in Hastings, Nebraska, said in comments submitted to the agency.

EPA’s September proposal would eliminate reporting requirements for 46 industrial sources of greenhouse gases, including carbon capture, storage and utilization (CCUS), ammonia and lime manufacturing and phosphoric acid production.

The agency said in the proposal there is no statutory requirement to collect GHG emissions information for sectors other than the petroleum and natural gas source category, which are subject to the Waste Emissions Charge in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. That law imposed an annual charge on methane emissions from large emitters in the oil and natural gas sector, but delayed implementation until 2034.

EPA specifically asked for comments on the elimination of reporting requirements for four categories: suppliers of carbon dioxide, geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide, injection of carbon dioxide and geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide with enhanced oil recovery.

But ethanol producers say if finalized, the proposal could wreak havoc with carbon capture projects that can significantly lower ethanol's carbon intensity. Also, it would be more difficult to make use of the $85-per-ton 45Q tax credit in the IRA for permanently stored CO2.

If the reporting program is repealed, ""most investors and lenders would cease deploying capital into new CCUS projects until a replacement reporting mechanism is established,” American Carbon Alliance CEO Tom Buis said in comments. “Without certainty on how to measure, report, and verify emissions reductions under section 45Q, the CCUS industry will be paralyzed, jeopardizing the administration’s energy dominance priorities.”

Many companies involved in CCUS that are seeking the sequestration tax credit under 45Q, in addition to those pursuing the clean hydrogen production tax credit under section 45V, “currently rely heavily on the GHGRP's reporting mechanisms to provide verifiable evidence of the amount of CO2 they have successfully sequestered or prevented from being emitted through their projects,” Buis said.

Summit Carbon Solutions, which has been struggling for years to persuade landowners to allow use of their land for a planned 2,500-mile carbon dioxide pipeline, is an ACA member. The company’s efforts have stalled, in large part because South Dakota approved a law prohibiting use of eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines.

Chief Ethanol Fuels' Garrett said use of Section 45Z, a tax credit for low-carbon transportation fuels, also could be imperiled.

The Treasury Department and IRS haven't finalized rules clarifying the 45Z requirements for monitoring, reporting and verifying CI reductions attributable to carbon capture and sequestration, he said. However, ""we believe it is likely the agencies will adopt an approach that is similar to the approach required for both 45Q and the section 45V clean hydrogen production tax credit (i.e., in cases where CCS is employed by the clean hydrogen producer).""

The GHGRP “is a well-established and accepted reporting mechanism within the carbon management industry that, if eliminated, would leave taxpayers unable to claim 45Q,” Christian Flinn, public policy manager at the Carbon Capture Coalition, said at a public hearing last month.

Flinn cited 19 “commercial-scale facilities with the capacity to capture more than 21 million metric tons of CO2 per year” and said 45Q “has spurred over $77 billion in investments across announced and operating projects.”

Savings from elimination of requirement questioned

EPA said eliminating the reporting requirements would save industries $303 million per year through 2033. But commenters who objected to the proposal said those savings aren’t substantial, given that more than 8,000 facilities participate in the program.

The law firm White & Case said compliance costs are about $50 million for industries other than petroleum and natural gas. “When that figure is spread across all of the companies required to report, the total annual cost of the program appears to be fairly modest for most of the regulated industries,” the firm’s analysis says.

In addition, Flinn said EPA’s own estimate shows that compliance costs are “negligible compared to the scale of industry investment.”

“It is already standard practice for facilities that capture, sell, and store CO2 to measure the volume of CO2 in question thanks to widely available, cost-effective equipment installed at these facilities,” he said. “Therefore, for large and small companies engaged in the CO2 supply chain, reporting this information requires minimal additional effort.”

In addition to the carbon capture implications, the proposal has fertilizer manufacturers concerned.

Some members of The Fertilizer Institute take advantage of both 45Q and 45V tax credits; the latter apply to hydrogen. “Without an adequate replacement methodology in place by Treasury/IRS to meet its statutory obligations, The group's members may be unable to demonstrate the ability to qualify for these tax credits,” Tom Lynch, TFI senior vice president of government affairs, said in comments.

TFI recommended EPA keep some of the industrial sources in the reporting program on a voluntary basis for at least a year to allow the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service to put an alternative reporting system in place.

“A short-term voluntary GHGRP would provide near-term certainty to operators of active projects seeking to claim credits, allow industry time to agree upon a suitable replacement methodology and give Treasury/IRS further time to develop effective guidance replacing the GHGRP for future tax years,” Lynch said in comments.

TFI also encouraged EPA to work with the Commerce Department, U.S. Trade Representative, Treasury and industry “to ensure that a framework is provided to support the export of low-carbon products. Currently, the GHGRP – and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies (GREET) model on which it relies – “aids in the ability of U.S. exports of energy and other low-carbon manufacturing exports to key allies by providing a well-respected path for exporters to document emissions.”

The North Dakota Ethanol Producers Association also strongly opposes getting rid of the GHGRP for carbon capture.

“The proposed changes would create significant uncertainty for ongoing and future carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects that are essential to the ethanol industry’s success and to advance national decarbonization goals,” the group said in a letter. Signatories include association officers from Guardian Energy Hankinson, Harvestone Low Carbon Partners, Tharaldson Ethanol Plant, Gevo North Dakota and BI Biorefinery.

The repository for the carbon dioxide from Summit’s proposed pipeline, which has 57 ethanol plants signed up, is in North Dakota.

“Repealing these requirements would invalidate approved [monitoring, reporting and verification] plans, discourage new investment, and diminish ethanol’s role as a low-carbon, homegrown fuel under the Renewable Fuel Standard and emerging clean fuel markets,” they said.

Chief Ethanol Fuels' Garrett said, ""the lower CI resulting from CCS helps ethanol remain highly competitive in U.S. and global markets where carbon reduction is required or rewarded, often opening significant new revenue streams for ethanol producers."" He urged EPA to retain a voluntary reporting program.",https://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/2024/Red-Trail-Energy-plant-Gevo.png?height=635&t=1762894216&width=1200,N,,2025-11-12 16:01:08.295794

Climate anxiety different from general anxiety Imagine you leave the house in the morning, and realize you left the stove on.
”I can’t just flip a switch around climate change.” The anxiety is more complex than a stove left on, because climate change is a more complex problem.
Climate anxiety is cyclical, because the sources of anxiety keep coming, and so does the need for coping mechanisms and actions.
Newman said that there isn't an easy switch between climate anxiety and climate optimism.","Every autumn, news feeds get flooded with stories about climate change. That's because around this time each year, global leaders gather to discuss collective efforts to limit our emissions of planet-warming gases, released primarily from oil, gas and coal.

Some of the information coming out of the COP30 conference is bleak. But it's not just COP. Climate stories can be difficult to consume year-round, whether it's about natural disasters, victims of heat waves or sea level rise or new studies about global warming impacts.

“When you throw a ton of scary facts and information at people, their nervous system shuts down. It’s a coping mechanism,” said Sarah Newman, founder and executive director of the Climate Mental Health Network.

That sense of dread, doom, fear or hopelessness gets lumped into a single term: climate anxiety. Surveys from the American Psychiatric Association have repeatedly shown that a significant amount of Americans experience climate anxiety.

Dealing with it, just like dealing with climate change, is an ongoing process. Here's how to get started.

Climate anxiety different from general anxiety

Imagine you leave the house in the morning, and realize you left the stove on. There's a fire hazard at home, and you're feeling anxious about it. So you turn around and switch it off. The problem is solved, and so is your anxiety.

Climate change doesn't work that way.

It activates different parts of the brain, according to a study published by the National Institutes of Health. While Generalized Anxiety Disorder often involves the part of the brain that handles fear, threat and emotion, climate anxiety activates parts of the brain that help with high cognition, willpower and tenacity.

“It’s an ongoing larger problem that I need to attend to over time and that is largely out of my control,” climate psychologist Thomas Doherty said. ”I can’t just flip a switch around climate change.”

The anxiety is more complex than a stove left on, because climate change is a more complex problem. The threat is indefinite, it’s largely out of each person’s control and addressing it requires repeated and variable action.

Doherty, who wrote a book about coping with climate anxiety, said that it isn't inherently negative. It's a natural reaction to a threat, and it's the first step in a cyclical relationship with climate change.

“The rest of the cycle is ultimately taking some action to resolve the threat as best that we can,” he said.

First, cope and connect

Newman said that one of the most effective ways to combat climate anxiety is to find other people who are experiencing it too, and to talk about it.

Every year, New York City hosts something called Climate Week. Folks from all over descend upon Manhattan for hundreds of events and panels on energy, the environment and climate change.

Between 15 and 20 people showed up to one event about finding connection and hope in the face of climate change. It was intimate, but so is confiding feelings of dread and isolation with a room full of strangers.

“How many of you wake up in the morning with feelings of despair or hopelessness?” asked the leader at the front of the room.

Just about every hand sheepishly went up.

“Not just in the morning!” said a man in the front row. And an awkward chuckle of understanding swept through the room.

That group was addressing what Doherty said is one of the greatest risks of climate anxiety: isolation.

“Just like working on any problem, any issue, once you have a team around you, then you feel better. You’re not alone. You feel stronger,” he said.

Meetups such as Climate Cafes or groups like Climate Psychology Alliance have online and in-person events where people can share experiences and build resilience together.

Much of Newman's work with the Climate Mental Health Network is about bringing people together to combat that feeling of isolation.

“When people start to recognize that, they’re not alone with what they’re feeling,” she said. “There’s an opportunity for people to move from that helpless state to one of empowerment.”

Many general anxiety treatments relate to calming the body and clearing the head, and Doherty said that all of those work with climate anxiety.

“It’s our same body. Our same brain, our same heart rate, blood pressure, our same ways of thinking,” he said.

Immediate grounding exercises include the 3-3-3 technique, where you name three things you see, three you hear and three parts of your body that you can move. Another one is the 5-4-3-2-1 technique, where you identify five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell and one thing you can taste.

Doherty also recommends prioritizing rest and exercise, going outside in nature and focusing on the present moment. He calls all of those practices basic mental hygiene.

Then, find a purpose

Doherty recommended channeling climate concern into something controllable, such as the impacts of climate change in your neighborhood, or even in your home.

“Take care of my own garden so to speak, before I try to plant a garden somewhere else,” he said.

That starts with something Doherty calls ceremonial actions. They don't meaningfully change the world, but they're easy, they can be repeated, they align with a person's values and make them feel better, like picking up litter or bringing reusable bags to the grocery store.

Then those ceremonial actions fuel the desire and resilience needed for something larger, like getting rid of the gas appliances in the house, which could take years to afford and invest in. The U.N. lists 10 actions to reduce a person's impact on the planet.

Climate anxiety is cyclical, because the sources of anxiety keep coming, and so does the need for coping mechanisms and actions. Newman said that there isn't an easy switch between climate anxiety and climate optimism.

“I still carry those emotions and I still have the worry and I have the anger and I have the sadness, but I’m able to live with them in a different way,” she said.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/12/PDTN/87231816007-ap-25315625869852.jpg?crop=5999,3375,x0,y200&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-12 13:03:05.681628

Against this backdrop, we should be thinking about how data centers can stack functions for sustainability, efficiency and community benefit.
These kinds of data centers offer some unexpected possibilities with respect to sustainability and social impact.
Pairing data centers with greenhouse agriculture and carbon-utilization operations changes that equation by adding growers, controls technicians, energy operators, logistics staff and trainers.
But any serious national strategy must grapple head-on with energy and water sustainability along with community resilience.","Tim Ryan is a former 10-term Democratic member of Congress from Ohio. Shawn Cutter is a sixth-generation Ohio farmer and an entrepreneur in the energy and tech sectors.

This year, a wave of state laws is reshaping how America builds data centers. Ohio’s HB 15, effective in August, fast-tracks power build-out and microgrids for large loads. Texas’s SB 6, in effect since July, makes mega-load data centers responsible for interconnection costs and makes them curtail-ready when the grid is stressed. Massachusetts just approved incentives that grant long-term sales tax relief to major facilities, and Colorado is also moving toward rebates for certified projects tied to jobs and energy benchmarks.

It’s good news that states are thinking strategically about accelerating data center development. All this is essential for the advancement of artificial intelligence and for American competitiveness vis-à-vis China. But speed alone won’t solve the harder problems. States now need creativity to meet the moment with respect to data centers: concrete plans for where the power, water and grid capacity will come from, as well as how to create good jobs and benefit communities and the environment.

Analysts at the International Energy Agency recently projected that U.S. data center electricity use could more than double within five years. By 2030, these facilities may draw nearly 9% of America’s total power — putting pressure on grids and pushing up rates without major new investment.

The squeeze isn’t limited to electricity. By 2027, AI-related water consumption is forecast to equal more than half of the U.K.’s annual use. Researchers at the University of California, Riverside estimate a ChatGPT session of 5–50 prompts can consume up to 500ml of water. Google used 20% more water in 2022 than in 2021 as it scaled AI; Microsoft’s usage rose 34% in the same period. Communities are also pushing back on new data centers over noise, water draw and thin long-term job creation.

Against this backdrop, we should be thinking about how data centers can stack functions for sustainability, efficiency and community benefit. And state governments, along with the federal government and municipalities, should be thinking about how to maximize these kinds of benefits.

In the face of long permitting timelines and firm-power needs, many new campuses are adding “behind-the-meter” power plants. These kinds of data centers offer some unexpected possibilities with respect to sustainability and social impact. For example, imagine capturing server heat and CO2 and putting them to work fueling nearby industrial-scale greenhouses that produce fresh, high-quality food. Elevated CO2 in greenhouses accelerates photosynthesis and boosts yields; recovered heat keeps crops warm through winter. That means local tomatoes, lettuce and herbs in a Northeast or Midwest January powered by data center byproducts. Because these sites often land in less dense areas with ample space, they can supply rural food deserts, strengthening local economies.

When crops require less CO2 in summer, excess carbon can be converted into fuel like clean hydrogen. Emerging capture and electrolysis pathways can turn emissions into hydrogen for backup systems, fuel cells or even local fleets. Organic greenhouse waste can be composted or turned into biochar on site, improving soils, locking away carbon and feeding the next growing cycle. In short: Stack multiple sustainability functions and turn liabilities into assets.

Water is another overlooked opportunity. Vast, flat roofs — often 100,000 square feet or more — are perfect for rainwater harvesting. One inch of rain on 50,000 square feet yields over 30,000 gallons, meaning significant offsets for cooling and irrigation. Captured rain can feed cooling towers and greenhouses, cutting municipal draw. Leaders like Google and Microsoft are beginning to show what this can look like in practice.

On jobs, today’s critique is fair: A 250,000-square-foot facility may employ up to 1,500 people during construction but only around 50 full-time operators thereafter. Pairing data centers with greenhouse agriculture and carbon-utilization operations changes that equation by adding growers, controls technicians, energy operators, logistics staff and trainers. These integrated campuses can run apprenticeships and hands-on programs in data operations, energy management and controlled-environment agriculture, creating durable jobs and deeper community roots.

We’re entering the largest infrastructure build-out in a generation. The choices we make about emissions, water and local economies matter. We’ve risen to moments like this before: the Tennessee Valley Authority and Rural Electrification Act brought affordable power to every farmhouse. The Erie Canal and interstate system rewired commerce. Apollo turned slide-rule sketches into a moon landing in under a decade. Each looked audacious at the start. Each expanded what was possible.

AI infrastructure now calls for a leap of similar ambition. If we pair capacity with on-site microgrids, rain-harvesting roofs, carbon-fed greenhouses, hydrogen production, workforce academies and other innovations, we can scale AI without undermining communities or nature.

It’s not just states that are pushing ahead with policies to accelerate data center development. In late July, the Trump administration unveiled its AI Action Plan, proposing reduced environmental requirements and faster permitting to speed construction of data centers and supporting power infrastructure. The new AI Action Plan contains sensible elements. But any serious national strategy must grapple head-on with energy and water sustainability along with community resilience.

The “megabill” passed this summer surprisingly retained one important environmental provision from the Biden Administration’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act: the 45Q tax credit, which provides incentives to companies capturing and storing carbon. Given the bipartisan support for carbon capture, we should be thinking about policies to enable data centers to bring these technologies to scale. While it’s important to emphasize speed, we need to think seriously, and realistically, about sustainability.

ElectriCities, the membership organization that provides power supply and related critical services to 99 community-owned electric systems in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia, was created by the North Carolina General Assembly’s Electric Act of 1965 to support public power communities in the region.

Sixty years later, ElectriCities and public power providers continue their mission to better serve citizens through safe, reliable, and affordable electric power, it noted.

“Through political changes, economic highs and lows, and significant evolution in the energy industry, ElectriCities has maintained its commitment to support the success of public power,” said ElectriCities CEO Roy Jones. “ElectriCities members are in the public power business because they know they can provide better, more reliable electric service to their customers—their neighbors,” said Jones. “Public power utilities don’t answer to shareholders or investors. They answer to their community.”

ElectriCities manages the power supply for North Carolina’s two power agencies: the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency (NCEMPA) and the North Carolina Municipal Power Agency Number One (NCMPA1). NCEMPA consists of 32 cities and towns in eastern North Carolina while NCMPA1 is made up of 19 cities and towns in piedmont and western North Carolina. Cities and towns that are members of NCEMPA or NCMPA1 own and operate their electric systems and provide power to their local customers.

Significant milestones mark ElectriCities’ 60-year history, including more recent successes that have saved public power communities and customers hundreds of millions of dollars while supporting increased electric reliability.

In eastern North Carolina, the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency’s 2015 $1.25 billion sale of assets to Duke Energy resulted in an average wholesale rate reduction of 19%.

What appeared to be a software fault was, in fact, a warning about the material fragility of American power. Behind every “cloud” lies a mountain of hardware: transformers, copper cabling, rare earth magnets, and fiber optics. These materials anchor the digital infrastructure of the United States. When the supply chains for data centers and industry falter, compute slows, translating into degraded command-and-control capabilities for the US military.

In an era of strategic competition, digital reliability is deterrence. A single outage in a hyperscale facility can ripple across intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) networks, disrupting real-time operational efficiency. Data centers power the digital age and the associated server farms underpin everything from economic productivity to military decision-making and intelligence operations. Current data center infrastructure is composed of thousands of acres of servers, transformers, and cooling towers scattered across North America. However, these private-sector behemoths remain perilously exposed. In the digital era, failure to treat data and data centers as national defense assets is a strategic blind spot.

The dynamics of deterrence have evolved in the 21st century. Previously, power projection relied on fuel and steel; currently, it relies on megawatts and computational throughput. The physical foundations of the cloud, including transformers, rare earth elements, and copper, are as essential to national security capabilities as shipyards and automobile assembly lines previously were.

The same materials that make fighter jets, missiles, and satellites are what make artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, cyber warfare, and command and control possible. When supply chains for these materials falter, such as through Chinese export controls on certain minerals and rare earths, or when power grid bottlenecks delay new facilities, the US military’s ability to process and act on information stalls. A targeted mineral embargo against the United States could undermine the infrastructure that supports military networks for collection and dissemination of ISR information.

For policymakers, the issue is that data centers are dual use. The Pentagon’s Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) and Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) networks utilize the same commercial power and server backbones that serve industry. A disruption in copper, transformer steel, or photonic components slows both sectors simultaneously. The boundary between civilian compute and military command has effectively vanished; resilience in one now requires resilience in the other.

Cloud outages have a major impact on the economy, critical infrastructure, and military operations, meaning the security and the functioning of these data centers are a major national security issue. This article traces the hidden linkage between data centers, component materials, and military readiness. It quantifies the physical footprint of compute infrastructure and examines the emerging vulnerabilities in supply chains and construction timelines before outlining concrete policy steps to harden the ability of US digital computing power.

The Mathematics of Data Centers: Power, Materials, and Build Cycles

Compute power may seem infinite, but its physical limits are constrained by materials and infrastructure. Building a single 100-megawatt AI-enabled data center—a power requirement on par with a mid-sized American city like Dayton, Ohio—has massive physical requirements. Each site needs about 2,700 tons of copper for cabling and busbars, 150 to 200 tons of transformer-grade steel, and more than 50,000 tons of concrete and structural steel for the shell. Even the smallest components carry strategic weight: rare-earth magnets inside hard-disk drives, gold in server connectors, and indium phosphide in optical transceivers. These materials form America’s compute base (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Material Intensity in a 100 MW AI Data Center (estimates)

The estimates for material tonnage are a synthesis of data from multiple sources, including the International Copper Association (2022) for copper requirements, the Department of Energy (2024) for transformer steel, and Arup (2022) for other embodied materials. Figures for rare earth elements and gold are based on component-level mineral data from the USGS (2024).

Every new data center build amplifies these demands. Their construction has already become one of the world’s fastest-growing industrial sectors for copper, aluminum, and specialized steels. Yet production of critical raw materials remains concentrated in a handful of unstable and/or authoritarian countries. The mathematics are unforgiving: Small shortages in transformer steel or copper can delay data center completion by years, with cascading effects on compute availability across both the civilian economy and defense networks.

This situation reflects the limitations that previously characterized naval logistics and fuel supply chains in the 20th century. In this context, computation has become a new form of logistics: Instead of moving oil to the front, it moves information to the decision-maker. And like oil, its flow depends on extraction, refining, and transport chains that are slow, exposed, and politically entangled.

Power requirements amplify the problem. Each megawatt of data center load also requires an investment in grid capacity through substations, high-voltage lines, and cooling systems, which depend on the same constrained material inputs.

Meanwhile, China’s 2024 National Computing Network Initiative plans over 300 new dual-use data centers that explicitly combine commercial and defense functions. Conversely, the expansion of computing in the United States is constrained by transformer shortages, permitting delays, and utility congestion. The inequality lies in hardware: Those who govern material throughput dictate digital speed. This disparity poses a sustained threat to information supremacy.

The American economy and military are racing to deploy AI, advanced analytics, and global sensor networks, yet current bottlenecks reside in the alloys. Each layer of digital acceleration adds an industrial burden that compounds over time. Rather than pursuing an endless build-up of capacity, the United States must also innovate its way out of material dependence. Advances in chip architecture, photonics integration, and compute efficiency, like domain-specific accelerators and co-packaged optics, can reduce the physical footprint of compute. Investing in efficiency at the transistor and algorithm level can stretch limited materials far further than adding another data hall.

Emerging Vulnerabilities: Grid, Transformers, and Mineral Bottlenecks

The most advanced command-and-control systems in the world still depend on transformers, specialized metals, and high-purity optics that each have globalized supply chains with slow replacement cycles. What once seemed like a commercial challenge is now a question of national security. A grid failure or material shortage that halts data center construction can lead to delays in the flow of intelligence and targeting data to combatant commands.

Transformer availability sits at the center of this risk. Rising demand, aging manufacturing equipment, and global concentration of electrical-steel supply have extended delivery schedules from under a year to more than four (see Figure 2). The same pattern holds for high-voltage substation components and electrical steel, where China, India, and Japan dominate supply. This creates an invisible drag on digital expansion. Even if America builds new compute clusters, the energy infrastructure that powers them cannot keep pace.

Figure 2. Lead-Time Ladder for Critical Compute Infrastructure

The estimates for lead times are derived from an aggregation of data from the US Department of Energy (DOE) reports in 2023 and 2024, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) in 2024, and private-sector analyses, including those from EPRI, the Uptime Institute, and McKinsey in 2023. The figures represent median durations and are subject to variation based on capacity and permitting jurisdiction.

These constraints spill directly into defense readiness. The recent US Department of Energy Grid Supply Chain Review cautions that the transformer backlog, extending for many years, is causing systemic delays in both commercial and defense programs. The 2021 Texas power crisis illustrated how grid instability can lead to widespread digital blackouts. Should such a disruption coincide with cyber or kinetic attacks, command-and-control systems dependent on commercial clouds may fail during crucial mobilization phases. In contrast, China’s State Grid Corporation manages dual-purpose “computing and command” corridors that ensure uninterrupted power supply for military intelligence fusion centers. The disparity is stark: US computing relies on market logistics, but China’s computing is regarded as national defense infrastructure.

Equally concerning is the geopolitical geography of these critical materials. China produces over 70 percent of the world’s transformer steel, refines most rare-earth elements, and dominates the wafer-level photonics used in optical transceivers. Any export restriction or embargo could throttle global build-out of hyperscale compute, giving Beijing a lever over both economic and military networks. Even friendly bottlenecks matter: The United States has only two domestic transformer plants capable of producing the large units needed for defense-critical data centers. The combination of long industrial lead times and concentrated supply creates a slow-burn crisis. Power, not processing speed, may determine who holds the advantage in digital-age warfare.

From Compute to Combat Power: Why the Cloud Is a Warfighting Enabler

Modern warfighting runs on compute. Every mission, from satellite intelligence and maritime surveillance to predictive maintenance and AI-enabled targeting, depends on data flowing through vast server farms and secure fiber links. These networks form to support military and intelligence actions across Joint All Domain Operations (JADO). When that data flow slows, the tempo of sensing, deciding, and acting slows with it. Compute latency means combat latency.

Decision cycles that previously depended on human analysis increasingly rely on distributed computing infrastructures. The more rapidly a nation can receive, communicate, and integrate sensor data, the more credible its deterrent stance becomes. Throughout the conflict in Ukraine, distributed cloud architectures were pivotal. When Russian missile strikes targeted Ukraine’s command infrastructure, Kyiv rapidly migrated intelligence and targeting data to cloud-based systems. That shift allowed operations to continue with minimal disruption, preserving pace and decision speed even under attack. Compute resilience enabled continuity of operations.

Compute is the new logistics for 21st-century warfare. It moves information instead of fuel, but its vulnerabilities are strikingly similar: limited surge capacity, globalized dependencies, and long resupply timelines. The United States once maintained strategic stockpiles of oil and munitions to ensure freedom of action in crisis. Today it must think the same way about the transformers, rare-earth magnets, and photonic wafers that are needed for a data server farm. Each is a “just-in-time” component that underwrites digital-age war.

Faster kill chains require the compute power hidden in the algorithms and AI at physical server farms, which depend on uninterrupted access to power, bandwidth, and data. An adversary that can choke these inputs, either through cyber-attack, export control, or sabotage, can slow US decision-making without firing a shot. Hence, protecting compute infrastructure is a strategic imperative that can hinder or enable US military operations in crisis or conflict.

Ultimately, superiority in warfighting increasingly depends on data that can be processed, transmitted, and acted upon faster than the enemy. Compute is combat power, and the materials that sustain it are the new munitions. Securing this edge means the United States must defend and sustain the factories, foundries, and substations that make data centers function.

Six Steps to Improve US Compute Power and Resilience

We highlight six steps needed to align industrial tools and defense planning approaches to preserve the US economy and military warfighting abilities.

First, Washington must designate and protect National Compute Nodes, data center clusters whose function is critical to both economic stability and military readiness. These facilities should receive priority access to transformers, fiber routes, and electrical power, along with hardened redundancy and physical defenses comparable to strategic ports and air bases. Compute should be viewed as a form of infrastructure sovereignty and defended accordingly. Regional diversification of data centers would ensure resilience, so that no single natural disaster, cyber-attack, or grid failure can paralyze national decision-making.

Second, the United States must accelerate grid and transformer capacity. Transformer lead times now exceed two years, delaying both commercial and defense projects. The Department of Energy should coordinate with industry to co-fund new electrical-steel and transformer manufacturing plants, establish a strategic reserve of key grid components, and expedite permitting for defense-critical substations. Every week of delay in electrical power delivery translates into slower compute growth, meaning slower economic growth and military command and control.

Third, policymakers must secure materials and photonics supply chains. Copper, transformer steel, rare-earth magnets, and indium-phosphide wafers underpin the entire data center ecosystem. Yet these midstream refining and finishing processes are concentrated in China. Extending Defense Production Act authorities, allied sourcing partnerships, and industrial incentives to these materials will reduce foreign dependency. Recycling and circular-economy programs can supplement domestic supply, but they cannot substitute for new refining and alloy capacity on US soil.

Fourth, Washington needs to deploy targeted industrial tools to rebuild the “missing middle” of manufacturing that connects raw materials to finished components. CHIPS Act styled incentives should expand to include magnet alloys, capacitor powders, optical connectors, and power electronics. These investments are modest compared to the strategic cost of supply-chain ruptures in wartime; plus, they yield long-term dividends in jobs, technology, and resilience across the defense industrial base.

Fifth, compute resilience must become an element of defense planning. Combatant commands should wargame scenarios in which data centers or regional grids are degraded or disrupted. Exercises should test backup compute, power rerouting, and data prioritization under contested conditions, just as logistics drills stress munitions and fuel. Deterrence depends on speed of response, and the assurance that speed can be sustained when data systems are strained or attacked.

Finally, the United States must align its electrical power grid with national security. Data center reliability depends on uninterrupted energy. This can mean small modular reactors, advanced geothermal plants, or contracted renewables backed by large-scale storage. The Pentagon should treat megawatts as munitions: finite, strategic, and vital to operations. Hardening that power base completes the loop between energy, compute, and combat power. It ensures the US military can sense, decide, and act faster than an adversary.

Emerging sensor technologies will amplify these compute demands. Quantum magnetometers, gravimeters, and other precision sensors will generate unprecedented data volumes, collapsing the decision window in future conflicts. Quantum sensing may make the invisible visible, but only if backed by resilient compute infrastructure capable of processing those signals in real time. Without secure power and stable data centers, quantum advantages are lost to immense noise these systems will generate.

By locking power, materials, and manufacturing into a single resilience plan, the United States can preserve its edge economically and militarily. Securing transformers, materials, and megawatts is as vital as maintaining aircraft or missiles. Washington must invest in the industrial base of intelligence—the physical architecture of cognition that turns information into strategy and compute into combat power.

American competitiveness will be built from silicon and electricity. Future success depends on every algorithm, satellite, soldier, and weapon system operating with an uninterrupted cloud. The chemistry of modern war has changed: It now runs on materials, minerals, and megawatts.

The Trump administration had just adopted the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which fundamentally altered tax and spending policies in the United States, including phasing out federal tax credits for clean energy.

Biggart, who has worked in the solar industry for over two decades, was alarmed. Just a few years ago, the Biden administration had done the opposite by raising solar tax credits to 30% for homeowners and businesses — increasing interest, accessibility and market for solar energy. But now, Biggart prepared for that momentum to plunge in 2026.

“A lot of people are trying to install solar right now, because once you roll into January you won’t get the credit,” said Biggart, CEO of Freedom Solar Power, a residential solar installation company based in Austin. “I would say once that credit is gone, the solar market is going to go down by 30% to 40%.”

Solar energy has been on the rise in Texas for decades, but a dramatic shift in renewable federal policy and funding has left the industry unstable and industry actors like Biggart uncertain of the future. As a consequence, incentives that made solar energy installation and employment attractive, accessible and affordable have vaporized across the state — throwing a wrench in the growing market.

Before Donald Trump took office a second time, the Biden administration increased the renewable energy tax credit from 20% to 30%, and created Solar for All — a $7 billion federal fund designed to expand solar energy access to disadvantaged communities across the country through the administration’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

However, in an effort to halt the growth of renewable energy in favor of the oil and gas industry, the Trump administration is phasing out the tax credit by January 2026 and eliminating Solar for All — stripping recipients of any initially awarded funds. This includes nearly $250 million for California, $156 million for Pennsylvania and $400 million for Texas.

Experts, officials and businesses across the country have sounded alarm bells over the impact these funding and policy changes will have on the solar industry. In Texas, Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee sued the Trump administration and Environmental Protection Agency in October, arguing that the administration’s decision to claw back the money is unlawful. In the meantime, the funding remains frozen. As for the loss of tax credits, solar companies like Biggart’s are in a kind of purgatory, fighting to stay afloat for the foreseeable future.

“We have more projects than we can literally fill a schedule, and we’re hiring like crazy and trying to get these projects done,” Biggart said. “But there’s this cliff and how far is the cliff, and how gnarly it is, is sort of to be determined.”

Accessible Solar

Despite being home to one of the largest petrochemical industries in the world, Texas has a large and growing renewable energy market.

The state is third in solar jobs behind California and Florida, and employment in the solar industry has increased by nearly 30% between 2018 and 2023, according to the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. And, recent reporting by the United States Energy Information Administration found that in Texas, utility-scale solar — which is solar energy sold directly to the state electrical grid — generated 50% more energy within the first nine months of 2025 than in the same period in 2024, and nearly four times more than in the same period in 2021.

However, the state is not as far along when it comes to nonutility-scale residential installation and community solar programs, according to Margaret Cook, vice president of water and community resilience at the Houston Advanced Research Center, a nonprofit focused on sustainable development and science.

“We have little problems in Texas getting those large [utility-scale] installations and the jobs associated with that,” Cook said. “Our single family, multifamily, our commercial and residential solar industries are not as robust and they are seeing a lot of turnover, downsizing of companies.”

Solar for All was meant to help close that gap by expanding energy access to low-income and disadvantaged communities across Texas through various partnerships and programs. The eventual goal was to lower energy costs and create local job opportunities in the industry — meaning more affordable and accessible solar energy.

With the federal program in place, solar companies prepared for a huge influx of work by hiring more people to get ready for the expected increase in business. Now, Cook said those are sunk costs since none of the companies will be receiving the grant money they were promised.

And it wasn’t just Solar for All. Other renewable energy funding eliminated or halted left numerous programs without funding.

The Black United Fund of Texas — a nonprofit housed in Houston’s historic Fifth Ward — had expected millions in funding from the federal government for a local solar installation training program through several EPA environmental justice and resiliency grants. The organization had already hired instructors and started its first class. But all the funds it initially received have been frozen or eliminated, and the organization had to search for new funding.

“Trust is a big thing in low-income communities because everyone comes in promising so many things, and usually they don’t see anything directly change or impact them,” said Velika Thomas, chief financial officer for the Black United Fund.

Some of the students were able to graduate from the first class, but weren’t able to continue to the next phases, said Thomas. Those students got jobs at a local solar installation company, but the organization is still searching for more funding for future students.

The same type of whiplash left companies like Biggart’s pivoting on the spot after the tax credit ended. Originally, Biggart could breathe a sigh of relief. The 30% credit the Biden administration adopted would last 10 years, until 2032. It meant he could plan how the market would look for the next several years. But after July, all that planning and relief went out the window.

Freedom Solar is now rebranding as Freedom Power, Biggart said. The company launched a heating, ventilation and air conditioning installation business and a generator business in addition to the solar installation and battery business. Two years ago, Freedom Solar had 1,000 employees. This year, it has 400.

“It’s sort of like riding a bull a little bit,” Biggart said. “There are a lot of ups and downs in the solar industry.”

Bringing Solar Back

Before the Trump administration cut funds, Harris County — a leader in Solar for All in Texas — was planning for 4,300 projects across Texas that would aid 30,000 low-income households through the initiative, according to the Office of County Attorney Menefee. He sued the Trump administration and the EPA in October.

Initially, when the Big Beautiful Bill passed in early July, the administration repealed only the unobligated funds — the funds that had not yet been distributed. This came to only $19 million out of the total $7 billion allocation and wasn’t deemed a massive concern, said Menefee.

“But then in August this year, the EPA administrator announced that Solar for All, all $7 billion, would be eliminated,” Menefee said. “So that’s when we started getting ready to take action, which is what led to the lawsuit.”

In an August statement, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said that the EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or to access the appropriated funds to “keep this boondoggle alive.”

Menefee disagrees. The Constitution and the laws of this country don’t allow a president to unilaterally eliminate a program that was appropriated by Congress and for which the funds have been fully obligated, he said. And Texas isn’t the only state taking action: nearly two dozen other states have also sued the Trump administration over Solar for All.

Experts point out that the administration’s move against solar and renewable energy is contrary to market demands. Solar is still on the rise in Texas, especially for the large utility-scale companies, said Cook, the vice president of the Houston Advanced Research Center.

Energy prices across Texas are also increasing, widening the gap that already exists between those who can afford electricity and those who struggle to pay the bills. For years, renewable energy, like solar, has been a growing solution to this concern since solar has proven to be more cost effective than traditional energy in the long term — at least for those who can pay the upfront installation cost.

In this new economy, the administration isn’t limiting access for everyone in the same way, said Cook. Solar is moving forward, but it’s leaving people behind at the same time.

“Texas has a lot of sun, a lot of land. It makes a lot of sense to do a utility-scale project in [the state]. It’s just very economically advantageous,” Cook said. “But Solar for All is for people to access what they might never have had access to without this program.”

“Swift and decisive action is required to jumpstart America’s nuclear energy industrial base and ensure our national and economic security by increasing fuel availability and production, securing civil nuclear supply chains, improving the efficiency with which advanced nuclear reactors are licensed, and preparing our workforce to establish America’s energy dominance and accelerate our path towards a more secure and independent energy future,” Trump said.

The Atlantic Council, an international affairs think tank, said in a May report that Trump’s order addressed “well-trodden issues” but was “ambitious.”

The president’s other directives on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which are partially aimed at reducing the federal agency’s staff, also present issues for the country’s nuclear energy industry, according to the think tank.

“In the new orders, the Trump administration has articulated ambitious goals for rapid deployment of next-generation nuclear technologies; however, reducing personnel and funding for the NRC and the Department of Energy, along with weakening the NRC’s independence and global credibility, will make it challenging to realize the full potential of the US nuclear energy industry,” the Atlantic Council explained.

This memo draws on CPE’s work with state agencies and municipalities nationwide, and demonstrates how tools like green banks, revolving funds, and public equity structures can advance climate goals while generating returns. They suggest that state actions taken now will build the institutional capacity to enable faster implementation when federal support returns.

The Trump administration has used both administrative and legislative measures to roll back the progress that the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was making to decarbonize and modernize America’s energy system while containing consumer costs. With the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), many IRA programs including tax credit support to renewable energy, federal loans for new energy infrastructure, and support for building decarbonization have been halted. New administrative barriers have been erected to minimize the impacts of the programs that still exist.

States can keep the flame of green industrial policy alive through the next three years to preserve some of the IRA’s gains and build a base of administrative competence, innovation, and market information for the day that we see competence return to the federal government. As part of its efforts to build public sector capacity among states, the Center for Public Enterprise has undertaken projects to help states replace and expand some of the functions of IRA, while acknowledging the fiscal limitations of state governments relative to the federal government.

States should be an investor in the green transition. We encourage leaders to find strategic business opportunities for state entities’ financial and development authorities not just by incentivizing the private sector to encourage investment in your state’s infrastructure but also by creating and redistributing value to the taxpayer. Institutions such as green banks, bond banks, and public investment funds can support green industrial policy while also generating returns to the budget that can be recycled or used as a cross-subsidy for further investment in essential projects.

Critical uses for public investments in the post-IRA environment include:

Public development of mixed-income housing: Complimenting and encouraging investment in green industrial capacity by preemptively pairing traditional state and federal economic development efforts with proactive planning of investments into workforce infrastructure—especially housing. State leaders such as the Montgomery County Housing Opportunities Commission (Maryland) not only streamlined regulation to build new housing but invested public capital into both traditional low income housing and “mixed income social housing,” combining both market-rate and subsidized units using tools such as publicly financed revolving funds. We are providing financial modeling and capital planning services to over 15 municipalities and state governments interested in addressing the housing shortage through this revolving fund-led approach.

Public development or financing of critical energy infrastructure: Using existing or new state instrumentalities as “public developers” of critical infrastructure, including higher-cost technologies such as transmission, storage, geothermal, and nuclear power. For example, the New York Power Authority has been instrumental in sustaining the state’s clean energy progress by building a pipeline of renewable energy projects owned and developed by the state in partnership with private developers.

Public development and financing of local grid resilience: Supporting smaller-scale decarbonization efforts such as rooftop solar and storage deployment and building decarbonization via both green bank lending and green bank-led public development. For example, the Connecticut Green Bank’s Solar Municipal Assistance Program uses its own power purchase agreement (PPA) and lease structures to directly build public-public partnerships with municipalities and community organizations, with the bank as PPA holder and lessor.

Public procurement of clean energy: Investing in both centralized procurement of clean energy projects and PPA warehousing to crowd in capital. In the former case, the state’s utility commission can itself sign PPAs and mandate that regulated utilities buy certain kinds of contracted power (e.g., geothermal or offshore wind). In the latter case, states play a more entrepreneurial role by signing upfront PPAs with developers, to lower developers’ construction risks, and selling them to end-users of clean energy when projects are complete, earning returns in the process. To maximize the impact of such measures, states should examine options for pre-payment of PPA contracts. California has implemented the former of these projects while the latter is being examined in several states in the Western Interconnect grid region.

Public backstop for critical projects: Examining opportunities to rescue projects that have encountered unexpected financial bottlenecks from federal policy uncertainty though public equity or lending structures. Many renewable energy projects rely on tax credit financing and are rushing to meet expiration deadlines. However, administration actions and other delays may cause projects to miss these cutoffs, forcing them to resort to higher-cost financing. In the absence of tax credits, most developers are anticipating charging higher rates for power. Our modelling and research demonstrates that low-cost state loans and public purchases of projects can replace a significant amount of the value provided by tax credits and allow stranded projects to reach completion without raising ratepayer electricity prices.

Whatever the future of national energy and climate policy, states will have to be critical players in economic development policy. Thus, undertaking active public investment is more than just helping sustain momentum before the federal government takes the lead: It is building up vital capacity for many possible futures. One of the roadblocks to IRA implementation was that states had very little experience and capacity in acting as developers and investors, or as partners to federal programs. Thus, they could not easily take advantage of many of the law’s many incentives or play a role in implementing federal policy on the ground. Working now to build up institutional knowledge and capacity will allow states to accelerate their efforts when the funding picture improves and, in the meantime, serve as the laboratories of democracy for the future of our energy system.",https://publicenterprise.org/wp-content/uploads/Norris_Dam_Norris_TN_-_51441440309.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 13:03:23.093349

Last month in Japan, U.S. President Donald Trump said Toyota planned a $10 billion investment in the United States. ""Go out and buy a Toyota,"" Trump said. He has been critical of Japanese and other auto imports and imposed hefty tariffs on imported vehicles.

Toyota has been one of the slowest automakers to move to full EVs but has rapidly moved to convert its best-selling vehicles to hybrids.

""We know there is no single path to progress,"" Ogawa said on Wednesday. ""That's why we remain committed to our multi-pathway approach, offering fuel-efficient gas engines, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery electronics and fuel cell electronics.""

Other automakers like Volkswagen have said they will add more hybrids as the Trump administration has rescinded EV tax credits and eliminated penalties that incentivized EV sales.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at the event the administration plans to soon propose to ease fuel economy standards, saying prior rules were too aggressive.

Duffy in January signed an order to direct the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to rescind fuel economy standards issued under President Joe Biden for the 2022-2031 model years that had aimed to drastically reduce fuel use for cars and trucks.","https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--YZoAQeme--/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/one-cms/core/2025-11-12T164213Z_2_LYNXMPELAB0VK_RTROPTP_3_AUTOSHOW-NEW-YORK.JPG?itok=gzSvODZw",N,,2025-11-12 14:03:03.032422

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) decided to retain the designation for PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA (Superfund)— a decision with sweeping implications for local governments, wastewater utilities, and other public entities that handle PFAS-contaminated water or waste.

While the designation aims to hold polluters accountable for cleanup costs, it also introduces significant liability questions for passive receivers, including municipal utilities that did not create or directly discharge PFAS.

To help agencies understand the potential impacts and next steps, SL Environmental Law Group is hosting a live forum featuring Senior Partner Ken Sansone, one of the nation’s leading attorneys in PFAS litigation and water contamination recovery.

What You’ll Learn

This session will provide critical insights into how EPA’s decision affects the public sector — including what risks and opportunities lie ahead for utilities and municipalities:

Understanding CERCLA Liability: How the designation of PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA creates potential liability for passive receivers of PFAS, like wastewater utilities and local governments.

Cost Exposure and Risk: What types of cleanup or compliance costs agencies could face under the new classification.

Congressional Action and Next Steps: Why utilities remain vulnerable until Congress acts, and what agencies can do now to mitigate risk and prepare for potential liabilities.

Participants will also have the opportunity to ask questions during a live Q&A with Ken Sansone, who will discuss the latest developments and share practical strategies for navigating PFAS-related exposure.

Why This Matters

The EPA’s decision to retain the PFAS CERCLA designation marks a pivotal moment for utilities and municipalities.

Massachusetts bill will “empower local climate action” by banning natural gas hookups

New Bedford (MA) NewBedfordGuide.com

Massachusetts lawmakers are advancing bill H3449 to expand a 2022 pilot program that currently allows 10 municipalities to ban natural gas hookups in new buildings. The expansion would permit 10 more cities and towns to join, supporting the state’s net-zero carbon emissions goal by 2050 through reducing fossil fuel reliance and cutting long-term energy costs. Proponents, including Rep. Manny Cruz, emphasize climate urgency and cite research showing all-electric homes have lower costs, while data suggests the existing pilot has not slowed construction. However, critics, like former Governor Baker, express concern over potential cost increases during a housing shortage. The bill awaits committee votes as a key step toward local climate action.

New York’s bad energy policies are out of control — time for Trump to take over

Washington (DC) The Hill/Paul H. Tice

The op-ed argues that President Trump’s attempts to change New York’s aggressive anti-fossil fuel policies through bargaining, like the speculated deal linking the Empire Wind restart to natural gas pipeline approvals, are ineffective. Governor Kathy Hochul’s administration has enacted strict measures like the All-Electric Building Act and a new climate tax, despite temporarily greenlighting the NESE pipeline last week. The author contends that this partial pipeline victory does not signal an end to New York’s net-zero crusade. Instead of seeking one-off project approvals, the Trump administration should use the court system to establish federal preemption over state environmental and energy laws, citing New York’s policies as an ideal test case. [MDN: The author, Paul Tice, a senior fellow at the National Center for Energy Analytics, makes a great point. It’s time to permanently establish federal authority over the states with energy policy.

Study shows resource scarcity, bureaucracy barriers to natural gas use in CT

Inside Investigator/Alex Appel

A report by the Connecticut Office of Legislative Research details significant hurdles to expanding natural gas use in the state. Connecticut possesses minimal natural gas resources and cannot geologically store gas, requiring reliance on interstate pipelines. Expanding these pipelines, such as the proposed Constitution project, involves navigating complex, protracted federal and state bureaucratic processes, potential use of eminent domain, and risks from public opposition and securing a viable customer base. An S&P Global study confirms growing demand and the obstacles, noting that previous state initiatives to limit financial risk failed. However, the study estimates that overcoming barriers to the Constitution pipeline could net ratepayers $8.5 billion in savings and generate an additional $8.5 billion for regional businesses over 15 years. [MDN: Yet another study that says the proposed Constitution Pipeline would massively benefit New Englanders, like those in Connecticut.]

Duke Energy five-year capital plan could exceed $100B

System additions could exceed 13 GW over the next five years, including 7.5 GW of new natural gas generation, solar, and battery storage. New nuclear generation is also being evaluated, but only after cost and supply chain issues are resolved. Duke expects to finance 30% to 50% of this ambitious plan with new equity. [MDN: The article reveals that Duke has secured 19 natural gas turbines and selected sites for seven new gas plants. Duke’s service territory is primarily in the Carolinas, Florida, Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky—all of which receive M-U molecules. The company is making a major investment in new gas-fired power.

U.S. natural gas settles higher as colder weather arrives

Wall Street Journal

U.S. natural gas futures settle higher in choppy trade as cold weather drifting over the eastern half of the country adds to heating demand. The supply-demand balance tightened “materially as early-season heating finally bites,” Gelber & Associates said in a note. Weather-led residential and commercial demand saw the strongest gains, while LNG feedgas “remains a sturdy call on molecules,” the firm adds. Nymex natural gas settles up 0.5% at $4.338/mmBtu, but off the overnight high of $4.509/mmBtu. [MDN: This was the settlement price for Monday, not Tuesday. And it was up once again.]

Trump’s EPA ‘leaning into innovation’ instead of overregulation to protect environment

Brietbart/Hannah Knudsen

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated that the Trump administration is prioritizing innovation and utilizing domestic energy resources over excessive regulation to protect the environment. He emphasized the high environmental stewardship standards already maintained by U.S. companies, citing numerous examples of industry initiatives across the country. Zeldin mentioned an Exxon Mobil advanced recycling operation in Texas that breaks down plastic, as well as new projects like a nuclear facility in Idaho and natural gas expansions from the Permian Basin to Arizona. He believes firsthand perspective from visiting these diverse, “multi-dimensional” projects nationwide is crucial for effective environmental policy, asserting that relying solely on D.C.-based regulatory discussions is insufficient. [MDN: The enviro-left pretends that without the bludgeon of government regulation companies will pollute us all to hell. Nothing further from the truth. Yes, some regulation is necessary. But the pendulum has swung WAY too far to the left. Zeldin is restoring common sense and balance to the EPA and its onerous overregulatory ways.]

Deloitte puts focus on natural gas in 2026

Midland (TX) Reporter-Telegram/Mella McEwen

Deloitte’s 2026 Oil & Gas Industry Outlook notes that the sector maintains strong capital discipline and innovation following the 2014 downturn. According to Kate Hardin, oil prices are softening, contrasting with a tightening natural gas market driven by rising data center and power demand. Natural gas and LNG companies are expected to increase capital expenditures and expand shale acreage to meet this growth and supportive LNG export policies. However, oil companies will remain cautious in 2026, delaying major spending until structural changes in global fundamentals occur. Facing rising costs and uncertainty, nearly 70% of U.S. O&G companies plan portfolio restructuring, cost optimization, and divesting noncore assets, underscoring a continued focus on shareholder returns over production expansion. [MDN: Years ago, we hinted (maybe even predicted) that oil would eventually decrease, but natural gas would increase. It was easy to spot. And now it’s beginning to happen. Oil will never go away completely, but over time, natgas will grow and continue growing. At least for the next 50-100 years.]

Former Gov. McAuliffe joins pro-natural gas group as national co-chair

Virginia Mercury

Former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe has joined Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future as co-chair to promote natural gas as a necessary bridge for long-term energy reliability while renewable sources develop. The organization, which advocates for an “all of the above” energy approach, posits that using natural gas alongside solar and wind can lower utility bills and cut emissions compared to coal, despite Virginia’s plan to eliminate fossil fuels. Natural Allies, whose leadership includes former bipartisan politicians, argues that a 100% renewable transition is too costly and challenging for meeting peak energy demand. However, the group, reportedly backed by fossil fuel companies, is accused of “greenwashing” the climate impact of natural gas to appeal to Democrats and young constituents. They are currently focusing efforts in states like Virginia, where debates about proposed gas plants are ongoing. [MDN: Lib Dems like Terry McAwful join pro-gas groups like Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future for one reason and one reason only: money. They have no principles and would turn on natgas in a heartbeat if other (better) payers appeared.]

America at 250 needs energy overhaul – ARC is the place to start

RealClearPolitics/David DesRosiers

Rep. Troy Balderson introduced “The Affordable, Reliable, Clean Energy Security Act” (ARC) to correct the focus of current energy policy, which the article argues prioritizes clean energy over affordability and reliability. The ARC bill would require federal agencies like the DOE, DOI, and EPA to prioritize affordability first, reliability second, and cleanliness third when evaluating energy projects. This “all-of-the-above” approach aims to codify the inclusion of all viable, cost-effective, and reliable sources, including natural gas and nuclear, to lower energy costs for American families and businesses. The author presents a nonpartisan appeal, arguing that current energy priorities lead to rising rates, citing examples in New Jersey and Georgia, and that the new framework is essential for economic growth and meeting future demands like AI. [MDN: An op-ed from the publisher of the RealClear websites. He lends his support to Balderson’s excellent bill.]

Oil gains as fuel prices surge

Bloomberg/A. Longley, R.W. Neo and W. Kubzansky

Oil prices, with West Texas Intermediate settling near $61 a barrel, rose for a third day, defying signs of a softer crude market, as support came from surging premiums for refined fuels like gasoline and diesel, and heightened concerns over Russian supply following a US crackdown. Analysts attribute the gains to strong product markets, which are keeping crude prices afloat despite a prolonged slump driven by widespread expectations of a global surplus and increased output from OPEC+ and other drillers. The narrowing WTI prompt spread suggests excess supply, but a major selloff is deemed unlikely unless the strength in refined products decisively ends. Traders also engaged in short covering after WTI successfully held the $60 level. [MDN: WTI for December delivery added 1.5% to settle at $61.04 a barrel. Brent for January settlement edged up 1.7% to settle at $65.16 a barrel. Despite its best effort to denigrate oil and talk the price down, the price keeps returning to the $60s, which is confounding for the leftstream media.]

Exxon CEO expects long-term role for oil and gas, maybe not as fuel

Reuters/Oliver Griffin

Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods stated that crude oil and hydrocarbons will remain critical for a long time, but their use as fuel (combustion) is likely to change as technology evolves, noting continued demand in other sectors, such as medical. Speaking ahead of the COP30 climate conference, Woods criticized current climate policy, stating that without effective carbon accounting to properly track emissions across value chains, “net zero is just a slogan.” He also expressed optimism about the company’s early-stage negotiations to return to Iraq to manage, develop, and operate the Majnoon oil field, emphasizing the need for a favorable, win-win investment proposition with the Iraqi government. [MDN: Darren Woods is undoubtedly a better CEO for Exxon than his predecessor, Rex Tillerson. However, Woods continues to dally with global warming nutters who insist we “transition” to non-fossil fuels for energy. No, Mr. Woods, we do NOT need “carbon accounting” (i.e., a carbon tax). Wise up!]

US urges Europe to stick to oil and gas, not renewables

Reuters/Edward Mcallister, Lefteris Papadimas

U.S. energy and interior secretaries recently argued that global renewable energy investments have failed to deliver, urging a focus on securing reliable fossil fuel supplies, particularly to Europe. Speaking at an energy conference, U.S. officials, reflecting the Trump administration’s policy, pushed to boost U.S. oil and gas exports to replace Russian imports entirely. Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated the shift to renewables “hasn’t worked,” citing that despite trillions spent, solar and wind accounted for only 2.6% of global energy last year. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum claimed there is “no energy transition, there’s only energy addition,” underscoring a divergence from the European Union’s emissions reduction goals. [MDN: Two smart people whom we are glad are part of Trump’s cabinet, both delivering some hard truths to Euro weenies.]

China could crash the price of oil

Forbes/Michael Lynch

Despite the IEA’s forecast of a massive looming oil glut and inventory build for 2025-2026, critics highlight that observed inventory data has not shown the expected increase, implying a tighter current market. The article argues this discrepancy is largely explained by significant, non-transparent inventory builds in China’s strategic oil stocks, which absorbed 700-900 thousand barrels per day (tb/d). Although the IEA still projects a substantial market surplus (over 2 mb/d by 2026), the market’s stability and price level depend precariously on China’s future purchasing decisions. If China abruptly halts its unpredictable strategic stock-buying, the surplus could turn into a severe flood of oil, likely necessitating intervention by OPEC+ to prevent a price collapse. [MDN: The author makes the point that the price of oil is pretty much in the hands of the thug dictatorship of China. How did we get here?]

IEA backs bullish oil demand growth scenario in tone shift

Bloomberg/Grant Smith

The International Energy Agency (IEA) has reversed its previous outlook, reintroducing a “Current Policies Scenario” (CPS) where global oil demand continues to grow by 13% through 2050, a shift attributed to slower electric vehicle adoption. This latest report marks a softening of the IEA’s stance on a near-term peak in demand and aligns more closely with the views of OPEC. The CPS, which envisions consumption climbing to 113 million barrels per day by 2050 and temperatures rising by nearly 3°C, contrasts with the “Stated Policies Scenario” (STEPS), where demand peaks around 2030. Even in STEPS, the peak is now seen later than previously projected, highlighting a trend across the energy industry toward a bumpier road to net zero. [MDN: What’s really happened is that the IEA is (for now) dropping its propaganda advocacy for unreliable renewables and instead using real data once gain to make predictions. Why? Because the money-sucking agency was threatened with defunding by the Trump administration unless it changed.]

Climate delusions & gaslighting at COP30

Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT)/Peter Murphy

The article harshly critiques the UN Climate Summit, COP30, labeling the proceedings as “absurdities.” It attacks UN Secretary-General António Guterres for raising “hysteria” with claims that a 1.5-degree temperature overshoot is “inevitable,” arguing he presented “zero evidence” for this catastrophe. The author contends that the globalists’ demands for massive annual funding (up to $1.3 trillion) are about control and will increase poverty by raising energy costs, noting that World Bank data shows poverty decreasing in nations developing oil and gas. Furthermore, the piece criticizes China’s Vice Premier for pushing “global climate governance” while his nation simultaneously undergoes a rapid, massive expansion of coal capacity. Ultimately, the article dismisses the climate agenda as “fantasies” that ignore the necessity of fossil fuels for global development.

Zoom out: For picking Liberty, Toyota is in line for around $664 million in incentives from the state and Randolph County, provided it meets hiring and investment goals.","Toyota's massive plant in the Greensboro suburb of Liberty is now assembling batteries for hybrids and electric vehicles. The first shipments went out this past summer.

Why it matters: The Japanese company says it is creating 5,100 jobs and investing $13.9 billion in the North Carolina facility.

Workers at the facility develop and manufacture lithium-ion batteries, which are becoming increasingly important to the world's largest automaker.

State of play: Toyota now has 11 plants across the U.S., but this is the ""first and only battery plant outside of Japan,"" a press release said.

The company on Wednesday pledged an additional $10 billion in American investments over the next five years.

The factory currently employs 2,500 workers.

Context: Earlier in 2025, Japan struck a deal with the Trump administration promising manufacturing investments in the U.S. in exchange for lower tariffs.

Ted Ogawa, Toyota's chief executive in North America, says the plant reflects the automaker's priority to ""build where we sell,"" a commitment he notes President Donald Trump praised on his recent trip to Japan.

Inside the room: U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Gov. Josh Stein both attended a flashy event held at the plant Wednesday, seated in the front row on either side of U.S. Sen. Ted Budd.

The ambassador from Japan, Shigeo Yamada, sat on Stein's other side.

What they're saying: Duffy joked he was relieved not to talk about aviation amid flight delays and cancellations caused by the government shutdown, and said, ""when companies invest in America, that means great American jobs.""

Stein says the factory helps ""build a state that is safer, stronger, cleaner and more resilient.""

Yamada says it will "" energize the economy of North Carolina — as well as the entire United States — while securing very vital supply chains.""

Zoom in: The site sprawls over 1,850 acres and runs 24/7. It will eventually accommodate 14 battery production lines for various vehicles.

That includes Camry, Corolla and RAV4 models, plus an all-electric 3-row SUV that's not yet been released.

Battery modules made in Liberty are shipped to assembly lines in Kentucky and Alabama, the company says. Factory workers say they're about 80% complete when they leave North Carolina.

Between the lines: Toyota no longer makes fully gas-powered Camrys, and its EV strategy has prioritized hybrids over all-electric models.

""I think the American people want hybrids,"" Duffy added. ""They want electric, but they also want the backup of a combustion engine.""

Don Stewart, who leads Toyota North Carolina, says the factory ""symbolizes the future of the automobile industry.""

Zoom out: For picking Liberty, Toyota is in line for around $664 million in incentives from the state and Randolph County, provided it meets hiring and investment goals.

""History tells us when a company like Toyota plants their roots in a town like ours, that community is going to thrive,"" says Rebecca Sams, a factory worker from Liberty.

Nonetheless, Stephan Singer, global energy senior advisor at CAN International, a global network of environmental organizations, said getting below that point is still possible.","Electricity demand will rise much faster than overall energy growth in the coming decades, underscoring the need for diversified energy sources, according to an analysis released Wednesday.

The report by the International Energy Agency said renewable energy, led by solar power, will grow faster than any other major source in the next few years and that coal and oil demand will likely peak globally by the end of this decade. The report noted that many natural gas projects were approved in 2025, due to changes in U.S. policy, indicating worldwide supply will rise even as questions remain about how it will be used. Meanwhile, global nuclear power capacity is set to increase by at least a third by 2035 after being stagnant for years.

The release of the annual World Energy Outlook coincided with U.N. climate negotiations in Brazil this week where global leaders are calling for ways to curb the planet's warming.

Regional dynamics

The IEA says building greater resilience in energy systems is especially important as data centers, heating and cooling, electrification and more drive energy demand. Investment in data centers is expected to reach $580 billion this year, exceeding investment in the oil supply, according to the report.

Growing economies including India and nations in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, will “increasingly shape energy market dynamics in the years,” the IEA said, noting their potential for solar power.

China, meanwhile, has accounted for half the global growth in demand for oil and gas, and more than half for electricity, since 2010.

“In a break from the trend of the past decade, the increase in electricity consumption is no longer limited to emerging and developing economies,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a release. Birol said that electricity use is also rising in advanced economies.

Nations are grappling with meeting demand while preparing for the risks brought on by the planet’s warming. The IEA says the world is falling short on universal energy access and climate change goals. Around 730 million people still live without electricity, according to the IEA, and despite progress, nearly one-quarter of the global population still relies on inefficient cooking methods that hurt their health or the environment. 2024 was also the hottest year on record.

Nations should diversify their energy sources and cooperate to expand supply chains for critical minerals used to make things like batteries for electric vehicles and components for solar and wind power generation, the IEA said. This also includes making quick improvements to the grid, energy storage and broader infrastructure.

“When we look at the history of the energy world in recent decades, there is no other time when energy security tensions have applied to so many fuels and technologies at once,” Birol said. “With energy security front and (center) for many governments, their responses need to consider the synergies and trade-offs that can arise with other policy goals — on affordability, access, competitiveness and climate change.”

In a conference call Wednesday, Birol said: “We will still use oil, we will still use gas. But the growth of electricity demand is spectacular.”

He noted the role transportation plays in accounting for 45% of global oil consumption, for example. “How the electrification of the transportation takes place, especially in countries beyond China and Europe, will determine the shape of the oil demand and growth.”

Global reaction

Wednesday's edition of the yearly report is the first released since the start of U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term. Trump's administration has for a second time opted out of the Paris agreement, rolled back dozens of climate regulations, slashed federal support for renewable energies such as wind and solar power and is reversing the “endangerment finding” that sits at the core of U.S. climate policy.

Trump has pledged his support instead to the fossil fuel industry, investing in coal and loosening restrictions on pollution.

But energy analysts said the shift to clean power is happening regardless of climate policy around the world.

“The evidence on the ground is overwhelming. EV sales are taking off in many emerging countries, solar is permeating even through the Middle East,” said Dave Jones, chief analyst at global energy think tank Ember. ""Renewables and electrification will dominate the future.”

Maria Pastukhova, energy transition program lead at climate change think tank E3G, said the report makes “the choices for the global energy system and the global economy unambiguous.”

“If countries want to grow their economies and protect their citizens from roller-coaster energy prices, they need to focus relentlessly on energy efficiency and the (decarbonization) of energy demand,” Pastukhova said.

Others, however, were critical of how the outlook addressed oil and gas. Ben Backwell, CEO of the Global Wind Energy Council, said the outlook does not fully capture the momentum in renewables, and that it should have emphasized the trajectory for renewable energy is accelerating, driven by the decreasing cost of the technologies, strong policy support and the move toward electrification.

“We’re accelerating,” he added. “You can see it all around the world and we can see it in our numbers for last year, but also in our numbers for the first half of this year. It looks very, very exciting, both for wind and for solar, in fact, and for next year, even more so.”

The outlook foresees the likelihood of surpassing the warming threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) established in the Paris Agreement. Nonetheless, Stephan Singer, global energy senior advisor at CAN International, a global network of environmental organizations, said getting below that point is still possible.

The IEA addressed some of the criticism in the call Wednesday. It said that it sees differences economically, politically and with regard to clean energy efforts across the globe, and that its analysis tries to account for those differences.

“In a nutshell, the IEA is backsliding. As a global think tank, the IEA has largely failed to represent where most countries in the (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) and the developing world are, as they’re supporting net zero emissions with 98% CO2 emissions reductions by mid-century,"" Singer said.

The achievement highlights the continued scale and efficiency of Tesla’s largest factory outside the United States — and one of the most productive automotive plants in the world.

Located in the Lin-gang Special Area of Shanghai, the factory began operations in late 2019 and has since become a cornerstone of Tesla’s global supply chain. The massive factory produces both Model 3 and Model Y vehicles for the Chinese market as well as exports to dozens of international markets across Europe, Asia, and beyond.

Canada was also part of Giga Shanghai’s export network for a brief period until the federal government imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese-made vehicles, a tariff the government is now reportedly considering to remove.

The 5-million-pack milestone, announced on the company’s official Weibo account in China, follows a series of record-setting achievements for the Shanghai facility. In July 2024, Tesla celebrated producing its 10 millionth drive unit at the same site. By November 2024, Giga Shanghai had built its three millionth vehicle and exported one million units overseas.

These numbers illustrate the plant’s massive contribution to Tesla’s global output. In 2024 alone, Giga Shanghai delivered more than 916,000 vehicles, accounting for roughly half of Tesla’s total worldwide deliveries. The site’s combination of advanced automation, localized supply chains, and production agility continues to set the standard for Tesla’s operations worldwide.

LANSING, MI- Michigan Senate Republicans put out a press release Tuesday that claims: ""Without legislative intervention, new energy laws would force the RICE generators to shut down.” This claim is a thinly veiled attempt by one of the UP’s largest utilities to circumvent our clean energy laws – and worse, it is categorically false.

In fact, the proposal for decision hyperlinked in the Republicans’ release clearly contradicts their claim. The PFD reads: “This PFD agrees with AG-CUB that it is possible for UMERC to operate its RICE units beyond 2040 as merchant plants and still meet the RPS, that is that Act 235 does not per se require their retirement.""

Republicans are either hoping no one will read this dense document or have not read it properly themselves.

Upper Michigan Energy Resources (UMERC) – one of the Upper Peninsula’s largest utilities – claims that compliance with state renewable energy standards would force drastic bill increases for ratepayers. Meanwhile, UMERC’s largest ratepayer, the massive out-of-state steel company Cleveland Cliffs, is ginning up fear among UP miners by threatening an early closure of the Tilden Mine due to our clean energy laws.

One big problem: none of this is true.

UMERC argued that to comply with a 2023 act it would need to prematurely close two natural gas-burning power plants. The legislation actually requires gradual compliance levels through 2040 that are designed to insulate both utilities and ratepayers from unmanageable costs.

The law establishes a renewable energy standard of 50% by 2030 and 60% by 2035, as well as a clean energy standard of 80% by 2035 and 100% by 2040, it would need to prematurely close two natural gas-burning power plants.

Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) staff and an administrative law judge (ALJ) agree that the gas units will not need to shut down for UMERC to comply with these renewable and clean energy standards. They also agree UMERC greatly exaggerated its costs by including expensive, unnecessary battery storage in their proposal that are unlikely to be approved.

House Bills 4007 and 4283 are a “solution” to a fabricated problem.

DETROIT, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lotlinx, the auto industry’s first and only VIN Performance platform built to help dealers maximize profitability, announced today its Q3 2025 Quarterly Vincensus Report, the most comprehensive quarterly inventory report in the industry. Leveraging over 24 billion proprietary VIN-level data points and more than a decade of machine learning innovation, the report delivers unmatched insight into the state of the automotive retail market, including new and used vehicle performance, pricing trends, inventory risk, and consumer behavior. Click here to access the full Q3 Quarterly Vincensus Report.

Market Outlook:

The third quarter of 2025 presented a distorted view of the automotive market, driven by a last-minute rush for electric vehicles (EVs) ahead of an expiring federal tax credit. This surge, a 72% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase in new EV sales, represents a pull-forward of demand rather than organic growth, with EVs still comprising just over 5% of total Q3 sales across brands represented in Vincensus.

While overall new vehicle sales rose 11% QoQ and used sales increased 3%, the underlying data suggests a more price-sensitive and competitive landscape ahead. Inventory levels are stabilizing after years of volatility, exposing challenges for brands with older or mispriced vehicles. Lotlinx anticipates a highly competitive Q4, characterized by increased manufacturer incentives, deeper markdowns, and aggressive year-end sales events as automakers seek to clear aging 2025 model-year inventory.

Key Findings

Inventory and Pricing Trends

New vehicle day supply increased by 5 days QoQ to 62 days (up 1 day YoY)

Used vehicle day supply increased by 1 day QoQ to 40 days (up 4 days YoY)

Carryover for new vehicles decreased 2% QoQ to 52%; used increased 7% QoQ to 50%

Aged ending inventory decreased 3% QoQ to 42% for new vehicles and held steady at 48% for used

Units sold with a markdown increased by 1% QoQ for new vehicles and 3% QoQ for used

EV, Hybrid, and ICE Performance

New EV sales surged 72% QoQ, while hybrids rose 7% and ICE vehicles 9%

EVs made up just 5% of all sales, signaling that the surge is short-term and incentive-driven

New EV day supply dropped to 61 days and used EV day supply to 36 days — both below ICE averages

Average list price of sold new units: EVs $55,510; hybrids $44,100; ICEs $41,857

For used vehicles, EV prices fell 3% QoQ to $28,888, while ICE and hybrid prices remained stable

Market Dynamics and Competition

The stabilization of inventory has introduced new challenges, particularly for brands with aging 2025 stock

Dealers are expected to face the most aggressive pricing environment in years, with manufacturer incentives rising sharply to move inventory

Markdown strategies and real-time decisioning are becoming critical for profitability

Lotlinx Dealer Performance

Lotlinx dealers continued to outperform the broader market during Q3. On average, Lotlinx dealers had 1% less aged inventory for new vehicles and 4% less for used vehicles compared to the market. Additionally, 59% of new vehicle brands and 92% of used vehicle brands leveraging Lotlinx outperformed their respective market benchmarks.

“Dealers are navigating a new chapter of hyper-competition, where every VIN decision matters,” said Len Short, Executive Chairman of Lotlinx. “Our data shows that Lotlinx-powered dealers are winning by acting faster and smarter, using VIN-specific insights to reduce aging, optimize pricing, and preserve profitability, even as the market becomes more volatile.”

,Texas Environment,2025-11-12 15:32:01+00:00,Los Angeles Times,"At Brazilian climate summit, Newsom positions California as a stand-in for the U.S.","Melody Gutierrez, www.latimes.com, melody-gutierrez",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-11-12/newsoms-rise-as-americas-shadow-climate-diplomat,"But on climate, it’s not all performance.
“Absolutely,” he said when asked whether the state is in effect standing in for the United States at climate talks.
“I’m trying to call that out,” Newsom said, adding that in a normal political climate, leaders should model civility and respect.
Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of state leaders, said three governors from the United States attended COP30-related events in Brazil: Newsom, Wisconsin’s Tony Evers and New Mexico’s Michelle Lujan Grisham.
“But some of the decisions that he’s made, especially recently, don’t move us in as good a direction on climate.” Newsom is expected to return to the climate summit Wednesday before traveling deeper into the Amazon, where he plans to visit reforestation projects.","The expansive halls of the Amazon’s newly built climate summit hub echoed with the hum of air conditioners and the footsteps of delegates from around the world — scientists, diplomats, Indigenous leaders and energy executives, all converging for two frenetic weeks of negotiations.

Then Gov. Gavin Newsom rounded the corner, flanked by staff and security. They moved in tandem through the corridors on Tuesday as media swarmed and cellphone cameras rose into the air.

“Hero!” one woman shouted. “Stay safe — we need you,” another attendee said. Others didn’t hide their confusion at who the man with slicked-back graying hair causing such a commotion was.

“I’m here because I don’t want the United States of America to be a footnote at this conference,” Newsom said when he reached a packed news conference on his first day at the United Nations climate policy summit known as COP30.

In less than a year, the United States has shifted from rallying nations on combating climate change to rejecting the science altogether under President Trump, whose brash governing style spawned in part from his reality-show roots.

Newsom has engineered his own evolution when coping with Trump — moving from sharp but reasoned criticism to name-calling and theatrical attacks on the president and his Republican allies. Newsom’s approach adds fire to America’s political spectacle — part governance, part made-for-TV drama. But on climate, it’s not all performance.

California’s carbon market and zero-emission mandates have given the state outsize influence at summits such as COP30, where its policies are seen as both durable and exportable. The state has invested billions in renewables, battery storage and electrifying buildings and vehicles and has cut greenhouse gas emissions by 21% since 2000 — even as its economy grew 81%.

“Absolutely,” he said when asked whether the state is in effect standing in for the United States at climate talks. “And I think the world sees us in that light, as a stable partner, a historic partner … in the absence of American leadership. And not just absence of leadership, the doubling down of stupid in terms of global leadership on clean energy.”

Newsom has honed a combative presence online — trading barbs with Trump and leaning into satire, especially on social media, tactics that mirror the president’s. Critics have argued that it’s contributing to a lowering of the bar when it comes to political discourse, but Newsom said he doesn’t see it that way.

“I’m trying to call that out,” Newsom said, adding that in a normal political climate, leaders should model civility and respect. “But right now, we have an invasive species — in the vernacular of climate — by the name of Donald Trump, and we got to call that out.”

At home, Newsom recently scored a political win with Proposition 50, the ballot measure he championed to counter Trump’s effort to redraw congressional maps in Republican-led states. On his way to Brazil, he celebrated the victory with a swing through Houston, where a rally featuring Texas Democrats looked more like a presidential campaign stop than a policy event — one of several moments in recent months that have invited speculation about a White House run that he insists he hasn’t launched.

Those questions followed him to Brazil. It was the first topic posed from a cluster of Brazilian journalists in Sao Paulo, Brazil’s largest city and financial hub, where Newsom had flown to speak Monday with climate investors in what he conceded sounded more like a campaign speech.

“I think it has to,” said Newson, his talking points scribbled on yellow index cards still in his pocket from an earlier meeting. “I think people have to understand what’s going on, because otherwise you’re wasting everyone’s time.”

In a low-lit luxury hotel adorned with Brazilian artwork and deep-seated chairs, Newsom showcased the well-practiced pivot of a politician avoiding questions about his future. His most direct answer about his presidential prospects came in a recent interview with “CBS News Sunday Morning,” on which Newsom was asked whether he would give serious thought after the 2026 midterm elections to a White House bid. Newsom responded: “Yeah, I’d be lying otherwise.”

He laughed when asked by The Times how often he has fielded questions about his plans in 2028 in recent days, and quickly deflected.

“It’s not about me,” he said before fishing a malaria pill out of his suit pocket and chasing it with borrowed coffee from a nearby carafe. “It’s about this moment and people’s anxiety and concern about this moment.”

Ann Carlson, a UCLA environmental law professor, said Newsom’s appearance in Brazil is symbolically important as the federal government targets Californa’s decades-old authority to enforce its own environmental standards.

“California has continued to signal that it will play a leadership role,” she said.

The Trump administration confirmed to The Times that no high-level federal representative will attend COP30.

“President Trump will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said.

For his own part, Trump told world leaders at the United Nations in September that climate change is a “hoax” and “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”

Since Trump returned to office for a second term, he’s canceled funding for major clean energy projects such as California’s hydrogen hub and moved to revoke the state’s long-held authority to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than those of the federal government. He’s also withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement, a seminal treaty signed a decade ago in which world leaders established the goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels and preferably below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). That move is seen as pivotal in preventing the worst effects of climate change.

Leaders from Chile and Colombia called Trump a liar for rejecting climate science, while Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva broadly warned that extremist forces are fabricating fake news and “condemning future generations to life on a planet altered forever by global warming.”

Terry Tamminen, former California Environmental Protection Agency secretary under Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, contended that with the Trump administration’s absence, Newsom’s attendance at COP30 thrusts even more spotlight on the governor.

“If the governor of Delaware goes, it may not matter,” Tamminen said. “But if our governor goes, it does. It sends a message to the world that we’re still in this.”

The U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of state leaders, said three governors from the United States attended COP30-related events in Brazil: Newsom, Wisconsin’s Tony Evers and New Mexico’s Michelle Lujan Grisham.

Despite the warm reception Newsom has received in Belém, environmentalists in California have recently questioned his commitment.

In September, Newsom signed a package of bills that extended the state’s signature cap-and-trade program through 2045. That program, rebranded as cap-and-invest, limits greenhouse gas emissions and raises billions of dollars for the state’s climate priorities. But, at the same time, he also gave final approval to a bill that will allow oil and gas companies to drill as many as 2,000 new wells per year through 2036 in Kern County. Environmentalists called that backsliding; Newsom called it realism, given the impending refinery closures in the state that threaten to drive up gas prices.

“It’s not an ideological exercise,” he said. “It’s a very pragmatic one.”

Leah Stokes, a UC Santa Barbara political scientist, called his record “pretty complex.”

“In many ways, he is one of the leaders,” she said. “But some of the decisions that he’s made, especially recently, don’t move us in as good a direction on climate.”

Newsom is expected to return to the climate summit Wednesday before traveling deeper into the Amazon, where he plans to visit reforestation projects. The governor said he wanted to see firsthand the region often referred to as “the lungs of the world.”

“It’s not just to admire the absorption of carbon from the rainforest,” Newsom said. “But to absorb a deeper spiritual connection to this issue that connects all of us. ... I think that really matters in a world that can use a little more of that.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0a057d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+284/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2Fbe%2F2d6ba3ce41f0b78a8533ad865521%2Fla-me-newsom-climate-cop30-02.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 13:03:33.944843

Dramatic as it may be, experts say the drop is only temporary, as more people are interested in new EVs, even without the tax credit.

According to J.D. Power, the number of people who are considering a new EV is the highest since January.

EVs are far from done, despite the dramatic decrease in sales last month, the first full month after the $7,500 federal tax credit was repealed. Compared to September, EV sales plummeted by 53%, slashing the market share in half.

But that’s just part of the story, as data analytics, software, and consumer intelligence company J.D. Power recently discovered. For starters, last month’s steep sales dip can be partly attributed to consumers rushing to get the tax credit in September, which ballooned the numbers. So, naturally, fewer people bought new EVs in the following month.

Then–and this is important–consumer interest is growing, not faltering, even without the $7,500 incentive on the table. Per J.D. Power, more than half of new vehicle shoppers (59.7%) say they are “very likely” (24.2%) or “somewhat likely” (35.5%) to consider buying or leasing an EV in the next 12 months. The number of people who are actively looking for a new car and are “very likely” to consider an EV is up 2.6 percentage points from September and is now at its highest level since January.

Current EV owners also need to be thrown into the mix, because most of them–a whopping 94%–say they will buy another EV when the time comes for a new car. Among them, 79% say they “definitely will” buy or lease a new EV, while 15% say they “probably will.”

The explanation for this continued interest is customer satisfaction. Among current EV owners, the number one reason for buying an electric car was the expected lower running costs (57%), followed by the tax credits and incentives (51%), driving performance (48%), purchase price or lease offer (47%), and design (35%).

As J.D. Power notes, the end of the federal tax credit will certainly affect the value equation, but EVs have consistently met or exceeded owners’ expectations on running costs.

This might not mean much today, but it will mean a lot next year, when no fewer than 243,000 franchise EV leases will come to an end. Seeing how 94% of current owners say they won’t go back to gas, many of them will likely buy or lease a new EV, putting them back on the market. For reference, 62% of people who returned an EV at the end of the lease in 2025 chose to buy or lease another one, according to the data intelligence company.

It all comes down to cost. While many EVs are more expensive to buy than their combustion-powered counterparts, they are more affordable to own. Per J.D. Power, 60% of current EV owners say their vehicles are much less expensive to own and operate than gasoline-powered cars, and another 26% say they are slightly less expensive to own. At the same time, just 7% of EV owners say their cars are more expensive to own than gas cars.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/ZngjGz/s1/hummer-ev-tesla-model-y-tesla-cybertruck-ford-mustang-mach-e-and-rivian-r1t-at-a-tesla-supercharger-station.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 13:02:10.212644

“This Trump administration, his acolytes and the supine Congress led by Speaker (Mike) Johnson, are doubling down on stupid,” Newsom said.
“We’re ceding cheap energy, green energy, infrastructure, supply chain manufacturing.
“President Trump will not allow the best interest of the American people to be jeopardized by the Green Energy Scam.
“But it is very positive that we have these other leaders from the United States that are here in Belem,” he said.","Calling America’s absence from key United Nations climate negotiations “doubling down on stupid,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday the United States risks being left behind as an economic power.

Newsom, a Democrat eyeing a 2028 presidential run, is so far the highest profile of several U.S. governors and mayors at U.N. climate talks being hosted in Belem, Brazil. They say they are here to tell the 195 nations who are trying to fight climate change that much of the United States is doing its best despite Trump administration policies overturning environmental regulations and aiding the production of dirty fuels, such as coal, while stymying green energies like wind and solar.

As he did during his first term, President Donald Trump is also pulling America from the 2015 Paris Agreement, which set international goals to limit average global temperature rise.

Newsom's presence as governor of the most populous U.S. state serves to draw a clear contrast with Trump's absence. He said Trump's decision to skip the talks tells the world: “You don’t matter, we don’t care.”

“This idea that somehow we can put up walls, we can put up barriers, we could put up tariffs, we put up our middle fingers and just turn our back is lunacy,"" Newsom said during an exclusive Associated Press interview at the climate talks in Belem, a city on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. ""And every other country in the world understands that. That’s why every other country in this world is moving in a different direction.”

Green energy transition and China's dominance

Even Russia and Saudi Arabia get it and are going green, but not Trump, Newsom said. U.N. organizers said only four nations are absent from the negotiations called COP30: Strife-torn Afghanistan and Myanmar, tiny San Marino and the United States, which over the century has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the air than any other nation.

California, with nearly 40 million residents, is a major economic hub and on the forefront of national climate policy. But the Trump administration has sought to roll back the state’s power to set aggressive climate policy, most notably by blocking a California regulation to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars within the next decade.

“This Trump administration, his acolytes and the supine Congress led by Speaker (Mike) Johnson, are doubling down on stupid,” Newsom said.

“We’re ceding cheap energy, green energy, infrastructure, supply chain manufacturing. We’re ceding economic power to other countries, notably China, taking advantage of that absence,” Newsom said. “And they’re going to clean our clock economically unless we wake up to the economic imperative and opportunities of low carbon regrowth.”

Trump, who actively solicited money from the fossil fuel industry during his last campaign, has massively deregulated industry that spews heat-trapping gas and cut subsidies to renewable energy. This would give America — the No. 1 oil producer in the world — energy independence and cheaper prices, he has said.

“Governor Newscum flew all the way to Brazil to tout the Green New Scam, while the people of California are paying some of the highest energy prices in the country. Embarrassing!,"" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement, using one of Trump's favored nicknames for Newsom. “President Trump will not allow the best interest of the American people to be jeopardized by the Green Energy Scam. These Green Dreams are killing other countries, but will not kill ours thanks to President Trump’s common sense energy agenda.”

Climate impacts in California and around the world

Climate change is undeniable, despite Trump calling it a hoax, Newsom said.

“If you don’t believe in science, and a lot of people apparently don’t, you have to believe in your own eyes,” Newsom said. “Nighttime temperatures, record-breaking heat globally, acidification of our oceans, impacts on our coral reefs. You’re not able to go where your grandfather brought you for the first time, your dad brought you and bring your kids because there’s another fire and it’s another closure and the air quality’s been degraded.”

California has warmed 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) in the past 30 years — slightly more than the U.S. as a whole — and gets nearly 7 inches of rain (17.7 centimeters) less now than it did in 1995, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records.

Some of California's largest and most destructive wildfires in history have sparked in the last five years, including two January infernos that devastated neighborhoods in and around Los Angeles. The previous winter, meanwhile, brought record-breaking rainfall as multiple atmospheric rivers pounded the state.

“I’m just privileged to represent one of the most blessed and cursed states in the world that’s on the tip of the spear of the impacts of climate change,"" Newsom said. “How about the simultaneous crisis of wildfires, drought, and floods stacked on top of each other.”

“Anyone paying attention here?” added Newsom.

California's ambitious climate goals and challenges

At home, Newsom has confronted the economic and political realities of pursuing the state's ambitious goal of by 2045 reaching carbon neutrality, or taking as much carbon pollution from the atmosphere as emitted. He recently signed legislation to boost oil production in part of the state, and his party has grappled with how to confront high gas prices. California also has some of the highest electricity rates in the country.

California is also dealing with the massive energy and water demands of data centers by keeping its last nuclear plant running longer than planned, adding huge chunks of solar power and battery storage and investing in nuclear fusion, Newsom said. Those energy needs will grow as AI continues to boom. Many of the nation's top AI companies are headquartered in California.

Veteran climate negotiations analyst Alden Meyer of the European think tank E3G said it was unfortunate that America's federal government was not participating in the talks.

The plant in Liberty, North Carolina, about 60 miles west of Raleigh, is the company's first and only battery plant outside of Japan.
The facility will house 14 battery production lines supporting gas-powered hybrid (HEV), full battery-electric (BEV) and plug-in hybrid models (PHEV).
The initial lines are set to power the company's Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, RAV4 HEV and a yet-to-be-announced all-electric three-row vehicle.
Phil Berger, the longtime leader of the North Carolina state Senate, added: “This is a monumental day for North Carolina and Toyota.","Washington — Toyota Motor Corp.'s $13.9 billion battery plant in North Carolina began production Tuesday.

The opening comes less than four years after a 2022 groundbreaking at the site and marks a significant milestone for the Japanese auto giant. The plant in Liberty, North Carolina, about 60 miles west of Raleigh, is the company's first and only battery plant outside of Japan.

""Toyota is a pioneer in electrified vehicles, and the company’s significant manufacturing investment in the U.S. and North Carolina further solidifies our commitment to team members, customers, dealers, communities, and suppliers,” said Ted Ogawa, president and CEO of the automaker's North American branch, in a statement.

The plant opening also underscores the company's commitment to a future business model that relies more heavily on battery electric vehicles, even as the Trump administration cuts federal support for such a transition. Toyota, which has a massive gas-electric hybrid portfolio, has purposefully lagged behind other U.S. competitors on BEVs but still has long-term sights set on electrification.

The 1,850-acre site, according to Toyota, will be able to produce 30 gigawatt-hours annually at full capacity and support 5,100 new jobs. The facility will house 14 battery production lines supporting gas-powered hybrid (HEV), full battery-electric (BEV) and plug-in hybrid models (PHEV). Additional lines will launch by 2030.

The initial lines are set to power the company's Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, RAV4 HEV and a yet-to-be-announced all-electric three-row vehicle.

Toyota also announced $10 billion worth of investment into the United States as part of the launch, which would bring the company's total U.S. investment to $60 billion since beginning operations in the country nearly 70 years ago, per a press release.

The company highlighted support from prominent national and local Republican politicians as the Liberty plant begins production.

“Toyota’s move to expand production in North Carolina is the latest show of confidence in this administration’s efforts to reshore manufacturing, generate new, great paying jobs, and inject billions of dollars into the economy. We’re just getting started!” said U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy.

Phil Berger, the longtime leader of the North Carolina state Senate, added: “This is a monumental day for North Carolina and Toyota. Even before the first battery rolled off the production line, Toyota has made a real impact in our state. I look forward to seeing North Carolina’s partnership with Toyota continue to grow for generations to come.”

This week Toyota is officially opening a lithium ion battery production facility in Liberty, North Carolina.
The plant will ultimately have a production capacity of 30-GWh of cells which would support production of over 300,000 battery electric vehicles.
The materials required for one BEV battery could produce 90 hybrid batteries and six PHEV batteries.
The Liberty battery plant began shipping hybrid modules to the Georgetown, KY assembly plant in June of this year and is now supplying the Camry, Grand Highlander, Corolla Cross and new Rav4.","Toyota has been building vehicles in the US for nearly 40 years and started producing engines just a few years later. Over the years, most of Toyota’s supply base has also set up manufacturing facilities in North America as well. But despite selling more hybrid vehicles than any other company in the world, Toyota has never produced batteries here until this year. This week Toyota is officially opening a lithium ion battery production facility in Liberty, North Carolina.

The $13.9-billion plant was announced in 2021 with an initial investment of $1.29-billion but the scope of the facility quickly grew. The plant will ultimately have a production capacity of 30-GWh of cells which would support production of over 300,000 battery electric vehicles. However, initial production at the plant is focused on batteries for hybrid electric vehicles.

In recent years, Toyota has been shifting toward making hybrid powertrains standard on an increasing number of models as part of its multi-pathway approach to electrification. The company has argued that selling large volumes of hybrids will have more positive environmental impact than a small number BEVs. This includes both the direct vehicle emissions and the environmental impact of producing batteries.

The automaker has called out its 1-6-90 rule. The materials required for one BEV battery could produce 90 hybrid batteries and six PHEV batteries. With each hybrid giving about a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, 3.5 hybrids would have a similar impact to one zero-emission vehicle. Through the first nine months of 2025, Toyota sold 17,760 zero-emission vehicles and nearly 875,000 hybrids and PHEVs.

In addition to the Prius, Sienna, Sequoia, Camry, Crown and the new 2026 Rav4 all have standard hybrid powertrains while all of the other Toyota and Lexus brand vehicles except for the bZ and RZ BEVs have hybrids at least as an option. Many of these models now also offer plug-in hybrid options which feature a larger battery pack.

The Liberty battery plant began shipping hybrid modules to the Georgetown, KY assembly plant in June of this year and is now supplying the Camry, Grand Highlander, Corolla Cross and new Rav4. Three of 14 planned production lines are already running with a fourth currently being installed. The hybrid batteries are typically about 1.5-kWh capacity with plug-in hybrids generally running from about 18-kWh to 22.7-kWh for the new Rav4. The cells being produced in North Carolina are all rectangular, prismatic can format.

The current Toyota bZ and Lexus RZ BEVs are built in Japan and have 74-kWh batteries. However, the Liberty plant will produce the batteries for an upcoming electric three-row SUV that may debut by the end of 2026 or sometime in 2027. That larger vehicle is likely to use a battery closer to 100 to 110-kWh, similar to what is found in competitors like the Kia EV9 and Hyundai Ioniq 9.

For a plant with a 30-GWh capacity, the $13.9-billion price tag is about three times the investment in other US plants with similar capacity. However, most of those other plants only produce the cells with cathode and anode material processing and module and pack assembly taking place elsewhere. Toyota will be doing all of this work in the Liberty facility. Given the slower rate of EV adoption since the plant was announced, it probably won’t reach its full capacity for several more years. Two million hybrid vehicles annually would only need about 3-GWH and another 200,000 PHEVs would take up another 4-GWh leaving enough capacity for well over 200,000 BEVs.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6913c3d0cd69709bc16d0f10/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-11-12 11:05:33.847805

Nuclear science not only provides the world with reliable clean energy, but also helps scientists monitor and protect ecosystems, enhance food security and reduce pollution.

At the IAEA Atoms4Climate Pavilion, visitors can see these innovations in action. In Brazil, for example, electron beam (e-beam) technology is transforming industrial wastewater treatment. In Latin America, countries are using nuclear techniques to control pests, safeguard crops and food exports — a win for farmers, consumers and the environment.

Treating wastewater contaminated by industrial pollutants remains a major challenge for many countries. Through its support for electron beam (e-beam) technology, the IAEA is helping countries develop innovative, chemical-free solutions that break down complex contaminants and improve water quality. Supported by the IAEA and Brazil’s Innovation Agency (FINEP), a mobile unit equipped with an electron beam accelerator is being deployed in Brazil to treat industrial wastewater, improving water quality and environmental protection.

The IAEA’s Marine Environment Laboratories in Monaco support blue carbon initiatives that focus on mangroves, seagrasses, and saltmarshes — coastal ecosystems that capture and store organic carbon. Using nuclear and isotopic techniques, the IAEA helps countries assess carbon sequestration rates and ecosystem health, contributing to climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation. At COP30, IAEA’s work on blue carbon will be highlighted at the UN-Oceans session “Ocean-climate-biodiversity nexus: leveraging synergies across frameworks,” focusing on building partnerships for nature-based solutions.

The sterile insect technique (SIT) is an environmentally friendly pest control method used to control harmful fruit fly populations in Brazil, Chile and Mexico. Sometimes described as birth control for insects, SIT works by releasing male insects that have been sterilized using radiation, which mate with wild female insects, resulting in no offspring. The SIT reduces reliance on insecticides, protects crops and enables countries to gain access to international markets for food exports. It is showcased at COP30 as part of climate-smart agriculture efforts using nuclear science and techniques.

Glaciers are retreating and even disappearing in many mountainous regions, threatening water supplies for millions. The IAEA supports countries like Bolivia in using nuclear techniques — such as Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensors and isotope hydrology — to monitor soil moisture and water availability in high-altitude ecosystems. These tools help scientists and decision makers assess the impact of glacier retreat on water resources and guide sustainable land management. At COP30, the IAEA is highlighting this work in the session “Nuclear Science for Climate Resilience”, aligned with the UN 2025 Year of Glaciers’ Preservation, and showcasing how nuclear applications empower local communities to adapt to changing conditions.

What Happened

According to an SEC filing released on Friday, WT Asset Management initiated a new position in NIO (NIO 3.39%), acquiring 18.7 million shares valued at $142.1 million as of September 30. This entry marks NIO as one of the fund’s largest equity positions at quarter-end, based on the reported holdings.

What Else to Know

This new position accounts for 6.6% of WT Asset Management’s reportable U.S. equity assets under management as of September 30.

Top five holdings after the filing:

NASDAQ:NVDA: $334.6 million (15.5% of AUM)

NYSE:RBLX: $158.2 million (7.3% of AUM)

NASDAQ:APP: $148.6 million (6.9% of AUM)

NYSE:NIO: $142.1 million (6.6% of AUM)

NASDAQ:HOOD: $128.8 million (6% of AUM)

As of Tuesday's market close, NIO shares were priced at $6.63, up 31% over the past year and well outperforming the S&P 500, which is up 14% in the same period.

Company Overview

Company Snapshot

NIO Inc. is a leading Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer focused on the design, development, and sale of smart electric SUVs and sedans. The company leverages a comprehensive ecosystem of charging and battery solutions to differentiate its customer experience and drive recurring service revenue. NIO's integrated approach positions it as a key player in China's premium EV market, supported by a robust service network and technology-driven product strategy.

Foolish Take

WT Asset Management’s new $142 million position in NIO signals a high-conviction bet on China’s EV rebound after a punishing multiyear downturn. The Hong Kong-based fund purchased 18.7 million shares in the third quarter, making NIO its fourth-largest holding at 6.6% of 13F assets, according to its latest SEC filing.

The move follows a strong second quarter for NIO, which reported record deliveries of 72,056 vehicles, up 26% year over year, and total revenue of $2.65 billion—a 9% year-over-year increase. The company also narrowed its net loss by 26% quarter to quarter. Despite these gains, shares remain down nearly 90% from early 2021 highs, underscoring both the opportunity and risk facing long-term investors.

For context, WT’s other top holdings—Nvidia, Roblox, and AppLovin—all tie to digital platforms and growth technologies with exposure to Greater China, suggesting NIO fits a broader thematic push toward innovation-driven assets. With EV adoption rising and NIO cutting operational losses, the firm’s timing could pay off if China’s demand stabilizes. Still, profitability remains elusive, and execution risks will determine whether this rebound proves durable.

In addition, the company throughout November will provide another $500,000 to at least 60 feeding programs statewide amid funding uncertainties as colder weather and the holiday season approaches

Since 2021, Duke Energy and the Foundation have dedicated more than $2.6 million to support the efforts of these agencies

Duke Energy and Duke Energy Foundation are contributing $100,000 to the One SC Fund recently activated by Gov. Henry McMaster to support food banks across the state.

Why it matters: As colder weather and the holidays approach, many South Carolina families turn to assistance programs that help support those facing hunger. But those programs are facing challenges of their own to support this tremendous need. That is why it is important to support the organizations that do this great work.

What they are saying

Gov. Henry McMaster: ""Duke Energy's contribution to the One SC Fund highlights the very best of South Carolina. At a time when many families are facing uncertainty, Team South Carolina is coming together to support our food banks and put food on the table. I'm grateful for their generosity and hope it will encourage others to join our effort to help families in need.""

Tim Pearson, Duke Energy's South Carolina president: ""These organizations are fighting the good fight every day in communities across our state, but they cannot do it alone. Duke Energy is happy to stand with the governor, and we encourage other corporate entities, organizations and citizens across the state to help support the fight against hunger.""

Bottom line: Duke Energy's support of these organizations and the issue of hunger in the Palmetto State is nothing new. Starting next week, Duke Energy, with support from Duke Energy Foundation, will kick off the company's monthlong annual campaign to support organizations in South Carolina that address food insecurities and inequities. The fifth year of the initiative will provide over $500,000 to more than 60 feeding programs leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday and culminate in final surprise grant announcements on Giving Tuesday.

Zoom in: This campaign is in addition to the support of the One SC Fund and will highlight critical community partners that do this incredible work to fight hunger, including Harvest Hope Food Bank, Mill Village Farms, Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina, FoodShare South Carolina and AIM, among many others. Duke Energy employees will also provide their time and talents volunteering with organizations throughout the month.

Go deeper: Customers struggling to put food on the table are also likely making decisions about what bills to pay at home, including their electricity bill. That is why it is important to also offer information that can assist families to manage their energy bills when times are tough.

This will bring the company’s total U.S. investment to nearly $60 billion since beginning operations here nearly 70 years ago.
“Today’s launch of Toyota’s first U.S. battery plant and additional U.S. investment up to $10 billion marks a pivotal moment in our company’s history,” said Ted Ogawa, president and chief executive officer, Toyota Motor North America (TMNA).
“Today marks a historic milestone as Toyota begins battery production right here in North Carolina,” said Governor Josh Stein.

(Nov. 12, 2025) – Toyota supercharged its multi-pathway approach to global vehicle electrification with the highly anticipated start of production at its all-new battery plant in Liberty, North Carolina. It is Toyota’s eleventh U.S. plant and the company’s first and only battery plant outside of Japan. The nearly $14 billion facility will create up to 5,100 new American jobs.

Building on its unwavering commitment to the U.S., Toyota announced an additional investment of up to $10 billion over the next five years to support future mobility efforts. This will bring the company’s total U.S. investment to nearly $60 billion since beginning operations here nearly 70 years ago.

“Today’s launch of Toyota’s first U.S. battery plant and additional U.S. investment up to $10 billion marks a pivotal moment in our company’s history,” said Ted Ogawa, president and chief executive officer, Toyota Motor North America (TMNA). “Toyota is a pioneer in electrified vehicles, and the company’s significant manufacturing investment in the U.S. and North Carolina further solidifies our commitment to team members, customers, dealers, communities, and suppliers.”

United States Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy expressed support for manufacturing investments in the U.S., noting that Toyota North Carolina’s investment of nearly $14 billion and the creation of more than 5,000 new jobs marks a turning point for the Piedmont Triad region.

“Under President Donald Trump’s leadership, America is open for business,” said U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy. “Toyota’s move to expand production in North Carolina is the latest show of confidence in this administration’s efforts to reshore manufacturing, generate new, great paying jobs, and inject billions of dollars into the economy. We’re just getting started!”

The 1,850-acre mega site can produce 30 GWh annually at full capacity. It will serve as Toyota’s hub for developing and producing lithium-ion batteries needed for its ever-growing portfolio of electrified vehicles. The state-of-the-art plant will house 14 battery production lines supporting hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), making it a historical investment for Toyota and a substantial economic impact on the Tarheel State.

“Today marks a historic milestone as Toyota begins battery production right here in North Carolina,” said Governor Josh Stein. “This groundbreaking investment will create more than 5,000 new jobs for North Carolinians and will strengthen our commitment to leading the way in both the automotive supply chain and the clean energy economy.”

Batteries assembled at Toyota North Carolina are set to power the Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, RAV4 HEV, and a yet-to-be-announced all-electric 3-row BEV—the first of its kind for Toyota to be built in the U.S. Currently, the plant ships HEV modules to both Toyota Kentucky and Mazda Toyota Manufacturing in Alabama. Additional production lines at Toyota North Carolina are set to launch by 2030. Once construction is complete, the new facility will not just be a place of work, but also a vibrant community, featuring a range of amenities for team members, including on-site childcare, a pharmacy, a medical clinic and a fitness center.

“We’re excited to see this innovative facility come to life and to provide cutting-edge careers for more than 5,000 North Carolinians,” said Don Stewart, president of Toyota North Carolina. “Today’s celebration would not be complete without thanking our team members. Their dedication, commitment, and resolve have truly led us to this historic moment. We also are grateful for the support shown to us by the State of North Carolina, Randolph County, and the greater Triad region, a place we are all proud to call home.”

The company remains steadfast in its commitment to being the best in town by supporting workforce development and educational initiatives. Through partnerships with schools and educators across the region, Toyota is developing the Triad’s future workforce with its time, talent and treasure.

During the ceremony, Toyota announced the second phase of Driving Possibilities in Guilford County Schools and the Asheboro City School District, with a Toyota USA Foundation grant of an additional $2.7 million. Driving Possibilities is a national STEM education initiative that brings together community, education leaders, local and national nonprofits, and industry partners to co-create programs that strengthen communities and prepare young people for future STEM careers.

“This incredible gift will provide our students and their families with life-changing opportunities,” said Wendy Poteat, president and CEO of shift_ed, a non-profit regional leader connecting education to workforce development, and coordinating partner for the NC Driving Possibilities program. “Toyota has become a generous supporter and dedicated stakeholder in enriching our school districts by inspiring innovation and nurturing curiosity and creativity in our learners from classroom to career. Programs like these are essential in closing opportunity and exposure gaps, empowering students to reach their full potential.”

Driving Possibilities is funded by the Toyota USA Foundation, with additional support provided by Toyota Motor North America (TMNA) and Toyota Financial Services (TFS).

A pioneer in electrified vehicles, Toyota has sold more than 6.6 million hybrid, plug-in hybrid, fuel cell and battery electric vehicles in the U.S. since 2000. Toyota currently assembles 11 HEVs and PHEVs in the U.S. as part of the company’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions and its philosophy of building where it sells.

Summary

Energy Transfer LP lowered its 2025 growth capital guidance by 8%, reflecting justified execution risks and sector headwinds, but maintains a robust long-term outlook.

ET's diversified growth projects, including natural gas transportation and long-term contracts, reduce concentration risk and position ET for AI-driven electricity demand appetite.

Despite near-term DCF headwinds and deferred earnings accretion until 2027, ET's valuation has normalized, and its forward yield now exceeds 8.3%.

A salivating prospect awaits ET buyers willing to tide through the near-term uncertainties while allowing the buying accumulation to pan out.

Thus, I deemed that an upgrade is finally due, as I urge investors to capitalize on the weakness while the market looks elsewhere.

“India’s EV and energy storage sectors are entering a transformative decade,” a Maxvolt spokesperson said.","Maxvolt Energy Industries, a leading Indian lithium-ion battery manufacturer, has announced plans to triple its production capacity to 2.25 lakh units annually, marking a major milestone in its growth journey. The company has acquired 55,000 square feet of land in the Duhai Industrial Area, Ghaziabad, to establish a state-of-the-art battery manufacturing and recycling facility, which is expected to commence operations by December 2025.

The expansion aligns with India’s accelerating shift toward electric mobility and sustainable energy storage solutions. Maxvolt aims to enhance domestic production capabilities to meet the surging demand for EV batteries, energy storage systems (ESS), and renewable energy applications.

Strategic Expansion to Boost India’s Battery Manufacturing Ecosystem

The upcoming Ghaziabad facility will increase Maxvolt’s annual lithium-ion battery capacity from approximately 72,000 units to 2.25 lakh units, significantly boosting output. In addition to manufacturing, the plant will also focus on battery recycling, supporting India’s circular economy goals and minimizing environmental waste from used cells.

According to the company, the integrated facility will include advanced automated production lines, testing labs, and R&D units aimed at improving battery efficiency, safety, and longevity. This expansion will enable Maxvolt to serve a wider range of industries—including electric vehicles, solar power backup, telecom infrastructure, and industrial energy storage.

Commitment to Sustainability and Circular Economy

Maxvolt Energy has been at the forefront of promoting eco-friendly manufacturing practices. The company’s investment in recycling infrastructure reflects its commitment to a closed-loop energy ecosystem, reducing import dependency and ensuring the responsible handling of used lithium cells.

“India’s EV and energy storage sectors are entering a transformative decade,” a Maxvolt spokesperson said. “Our expansion in Ghaziabad will increase manufacturing efficiency and reinforce our role as a trusted partner for clean energy and mobility solutions.”

The move comes at a time when India’s battery demand is projected to reach 260 GWh by 2030, driven by electric vehicle adoption and grid-scale energy storage. The government’s policies, including the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme and Battery Waste Management Rules, have encouraged domestic manufacturers like Maxvolt to scale production and invest in sustainable innovation.

Industry analysts believe this expansion will strengthen India’s position in the global lithium-ion value chain while creating employment opportunities and localizing advanced energy technologies.

Looking Ahead

Once operational, we expect the Ghaziabad plant to significantly enhance Maxvolt’s market share in the EV battery pack and ESS segment. The company plans to further explore partnerships with electric mobility startups, OEMs, and energy service providers to meet the growing demand for high-performance lithium-ion solutions.

With a focus on scalability, sustainability, and innovation, Maxvolt Energy’s expansion represents a critical step in supporting India’s mission toward net-zero emissions and energy independence.

“In Europe, the overall year-to-date growth figure remains relatively high and we're expecting strong sales towards the end of the year,” Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester said, as quoted by Reuters. “Chinese automotive market is expected to show strong growth in November and December, helped by pull forward effect as the country is moving from a full purchase tax exemption to just a 50% exemption on NEVs.”

After landing Google’s $15 billion project, Andhra Pradesh is doubling down on its next growth frontier — clean energy, AI, quantum computing, and electronics manufacturing. Minister Nara Lokesh says the state’s “sector-agnostic” approach is attracting both global and domestic players.

In an exclusive conversation with CNBC-TV18, Lokesh revealed that the state’s major upcoming investments will focus on clean energy, steel, electronics manufacturing, and AI-driven technologies.

“Clean energy is a very important sector for us,” he said. “Even traditional industries like steel depend on it. We’re also focusing on IT, AI, data centres, and quantum computing — these are our primary thrust areas.”

Lokesh said Andhra is also investing in agriculture and food processing. “As important as a Google investment is, a mushroom processing unit is equally important to me because Andhra is predominantly an agrarian economy,” he said.

He added that the state’s new initiatives in rare earth minerals and beach sand mining will help create a vertical and horizontal industrial ecosystem that connects education, skills, and production.

Last May, as blistering-hot weather broke records across South Florida and smoke from distant wildfires in Mexico turned the sky hazy, Ron DeSantis, Florida’s Republican governor, signed legislation erasing most mentions of “climate change” from state law. “We’re restoring sanity in our approach to energy and rejecting the agenda of the radical green zealots,” he wrote on X.

Back then, it felt like just another Florida story, a fresh example of the culture war overriding reality. In hindsight, it was a preview of where the country was headed.

President Donald Trump’s second term has plunged the United States into “don’t say climate” politics. Even as horrific floods and fires unfolded around the country this year, Republicans in Congress reversed the country’s only climate plan. The administration has deleted “climate change” from hundreds of government webpages and dismissed facts about the warming planet as “brainless fear-mongering rhetoric.” Rather than pushing back, Democrats have been talking about climate change less since the 2024 election, emphasizing “cheap energy” instead.

Even if talking about climate change is politically radioactive, adapting to its effects is no longer optional. Florida tops some lists for the state most at risk from climate change, facing a combination of heat, drought, fires, flooding and hurricanes. Miami Beach and towns in the Florida Keys have been raising their roads as the sea begins to rise. DeSantis has committed more than $1 billion to Resilient Florida, a grant program that helps local governments address some of these problems.

You don’t necessarily have to mention climate change to start adapting to it — a phenomenon now seen all over the country. PG&E is burying its power lines underground to avoid sparking fires in California’s drying forests, in the name of “wildfire safety.” After Hurricane Harvey flooded Houston, the county began buying homes that have been repeatedly inundated and relocating residents, turning their former homes into open space to absorb floodwaters.

“There’s been a radical increase in how many people are realizing that whether it’s flooding, drought, fire, air quality impacts from fire — take your example — the disasters have been getting out ahead of us,” said Katharine Mach, a professor of environmental science and policy at the University of Miami.

Since at least the 1980s, the public discussion over climate change has revolved around trying to get the world’s carbon emissions under control. But as time has worn on and emissions have continued to rise, it’s become much more about living with the effects of an overheating planet. A recent United Nations report found the world will soon overshoot its goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), with current policies likely to lead to 2.8 degrees C (5 degrees F) of warming by the end of the century. That’s a slight improvement from previous estimates, but still translates to an unrecognizable planet.

“We have unleashed a world where many climate impacts are now locked in,” said Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director for climate and energy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Because we did not act quickly enough, it’s not just about mitigation anymore. We have to adapt.”

Bill Gates, who’s long funded efforts to switch to clean energy, recently wrote an essay arguing that climate advocates have spent too much time and effort on reducing emissions, and not enough on programs that help people stay resilient in the face of increasingly dangerous weather.

“Unfortunately, the doomsday outlook is causing much of the climate community to focus too much on near-term emissions goals, and it’s diverting resources from the most effective things we should be doing to improve life in a warming world,” Gates wrote.

The question of how to fund efforts for low-income countries to adjust to this new, unpredictable environment has become a central concern for this year’s global climate talks in Belém, Brazil, which started Monday. “It’s a responsibility that richer nations, major emitting nations, have been shirking for the longest time,” Cleetus said. Another recent U.N. report found that developing countries will need at least $310 billion a year over the next 10 years to prepare for the effects of climate change. In 2023, richer countries only provided $26 billion.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has eviscerated foreign aid, stripping away development funding for poorer countries while undermining its own ability to respond to disasters at home. Cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have hindered forecasters’ ability to predict what’s coming, at the same time as the diminished Federal Emergency Management Agency has forced local governments to fend for themselves. The U.S. isn’t sending any high-level delegates to the talks in Belém, marking the first time the country will go unrepresented at the annual U.N. climate conference.

“I’ve never seen an administration be so deliberately undermining a country’s capability to be prepared and to deal with challenges like this,” said Susanne Moser, a social scientist who’s considered one of the leading experts on climate adaptation.

Billionaires like Gates are stepping into the gap. MacKenzie Scott, another influential philanthropist, recently donated $60 million to the Center for Disaster Philanthropy to help with disaster preparedness and recovery.

Experts said the new focus on adapting to a changing climate was necessary, but they said that Gates — like many before him — needlessly pitted the need to adapt against the need to cut emissions when both things can happen at the same time.

“Adaptation can actually not succeed, ultimately, if climate change goes unchecked,” Moser said. Today, the world has seen about 1.3 degrees C (2.3 F) of additional warming since before industrial times, but as Gates notes, it could reach 3 degrees C (5.4 F) by the end of the century.

“A 3-degree world is not a world in which adaptation can provide well-being and health,” Moser said. “It’s just simply, people are living in ruins and are trying to basically survive.”

There’s an entrenched idea among environmentalists that discussions over how to adapt to climate change distract from the core mission of cutting planet-warming emissions, what’s known as mitigation. It’s sometimes perceived as a form of giving up. But studies have repeatedly shown that talking about adaptation doesn’t necessarily reduce public support for mitigation efforts. If anything, the challenges of adapting — the high price tag of raising roads in low-lying coastal areas, or the difficulties of relocating communities out of danger zones — highlight the need for reducing emissions. “Once you begin adaptation and you see how difficult it is, mitigation looks like a cakewalk,” Moser said.

If Florida is any indication, the two might go hand in hand. Yoca Arditi-Rocha, CEO of The CLEO Institute, a climate education nonprofit in Florida, says that the state has made a lot of progress that doesn’t often get discussed. In fact, it’s one of the largest markets for electric vehicles in the country, and also right near the top for installations of utility-scale solar and rooftop solar.

Arditi-Rocha hopes Florida can show the rest of the country that climate action can still move forward, even if the term itself remains politically off-limits. Getting specific helps, she said: Talking about how towns need more trees for shade, or how they need to be prepared for hurricanes and heat waves, is simply practical. Then again, so is reducing carbon emissions.

“We have to shut down the overflowing bathtub,” Arditi-Rocha said. “We cannot be mopping the floor forever.”

MANAGEMENT COMMENTS

“U.S. Energy delivered another quarter of meaningful operational progress in Q3 2025 as we advanced our Montana industrial gas project,” said Ryan Smith, CEO. “With disciplined execution across upstream development, infrastructure build-out, and carbon management, the Kevin Dome’s scale and strategic location continue to position us as a first mover in a rapidly expanding segment of the energy market. Design of our initial processing facility is now complete, with construction commencing in the coming months—unlocking new revenue streams from both industrial gas production and carbon initiatives. The capture of recycled CO₂ will support carbon management and enhanced oil recovery across legacy assets, creating an integrated platform that maximizes value realization. Our consistent performance, capital discipline, and long-term strategy continue to drive scalable growth and build sustainable shareholder value.”

ADVANCING FULL-CYCLE INDUSTRIAL GAS DEVELOPMENT

The Company continues to achieve significant milestones while advancing the full-cycle development of its industrial gas assets across the Kevin Dome in Montana.

Upstream Development

Drilled two additional industrial gas wells in the quarter, bringing the total to three high-deliverability wells in the CO₂ and helium-rich Duperow Formation, each positioned to deliver strong economic returns.

The three wells achieved a combined peak rate of 12.2 MMcf/d, with high-value composition of ~0.5% helium and 85% CO₂. After testing, flows were restricted to ~8.0 MMcf/d and then shut in to preserve reservoir value until infrastructure is online, setting up an efficient production ramp-up.

Planning one additional industrial gas well for Spring 2026 in the same formation.

Advancing EOR opportunities using recycled CO₂ on nearby Company-owned oil assets.

Undertaking helium offtake negotiations with third-party end users to support commercialization.

Infrastructure Development

Finalized the design for the initial gas processing facility, targeting high purity recovery of helium and recycled CO2, with capital deployment expected to begin in early 2026.

Acquired 80 acres in Toole County, MT for $240,000 to serve as the facility site.

Finalized design of the infill gathering system; construction scheduled for early 2026 to connect wells directly to processing and sequestration.

Permitting, land access, and utility connections progressing in parallel to support a timely startup.

Once operational, the facilities are expected to generate diversified cash flow from helium sales, incremental oil from EOR, and carbon management.

Carbon Management Initiatives

EPA Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) plan was submitted in October 2025, with approval expected by Spring-Summer 2026, creating the ability to capture federal carbon credits.

Preparing second MRV plan for EOR operations, with submission targeted for December 2025.

Sustained injection of 17.0 MMcf/d across two Company-owned wells, equivalent to ~240,000 metric tons of CO₂ sequestered annually.

Progressing near-term EOR projects using recycled CO₂ on legacy oil assets.

Second Class II injection well approved by Montana regulators in August 2025.

CURRENT INDUSTRIAL GAS RESOURCE REPORT

The Company recently had an industrial gas resource report prepared by Ryder Scott for the volumes in place on its initial target development area across its Kevin Dome asset. The report concluded 1.28 billion cubic feet (""BCF"") of net helium resources and 443.8 BCF of net CO2 resources, contingent upon economics and future development. The gas concentrations used for the report were 0.4% - 0.5% helium and 84% - 85% CO2, reflecting the composition of the Company’s recent development activities.

THIRD QUARTER 2025 FINANCIAL RESULTS

The Company’s proved developed producing (“PDP”) oil and gas reserve base as of October 1, 2025 consisted of approximately 1.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (“BOE”) comprised of approximately 75% oil. The present value discounted at 10% (“PV-10”) of the Company’s reserves was approximately $20.5 million at SEC pricing, with assumed pricing of $67.45/bbl, $3.10/mcf, and $33.01/boe for oil, gas, and natural gas liquids, respectively.

Total hydrocarbon production for the third quarter of 2025 was approximately 35,326 BOE consisting of 75% oil production. Total oil and gas sales for the third quarter of 2025 were approximately $1.7 million, compared to $5.0 million in the same quarter of 2024. This decrease in production and revenue primarily reflects the effects of the Company’s divestiture program throughout 2024. Oil sales accounted for 91% of total revenue this quarter, an increase from 88% during the third quarter of 2024.

Lease operating expenses (LOE) for the third quarter of 2025 were approximately $1.0 million, or $29.36 per Boe, compared to $3.1 million, or $28.95 per Boe, in the prior year. The overall reduction in LOE is primarily attributable to fewer producing assets as a result of our asset divestitures.

Cash general and administrative (G&A) expenses for the third quarter of 2025 were approximately $1.7 million, a decrease of 15 percent when compared to $2.0 million reported in the third quarter of 2024. The decrease was due to a reduction in acquisition costs.

Adjusted EBITDA was ($1.3) million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2024. The Company reported a net loss of $3.3 million, or a loss of $0.10 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2025.

ADJUSTED EBITDA RECONCILIATION

In addition to our results calculated under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), in this earnings release we also present Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a “non-GAAP financial measure” presented as supplemental measures of the Company’s performance. It is not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), plus net interest expense, net unrealized loss (gain) on change in fair value of derivatives, income tax (benefit) expense, deferred income taxes, depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization, one-time costs associated with completed transactions and the associated assumed derivative contracts, non-cash share-based compensation, transaction related expenses, transaction related acquired realized derivative loss (gain), and loss (gain) on marketable securities. Company management believes this presentation is relevant and useful because it helps investors understand U.S. Energy’s operating performance and makes it easier to compare its results with those of other companies that have different financing, capital and tax structures. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe it provides additional useful information to investors due to the various noncash items during the period. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on debt or cash income tax payments; although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and other companies in this industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than the Company does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

The Company’s presentation of this measure should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure, below. We encourage investors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in their entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Specializing in PG&E and SMUD solar programs, the company is helping residential customers take full advantage of the current incentives by offering highly tailored system designs that meet both financial and technical goals under the new Net Energy Metering 3.0 (NEM 3.0) structure.

The Investment Tax Credit has long made residential solar more affordable, but to claim the full 30% credit, systems must be installed and fully operational by December 31, 2025. This deadline is more than a formality; it requires every step, from design and permitting to installation and utility approval, to be completed on time. Given the complexity of working with utility providers and local jurisdictions, North Valley Solar Power, a leader among solar companies Grass Valley, advises customers to commit by November 2025 at the latest to avoid delays that could cost them thousands in lost incentives. Year-end installation schedules compress quickly; early commitments receive priority placement.

Against this backdrop of urgency, the company stands out among solar power companies for its deep expertise in designing systems that are both ITC-compliant and optimized for California’s evolving solar landscape. Under NEM 3.0, simply installing panels isn’t enough. The new rules reduce compensation for excess energy sent back to the grid, making accurate sizing and storage integration essential for maximizing long-term savings.

North Valley Solar Power takes a precision-focused approach, ensuring each system is properly designed to meet the homeowner’s unique energy needs while aligning with NEM 3.0 requirements. The company avoids the common mistakes seen in the industry, such as under-sizing or improper battery pairing, that can diminish system performance and reduce return on investment. By integrating batteries strategically, they help customers use more of the energy they generate, avoiding high utility rates and increasing energy independence. Engineering for right-sizing under NEM 3.0 delivers measurable NEM 3.0 solar savings by prioritizing self-use and intelligent battery dispatch.

Navigating utility interconnection is often the most time-consuming phase of a solar project. North Valley Solar Power’s direct coordination with PG&E and SMUD helps expedite the process, ensuring all paperwork, inspections, and approvals are handled efficiently and accurately. This local utility knowledge gives the solar providers a clear advantage in meeting the tight timelines required for ITC qualification. This utility-first workflow helps fast-track PG&E solar installation in Grass Valley and keeps SMUD interconnections on schedule.

With more than 2,500 residential projects delivered statewide, North Valley Solar Power fields a CSLB-licensed (California Contractors State License Board) team and keeps design, permitting, installation, and maintenance entirely in-house for quality control and clear accountability. As a locally staffed organization, NVSP supports sustainability events and clean-energy education with schools throughout Nevada County.

With time running out and the 30% tax credit nearing expiration, homeowners are encouraged to start the process now to avoid missing out. North Valley Solar Power continues to support Grass Valley and surrounding communities with trusted expertise and a deep understanding of what it takes to go solar successfully in California.

But what should be a moment of celebration is instead being overshadowed by rising uncertainty: the climate-finance gap still amounts to trillions of dollars, while support among the developed countries for climate action is fracturing.

The transition to a low-carbon global economy cannot succeed without the active participation of the private sector, yet businesses and investors are reluctant to commit funds amid uncertainty and instability. Above all, markets need predictability: coherent policy frameworks, clearly defined priority sectors, and practical strategies for managing the financial, environmental, and social risks.

The predictability and stability that investors and markets require, however, remain out of reach. The International Energy Agency has warned that policy uncertainty has stalled the development and usage of many promising clean-energy technologies that are ripe for scaling up. Excluding AI, venture-capital funding for energy innovation declined across sectors in 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, most countries still lack the policy and investment mechanisms needed to mobilize private capital at scale.

While tighter financial conditions and policy uncertainty play a major role, they are only part of the problem. A deeper, often overlooked reason for the slow pace of progress is that the global climate movement has largely failed to focus on the people most affected by the energy transition: workers, consumers, and local communities.

From its very inception, the Council for Inclusive Capitalism (which I lead) has argued that major economic transitions provide companies and investors with a unique opportunity to build a more inclusive society. Inspired by the late Pope Francis’s call to “hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor,” we established a partnership with energy-intensive companies and investors to develop a framework for a just climate transition.

Created in collaboration with BP, Reliance, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, State Street, and others, this framework places people at the heart of the energy transition. It emphasizes universal access to clean energy, decent jobs that provide pathways for retraining and reskilling, support for local communities, and the need to strengthen supply chains. It also recognizes that investors’ capital-allocation strategies must align with these priorities through meaningful stakeholder engagement and sharing of best practices.

Together with the energy transition, the AI revolution is set to reshape labor markets. To this end, we co-hosted a meeting with World Bank President Ajay Banga at the recent UN Climate Week in New York to discuss how to learn from the mistakes of past transitions and ensure that no one is left behind.

Turning ambition into action requires achievable national strategies. When implemented effectively, nationally determined contributions can serve as more than just climate pledges – they can guide investment and act as roadmaps for economic transformation. Brazil provides a useful model: a joint report by the OECD and the UN Development Programme touts the country’s National Bank for Economic and Social Development as a leader in creating innovative financial instruments capable of attracting private capital at scale.

Other emerging markets are also making strides. Wind and solar power are expanding rapidly across Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, with India on track to become the world’s second-largest renewable-energy market after China. For developing countries, inclusive growth is not a slogan but a socioeconomic imperative, particularly when it comes to ensuring access to energy and critical infrastructure.

Developed economies face a different set of challenges. In the United States, about 40% of energy and technology projects announced under former US President Joe Biden’s industrial and climate policies were already experiencing delays even before President Donald Trump’s return to the White House. At the same time, rising energy costs are jeopardizing the United Kingdom’s net-zero transition, while European manufacturers struggle to cut CO2 emissions and stay profitable in a global market increasingly dominated by Chinese firms.

Even so, there are reasons for cautious optimism. Although Trump withdrew the US from the Paris agreement, energy affordability and AI competitiveness remain top national priorities. Institutional investors and private capital have both the means and the incentive to back emerging technologies – including carbon-free, scalable nuclear energy – that can sustain AI growth without driving up utility costs.

The dozens of world leaders in Brazil for COP30 are meeting at a critical juncture. To build a just and sustainable future, we must bridge the divide between governments, financial institutions, civil society, and the private sector. Only by focusing on workers, communities, and consumers can we translate national targets into tangible progress that protects both people and the planet.",https://webapi.project-syndicate.org/library/985746892da40ba06638ff0c739308f2.2-1-super.1.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 13:02:58.003880

Long before it grows its classic black and orange wings, the Monarch butterfly begins its life among the hooded flowers of milkweed. As caterpillars, they can’t eat anything else. Alongside millions of human beings, these butterflies also call North Carolina home, feeding on the 16 species of milkweed that are native to the state, according to the North Carolina Wildlife Federation.

Native species are those that have formed interdependent, complex relationships with the flora and fauna of an area after co-evolving with these species for thousands of years, according to North Carolina State Extension.

But sometimes, they face competition from non-native or invasive plants, which are popular for their landscaping appeal.

As developments continue, it’s more important than ever that the plants we do have nourish the environment, says Amy Mackintosh, co-chair of the Margaret Reid chapter of the North Carolina Native Plant Society.

“We’re having so much impact between agriculture and residential and whatever else use, land use, that we can’t say, ‘Oh, well, [nature] will move to the next place in the country’,” she says. “There is no next place in the country. It’s us.”

The N.C. Native Plant Society and other organizations are encouraging the use of native plants in landscaping by focusing on one side of the business equation: demand. They’re educating the public on how native plants can be incorporated into landscape aesthetics, in the hopes that this will encourage people to buy them.

Here’s one thing that helps: across the state, there’s already a growing interest in native plants, they say.

Demand: Why are people interested in native plants?

In a 2021 survey sponsored by the Coastal Landscapes Initiative, most of the 20 commercial plant growers that were surveyed reported seeing the demand for native plants grow over the past five years, says Jane Harrison, coastal economics specialist for North Carolina Sea Grant, which manages the Coastal Landscapes Initiative. Native plants like Southern wax myrtle, native hollies, and milkweed were especially popular.

The N.C. Native Plant Society has also seen interest in their organization grow beyond membership. While it has around 900 official members, about 2,300 opted in to receive its newsletters, says Margaret Partridge, the other co-chair for the Margaret Reid chapter of the N.C. Native Plant Society.

Concern about native plants has even risen to the state level. In July 2019, the North Carolina General Assembly passed Senate Bill 606, which requires the Department of Transportation to prioritize planting native plants along roadways.

But where is all this interest coming from? Recent research linking native plants to preserving biodiversity formed a lot of the impetus behind this, Mackintosh says.

Thousands of years of co-evolution means that entire ecosystems depend on native plants. For example, many native wildflowers provide nectar for pollinating insects and seeds for animals, says Christopher Moorman, associate head of the Department of Forestry and Environmental Resources at North Carolina State University.

Not only do native plants serve as foundations of the food web, but they also affect soil composition, plant community structures, and disturbance processes, such as fires, he says.

Non-native plants, even if they spread beyond their native range, can never fully replicate the complex interactions that naturally occur, according to N.C. State Extension.

For example, privets, non-native plants from the Ligustrum genus, are integrated into the North Carolina food web because birds eat them, Moorman says.

But if privets outcompete native plants that support invertebrates, such as milkweeds, then the baby birds that need protein from the invertebrates will not survive. So while privets certainly contribute to the food base for native birds, their growth may have other consequences to native bird species as a whole, he says.

When non-native plants outcompete various native plants in a certain area, it can reduce the diversity of plants in an area, as well. This homogenization of food resources is why it’s harder to find native bird species in urban or suburban areas, for example, Moorman says.

“They’re just not able to persist in these landscapes,” he says.

Many non-native plants are popular because they are resilient and grow well in most conditions. But these same characteristics can also crowd out native plants, which arguably makes them invasive.

For Moorman, nonnative plants that establish and reproduce on their own are invasive, primarily because they take up space that native plants could use.

“That also accounts for the fact that in many cases, it takes decades or centuries for a plant species population to become well enough established so that it’s recognizably outcompeting native plants,” he says. “And so if we see it reproducing and surviving on its own now, I think it’s a good indication that in decades in the future, that it would be more widely spread.”

Take Ficaria verna, also known as fig buttercup, for example. The plant was introduced to the United States from Europe, according to N.C. State Extension. In late April and May, the plant grows dormant, forming bulbs under the ground and tiny bulbs on its stems, says Peter Schubert, the citizen representative on the Board of Directors for the North Carolina Invasive Plants Council.

When the stem withers away, its tiny bulbs can spread far, especially through floodwater. Each becomes a new source. And where they settle, they can grow to outcompete native plants, thus harming the ecology of an area, Schubert says.

The N.C. Invasive Plants Council, a volunteer organization that spreads awareness about the dangers of invasive plants, has published a list of invasive plants in the state. It gets input from a variety of experts, including scientists, governmental and conservation organizations, and the landscape and nursery industries.

But there’s no consensus on what makes a plant invasive, Moorman says. Many in the scientific community would not define non-native plants as invasive until they’ve observed their harmful effects on an ecosystem – however long that may take.

“And I’ll also say there’s a component of the ecological community that says, ‘Quit whining, stop worrying about it,’” he says. “‘These plants are here. It’s part of the cycle now with humans, and so we just need to accept it and sort of adapt to it.’ There’s some truth in that.”

Non-native plants have become very integrated into multiple cycles that affect humans. One of the most important ones is the economic cycles, where they form a solid base of the landscaping plant supply.

Supply: Why aren’t there more native plants in the plant nursery supply?

Yousif Nazo, business manager for Nazo Landscaping in Durham, says he has noticed that while there’s a substantial subset of consumers who ask for native plants, most people still prefer to plant non-natives.

Nazo Landscaping is both a full-service nursery and landscaping company, which means it grows the plants it installs for its customers. It sells some native plants, especially ones that are in high demand and don’t grow so wild that they require more work on the company’s part.

However, the lion’s share of their sales comes from non-native plants.

“To be honest, we’re a business at the end of the day, so we try to grow what works really well here but also what’s in high demand,” Nazo says. “You know, I have to maximize all my space, being that we’re right here in Durham, I mean, we’re using almost every foot of space we have.”

Most people asking for native plants are homeowners, who spend around a couple hundred dollars when they shop, he says. But contractors, landscapers, and developers, who primarily buy non-native plants, put in orders worth thousands of dollars.

“It’s a big difference, you know. So the people who are buying the most are the people I have to cater to in order to stay in business,” he says.

Nazo is not the only one. While a mix of small and medium nurseries from the 2021 Coastal Landscapes Initiative survey focused exclusively on native plants, the largest ones did not, Harrison says. This is a trend Mackintosh sees too; while there are smaller nurseries which cater to native plants, they’re still not selling at a scale that would attract landscape contractors, she says.

Various organizations, from nonprofits to the state, are having to balance economic and environmental benefits in landscaping.

“We really have to build a demand so that the horticulture industry can shift to native plants and still be viable economically,” Moorman says. “And we certainly want them to be viable economically.”

Design: Are new aesthetics the solution?

Some of these organizations insist there’s a way to achieve both: emphasizing the aesthetic appeal of native plants.

Both the N.C. Native Plant Society and N.C. Sea Grant works to educate the public on intentional design, particularly when it comes to designing with native plants. There are many ways native plants can be incorporated into a garden or yard to create a neat and organized look, Harrison says. Or, they could be placed in such a way to have a freer, natural look.

“I often think of a garden, a really, you know, kind of attractive, organized garden should be like a living room, you know, just like in someone’s home,” she says. “Do you put a chair in the middle of the room, kind of randomly, or do you put it in a corner, you know, kind of situated so that it can talk to or see the couch across the way?”

There’s even an aesthetic appeal inherent to native plants that attracts North Carolina residents – especially new ones, Harrison says.

“I think people have an interest in what is uniquely North Carolina, you know, what kind of makes this place special,” she says.

It’s not just individual homeowners or gardeners who see the aesthetic appeal of native plants. When the landscape around the Old Well, one of the most famous sites on the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill campus, needed refreshing, native plants proved to be the right ones for the job.

“You know, we’re the University of North Carolina,” says Daniel Widis, UNC University Facilities Landscape Architect. “Pulling in plants from across the state that are representative of the region, representative of this place, right, felt appropriate for that moment, right?”

Almost fifty different types of plants were added around the Old Well during the fall 2024 semester. Previously, the Old Well featured tall hedges, as well as the colorful azaleas that brightened graduation photos during the first two weeks of May, Widis says. Now, the hedges and large trees around the area have been removed. The native plants surrounding the well will bloom at various times throughout the year.

But this landscape will evolve and change over time. Each year, University Facilities will make small tweaks to it. Non-native plants may still be planted in the space in the future, and the design would still be successful, Widis says.

“I don’t think you need to be a strict nativist when it comes to planting, though it obviously comes with a number of ecological and environmental benefits,” Widis says. “In this moment, it just felt like the right thing to do.”

Rather than choosing between yard aesthetics and environmental benefits, organizations across the state seek to increase the demand for native plants by educating the public on how they can achieve both.

And one of the biggest reasons why is that there’s beauty that inherently comes from seeing the diversity of life that flourishes around native plants, Mackintosh says.

Many native plants undergo seasonal shifts throughout the year. From deciduous trees in January to the first hints of trout lily blooming in February, these plants also attract various creatures like butterflies, squirrels, and birds, she says. That’s the beauty of planting native plants.

“I don’t feel like I’m doing it just for the good of the world,” she says. “I mean, I think we get great pleasure out of it, but the greatest pleasure is seeing the life that comes around.”",https://thelocalreporter.press/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cropped-local-reporter-logo-round-3-option-1-3-e1566310206658-1-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-12 14:04:13.991888

The Steamboat Hills plant employs state-of-the-art air-cooled binary technology, with the geothermal fluid circulated through a closed, sealed loop system.","Earlier this month, we stood together at the Steamboat Hills Geothermal Complex in Washoe County, a facility operated by Ormat Technologies Inc. We both subscribe to two fundamental principles that cross party lines: Nevada requires clean, secure power, and Nevada requires strong, secure jobs. What we saw at Steamboat Hills, a plant based on more than 30 years of successful history, is a great model of how geothermal power provides on both.

Our visit highlighted the future of American energy. While solar is an essential piece of Nevada’s clean energy puzzle, the most critical element of this facility is reliability. Geothermal provides always-on baseload power around the clock. This perpetual natural resource is a pillar of grid stability, offering energy independence and a truly resilient system capable of supporting our growing economy.

The economic and community dividends are just as persuasive, demonstrating how clean energy technology can be a cornerstone of regional wealth. In Nevada alone, Ormat owns multiple geothermal power plants with over 483 MW (megawatts) of capacity. They employ nearly 400 highly skilled professionals right here in the state — high-tech, full-time jobs that support Nevada families throughout the region. In addition, these activities have a strong foundation in our society, producing more than $30 million per year in taxes, royalties and other important economic payments, directly contributing to our state budget and local communities.

This accomplishment is the product of good environmental practice, demonstrating the company's ""full commitment"" to the future in a responsible manner. The Steamboat Hills plant employs state-of-the-art air-cooled binary technology, with the geothermal fluid circulated through a closed, sealed loop system. This method of utilizing the earth's heat economically, while taking good care to safeguard our precious groundwater resources and reduce surface disturbance. This dedication to ""constant renewal"" and sound environmental stewardship is evidence that economic vitality, technological advancement and environmental stewardship can, and must, coexist.

The Steamboat Hills Complex is a crystal-clear bipartisan victory. It's a homegrown, financially robust energy answer that anchors our grid and sets us on the way toward a cleaner future. By growing our own natural, renewable resources, Nevada is building a strong, long-term energy economy for generations to come.

Globally, the energy sector produces the most emissions of any sector, accounting for over 75 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.
However, the predominance of investor-owned electric utilities (IOUs) complicates, disincentivizes, and impedes clean energy investment and development for reasons explained in the Introduction.
Creative solutions outside of IOUs are needed to facilitate a clean, equitable, and just energy transition in the utility space.
This brief will explore alternative models outside of the IOU structure — electric cooperatives, publicly owned utilities, and community choice aggregators — and outline the benefits and drawbacks of each of these in achieving an equitable, clean energy transition.","The energy sector needs creative solutions for addressing the worsening and unevenly distributed impacts of climate change. There is growing scientific consensus that we have already surpassed 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, the limit that would have prevented even more dire and irreversible climate consequences like permanent ice sheet melting, loss of entire ecosystems, and intensifying ocean warming. Instead, we are on a trajectory for 2.5 degrees Celsius warming by the end of 2100.

Ever-increasing global temperatures are directly related to more catastrophic events like intensifying droughts, floods, and extreme heat. These climate effects also have disparate impacts on racialized and historically oppressed communities, including communities of color, immigrant groups, the working class, LGBTQ+ communities, and those with limited English proficiency. This is true across educational attainment and age categories.

Longstanding structural forces including white supremacy, settler-colonialism, patriarchy, capitalism, and imperialism have produced deep systemic inequalities and power disparities across economic, social, and political outcomes, and these power differentials perpetuate uneven impacts of climate change. A mix of racist policies and practices stemming from these structural forces, including gerrymandering, mortgage and lending discrimination, and historic disinvestment, has created segregated, under-resourced communities that are especially frontline to environmental and climate catastrophes.

These compounding and intersectional factors have led to a lack of energy-efficient and healthy housing and have led to high energy burden (high amount for energy bills relative to income) for these same communities. Households with higher energy burdens are disproportionately headed by low-wealth people, Black, Latino, and Native American people, older adults, renters, and multigenerational families. In other words, people who have contributed the least to climate change are experiencing its worst effects, including those related to energy pollution and energy burden.

Burning fossil fuels like methane gas, coal, and oil is the leading contributor to the rapid and unprecedented warming over the last 10,000 years. These fuels release carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere, which traps heat and warms the planet. Burning these fuels also releases other greenhouse gases and nitrous oxides, which are linked to adverse health outcomes like respiratory illnesses (including asthma), cancer, and heart disease.

These adverse health outcomes are disproportionately high across racialized groups. Due to systemic racism in lending and zoning laws, people of color, especially those who are low wealth, are more likely than other groups to live near oil refineries, gas plants, and other dirty energy infrastructure. Higher and disproportionate exposure to these facilities’ toxic emissions corresponds to higher rates of respiratory problems.

Overall, the electric power sector is second only to the transportation sector in terms of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States, 74 percent of all human-produced greenhouse gas emissions come from burning fossil fuels for electricity. Globally, the energy sector produces the most emissions of any sector, accounting for over 75 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. While the U.S. has seen a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions from the electricity sector due to investment in renewable energy resources like solar, wind, and geothermal technologies since the 1990s, energy-related carbon emissions increased by 7 percent in 2021, in part due to increased electricity demand as more of the economy electrifies.

Bold action is needed to mitigate the catastrophic and disproportionate climate and health harms from burning fossil fuels for electricity. Decarbonization is one of these bold and essential actions.

Decarbonization — the process of reducing or removing fossil fuels from production by switching to renewable energy resources in energy and economic systems — is necessary to slow or halt the adverse consequences of climate change and carbon dioxide emissions. Some scholars have coined the phrase “deep decarbonization” to describe more specific, impactful interventions, including energy efficiency measures (upgrading residential and commercial heating and cooling systems and insulating homes), removing carbon from the electricity sector (ending the use of coal and natural gas and switching to wind and solar energy on the electric grid), transferring clean energy to building and transportation sectors (solar-powered electric buses), and utilizing natural carbon sinks (replanting forests). Decarbonization must be conducted through the lens of equity and justice to fully and adequately address historic and present harms associated with fossil fuel-based pollution.

The electricity sector needs to deeply decarbonize, and to do so rapidly. However, the predominance of investor-owned electric utilities (IOUs) complicates, disincentivizes, and impedes clean energy investment and development for reasons explained in the Introduction.

Utility decarbonization targets can stem from legislative action like state climate laws, mandates from regulators at public utility commissions, emerging clean energy technology that is lower-cost and lower risk, market demand from customers or other stakeholders, or corporate environmental, social, and governance goals. Collectively, the electricity sector must reduce emissions by 80 percent by 2035 to limit its impact on climate warming, but within the current decarbonization efforts of IOUs, aggregate progress has been lackluster and is only slated to meet 50 percent carbon reduction.

In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) — the single largest piece of climate legislation in U.S. history — was signed into law to facilitate, among other things, widespread decarbonization. The IRA was intended to boost a clean energy transition for individuals, municipalities, nonprofits, and industrial stakeholders like electric utilities through subsidies, loans, and adders (a specific type of financial bonus) for energy communities (or, those communities historically overburdened by fossil fuel based pollution). Many core elements of the IRA — including Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants, the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Fund, Home Energy Performance-Based Grants, Whole House Rebates and Training Grants, and the High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Program — are investments in low-income and disadvantaged communities to promote “legacy pollution reduction, affordable and accessible clean energy for disadvantaged communities, and a better quality of life and good jobs.”

The most prominent provisions of the IRA for utility-scale decarbonization are the Investment Tax Credit and Production Tax Credit, with additional credits for low-income communities. Unfortunately, these tax credits for utility-scale solar and wind projects, along with other credits, rebates, and subsidies, are now sunsetting earlier because of tax code changes in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (H.R. 1) passed on July 4, 2025. With the effective repeal of the IRA, three impacts relevant to this brief are likely:

“Reduction in cumulative capital investment in U.S. electricity and clean fuels production by $0.5 trillion from 2025-2035.

Increase of greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 190 million metric tons per year in 2030 and 470 million tons in 2035 — or about 2 percent of 2005 emissions in 2030 and 7 percent in 2035.

Decrease in clean electricity generation in 2035 by more than 820 terawatt-hours — more than the entire contribution of nuclear or coal to the electricity supply today.”

Within the IOU space, the scale and pacing of decarbonizing was already lagging; the effective repeal of the IRA means even fewer industry incentives to decarbonize and more carbon pollution. Creative solutions outside of IOUs are needed to facilitate a clean, equitable, and just energy transition in the utility space.

If IOUs aren’t up to the monumental task of deep decarbonization in the name of an urgent climate crisis, what are the viable alternatives for electricity? This brief will explore alternative models outside of the IOU structure — electric cooperatives, publicly owned utilities, and community choice aggregators — and outline the benefits and drawbacks of each of these in achieving an equitable, clean energy transition. We will also address legal mechanisms and barriers for adopting these alternatives.",https://cpr-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/uploads/2025/11/Advancing-a-Clean-Equitable-Energy-Transition-through-Alternatives-to-Investor-Owned-Utilities.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 10:01:14.263632

Coinbase, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, has made a strategic decision to relocate its corporate domicile from Delaware to Texas. This move follows the approval of the majority of its stockholders through written consent and does not impact the company's current operations, office locations, or the trading of its shares. The decision is influenced by the favorable business environment in Texas, which is known for lower taxes, a pro-business climate, and a thriving technology ecosystem.

The rationale behind this shift stems from Texas's corporate laws that promote innovation and provide a more predictable legal environment. These laws come with lower litigation risks and enhanced protections for both boards and shareholders. As companies across various sectors reconsider their incorporation locations, Texas has emerged as a prime alternative due to these benefits.

#What Does This Move Mean for the Future of Coinbase?

This transition to Texas reflects broader trends among corporations exploring options beyond Delaware, especially following recent controversies regarding executive compensations that have raised eyebrows within the legal frameworks of some states. By opting for Texas, Coinbase seeks to leverage a more favorable regulatory atmosphere conducive to business growth.

This decision highlights the increasing interest of companies in finding more advantageous legal settings for incorporation. Texas's appeal as a destination for businesses looking to optimize their legal structures is becoming increasingly evident, positioning it as a formidable competitor to traditional hubs like Delaware in the corporate landscape.",https://d39vprqkrd8fxp.cloudfront.net/4eabbc94-a8c4-4f44-a6c6-68d573454ba5/icons/android-icon-192x192.png,N,,2025-11-12 11:04:16.108148

Our goal was to identify ways to change that.” “Participatory science is about science and people,” said David Bonter, co-director of the Center for Science and Engagement at Cornell.
Participating in science from home For many, observing nature from home offers an easy entry into science.
Democratizing discovery Community science invites anyone with curiosity and time to help advance research.
Dayer’s team is expanding who gets to take part in discovery while showing how welcoming science strengthens communities.","When Ashley Dayer, professor in the Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation, talks about her work, she starts with a simple idea: Everyone deserves a chance to take part in science.

That belief inspired a new study from Dayer’s lab in Virginia Tech's College of Natural Resources and Environment that explores how to make one of North America’s largest bird observation programs – Project FeederWatch – welcoming to everyone who enjoys feeding and watching birds.

Run by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and Birds Canada, FeederWatch invites participants across the U.S. and Canada to report bird activity in their backyards. The project connects people to nature while contributing to decades of data about bird populations.

Despite its reach, FeederWatch, like many community science programs, tends to engage a narrow audience. Dayer and postdoctoral researcher Kelley Langhans, the study’s lead author, partnered with colleagues from Cornell University, North Carolina State University, and The Ohio State University to understand how the project could better reflect the broader community of people who feed birds.

“Community science has been a great success for research,” Dayer said. “We know more about birds and ecosystems because of public contributions. But not everyone feels these projects are designed for them, which limits their benefits and creates data gaps. Our goal was to identify ways to change that.”

“Participatory science is about science and people,” said David Bonter, co-director of the Center for Science and Engagement at Cornell. “This study provides vital information for helping us understand how to engage more people in observation, learning, and sharing information about the natural world.”

The study, published Nov. 11 in Citizen Science: Theory and Practice, recommends that FeederWatch collaborate with community organizations, develop educational resources to support participant learning, and clearly show participants how their data support conservation.

Participating in science from home

For many, observing nature from home offers an easy entry into science. Feeding birds and recording observations can provide meaningful connection to nature and contribute to data used by conservation scientists worldwide.

Langhans and Virginia Tech graduate students, including co-author Chris Blume, hosted online focus groups with people who already feed birds but don’t participate in FeederWatch. With help from organizations that promote welcoming outdoor spaces, the team explored opportunities and challenges to making the project more inclusive.

Participants appreciated FeederWatch’s flexibility and the ability to take part from home. The program’s structure — allowing people to collect data on their own time — helps those with busy schedules or limited mobility connect with nature and contribute to science.

Many also spoke about the joy that participation brings. Counting birds offers a chance to notice nature, engage curiosity, and make a meaningful contribution to environmental research.

Supporting participation

Some participants saw the annual fee as a barrier, while others mentioned the need for adaptive technology or materials in additional languages. In response, the research team focused on how the project itself could adapt.

“When we think about growing participation, it’s about designing the project to be welcoming to everyone,” Langhans said. “Adjustments such as waiving fees, creating user-friendly digital tools, and increasing representation in staff and materials can open the door to a wider range of participants.”

By focusing on project design, Dayer said, community science programs can reach more people and produce stronger, more representative data.

“When more people take part, the science gets better,” Dayer said.

Democratizing discovery

Community science invites anyone with curiosity and time to help advance research. Projects like FeederWatch have transformed ecology by generating millions of observations that help scientists monitor species and environmental change.

When done well, these programs also benefit participants — growing skills, addressing local needs, and creating a sense of belonging and purpose. Dayer sees this as a return to community science’s original promise: to democratize discovery.

“Science should be open to everyone,” she said. “Community science was designed to give people the tools to observe the world around them and know they’re contributing to something larger.”

From data to healing

For Dayer, the impact of this work goes beyond research. After her mother underwent a heart transplant, one of the first things Dayer did was help her mother return to watching the bird feeders at her home.

“Watching the birds brought her peace,” Dayer said. “It was something she could do every day — to sit outside, notice what was around her, and feel connected again. That’s the heart of community science. It’s more than data. It’s about what those experiences mean for people.”

This spirit reflects the college's mission to connect people and the natural world through learning and stewardship.

A more welcoming future

Through their partnership with the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Dayer and Langhans are sharing their findings with community science programs nationwide. The team hopes the recommendations will guide future adaptations that make science more welcoming, flexible, and relevant to people’s lives.

Dayer’s team is expanding who gets to take part in discovery while showing how welcoming science strengthens communities.

“When everyone has the chance to participate,” Langhans said, “science truly becomes a shared endeavor. That’s how we all learn more about our world.”",https://news.vt.edu/content/dam/news_vt_edu/articles/2025/11/dowwoo1.jpeg.transform/l-medium/image.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 11:04:25.323267

Trump urging swift finalization of key federal biofuel policies needed to strengthen domestic demand for U.S. soy and support farmers facing continued market pressure.

The organizations called for completion of several priority actions, including finalizing EPA’s proposed 2026 to 2027 Renewable Fuel Standard volumes, limiting RIN credit generation from foreign feedstocks and imported biofuels, discouraging imports of used cooking oil and beef tallow that displace domestic soybean oil, ensuring full reallocation of waived RVO volumes tied to small refinery exemptions, and issuing timely Treasury guidance for the revised 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit to reflect congressional changes that prioritize domestic agricultural feedstocks.

ASA has applauded the Trump Administration for its advocacy to secure American energy dominance and U.S. soybean farmers are eager to support domestically produced biofuels made with U.S. soy. Finalizing the 2026 and 2027 Renewable Fuel Standard volume obligations and updating 45Z tax guidance to reflect support for domestically-sourced feedstocks is urgently needed to expand domestic market opportunities for U.S. soybean farmers.

ASA CEO Stephen Censky said the administration’s decisions in the coming weeks will directly influence farmer profitability and future processing investments.

“Farmers need clear and consistent federal policy to expand domestic biofuel production and strengthen the market for American grown soy,” Censky said. “The administration has taken important steps to support U.S. biofuels, and it is essential that these policies are finalized before the end of the year.”

Roughly half of all U.S.-processed soybean oil is used in biomass-based diesel, making biofuels one of the most significant domestic markets for soybeans.

Environmental organizations that oppose the DEP’s intention to grant the permit have asked the department to hold a public hearing on the issue.

The DEP has not made a final decision on whether to hold a public hearing on the permit but will decide based on the substance of comments received during the comment period that ended last week, Aquiline said.

In a 25-page joint letter Nov. 3 to the DEP, the Environmental Integrity Project in Washington, D.C., and the Mountain Watershed Association, an environmental group in Melcroft, contended the DEP should hold a public hearing because of sufficient interest in the plant and its emissions as a large pollution source.

The draft permit “contains many substantive deficiencies that must be fixed before the permit is issued,” including failing to require adequate monitoring to assure compliance with pollution limits for several pollutants from multiple sources at the plant, the environmental groups stated. Those pollutants include volatile organic compounds, sulfuric acid mist and sulfur oxide from plant sources.

The agency’s new proposal under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) seeks to make reporting requirements more practical, eliminate duplicative submissions, and focus on collecting the most critical data about PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) – commonly known as ‘forever chemicals.’

With this approach, EPA hopes to ease compliance for manufacturers and importers while continuing to track the environmental and health impacts of these persistent chemicals.

Understanding PFAS and their risks

PFAS are a large family of artificial chemicals widely used for their water- and grease-resistant properties in products such as cookware, textiles, and firefighting foam.

Dubbed forever chemicals, PFAS persist in the environment and accumulate in the human body over time.

Studies have linked exposure to certain PFAS to adverse health effects, including liver damage, thyroid disease, developmental issues, and increased cancer risk.

Environmental contamination is also a concern, as PFAS can migrate from products into soil and water, creating long-term ecological impacts.

The 2023 PFAS reporting rule

In October 2023, the Biden Administration finalised a one-time PFAS reporting and recordkeeping rule under TSCA Section 8(a)(7).

This regulation required manufacturers, including importers, who produced PFAS between 2011 and 2022 to submit detailed data on exposure, environmental effects, and health impacts.

The rule, however, has faced criticism for imposing a nearly billion-dollar compliance cost on industry without providing clear guidance on how collected data would be used to protect the environment.

Significant IT system failures and administrative delays highlighted shortcomings in practical implementation, especially for small businesses and importers. Critics argue that the regulation burdens industry while delivering limited environmental benefit.

Proposed changes to streamline PFAS reporting

EPA’s new proposal seeks to reduce regulatory burdens while maintaining essential data collection.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin emphasises that the changes align with the ‘Powering the Great American Comeback’ initiative, aiming to provide regulatory certainty, lower compliance costs, and focus on the most relevant PFAS information.

Key proposed exemptions include:

PFAS present at 0.1% or lower in mixtures or products

Imported articles

Certain byproducts and impurities

Research and development chemicals

Non-isolated intermediates

Additionally, the agency plans technical corrections to clarify required data fields and adjust submission timelines, ensuring a smoother reporting process.

Zeldin commented: “This Biden-era rule would have imposed crushing regulatory burdens and nearly $1bn in implementation costs on American businesses.

“This proposal is grounded in common sense and the law, allowing us to collect the information we need to help combat PFAS contamination without placing ridiculous requirements on manufacturers, especially the small businesses that drive our country’s economy.”

Balancing safety and efficiency

The EPA’s proposal reflects a broader effort to implement TSCA Section 8(a)(7) in a way that supports both industry and environmental goals.

By targeting unnecessary reporting while retaining critical safeguards, the agency aims to collect meaningful PFAS data without overwhelming businesses.

As the public comment period opens, stakeholders will have the opportunity to provide input on the proposed PFAS reporting refinements, shaping a more effective and practical regulatory framework.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_2603263941-2.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 10:00:14.016519

""The Trump administration, unfortunately, has been setting bad policy in the United States and trying to undermine policy around the world.""
In the IEA's Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), oil demand would peak ""around 2030"" and decline to 100 million barrels per day by 2035 before falling in subsequent years.
""But this year's report also shows Donald Trump's dystopian future, bringing back the old, fossil-fuel intense, high pollution Current Policies Scenario,"" he said.","Renewable energy is still expanding faster than fossil fuels around the world despite policy changes in the United States, with oil demand possibly peaking ""around 2030"", the International Energy Agency said Wednesday.

The Paris-based IEA presented different scenarios for the future of energy in its annual World Energy Outlook -- the first since coming under fire from the government of US President Donald Trump over its oil forecasts.

""The pace varies, but renewables grow faster than any other major energy source in all scenarios, led by solar photovoltaics,"" the agency, which advises mostly developed nations, said in its 518-page report.

In one scenario, ""policy changes mean that the United States has 30 percent less renewables capacity installed in 2035 than in last year's Outlook, but at the global level renewables continue their rapid expansion"".

The report comes as world leaders meet at the UN's COP30 climate conference in Belem, Brazil, which Trump and his government have shunned.

Trump, who has pulled out of the Paris climate accord, wants to expand oil and gas production and roll back the clean energy policies of his predecessor, Joe Biden.

The IEA had to walk a fine line when drafting its latest outlook as it has faced criticism from the Trump administration for projecting dwindling demand for fossil fuels.

US Energy Secretary Chris Wright threatened in July to pull out of the IEA if it did not reform how it operates.

- 'Politically motivated' -

The IEA used three scenarios for its World Energy Outlook: one takes into account policies that are currently in place, another looks at ""stated"" government policies including measures that have yet to be adopted, and a third considers a world that reaches net zero emissions by 2050.

Under the Current Policies Scenario (CPS), oil and natural gas demand would increase by 16 percent to 2035 and rise further through to 2050.

The IEA had dropped such scenarios from its reports in 2020.

""That (CPS) scenario is entirely politically motivated,"" Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told reporters at COP30 in Belem.

""The Trump administration, unfortunately, has been setting bad policy in the United States and trying to undermine policy around the world.""

In the IEA's Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), oil demand would peak ""around 2030"" and decline to 100 million barrels per day by 2035 before falling in subsequent years.

In a report in June, the IEA had forecast that global oil demand would fall slightly in 2030, which would mark the first drop since the 2020 Covid pandemic.

The World Energy Outlook said demand for electricity is rising, fuelled by data centres and artificial intelligence in advanced economies and China, along with increasing use of air conditioning in developing countries.

In every scenario, China remains the largest market for renewable energy, accounting for 45 to 60 percent of their global deployment over the next 10 years.

Under every scenario, however, the IEA said the world would exceed 1.5C of warming above pre-industrial levels -- the most ambitious goal of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.

""There is less momentum than before behind national and international efforts to reduce emissions, yet climate risks are rising,"" the report said.

Under the CPS, warming would exceed 2C around 2050 and 2.9C in 2100 -- and then keep rising from there.

In STEPS, warming would exceed 2C by around 2060 and 2.5C by 2100.

But in the net-zero scenario, it would peak at about 1.65C around 2050 and decline slowly after that, before dropping back below 1.5C by 2100, according to the IEA.

The IEA has ""confirmed that no single country can stop the energy transition, with oil and coal demand to peak by 2030 in its business-as-usual scenario"", said David Tong, global industry campaign manager at Oil Change International, a non-profit advocacy group.

""But this year's report also shows Donald Trump's dystopian future, bringing back the old, fossil-fuel intense, high pollution Current Policies Scenario,"" he said.

During these years, I’ve also done social service and environmental work. I have come to realize how interconnected the inner work of being a healthy human and the bigger efforts to be a healthy community really are. These are not separate, especially in our society right now. As I read comments on various news sources around our region, I realize that we really do have more in common than separates us – at least when it comes to the Google Data Center.

Each time Project Zodiac announces taking more wetlands, requires more unsustainable energy sourcing with ratepayers footing the bill, and applies for more massive diesel generators as back-up, I notice the breadth and depth of our community questioning if any potential benefit of this hyperscale AI data center in SE Allen County will be worth the resources they will extract. In the weeks since Indiana Michigan Power and Hatchworks, LLC have piled on four overlapping applications for more asks, I have met hundreds of new neighbors who have concerns about this center.

We, the people, understand that ordinary people bearing the cost of more energy production by I&M to fuel this complex is bad enough, but bearing the cost with our health and our lives is far too much.

To get into the nitty-gritty, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) uses a capacity of 25% to calculate its air permit limits. Emergency back-up diesel generators are allowed to run up to 100 hours per year for maintenance and non-emergency use, but could potentially be running much more. IDEM’s draft air permit allows the company to release over 980 tons each year of air pollutants! I want to be clear – there is no safe exposure to these ultra-fine particles emitted into the air (called PM 2.5) for human health. Even if there is compliance with the national and state standards, this does not ensure the air is healthy. Health impacts from exposure range from low birth weight, higher infant mortality rates, and cancer to asthma, COPD, and cardiovascular disease.

In a densely populated area, I believe there is no reason Google cannot reduce the total number of emergency diesel generators by increasing the use of battery storage, using renewable energy sources on site, and adding pollution controls to any generators on this site! As an innovative tech company that at one time aimed “to do no evil,” they could certainly bring innovation and ethics to DO better because we deserve better.

As we witness what is unfolding in other AI data center communities and look at the energy demand for this one, we can already predict that this is far from the last “ask” we will get that impacts our air, soil, water, energy and quality of life. More generators may follow, as these 177 massive generators are not nearly enough to keep this monstrosity going when the center is operating full tilt and the grid is unstable. We need to demand transparency about plans from Google regarding this site and urge our city and state leaders to be our advocates. The Indiana Department of Environmental Management must protect our community by requiring the best available control technology on any diesel generators at this site and deny this permit.

It takes a watchful eye to catch permit applications and be on top of the next vote at Citizens Square, but a large coalition of concerned citizens helps a little effort to make a big impact.

There are so many pressures that weigh on us and threaten to divide us, but one hope I have is seeing that throughout our community, we care about people’s health and life opportunities, not just for the wealthiest companies. We can be the best community when we make time to enjoy the goodness Allen County has to offer AND when we make time to invest in our community’s well-being. One engagement provides short-term sustenance and joy, the other makes way for a long-term impact of human resilience. Whether you are fascinated or repelled by AI technology, participate in the public process to learn more. Whether you feel ill-equipped but concerned or come armed with statistics and solutions, join the voices demanding that Google’s air permit be denied until they present a plan that literally has us breathing a little easier. Each of us is worth having the best chance at wholeness and health. Together we will foster a healthier community, one action at a time. Be of courage and hold fast to that which is good – we are worth this effort to protect Allen County.

,American Energy,2025-11-12 13:00:41+00:00,Energy-Storage.News,"71% of Americans surveyed support energy storage, but 'vocal minority' kill or delay projects",April Bonner,,,,,https://www.energy-storage.news/71-of-americans-surveyed-support-energy-storage-but-vocal-minority-kill-or-delay-projects/,"DeBellis says, “We found through the survey that actually, 71% of Americans support energy storage projects in their local community.
For us, this was a pretty surprising result, just because you see a lot of the attention-grabbing headlines in the news about energy storage.” He continues, “We found that only 29% of the Americans that were polled oppose energy storage, and that’s overwhelmingly the minority there, but that minority is very vocal about their concerns.” This vocal minority of Americans opposed to energy storage can significantly impact project development.
In these instances and others like it, fire was brought up as a major concern of residents located near BESS projects.
However, moderator Mike Ryan, the commercial director at developer Constantine Energy Storage, highlighted that public perception frequently contradicts this view.
This standard, titled NFPA 855: Standard for the Installation of Stationary Energy Storage Systems (ESS), is updated every three years and sets minimum requirements for installing energy storage systems across residential, commercial, industrial (C&I), and utility scales.","Cummings added, “It’s crucial the industry takes a proactive stance in both communication and standard setting. That means engaging early with local stakeholders, explaining the safety measures in place and pushing for modern codes and standards that reflect today’s technologies. We have to go beyond the minimum compliance thresholds.”

In April, Brian Cashion, Director of Engineering at Firetrace, wrote a guest blog for Energy-Storage.news, discussing how community opposition has the greatest potential to hinder the BESS sector’s growth.

“At a broader level, local communities are often unaware of the significant benefits that BESS sites can create, including lower electricity bills, cleaner air and more reliable power. Many local citizens, understandably, don’t want large infrastructure projects near their homes, fearing they could impact property prices and the aesthetics of the local area,” Cashion wrote.

Firetrace’s global head of clean energy, Joe DeBellis, expands on these ideas through the lens of the company’s new report and survey.

Firetrace International manufactures fire detection and suppression systems for various sectors, but with a particular focus on the renewables industry.

‘Unlocking Support for BESS’

The report, ‘Unlocking Support for BESS: How to boost public support for battery energy storage systems’, details the results of a survey of 4,000 people across the entire US, gauging awareness and attitudes toward BESS projects.

DeBellis says, “We found through the survey that actually, 71% of Americans support energy storage projects in their local community. For us, this was a pretty surprising result, just because you see a lot of the attention-grabbing headlines in the news about energy storage.”

He continues, “We found that only 29% of the Americans that were polled oppose energy storage, and that’s overwhelmingly the minority there, but that minority is very vocal about their concerns.”

This vocal minority of Americans opposed to energy storage can significantly impact project development.

DeBellis points out, “We’ve actually seen that through that 29% – various projects over the last few years. I believe there were upwards of nine separate projects that were rejected or delayed in the last year alone, solely due to safety concerns. That’s a lot coming from the vocal minority there that has concerns.”

In July, ESN Premium reported that Marion County in Oregon enacted a moratorium on utility-scale battery storage, following zoning law amendments approved by the Board of Directors (BoD) in June.

A similar situation was reported in June, when renewables developer Prospect14’s hybrid storage project application was reviewed and rejected by town authorities in Chino Valley, Arizona.

In these instances and others like it, fire was brought up as a major concern of residents located near BESS projects.

DeBellis notes of this common concern, “From that survey as well, we saw that 47% of the folks said that they’re going to be more comfortable with a battery energy storage site if they had a clear understanding of safety measures as well. That’s something that can be addressed very early on, not just when the public remarks that, ‘Hey, we’re a little bit concerned.’”

Providing BESS education

Effectively communicating the safety measures could go a long way in building trust with the public, because, as DeBellis highlights, about the 29% of Americans opposed to energy storage identified in the survey:

“Of that 29%, really half of that – so 52% of the folks that oppose energy storage – actually haven’t encountered information about battery energy storage at all. So, the way that we interpret that is a lack of information. It’s not necessarily that they’re truly concerned with the technology. It’s just they haven’t been educated enough.”

Kevin Smith, CEO of developer-operator Arevon Energy, also noted the importance of providing education and pushing back against BESS misinformation in a July interview with ESN Premium.

“If you’re not in the community from the beginning, a lot of misinformation starts circulating. People end up creating Facebook pages with all kinds of inaccurate information. That’s why it’s really important that we get in early and make sure residents have the right information.”

Smith continued, “Obviously, people are going to look online and find other perspectives, but we want to ensure they have accurate information from us so they can weigh that against whatever else they encounter.”

This task becomes increasingly difficult when, as seen recently, government officials parrot incorrect information about BESS safety.

In July, Josh F.W. Cook, the Administrator of the US EPA Pacific Southwest Region, addressed BESS fire incidents after the agency reached a settlement with IPP LS Power to oversee cleanup following a lithium-ion battery fire at the Gateway energy storage site.

Cook said, “I am alarmed by the incidents and impacts of utility-grade battery fires on first responders, specifically the professional firefighters who are exposed to horrible, toxic conditions when batteries catch fire. This settlement action is a step in the right direction, but the broader battery storage fire issue requires additional attention and EPA enforcement.”

While fire incidents involving BESS are serious, they are relatively infrequent, and the occurrence of failure incidents is decreasing. There appears to have been one incident to date in which firefighters in the US have been seriously hurt in a BESS fire incident. In 2019, at the 2.16MWh McMicken facility in Surprise, Arizona, members of a fire crew suffered injuries when an external door to an enclosure blew open while they were investigating.

The EPA did issue BESS safety guidance in August, which noted, “Since 2020, BESS failure incidents have decreased, but some recent fires have gained attention in the media.”

In the Firetrace report, DeBellis highlights what could be a crucial piece of info in helping developers gain support for BESS projects.

He says, “Roughly 70% of citizens said that if these energy storage sites created benefits, like cheaper electricity bills, they would be in favour of them.”

DeBellis continues, “68% wanted reliable power, two-thirds of folks highlighted local jobs and economic benefits as important factors to support.”

The company has also provided this information to the public in many instances, to help build community support and education around BESS.

“The responsibility for (Firetrace and the BESS industry) is to educate the community, educate the public, on technologies, different safety measures that can be done. I think that’s very important as technologies continue to evolve.”

DeBellis says, “It’s important to ask, ‘How do we get out ahead of some of these hurdles and navigate rough waters with some of these projects going up?’”

A similar sentiment was shared during the recent Battery Asset Management Summit UK & Ireland, where a panel of BESS owner-operators, investors, and technical services firms concurred that lithium-ion BESS is generally a safe technology in a discussion about safety strategies, technologies and best practice. However, moderator Mike Ryan, the commercial director at developer Constantine Energy Storage, highlighted that public perception frequently contradicts this view.

The BESS industry is constantly working to improve fire safety measures and communicate the safety of BESS.

In September, the US National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) released the latest version of its key safety standard for battery storage, NFPA 855.

This standard, titled NFPA 855: Standard for the Installation of Stationary Energy Storage Systems (ESS), is updated every three years and sets minimum requirements for installing energy storage systems across residential, commercial, industrial (C&I), and utility scales.

The standards are adopted by local authorities having jurisdiction (AHJs), various US states, and are often referenced by stakeholders such as financiers and insurers.

In an article for PV Tech Power (Vol.43), Drew Bandhauer, a BESS engineer at Leeward Renewable Energy, stated that NFPA 855 is “the primary fire standard guiding BESS site design and installation, supported by critical sub-chapters, including NFPA 68, NFPA 69, and NFPA 72.”

In April, the American Clean Power Association (ACP), a group representing clean energy industry interests, published Battery Energy Storage: Blueprint for Safety, a safety framework guide for BESS. This was based on an evaluation by fire protection engineering expert group Fire and Risk Alliance, which examined historical data and research on fire incidents in the US over the past decade.

Both ACP and Fire and Risk Alliance stated that their assessment results did not suggest any risks to public health or neighbouring communities stemming from the studied fire incidents.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-74.png,N,,2025-11-12 11:03:13.132831

Billions Flow to US Nuclear Sector With Payoff Still Years Away Back to video

Article content

Article content

In theory, $80 billion can buy enough reactors to power all of Virginia’s Data Center Alley. In reality, traditional reactors take 10 years or more to build, while a highly anticipated wave of small, modular reactors has yet to produce commercial power. That means the only plants that will go into service anytime soon are a handful of shuttered facilities that can be restarted.

Article content

“There’s a lot going on, and nothing is going on,” said BloombergNEF’s head nuclear analyst Chris Gadomski.

Article content

That dissonance underscores how radically, and rapidly, the US energy system has transformed in recent years. Not long ago, utilities were shutting down costly nuclear plants and replacing them with cheaper natural gas-fired and renewable plants. The AI boom has since supercharged electricity consumption, straining power supplies and driving up prices. But while nuclear is suddenly in demand again, logistics and technology constraints threaten to thwart development even with President Donald Trump’s moves to streamline permitting and commit billions of dollars in funding.

It’s possible the nuclear industry can meet Trump’s goal of starting construction on 10 big nuclear reactors by 2030. But there won’t be a lot of wiggle room, said Wyatt Hartley, head of North American asset management for Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. The company is emerging as a key player in the industry, in part because it’s the majority owner of Westinghouse Electric Co., which is expected to be a key beneficiary of the $80 billion reactor deal announced last month.

Article content

“Nothing in nuclear happens overnight,” said Jeffrey Merrifield, a former commissioner with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Article content

Besides permitting, developers must line up buyers for the power and hire thousands of skilled workers. And some of the most critical components of a plant, such as reactor vessels and steam generators, can take as long as four years to manufacture and deliver.

Article content

Hartley expects some of those orders to be placed “in the very near term” but, realistically, it will take 10 years to get just two plants up and running.

Article content

Until then, some reactor developers are relying on natural gas. Fermi Inc., an energy real estate investment trust co-founded by former Energy Secretary Rick Perry that is developing a massive data center in Texas, placed orders for reactor components last month, but doesn’t expect them to go into service until the early 2030s. Start-ups Blue Energy Global Inc. and First American Nuclear Co. also expect their reactors to be completed next decade. All three companies are installing gas systems to supply data center customers as soon as possible.",https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/financialpost/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/reactor-revival-us-will-spend-more-than-350-billion-on-nu.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 10:01:29.946200

It is unclear whether the furloughs are related to this detention or a separate action—Qcells has not yet responded to PV Tech’s requests for comments on the decision—but the episode highlights the vulnerability in global solar supply chains that have undermined the US’ recent push towards greater domestic manufacturing of solar modules.
This imbalance means that US module manufacturers rely on foreign imports of critical components, such as cells, which are exposed to detention by the CBP.
“Our latest supply chain is sourced completely outside of China and our legacy supply chains contain no material from Xinjiang province based on third party audits and supplier guarantees,” Stoepker said.
“Our commitment to building the entire solar supply chain in the United States remains.","“As Qcells introduced new supply chains to support its growing solar panel manufacturing facilities in Georgia, the company was recently forced to scale back production while our shipments into the US were delayed in the customs clearance process,” explained Qcells spokeswoman Marta Stoepker to local news station WSBTV Atlanta.

Earlier this year, PV Tech reported that CBP had detained cells imported by Qcells from Korea to supply the company’s module manufacturing facility in Georgia. It is unclear whether the furloughs are related to this detention or a separate action—Qcells has not yet responded to PV Tech’s requests for comments on the decision—but the episode highlights the vulnerability in global solar supply chains that have undermined the US’ recent push towards greater domestic manufacturing of solar modules.

While the US has successfully expanded its module production—adding 50GW of new capacity last year alone—adding new cell capacity has proven more difficult, with just 2GW of new capacity added in the first nine months of this year. This imbalance means that US module manufacturers rely on foreign imports of critical components, such as cells, which are exposed to detention by the CBP.

QCells is working on what would be the US’s first c-Si integrated ingot-to-module production facility to minimise supply chain disruptions such as this; however, it is not due to be in operation until early next year.

‘No material from Xinjiang province’

The assumption is that Qcells is thought to not be in compliance with the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), which prevents materials and components made in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), and that are suspected of being made with forced labour, from entering the US.

Fellow manufacturer Maxeon has seen its modules detailed by the CBP under this act, and while CBP has not specified the conditions under which the Qcells cells have been detained, Stoepker emphasised that the company’s products are not linked to the XUAR.

“Our latest supply chain is sourced completely outside of China and our legacy supply chains contain no material from Xinjiang province based on third party audits and supplier guarantees,” Stoepker said. “Our commitment to building the entire solar supply chain in the United States remains.

The report by the International Energy Agency said renewable energy, led by solar power, will grow faster than any other major source in the next few years and that coal and oil demand will likely peak globally by the end of this decade. The report noted that many natural gas projects were approved in 2025, due to changes in U.S. policy, indicating worldwide supply will rise even as questions remain about how it will be used. Meanwhile, global nuclear power capacity is set to increase by at least a third by 2035 after being stagnant for years.

The release of the annual World Energy Outlook coincided with U.N. climate negotiations in Brazil this week where global leaders are calling for ways to curb the planet’s warming.

Regional Dynamics

The IEA says building greater resilience in energy systems is especially important as data centers, heating and cooling, electrification and more drive energy demand. Investment in data centers is expected to reach $580 billion this year, exceeding investment in the oil supply, according to the report.

Growing economies including India and nations in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, will “increasingly shape energy market dynamics in the years,” the IEA said, noting their potential for solar power.

China, meanwhile, has accounted for half the global growth in demand for oil and gas, and more than half for electricity, since 2010.

“In a break from the trend of the past decade, the increase in electricity consumption is no longer limited to emerging and developing economies,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a release. Birol said that electricity use is also rising in advanced economies.

Nations are grappling with meeting demand while preparing for the risks brought on by the planet’s warming. The IEA says the world is falling short on universal energy access and climate change goals. Around 730 million people still live without electricity, according to the IEA, and despite progress, nearly one-quarter of the global population still relies on inefficient cooking methods that hurt their health or the environment. 2024 was also the hottest year on record.

Nations should diversify their energy sources and cooperate to expand supply chains for critical minerals used to make things like batteries for electric vehicles and components for solar and wind power generation, the IEA said. This also includes making quick improvements to the grid, energy storage and broader infrastructure.

“When we look at the history of the energy world in recent decades, there is no other time when energy security tensions have applied to so many fuels and technologies at once,” Birol said. “With energy security front and (center) for many governments, their responses need to consider the synergies and trade-offs that can arise with other policy goals – on affordability, access, competitiveness and climate change.”

Global Reaction

The Nov. 12 edition of the yearly report is the first released since the start of U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term. Trump’s administration has for a second time opted out of the Paris agreement, rolled back dozens of climate regulations, slashed federal support for renewable energies such as wind and solar power and is reversing the “endangerment finding” that sits at the core of U.S. climate policy.

Trump has pledged his support instead to the fossil fuel industry, investing in coal and loosening restrictions on pollution.

But energy analysts said the shift to clean power is happening regardless of climate policy around the world.

“The evidence on the ground is overwhelming. EV sales are taking off in many emerging countries, solar is permeating even through the Middle East,” said Dave Jones, chief analyst at global energy think tank Ember. “Renewables and electrification will dominate the future.”

Maria Pastukhova, energy transition program lead at climate change think tank E3G, said the report makes “the choices for the global energy system and the global economy unambiguous.”

“If countries want to grow their economies and protect their citizens from roller-coaster energy prices, they need to focus relentlessly on energy efficiency and the (decarbonization) of energy demand,” Pastukhova said.

Others, however, were critical. Ben Backwell, CEO of the Global Wind Energy Council, said the outlook does not fully capture the momentum in renewables, and that it should have emphasized the trajectory for renewable energy is accelerating, driven by the decreasing cost of the technologies, strong policy support and the move toward electrification.

“We’re accelerating,” he added. “You can see it all around the world and we can see it in our numbers for last year, but also in our numbers for the first half of this year. It looks very, very exciting, both for wind and for solar, in fact, and for next year, even more so.”

Certainly, both livestock and crop producers would prefer stability rather than the uncertainty of boom-and-bust cycles. Cooperation between both sectors remains paramount.

In difficult times, it is all the more important to stay unified. The good news is that farmers and those who serve them remain committed to the cause. They haven’t given up.

Hydrogen has seen significant growth over the past few years, with California displaying a special proclivity for the renewable energy resource. Some have noted that the shelving of federal funds is merely a punishment for California’s Governor waging a social media war with US President Donald Trump.

The cancellation of federal funds has been a hit to the California hydrogen dream

Hydrogen has long been overlooked by the international energy community as a viable energy resource, however, that reality has started to shift in recent years as many nations now have strategic plans and policies in place to boost hydrogen production and usage, While the majority of the United States has steered clear of hydorgen, California has plans to become the spirituial home for hydrogen in the United States.

Those plans for California to embrace the hydrogen sector have hit a major snag recently, with the federal government rolling back any progress made in the previous administration that aimed to boost the renewable energy sector in the United States. State-run ARCHES green hydrogen hub has been forced to halt development as the Trump administration has canceled over $1.2 billion in DOE support.

California has been waging a theoretical war with the current administration

Many insiders have noted that the real reason behind the cancellation of federal funds for ARCHES is the latest conflict between US President Donald Trump and California’s Governor Gavin Newsom. Newson has been posting satirical posts online that mock the President’s online style, not to mention the redistricting vote that California recently held to offset a similar move by Texas.

The Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems was supposed to establish a home for hydrogen in America

The joint project was supposed to build a flagship hydrogen hub in California, connecting several hydrogen facilities to a state-run project aimed at boosting production and usage of the renewable energy resource. However, the federal government has opted to cancel funding for the project as part of a broader fiscal cut to the budget.

The ARCHES project boasted support from several institutions and organizations that aimed to boost the standing and reputation of the American hydrogen sector, such as:

California Governor Gavin Newsom’s Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz)

the University of California

The State Building and Construction Trades Council

Renewables 100 Policy Institute

ARCHES was set to receive the largest single allocation of the $8 billion Hydrogen Hubs Program, which was set to roll out in the near future. The initial plan for the ARCHES project was to connect hydrogen pipelines and infrastructure to deliver 220,000 direct jobs in the energy sector and hopefully attract business from the state’s largest companies, such as Amazon, Chevron, GE, Toyota, and Plug Power.

The news comes after the French automaker terminated its project with technology firm Valeo focused on rare-earth-free EV motor and is part of efforts to reduce cost.

China accounts for about 70% of global rare earths mining and 85% of refining.

Beijing’s tightening export curbs have forced the industry to race for alternative supply.

Renault has deployed rare-earth-free motors since 2012 and said in late 2023 it was collaborating with Valeo on a higher-power, more compact unit.

One of the sources said: “The E7A engine project is no longer being done with Valeo. It will be done entirely in-house across the entire value chain, except for the stator which could be bought from a Chinese supplier.”

Even if a Chinese company supplies the stator, Renault plans to manufacture the motor at its Cléon plant in France.

STMicroelectronics will provide silicon carbide modules for the inverter.

A representative for Renault’s EV subsidiary Ampere said, “A Chinese partner is a possibility” but a decision is yet to be made.

Valeo did not comment.

The new rare-earth-free motors are slated to power Renault’s next generation of compact EVs from 2028.

The E7A motor is expected to deliver 200 kW, around 25% more than current units used in models such as the Scenic.

It will incorporate an 800-volt system, double that of current Renault EVs, to shorten charging times.

The motors are part of CEO Francois Provost’s strategic plan due to be presented in March.

The company has increasingly turned to partners in recent years to speed up and reduce the cost of EV development, including Chinese suppliers.

Valeo continues to pursue its own magnet-free motor path with Mahle. Its “iBEE” motor, offering up to 350 kW, targets market launch in 2028.",https://www.just-auto.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2025/11/JA-shutterstock_2631491345.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 08:01:26.082173

Dampening a solar boom The use of rooftop panels by Republicans illustrates the growing economic appeal of solar energy, industry data shows.","At least three Republican lawmakers took advantage of a decades-old rooftop solar credit that will end in January due to President Donald Trump’s megalaw, according to a review of property records and satellite imagery by POLITICO’s E&E News.

The lawmakers — with solar arrays on a California villa, a $3 million Utah manse and an off-the-grid Kentucky homestead — all supported ending the perk this summer that sliced thousands of dollars off the cost of installing their panels.

California Rep. Ken Calvert, a long-serving Republican who was thrust into a race next year with a member of his own party when the state redrew his conservative district, defended voting to end the solar credit that he used about 15 years ago to offset the cost of putting two rows of panels on the back roof of his ranch-style house in Southern California.

“It never was supposed to be permanent,” Calvert said of the credits — a line echoed by other Republicans who criticized renewable energy as unreliable and dependent on subsidies. The law that Trump called his “one big beautiful bill” passed Congress with no Democratic votes and the support of all but five Republicans.

E&E News examined the rooftops of 112 members of Congress: every Senate Republican and 59 House GOP lawmakers who are in leadership or facing tough reelection races.

The search found that at least seven Republican lawmakers had rooftop panels. Three of them acknowledged using the federal tax credit to help pay for the arrays. One couldn’t recall. Another had leased a solar system that was indirectly subsidized via a separate tax credit for installers. And two other lawmakers didn’t respond to questions about their panels, which were on properties they had recently owned.

In addition to Calvert, the other Republican lawmakers who are known to have collected the residential solar credit are Sen. John Curtis of Utah and Rep. Tom Massie of Kentucky, a libertarian who voted against Trump’s megalaw but said in an interview he supports rescinding the solar subsidy — and all tax credits. Curtis said Democrats and solar companies “knew that it was time for the subsidies to go.”

The revelations come at a time of rising utility rates and increasing politicization of energy as the Trump administration scraps grants, loans and permits for solar, wind and other renewable energy technologies. The president has dismissed solar panels as part of Democrats’ “green new scam” and called them “a blight on our country.”

Trump’s megalaw reinforced the partisan divide on energy. While the legislation primarily extended tax cuts passed in the president’s first term and provided $300 billion for border enforcement and military programs, it also slashed over $484 billion in clean energy incentives. Despite the megalaw’s deep cuts for climate programs, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that it would add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.

The law was a double-whammy for the solar industry. It speeds up the phase-out of both the rooftop solar subsidy tapped by Calvert, Curtis and Massie as well as another credit relied on by project developers to cut the price of leased panels. At the same time, it boosted an oil subsidy created in the early 1900s and included other provisions to increase the production of fossil fuels that are primarily responsible for global warming.

“There has been a push, as you know, for a long while to get rid of those tax credits,” said Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, whose Capitol Hill rowhouse roof has been layered with solar panels for about a decade. “And then when you had Trump come into office, he made it very clear that this was not something that he was going to continue supporting.”

A key swing vote on the megalaw, Murkowski couldn’t recall if she received the credit, which can save homeowners thousands of dollars by refunding 30 percent of the cost of buying and installing panels. Analysts say almost everyone who buys a new solar system — the average cost of which is now about $30,000 — files for the benefit.

Rise and fall of solar subsidies

Congress first established a tax credit for some residential solar investments in 1978, but the subsidy expired in 1985.

The tax credit was revived in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 — a sweeping law signed by President George W. Bush that Murkowski and Calvert voted for at the time.

In the years since, the so-called residential clean energy credit has been extended and broadened in scope several times, most recently when Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 with no Republican votes. The clean energy spending package would have allowed homeowners to claim tax credits of between 22 and 30 percent of the cost of qualifying solar, wind, geothermal and battery projects through 2034.

Then on July 4, Trump signed the megalaw that moved up the expiration of the residential clean energy credit by nearly a decade.

The legislation also accelerated the end of a 30 percent investment tax credit that’s used by solar installers to lower the cost of leasing panels for their customers. That solar credit will now largely disappear at the end of 2027, at least five years earlier than it would have.

New York Rep. Mike Lawler lives in a suburban home in the Hudson River Valley with rooftop panels that he leases from Vivint Solar. His district narrowly supported former Vice President Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, making him one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress.

Lawler was among a group of GOP lawmakers who repeatedly urged House leaders to protect clean energy subsidies when the party was overhauling the tax code this year. Those efforts were largely unsuccessful, and Lawler voted for the bill.

“We didn’t get everything we wanted, but we were able to keep a lot of the provisions and labor standards, etc.,” he said in an interview.

The panels on Lawler’s house have helped him avoid the impacts of rising electricity costs. Since he began leasing the solar system in 2016, it has saved him “a few thousand bucks,” he estimated.

“Look, they were going to expire,” Lawler said of the solar subsidies. “And it was phased out — a little more accelerated than some would like — but people are still able to utilize them.”

Lawler indirectly benefited from the investment tax credit, analysts say, because it helps companies reduce the costs their customers pay for leasing rooftop solar systems. After 2027, when the investment tax credit disappears, it could be harder for people to lease panels or buy electricity from community solar projects, according to Zoë Gaston, an analyst at the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.

“Solar will definitely be more expensive,” she said. “It could be as much as a 30 percent increase. I know from talking to lots of installers that they’re trying to find other opportunities to cut costs.”

California Reps. Darrell Issa and Young Kim, both Republicans who voted for the megalaw, also had solar panels on homes they once owned. Public records show Issa sold his property last year. Kim transferred hers to a family trust in 2024 that now operates it as a rental property. She is facing a primary from Calvert.

Their offices did not respond to questions about whether the lawmakers had taken advantage of federal subsidies to purchase or lease the panels.

Dampening a solar boom

The use of rooftop panels by Republicans illustrates the growing economic appeal of solar energy, industry data shows.

A renewable energy trade group estimated in 2004 that the nation installed enough panels that year to produce a total of 58 megawatts of power, enough for about 8,000 homes. Installations have exploded in popularity since then. Last year, the U.S. added over 50 gigawatts of solar capacity — 865 times higher than 2004 levels — with 4.8 GW of that annual growth coming from the residential sector alone, according to solar industry data. Seven percent of U.S. homes now have solar systems.

The megalaw is likely to blunt the solar boom as it amplifies other challenges facing the industry, such as high interest rates and Trump’s tariffs, according to analysts. Three large companies have already filed for bankruptcy protection this year, with more expected to become insolvent in the coming months. Wood Mackenzie estimates that solar installations over the next decade would be 17 percent lower than it had previously forecast.

Curtis and Murkowski both argued that phasing out solar subsidies was necessary.

“I think universally, everybody — including our Democratic colleagues, including the industry — knew that it was time for the subsidies to go,” said Curtis, who along with Murkowski shaped the megalaw to make it slightly less difficult for companies to access the investment tax credit before it ends. “Nobody fought harder than I did for the off-ramp for those, because I felt like the off-ramp was appropriate.”

Democrats and solar companies disagreed with Curtis. Abigail Ross Hopper, the head of the Solar Energy Industries Association, warned on July 1 that the compromise legislation he and Murkowski had brokered “will strip the ability of millions of American families to choose the energy savings, energy resilience, and energy freedom that solar and storage provide.”

Curtis founded the Conservative Climate Caucus in 2021 while he was serving in the House. Two years later, he invited a climate media company to tour his home in Provo, Utah, where he showed off his solar panels and geothermal heat pump, while bragging about the hundreds of dollars per month they helped him save in energy costs. The panels and heat pump were both eligible for the residential tax credit he voted to terminate.

Back on Capitol Hill, Murkowski said her husband decided to install panels on their rowhouse about a decade ago. The senator, who once chaired the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, couldn’t recall if they had filed for the federal tax credit.

“He was a real skeptic of solar and solar panels, more specifically, because he didn’t think that they were really going to make a difference for him as a consumer, as an individual,” Murkowski said, referring to her husband, Verne Martell.

What changed his mind, she said, was seeing the electricity savings of his then-87-year-old mother, who has solar panels on her home in Maui, Hawaii.

“It was an education for him that allowed him to do more research about how it might work in Washington, D.C.,” Murkowski said. “I do like the fact that our utility bills are really manageable now. And you know, it took a while, but it paid off.”

New fossil fuel subsidies

Republicans’ justification for killing rooftop solar credits are undercut by their continued support for incentives that go to the fossil fuel industry, argued Jesse Lee, a former senior adviser to the National Economic Council during the Biden administration.

“We’ve had subsidies and tax credits for oil production for more than a century. So I don’t really understand this argument that all clean energy tax credits must come to an end,” said Lee, who is now a spokesperson for the environmental advocacy group Climate Power.

“And not only did they leave the century-old oil industry subsidies untouched, they gave new tax loopholes to the oil industry,” he added. For instance, the megalaw established a 2.5 percent production tax credit for steel-making coal, cut royalty rates for coal mining and oil drilling on federal land, and eased restrictions on tax deductions for oil drilling costs — a subsidy that dates back to 1913.

Murkowski wasn’t comfortable with the megalaw’s energy contradictions.

“It’s kind of putting your finger on the scale, if you will, and picking winners and losers in the energy space,” she said. “I don’t think we should do that.”

But overall, she thought the bill was “more positive than negative in a lot of different areas,” she said. Murkowski was one of the final Republican holdouts on the bill, which passed the Senate with a tiebreaking vote by Vice President JD Vance.

Massie, whose Kentucky farmhouse appears to have more solar panels than the homes of his GOP colleagues, was one of only two House Republicans to oppose the megalaw. He voted against it because he thought the bill didn’t go far enough in cutting energy and health care subsidies.

“I would end all the tax credits. For everything,” said Massie, who earned a master’s degree in mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and has enough solar and battery systems to live off the grid. “I bought the bulk of mine before the federal tax credit.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/d7/41/b41a2dcd46419e20c32ff86c2217/main-ee-solarcredits-new.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 07:01:10.805356

Kennedy famously implored a new generation of Americans to serve their country. Almost 64 years later, Jack Schlossberg, his only grandson, is now heeding the call for generational change from Democratic voters as the party’s leaders continue to cling to office well into their 70s.

Schlossberg, 32, announced Wednesday morning in a video posted to social media that he’s running for the House seat of 78-year-old Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who is set to retire after 34 years representing the heart of Manhattan. The video was not cheeky, controversial and eyebrow raising as much of his content as “JackUno” often is.

Instead, Schlossberg notified his nearly 800,000 follower in a serious and earnest tone of his desire to represent his hometown district and fight against the Trump administration from within the halls of Congress.

“It’s certainly time for a new generation of Americans to step up and ask what they can do for their country,” Schlossberg said in an interview with MSNBC ahead of his announcement. “And I think that it shouldn’t just be about someone’s age. It should be specifically about young candidates — any age candidates — who understand policy and how to compete in this political environment, which is toxic.”

Like other Democrats, Schlossberg sees President Donald Trump’s policies and behavior as causing what he called corruption, affordability and constitutional crises. But unlike other elected Democrats and candidates, the New York City native is leaning into his influencer credentials to fuel his first run for elected office. He sees taking it to Trump on social media as not just clickbait but a necessity in an attention economy dominated by right-wing X posters, podcasters and YouTube influencers spreading the Trump gospel.

“One thing we can do is elect candidates who know how to communicate and cut back in this toxic political environment that we find ourselves in,” Schlossberg said. “New media is completely polluted and the air is dirty. I figured out a way to breathe in that environment, and we need to elect candidates who understand how to do that, and I think that’s what makes me an effective representative.”

Schlossberg isn’t shying away from the personal nature of the fight against Trump — who has sought to dismantle the Kennedy legacy — or against his cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who Trump appointed Health and Human Services secretary after a failed presidential run that was Camelot-coded.

Schlossberg’s online following ballooned last year, in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election, as he tried on various characters and presented his followers with accented impersonations. He was the first in his family to publicly criticize his cousin, and drew attention for trolling the now-HHS secretary and Trumpism.

Schlossberg also appeared as a surrogate on the 2024 campaign trail, spending the months ahead of the election traveling the country and making cameos in viral videos with elected officials in hopes of turning out young voters. Schlossberg’s “trolling for a cause” model, as he called it, recently has been embraced by high-profile Democrats such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom and others who have started posting slightly unhinged or lacerating social media messages directed at Trump and MAGA world, oftentimes in all caps and with exaggerated punctuation.

“In the lead-up to the 2024 election, I saw a problem that I wanted to do something about, and that’s that the internet and new media is dominated by the right — and it has been for a decade,” said Schlossberg. “I want to offer a different perspective, an alternative perspective, and get the Democratic Party’s message out there to reach people. So I use my own creativity, a little bit of courage, to put my neck out there and speak up for what I believe in. And I learned a lot doing that.”

But Schlossberg’s in-real-life takeaway from his experience on the campaign trail wasn’t as sarcastic or mischievous, departing from his online brand.

“I learned that the Democratic Party is not dead or dying there,” he added. “I met thousands of people across the country. I went to almost every single swing state, and I met people, young and old, who are excited to join our cause and do whatever they can to stop this president from enacting his agenda.”

Schlossberg joins a growing primary field for Nadler’s heavily Democratic district in which a primary win is tantamount to victory. Micah Lasher, a New York state assembly member and Nadler protégé, jumped into the race in September, along with Liam Elkind, a 26-year-old nonprofit founder. Nadler told The New York Times last month that any endorsement of a successor “is way down the road.”

If elected, Schlossberg could serve in Congress while his cousin holds a Cabinet position. As HHS secretary, RFK Jr. has departed radically from his uncle’s Democratic legacy, slashing health research funding, laying off hundreds of federal workers, and weakening vaccine policy. Schlossberg argued that fighting the Trump administration is not just about his family’s legacy, but about the “generations of Americans and New Yorkers who fought and sacrificed to build this country.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251111-jack-schlossberg-kennedy-congress-es-571c58.jpg",N,,2025-11-12 07:01:15.931091

The transition to a sustainable economy — based on renewable energy and clean technologies — have broad popular support in Brazil. According to research released by the Brazilian Agency for Industrial Development (ABDI) in partnership with Nexus, Three out of four Brazilians believe that the green economy will bring new jobs..

The survey indicates that 75% of respondents believe that the shift to a sustainable economic model will be accompanied by... generating job opportunities, while only 16% express pessimism regarding this scenario. The research therefore reinforces that the advancement of clean energy is seen not only as an environmental response, but also as a solid alternative for social and economic growth.

Positive outlook across all income levels.

According to the study, the perception that the green economy can boost the job market is stronger among higher-income individuals. Among those who receive above five minimum wages78% believe that the sustainable transition will create new jobs. The same percentage is observed among those who earn from two to five minimum wages, followed by 76% among those with income between one and two minimum wages.

These numbers indicate that confidence in job growth is strong. renewable energy It is widespread across all social strata, albeit with varying degrees of intensity.

Education and professional qualifications influence perception.

The study also shows that education has a direct impact on the vision of the future of the green economy. Among Brazilians with complete higher education79% believe that the transition to a sustainable model will increase job creation. Among those who completed the... high school, 78% share this opinion, while 68% of respondents with complete primary education They believe that the green economy will bring improvements to the job market.

To Ricardo CappelliAccording to the president of ABDI, the advancement of renewable energies will require more qualified and better-paid professionals.

""Therefore, it is natural that those with more education and income are better able to see the opportunities that this change can bring,"" he highlighted in an official statement.

The official's statement reinforces the importance of investing in technical and technological education to meet the growing demand for professionals prepared to work in the low-carbon economy.

Gender, age, and region also shape the optimism of Brazilians.

The research shows striking differences in perception between demographic groups. Men 59% believe more in the creation of new jobs through the green economy than women (49%).

Age also influences perspectives on the topic. younger, between 16 and 24 years, are the most optimistic: 62% believe that the renewable energy New opportunities will open up. The same pattern holds true among people of 25 the 40 years (59%). Among the 41 and 59 years, the confidence rate falls to 49%, and among the over 60 years, it reaches 46%.

Regionally, the numbers remain high. In Southeast e Sul78% of those surveyed believe that the green economy will boost employment. North e Midwest, the index reaches 73%. Already in Northeast67% of residents demonstrate the same confidence in the transformative power of renewable energy.

“As a Virginian who knows the importance of natural gas to my Commonwealth’s economy, I believe that we must come together to secure a reliable and affordable energy future,” McAuliffe said in a statement.

McAuliffe will lead the organization with former Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, former U.S. Reps. Kendrick Meek of Florida and Tim Ryan of Ohio and former Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter.

The group points to studies that suggest transitioning to 100% renewable energy will be cost prohibitive and meeting peak demand for energy will prove a challenge. Natural gas in conjunction with renewable sources will allow the demand to be met at a reasonable cost, the group has said.

Reporting by the Guardian and Floodlight show that Natural Allies is backed by fossil fuel companies to appeal to young, liberal, non-White constituents. Their mission is to focus on how gas is “cleaner” than coal, yet fossil fuels remain a major driver in climate change.

Ryan said this strategy “can show Democrats they don’t have to choose between environmental progress and economic reality. We can lead on both fronts.” Environmental groups believe the messaging from the group is “greenwashing” the impacts of gas power on the climate.

Natural Allies states that they work with lawmakers to educate them on how they can marry gas power and renewable energy to meet their states’ needs. The group is largely focused on Virginia, New York, and New Jersey and stresses the significantly lower carbon emissions that natural gas emits compared to coal fired plants.

In Chesterfield, that is a common argument made in support of the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center, a proposed gas peaking plant to be built on the site of a former coal plant. Hundreds of residents in the area have been fiercely opposing the plant and say they want to prevent additional pollutants being released into the surrounding communities.

Still, Natural Allies’ website reads that “Without natural gas, higher-emitting fuels like coal and oil would be needed to keep lights on. Additionally, rising energy costs will disproportionately impact vulnerable households — worsening health, education, and economic outcomes.”

McAuliffe served as Governor of Virginia from 2014-2018, before the Virginia Clean Economy Act passed in 2020 – which mandates utilities retire gas powered plants by 2050. Virginia is also one of the largest energy importers in the country and is facing a demand crisis with hundreds of power thirsty data centers on the grid and more expected.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mcauliffe-campaign-stop-richmond-3.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 11:07:11.643747

Bennet says",Lindsey Toomer,,,,,https://coloradonewsline.com/2025/11/12/congress-unlikely-to-extend-premium-tax-credits-after-shutdown-deal-sen-bennet-says/,"“I don’t have confidence about how that vote is going to turn out,” Bennet said in a press call Tuesday.
The enhanced premium tax credits implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic were initially set to expire in 2022, but Congress extended and expanded them with the Inflation Reduction Act.
Bennet and U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper, both Colorado Democrats, voted against the measure because it “did nothing” to extend the tax credits expiring at the end of the year, Bennet said.
He is “recommitted more than ever” to advocating for a universal health care system in the U.S.
The shutdown was not a waste of time because “fighting for Americans’ health care is not a waste of time,” Bennet said.","After the Senate passed a stopgap funding bill that does not include extended Affordable Care Act tax credits, U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet is not confident that a future floor vote in the Senate will lead to an extension.

“I don’t have confidence about how that vote is going to turn out,” Bennet said in a press call Tuesday. “I don’t expect any Republicans in the Senate to change their vote, and I don’t expect the House to try to pass that bill. We could end up being surprised by that, but I wouldn’t hold out hope for that.”

The U.S. Senate voted 60-40 Monday on a stopgap spending bill that will reopen and fund the federal government through Jan. 30 following the longest shutdown in U.S. history. Members of the House of Representatives began traveling back to Washington, D.C. this week, as the chamber will need to pass the Senate-approved measure before the government will reopen.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune promised Democrats a floor vote on an extension of the tax credits will occur in December, part of a deal struck with seven Democrats and one independent to advance the spending bill, despite it not including an extension of enhanced premium tax credits to support Americans who purchase health insurance through the individual marketplace.

The enhanced premium tax credits implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic were initially set to expire in 2022, but Congress extended and expanded them with the Inflation Reduction Act. In the absence of those enhanced federal subsidies, the average cost to purchase health insurance through Connect for Health Colorado, the state’s individual marketplace, will more than double next year.

Bennet and U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper, both Colorado Democrats, voted against the measure because it “did nothing” to extend the tax credits expiring at the end of the year, Bennet said. He said he thinks the Democrats who voted to pass the stopgap measure made a judgement that the downsides of continuing the shutdown overrode the benefits.

“I obviously didn’t share that judgment, but that was their judgment,” Bennet said.

While he is “deeply disappointed” with the outcome in the Senate, Bennet, who is running for Colorado governor in 2026, said he will continue to push for an extension of the tax credits as well as broader reform of the country’s health care system. He is “recommitted more than ever” to advocating for a universal health care system in the U.S.

The shutdown was not a waste of time because “fighting for Americans’ health care is not a waste of time,” Bennet said. But he said there is no plan B to help Coloradans facing higher insurance premium costs.

“For months, we urged President (Donald) Trump and Republicans to come to the table and extend the tax credits — which are already existing law and simply need to be extended — to give families a little bit breathing room, to make healthcare a little bit more affordable, and they’ve refused,” Bennet said.

Bennet declined to say if he still supports Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has faced calls from progressive groups and some Democratic House members to step down from leadership after failing to hold his caucus together in the shutdown fight.

Americans will make the judgement that Democrats continue to fight for affordable healthcare while Republicans make it more expensive, Bennet said, as Republicans have fought against the Affordable Care Act since it was first introduced.

“We now know that we will never have an improved health care system as long as Donald Trump is our president and we have a majority of Republicans in the House and the Senate,” Bennet said.

Many major federal government operations have been shut down since Oct. 1. The Trump administration laid off many federal workers during the shutdown, a move that will be reversed under the Senate-approved measure. Bennet said his office will work to reach out and make sure workers who were laid off in Colorado know that they could be reinstated.",https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-11-at-4.24.05 PM-2048x1309.png,N,,2025-11-12 07:01:18.525390

Q: Can U.S. automakers match Chinese prices?
Q: What advantages do U.S. automakers have?","Detroit’s automotive leaders are sounding alarms as Chinese automakers rapidly expand in the global electric vehicle (EV) market, highlighting both opportunities and challenges for the U.S. industry. While China’s automotive sector has surged under extensive state support, U.S. executives insist that adopting similar practices is not a feasible or desirable path.

Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley described Chinese EV companies, including BYD Co. Ltd., which sells models under $10,000, as “an existential threat” to traditional U.S. manufacturers. However, he emphasized that American companies have distinct advantages in infrastructure, innovation, and workforce experience, which can help them maintain a competitive edge.

“Ford will always advocate for policies that level the playing field,” Farley told The Detroit News. “We’ve made progress in the U.S., but government support still lags behind the extensive subsidies and incentives offered by China.” Farley also noted growing bipartisan support for policies aimed at strengthening U.S. automakers’ global competitiveness.

China’s dominance in automotive manufacturing is the result of decades of coordinated policy efforts. After the 1980s, foreign automakers entered China through joint ventures with domestic companies, often state-controlled, and the market only exceeded 2 million vehicle sales annually after China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. By 2024, China’s annual vehicle sales topped 31 million, with EVs and plug-in hybrids now representing the majority of the market.

Experts point to China’s long-term industrial planning, particularly the 2015 “Made in China 2025” initiative, as a critical factor in the country’s sustained growth. According to Bill Russo, CEO of Automobility Ltd., “China’s consistency in policy and industrial direction gives it a significant advantage over the U.S., where regulations and incentives often fluctuate with political changes.”

Chinese EV manufacturers have benefitted from at least $230 billion in subsidies between 2009 and 2023, not including regional incentives or support for battery production and infrastructure. These subsidies, combined with low-cost labor and rapid automation, allow companies to price vehicles aggressively, fueling intense domestic competition often referred to as “involution.” While some companies, such as BYD, have seen net income declines due to the competitive market, government interventions aim to stabilize pricing and shift focus toward innovation and vehicle features.

U.S. automakers are adapting to these pressures. Ford has launched its Universal Electric Vehicle (UEV) platform, aiming to produce a midsize EV truck priced around $30,000 at the Louisville Assembly Plant by 2027. The company seeks to match Chinese production costs while maintaining U.S. labor standards and sustainability practices. Similarly, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe noted that while Chinese firms benefit from subsidies and low-cost labor, their manufacturing methods and technology are not inherently superior to U.S. standards.

Concerns over intellectual property, supply chains, and national security are also shaping U.S. strategies. China controls large segments of critical materials such as rare earths and EV battery production, prompting U.S. policymakers and companies to prioritize domestic sourcing and innovation to protect competitive advantages.

Despite these challenges, the U.S. automotive industry retains significant strengths, including a highly skilled workforce, strong university-industry collaboration, established consumer loyalty, and experience in large-scale manufacturing. Experts argue that leveraging these assets while investing in EV technology, supply chains, and partnerships can allow American automakers to compete globally without replicating China’s intensive and often ethically problematic practices.

As the EV race accelerates, executives like Farley and analysts warn that the stakes for U.S. manufacturers could not be higher. “We’re in a global competition for manufacturing dominance,” Farley said. “China wants every one of our jobs, and we need to respond strategically without compromising our values or workforce standards.”

FAQ

Q: Why are Chinese automakers a threat to U.S. companies?

A: Chinese EV manufacturers benefit from extensive subsidies, low-cost labor, and government-backed industrial policies, allowing them to produce vehicles at lower prices and gain global market share.

Q: Can U.S. automakers match Chinese prices?

A: U.S. companies like Ford and Rivian aim to reduce costs through advanced production platforms, economies of scale, and innovation, but direct cost parity is challenging without compromising labor and ethical standards.

Q: What advantages do U.S. automakers have?

A: Legacy infrastructure, experienced workforce, consumer trust, and research collaborations with universities give U.S. manufacturers a competitive edge in quality, safety, and innovation.

Q: How is the U.S. government supporting automakers?

A: Policies include EV tax incentives, tariffs on imports, domestic supply chain support, and regulations to protect intellectual property and industrial independence.",https://crispng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1020.jpeg,N,,2025-11-12 07:01:58.277256

We talk a lot about the grid of the future. The truth is, that future is already showing up in Texas.

Batteries are being built at record pace, data centers are chasing cheap and reliable power, and Texans are adding gigawatts worth of backup systems in homes, schools, and factories.

I sat down with energy analyst Nat Bullard to ask a simple question: if we look at what is actually being built — not the rhetorical arguments happening online, but what is actually happening around the world — where are energy systems headed?

We started with a comparison of batteries and gas peakers. Batteries respond in milliseconds, don’t rely on fuel deliveries during a freeze, and can make money all day providing grid services between scarcity events. Increasingly, duration is less of an issue as prices fall.

As Nat reminded us, during Winter Storm Uri it was “largely things in the thermal fleet” that failed. Winterizing batteries is likely much less onerous and complicated than winterizing gas plants.

Behind-the-meter systems are also booming. One- to ten-megawatt batteries can turn schools or factories into mini-resilience hubs. If Texas keeps adding storage at this pace, we could end up with the equivalent of dozens of peaker plants—only more responsive and decentralized.

Share

Nat concluded with a description of his family as a mix of, a ground source heat heat pump, a mini split, and a Franklin stove. A small hybrid system built to ride out different conditions.

That is a good picture of where ERCOT is headed: a mix of gas and batteries, large wires and local resources, data centers and smart devices. The question is whether we design structures to speed up that hybrid grid on purpose or stumble along and end up there eventually anyway. The first path costs a lot less.

The more we learn from what’s actually happening — the focus of Nat’s excellent annual decarbonization presentation — the more cost effective our decisions will be for Texas.

Doug Lewin (00:06.422)

Welcome to the Energy Capital podcast. I’m your host, Doug Lewin, and welcome to part two of my conversation with Nat Bullard. Nat, as you heard last week, is the co-founder of Halcyon. He is also the one who puts together a fantastic energy transition and decarbonization presentation that comes out every January, which we talked about in this podcast. All around, one of the great experts on all things energy transition and decarbonization. I learned a ton from talking to Nat. I couldn’t let him go after the usual 45 to 50 minutes. We ended up going long, so we split it into two parts. This is part two.

So that kind of leads me to where I wanted to go next. You obviously do a whole lot of tracking of batteries. We’ve been talking about electric vehicles a lot. Obviously batteries first started their performance improvement and cost declines because of their use in computers and phones. But now we’re seeing them go into cars on a mass scale and now onto the grid in a really mass scale. I mean, how do you think about that as far as the price comparisons for batteries, particularly gas peakers? Combined cycle, I would almost put in a little bit of a different category because you’re talking more about something that’s going to have a much higher utilization. These days, I think there weren’t a lot being built. There were very few being built, particularly in Texas, but I think just about anywhere with data centers, I think we’ll see some more built.

But still in Texas, for instance, in the Texas Energy Fund—this is obviously the subsidy program the Texas legislature put in place a couple of years ago, $7.2 billion in subsidies for gas plants—something like 80% of the projects that applied and were chosen, I think it actually is closer to 85%, were peaker plants. And that’s because we do have an energy-only market. Like you said, in a market, people respond to incentives. The incentives are for short bursts of very high prices. And when you start to stack the peakers up against batteries, and of course the old thing was, you can only go an hour or two, an hour or two is enough for 90, 95% of the high prices in the market. And for the rest, now we’re starting to get to where batteries are going to four or five, six, even longer hour durations. So how do you think about both the price comparison and then the attributes? How do you think differently about the attributes of a peaker versus a battery? Are they really doing the same thing?

Nat Bullard (03:13.294)

What’s so funny—we had this four-hour standard, more or less. And what’s fascinating about that to me is that is largely an artifact of regulation, not of anything technical. In California back in the day, all you would get paid for was four hours worth of storage. So guess what? Everybody optimizes around this artificially binding constraint that I think we’re starting to see people move past. Again, energy-only market—if there was any place that is going to be ready to do more, or for that matter, to do less, it would be Texas. And also to combine things. When I talk to the biggest of the developers, what their view is, is to meet, let’s say a 500-megawatt load for a data center, the quickest path, the critical path is probably going to be mostly renewable electrons. And within that almost entirely, probably solar, a bunch of batteries. And then you have a combustion turbine to serve the rest of the purpose, but it comes in kind of after the purpose served, obviously, by the generation, but also by the storage.

And that kind of stack is the one that seems to be moving the quickest, probably at the lowest cost, and probably the best fit for anybody who’s out there operating. It’s also the one in the future that, if you want to think about future-proofing it, you’re not talking about having to rip out 600 megawatts of solar and 3,000 megawatt-hours of batteries or whatever you might be doing. You’re talking about keeping those, improving them with software, with new hardware, and then altering the final step at the end. If you were to make this a zero-carbon or zero-net-emissions in the long run, maybe the combustion turbine is running on hydrogen. Maybe you’re doing some kind of durable binding, verified carbon removal to cover the cost of the emissions that are there.

So I guess my way of thinking is to be a bit more ecumenical about all of this and also watch what the smartest people who build stuff are already doing, watch how they’re going about it and thinking about doing this and viewing these things as generally part of a portfolio approach as opposed to either “if this then that” or an “either/or” approach. Not like if I’m doing this I therefore have to do that, but I’m doing that because it makes the most sense and not I’m doing this or I’m doing only that. Now there are constraints elsewhere. Again, Texas is a unique market where if you have the land and the wherewithal to go build a 500-megawatt data center, you probably can locate the land and have the wherewithal to do a similar amount of power generation. It is less the case in, say, Pennsylvania or in Maryland. So it’s going to be different elsewhere, but you all have a unique market down there for this kind of thing.

Doug Lewin (05:51.948)

Yeah, it’s incredibly challenging here too, but I think it is more doable than in those other places. I also think that there is too much kind of either/or. I think there’s actually benefits to having both on the system—gas peakers and batteries. Obviously batteries, whatever the duration is, they are duration-limited at some point. They’re going to run out. Now the sun will come back up and charge them or wind blows and charges them or turn the gas plant on and charge them, if you have enough power to do that. And we also get times when the gas plants aren’t working, particularly in extreme cold. We’ve had severe problems with that. Having a battery that can operate while you’re getting people to the site to figure out what’s going on with the gas plant to get it working, right? Or getting that gas plant turned on so the battery can recharge. There’s actually, I think, a bit of a symbiosis there.

And from the emissions perspective, if gas peakers allow you to displace other much more higher emitting baseload plants and still have the capabilities of those thermal units, you may not get your system to zero, but if you get it damn close, because we’re nowhere close to zero right now. So like, yeah, it’ll still be progress.

Nat Bullard (07:10.252)

That’s right. The best renewable developers I know are relentlessly practical people. I would argue that power developers in general are relentlessly practical, but renewable developers, maybe I should uplevel a little bit, are ruthlessly practical. And if this is going to be the path to market, then that makes most sense. As a quick thought experiment, when you mentioned about batteries, batteries operating until you can go turn on your combustion turbine is fascinating, right? If you think about during Winter Storm Uri, what assets had seized up was largely things in the thermal fleet that had seized up and were not able to provide this, that, and the other services at that time. If you’re a new battery, winterizing it is probably more straightforward than winterizing an existing thermal plant.

I remember at that moment, because I still had access to all this North America-wide data, during Winter Storm Uri, people were like, does this mean gas plants don’t work? And I said, let’s take a quick look at Saskatchewan right now, which is at the heart of the polar vortex that has dipped down to Texas. And it was like well below zero degrees Fahrenheit and everything’s running. But that’s because that’s within the normal design parameters. So a lot of this is thinking about how are we going to parameterize our future? And it’s a lot easier to parameterize brand new assets for something different than those that are already existing.

So I appreciate your practicality in thinking about this. I know that developers think that way. I know that given the capability that all grid operators want to think that way too. So let’s watch closely to see in an energy-only and competitive market, what moves fastest, what moves first, what has the most flexibility, literal and figurative, what’s the most supple in terms of how the capital markets are going to treat it, what has the most supply, what can provide the most capacity, you name it. All of these things, I think, will become more clear and less ideological one way or another over time.

Doug Lewin (09:11.342)

I want to ask you also just what you’re seeing. I don’t know how much you’re tracking this, but residential battery—we’re recording on October the eighth and today Base Power in Texas announced they just raised their Series C of a billion dollars. And by the time this podcast comes out, there’ll be another one out where Zach Dell was on a panel that I’d moderated at Gulf Coast Power Association, where he said they’re doing 20 megawatts per month at this point. It’s a small company on kind of a growth trajectory. And that’s just one company, right? Tesla’s doing batteries. I mean, I want to test this against you. I am very, very bullish on distributed batteries. We’ve also seen, by the way, there is some good data on this. Maybe this will make it into your slideshow in January. I’ll send you this slide.

There is a slide that ERCOT has on distributed energy resources in Texas. The fastest growing segment in Texas—well, the bulk battery storage is growing—but on DERs is between one and 10 megawatt batteries. There’s developers all over ERCOT putting in 9.9s, because when you get above 10, you reach a certain threshold where you change your status and the way you interconnect. There’s just tons of these 9.9-megawatt batteries. So between garages and this one to 10 segment, which literally doubled from ‘23 to ‘24, I really think this is going to be a mega trend and one that is really, really good for the grid for the very things we were just talking about, these reliability and resiliency problems, having batteries scattered all over. Is that something you’re tracking? Have any thoughts or stats or anything like that on?

Nat Bullard (10:49.526)

At Halcyon, we’re tracking now—we just set up another subscription to cover this—is going to be looking at the grid-tied battery and energy storage systems. So those that, again, go through a kind of public certification and necessity process. The speed with which these things are happening is fascinating because it’s consumer-led. Obviously, policy and regulation informs it. But there are other dynamics at work. There are neighborly dynamics to it. As we know, if you’re the only house on the block that’s got power during another winter outage, your neighbors are going to notice. And hey, you’re going to invite your neighbors over to charge up.

My folks when they were still with us, when they had a farm in coastal Virginia and they had a gen set because hurricanes would come and knock things out for like a week at a time. And just as an anecdote, the only thing that they ran their gen set for was the chest freezer full of meat and fish that people would give them in exchange for cords of firewood. And so people will find a way to put power to use and do something with it and help each other out.

I would say that the one to 10 megawatt—was that the battery size that you quoted?

Doug Lewin (11:58.666)

Yeah, yeah, exactly.

Nat Bullard (12:00.814)

So again, listen, why is it 10 megawatts? No reason, except there’s a tripwire and regulatory above that at which you shall not pass. But I mean, I’ll give you something fascinating. So I was looking recently at some data from Australia, smaller in every way than Texas, and they have a new incentive for batteries. So Australia has installed just under 800 megawatt-hours of batteries residential only in two months under a new support mechanism. Like these things go really quick and you can watch how people optimize up to their limit. And what’s really cool was that they do it with smart providers who are ideally looking out for their best interests, but they do it according to their ability and according to their need, according to their financial ability and according to their need for stored power. And that’s really cool.

What other models are going to get built on top of that? I think is a really good question for us to be thinking about and to be asking. But also it’s one that we can observe. We’ll be able to see that as markets take off and start to ship more and do more. It’s funny, I can’t remember who it was. I was listening recently talking about vehicle to grid. I think it was on Shayle Kann’s podcast and the discussion was like, we should think about rebranding it from vehicle to grid to vehicle to home. Vehicle to grid—I’m supporting the abstraction of everybody. Vehicle to home—I am in a blackout, but I can watch telly. Like that’s different.

Doug Lewin (13:26.006)

Absolutely. And like you said, help your neighbors. I think that’s really—people want to do that kind of stuff. Some people will—there are people, I’m not doing that as long—if it came to it, of course you’d help your neighbors and you’d be happy to do it. I just actually recorded a podcast with Brett Biggart. He’s the CEO of Freedom Solar, which is the, or one of the largest installers in the state of Texas. And he said, attachment rate in Houston right now is 90%. So 90% of the solar installations they’re doing—for new systems, 90% of the systems they’re installing include storage at this point, which kind of makes sense, because if you’re in Houston and you just lived through Hurricane Beryl and you’re worried about the next hurricane, why would you get solar without storage? So I really do think we’re going to see this more.

Nat Bullard (14:10.22)

And you know, I’m also fascinated to think of this not just as an installation, but as the beginning of a relationship in the sense that’s not just a relationship with a vendor, but a relationship with how you think about power and the grid. Like if you’ve even done this, you were probably not going back and you’re going to have somebody come to you in four or five years, buying your old battery off of you and getting you twice as much storage for the last money or whatever it might be. There’s a lot of different ways we could cut this. But for people to come in and be like, do you want to get much more for the same dollars or do you want to pay less and get the same as you’re getting right now? Like there will be a lot of things that come in here and there’ll be a lot of innovation in terms of getting these things to market for everybody. And let’s see what happens.

It’ll be done, I think, in a—it’s definitely not permissionless because you literally need permission to do this—but it will be done in a much more literally distributed fashion than the Texas Energy Fund. This isn’t the Texas Energy Fund approving $7 billion that goes out to what, no more than 30 entities. How many total plants are gonna draw funding from the Texas Energy Fund?

Doug Lewin (15:22.798)

That’s a good question. I think it’s 15 to 20 or something like that. Yeah, right. The sizes vary as some of them drop out and others get in, but we’ve seen some as big as a gigawatt, some as small as 100 megawatts. I think it’s like, because they’re trying to get 10 gigawatts, it’s probably about 15 to 20.

Nat Bullard (15:38.04)

But we’ll see that much equivalent instantaneous storage capability deployed probably by the same time that the Texas Energy Fund plants have been built. And into what market? This is another great question for those of you who are thinking from a market’s perspective. When the Texas Energy Fund assets are fully commissioned at whatever price point it is, what market are they competing in? Are they competing in a market that’s installing a gigawatt-hour of distributed storage a month in Texas? It’s entirely within the possibility that that will be happening four or five years’ time. And then what? Right?

One of the things that you do such a good job of, and I would hope to be able to do, is ask the next question for people, which is if you’re in the combined cycle business in Texas, are you watching what the Base Powers of the world, the Freedom Solars of the world are doing when they’re watching battery installation or their attachment rates because an electron is an electron. Obviously there’s plenty of other qualitative things that come into it, but it’s really worth keeping an eye out on this stuff as it goes.

Doug Lewin (16:34.734)

It absolutely is. All right. So you, if I’m not mistaken, you started your career as a solar analyst, right? At NEF?

Nat Bullard (16:41.5)

I did.

Doug Lewin (16:42.5)

So solar, obviously we’re in a moment right now as one of your slides showed, I think 600 gigawatts of solar installed in 2024. Is that about right? It looks like we’re probably trending higher. Chinese capacity, again, one of your slides crested over a terawatt. I believe last year or maybe in 2023 they have a terawatt of capacity that they could produce. That is astounding. I think most of the audience probably knows this, but just to be sure to put that in perspective, the entire installed base of the United States of America is about 1.2 terawatts. So the Chinese could produce that entire amount in a given year. So when you’re talking earlier about exporting to Africa and other places, right? Latin America, Southeast Asia, et cetera, they’ve got plenty of capacity to do that.

Let’s talk a little bit about the outlook for solar. Are we going to reach a point where we’re like, okay, yeah, 600 gigawatts, 800 gigawatts, like that’s where it’s going to stop? Or do you see that that kind of growth is going to continue as we pick up with data center load growth and that kind of thing?

Nat Bullard (17:47.158)

It is a fascinating technology that I think confounds other ways of thinking by analogy. And you just have to sort of YOLO it and think about the incentive of building for the manufacturing side, Red Queen style. You’ve got to run to stand still. You’re always competing against more efficient plant, more efficient models. Your equipment depreciates very quickly. So there’s no such thing as like a 15-year-old solar manufacturing line that I know of that anybody would pay anybody for. So everybody’s doing more constantly. There’s always an urge to sort of tap these companies down so that they can make more money. It never seems to work in a durable fashion, but like the upstream issues of solar manufacturing are meaningless to the downstream advantages of anybody trying to buy and install and build comfortably within capability that we’re shipping a terawatt of PV modules every year, which would account for, currently there would be like multiple single-digit percent of total electricity demand every year being added from just solar electrons.

The question is, to my mind, less how much of that can be built and more what’s the rest of demand going to be? And how much demand inception is there going to be by this? Like if I think about all these exports to sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, that’s providing electricity that didn’t previously exist. It’s not displacing demand for electrons. It is potentially displacing potential future demand for thermally generated electrons, but it’s not displacing some existing demand. That’s only happening in places that have a grid. That’s more of an example as your guest Bill McKibben talked about in Pakistan. So I just think we should watch carefully how the rest of the world is approaching this and think as well about how a system will begin to design itself around the kind of native conditions of very, very low cost, but variable as available electrons with this generation profile and just lay that in. This is a truth. And now what?

Either what are you going to do to match your demand to that supply or what are you going to do to mitigate it? What are you going to do to smooth it, store it? How are people going to sort of configure themselves around that? And that’s where flexibility on the demand side is to me, the more interesting question for the future than it is. How much solar are we going to manufacture? That’s a question that is honestly, it’s almost like hilarious. Like it’s fever dream stuff for me as an analyst almost two decades ago, right? The IEA would come out and be like, there’s no problem meeting that narrowly defined net zero goals of solar already to the middle of the century, because there’s just so much being made and there’s so much capacity. Like you just have to sort of take that as a given and then start to think more creatively and constructively about every other thing that happens to outstrip that.

Doug Lewin (20:48.238)

Totally. I think that’s exactly right. And I think also your point about Africa is a really good one, right? And again, you have this slide of 10 or 12 different African countries and some of them as much as 57% of their power is coming from—these are countries that—and this is one of the things that drives me crazy about some of the crowd that is pro-fossil fuel and anti-everything else. I don’t mind people that are pro-fossil fuel. I do mind people that think that somehow emissions and pollution just aren’t a problem. Like even if you didn’t believe in climate change, we’ll put that aside. There’s pollution that obviously impacts human health from fossil fuels, and we should at least take that into account.

But the people that are just pro-fossil fuel and anti-everything else are like, if you hurt fossil fuel production, Africa will never get electrified. And I’m like, how long have we been producing fossil fuels? Stop kidding yourself that the United States or anybody else is going to fund the buildout of a macro grid. You’re going to build central station plants and you’re going to build high voltage transmission lines and you’re going to build an entire distribution system in Burkina Faso. No, you’re not. But you might put solar panels and batteries and LED light bulbs, just like the Pakistan example Bill McKibben gives, right? They’re literally—forget this about solar—they’re solar modules. They are modular. You could do one at a time and add to them. And the fact that it is producing power in concert with what is one of the most important energy uses for human health, which is air conditioning, which still a lot of the world does not have to any appreciable measure.

Like solar and air conditioning go so well together. And to think that somehow if we don’t fully develop fossil fuels, Burkina Faso is not going to get electricity. It’s insane. And it kind of drives me crazy. So I do think this is one of the places where solar will really stand out is really bringing power to billions of people around the world that just don’t really have it in any appreciable way.

Nat Bullard (23:03.872)

And one other thing to add on that, and it’s brought me back to my point about thinking about distributed storage in Texas is to ask the permission framework on which this happens. No one that’s importing solar modules from China to Zambia or to Mongolia is looking to whatever policy and politics-driven examples are happening elsewhere and saying, well, if this is being said in the United States, then I guess I shouldn’t do this. They don’t care. There’s essentially no overlap there whatsoever. And so another way to view this is that these are rhetorical discussions that we tend to have that are becoming increasingly academic.

And so it reminds me of the old joke about the French philosophers that that’s all well in practice, but how does it work in theory? Like this is sort of how these arguments are now starting to go. And so I would urge us all to be as observational as possible about all of this. And to also remember what is being observed and what is being adhered to elsewhere. Like, I don’t really think that there are a lot of solar module importers in Algeria who are following policy and politics-driven discussions elsewhere at the moment and using those as the basis for their business.

Doug Lewin (24:25.9)

Right. They’re just buying Chinese panels and batteries and electric vehicles as fast as they can.

Okay. So you talked about flexible demand. I want to talk about that next. And this might be a good last segment for this, coming back to where we started. The load projections for data centers, you have a great slide. I think this is the first time I saw this slide. I think Grid Strategies had a really good report that had something like this too, because I hadn’t seen quantified the data center demand in Texas, and you had a slide on this that in 2023 it was about 22 terawatt-hours. I would imagine in your next iteration of the slideshow, that number is going to be much, much higher.

And one of the things that is really interesting that is happening here right now, Nat, we talked earlier about the 85.5-gigawatt peak. That was in 2023. In 2024, it was a little less. It was like 85.1 or something. This year, throughout the summer in 2025, we were right at about 84. Now, it wasn’t as hot this summer as it was the last few, but it was still—people around here say it was a mild summer, but they’ve got recency bias. It was actually in the top third for hottest summers ever recorded compared to the last three years before that, which were all top six, not even top 6%, top six out of 150 years. It seemed cool.

So we’re seeing this lowering of the peak, but a significant increase of the minimums. Every single minimum this year is higher, and some of them, some months 20 to 25% higher. Some of that is driven by climate change, because even though it’s not as hot in summer, the nighttime lows aren’t as much. But a lot of that is being driven by data centers, and it’s being driven by flexible demand. So there’s flexible demand on the bulk side of data centers, crypto miners, those kinds of entities using power more off peak. I’d love for you to talk a little bit about the potential you see there, but then also that flexible demand on the smaller sites. We’ve already talked about residential batteries. That is like the ultimate flexible demand, right? You’re going to fill those batteries when there’s plenty of power, but we can also think about homes, if they have some minimum level of insulation at least as thermal batteries and actually moving demand around to create a system that has higher utilization, lower peaks, lower net peaks. How do you think about that? How are you tracking that? And yeah, what do you see as some of the trends in that space?

Nat Bullard (27:06.678)

I’m not tracking it much yet, but I’ll walk through my thought process on how I consider this, which is there’s no one who wants to go and set this up on their own. There’s also no one who wants to have no control over things. So there needs to be a really subtle, well-designed behavioral economics sort of modality here to have people saying like, yeah, use my home as one way or another, a thermal asset for the grid. Crypto mining—great. Like that’s a pretty clear incentive structure for people to be like, do this now, don’t do that then. Homes and consumers are a little bit more subtle, a little bit more fickle. Maybe it would be another way to say it. So I want to watch very closely to see what emerges that acknowledges that aspect of consumer nature. Right. How do you make it so people don’t feel like they’re getting surge priced, but they do want to opt out of something. How do people feel rewarded in a way that’s not just virtue signaling for doing something at the right time.

And you already alluded to it. How do you optimize other things around that? Well, if your house is a lot better insulated, then your thermal envelope is going to be better and your thermal battery capability, so to speak, is also going to be much better. Like if your house is essentially a leaky sieve, because it’s from the 1930s and it hasn’t been insulated, then you are going to pay a price for not cooling it at that moment. If it is insulated, then it’s much less of a big deal to you to go and do a ride through. This is why the classic old industrial and large commercial demand response was something like an industrial freezer, right? Things are chilled to well below zero degrees C. It’s not like a 30-minute ride through is going to make 80,000 pounds of beef rot instantly. Like there’s enough time for 30 minutes, whatever it might be for things to be okay.

You need a housing stock and a capability that’s better designed around that. That could be part of the package that goes into designing that to begin with, which is I’m not asking you to boil and bake here. What I’m asking you to do is in exchange for this, I’m also going to make sure that your house is more comfortable for everything. I do think this is a really important thing to consider. This is anecdotal data because I’ve seen it written about in multiple markets, but you have people in parts of the United States. It’s more common in Appalachia and in the mid-Atlantic who have an older home for which they have summer power bills higher than their mortgage. Like that’s not a state of affairs that we should be encountering. And how do we remedy that? It’s not just cheaper power. It’s a better thermal envelope. It’s a better business model to help shave the peak off for them or to pay people for not using it at certain moments.

But it’s very episodic. Not everybody’s like that, obviously. It can be very, very acute. But how do we, in a full stack, policy, regulation, society, behavior, business model, economics, finance, come together to make sure that we can meet all of those needs for everybody involved in a smart and quick and reliable way?

Doug Lewin (30:18.754)

That’s a huge question. Yeah, right? Look, it’s one that I’ve spent a long time on, I’m going to spend a lot more time on. You were talking about gigawatt-hour of batteries a month on the residential side. We could see that kind of scale. I also wonder if we can’t start to get to gigawatt scale of reduction of, for instance, winter peak in Texas. We’re worried about winters and Winter Storm Uri. We’ve got all this inefficient resistance heat. We know the heat pump technology is out there. I was really heartened in that conversation I had with the Freedom Solar CEO, Brett Biggart, that one of the ways he’s responding to the removal of the tax credits is he set up an HVAC company. Because he’s like, I have these relationships with people that have solar and storage. They probably have a really inefficient HVAC. Next time it breaks, I’d like to give them the high-efficiency heat pump.

If we can think about the integrated demand side, we can have a system that can take much more load growth. Again, not just data centers, it’s industrial electrification, transportation electrification, all of these things, which leads me to one other thing I did want to ask you about is one of the smartest people I’ve ever heard talk about energy. I am curious about how you think about primary energy. There’s been this big debate at the federal level around—it was Chris Wright, the secretary of energy said the other day, he doesn’t think in his lifetime we’ll ever get to 10% of global energy being solar. Now we were just talking about 600 gigawatts in 2024. He’s kind of playing a game there where he’s talking about primary energy as useful energy. Solar’s probably already pushing four or 5%, something like that. But this is where I think that the shift has to happen is we have to think about like, how do we use energy in the maximal possible way with as little waste as possible, then you’re really optimizing the economy.

Nat Bullard (32:12.568)

So the way that I think about that one is that the solar competition with primary energy is like, how good is it competing with 60% waste? How good is solar competing with mostly exhaust heat, rejected heat and emissions? To be less cheeky about it, what I think we’re likely to see is more and more things that are directly electrified by the final energy that is provided by solar and therefore changes the frame. So the good reliable modeling to think about the long future when it’s deeply decarbonized is that actually primary energy demand goes way down because you’re removing that waste heat rejection element of the equation. And you’re going to a world of even resistance heat in Texas that would be powered by solar directly. Like imagine it’s on your roof. You’ve got solar on the roof. You’ve got your battery. You have your even inefficient resistance baseboard.

What you do not have in there is the coal plant that’s maybe running at 30 to 35% efficient, all the transmission and distribution losses, all the conversion losses in the middle to then reconvert that into resistance heat. Like that’s something that is more cognitive at first than anything we need to think and imagine that that’s going to be the way that things go. But I would not bet against solar, particularly not in a lifetime fashion. That requires a suspension of disbelief in a way in the trend that was happening. It also is not using some very evidence-based imagination, I think, to think about what might be happening in the future and to be relatively neutral about all that kind of thing.

It’s a matter of what you’re competing with. And then as with any of these distributed technologies that get cheaper and better over time, not just what do they engage with at first and not just what do they displace. Well, what do they create? Like what different models are going to be created out of that process that changes the way that we think about this as the equivalent of thermal fired primary energy.

Doug Lewin (34:21.078)

Yeah. And on the piece of resistance heat, right? The bigger thing would be at night, right? When it’s really, really cold, you would have to then run your resistance heat with batteries where you would have some losses, but still far less than with fossil fuels. That’s of course partly why you’d want to have a heat pump because otherwise you’d have to size the battery to an absurdly high level. But your point remains, you’d have no waste.

Nat Bullard (34:45.235)

You know, my family farm’s frontier technology model for running the farm throughout very cold winters, ground source heat pump, one mini-split unit upstairs and a Franklin stove. Great.

Doug Lewin (34:58.853)

Yeah, that’s one way to do it. And it worked.

Nat Bullard (34:59.448)

The house was a little dry. Not going to lie to you. It was a rather low humidity house, but yes, price was right.

Doug Lewin (35:08.344)

There you go. All right, last thing. So earlier, I think at the beginning, I asked you one of those multi-layered three-part questions, and I don’t think we got to the third part, which is what’s coming in the 2026 slideshow? Drop a couple of nuggets to the audience of what they can look for that might be different in the 2026 slideshow.

Nat Bullard (35:27.682)

I’m not—if it’s going to be thinking about trade flows again, how that’s manifesting in markets outside the US. It will be thinking about pricing, how changes in electricity impacted pricing. I will be calling you up and asking you, Doug, what’s the very best ERCOT data set for me to pull in terms of volatility and prices here. I will do my best to look at other markets as I always do outside the US to try to help everybody see things as clearly as possible.

My one last thing I always hope is that I get a good clear view of the present moment. That’s my goal. That in and of itself, I think, helps us talk longer about the future. The challenge in thinking about the future is that a lot of people don’t even adequately understand the present moment. People are living in different, informationally living in a different present, not just a different future, but a different present. And how can I pull this in really quick? I had a couple of dinners in New York at Climate Week. Even people in the US are well informed. One of the arguments is like, look at India, India’s emissions are going to go crazy. I was like, India’s emissions from fossil fuels topped last year and were rather flat in the first six months of this year. Like I didn’t know that. It was like, well, I’m not saying you should have known it, but it’s something to know. Let’s put it that way.

I’m very accommodating in terms of what people know and don’t know because we all have areas of focus. We all have things we look at. My motivating pathology is to try to look as broadly as I can across all of these sorts of things. And in so doing, be as useful as I can to everybody in terms of the information.

Doug Lewin (37:04.94)

Yeah, and it’s always worth spending time with. I’m already looking forward to seeing the next iteration. Nat, thank you so much for doing this. Is there anything that I should have asked you that I didn’t or anything else you just wanted to say you didn’t have a chance to yet?

Nat Bullard (37:17.672)

Nope. I’ll drop a couple links in the show notes for everybody. Come take a peek at what we’re doing. Bring your custom curated hand-loaded list of docket IDs if you’re that kind of person directly to Halcyon.io and we will get you sorted out to go and dive in and start looking at what’s there.

[4] Bronwyn Cumbo, ‘Australia is set to get more AI data centres.","The growth of artificial intelligence (AI) is driving profound transformation in global data infrastructure and energy demand. The integration of AI into a range of commercial and industrial products, from refrigerators to virtual assistants, is placing mounting pressure on both domestic and foreign energy networks. With global data centre demand projected to surge 165% by 2030, concerns around the adequacy of existing legal frameworks, energy access, and environmental sustainability have been raised.[1] This article will explore the significant energy demands of AI, the capacity for the NEM and national transmission infrastructure to adapt, and international responses to this evolving demand-side challenge.

What’s the issue with AI’s energy demands?

Data centres are already significant energy consumers, and the rapid uptake of artificial intelligence – particularly generative AI – is accelerating this trend. AI requires immense computational power, placing growing demands on both existing and new data centres. As AI products and services become further embedded in the economy, data centre energy consumption will continue to rise.

Globally, the scale of this demand is striking. For example, ChatGPT alone is estimated to use 39.98 GWh of electricity and 148.28 million litres of water daily for cooling.[2] Meeting the worldwide appetite for AI is projected to require $5.2 trillion in capital expenditure by 2030.[3]

In Australia, data centre development is accelerating. AI-intensive sectors such as finance and telecommunications are driving a substantial surge in demand for high-performance data infrastructure.[4] These facilities require uninterrupted, highly reliable electricity, placing disproportionate pressure on local energy distribution systems. Data centres already consume approximately 4–5% of Australia’s electricity,[5] with projections suggesting this could rise to 8% by 2030.[6]

As the scale and complexity of data centres expand, so too do the regulatory challenges surrounding AI deployment. In response, the Federal Government has introduced the Voluntary AI Safety Standards, encouraging companies to self-regulate across all stages of AI development and implementation.[7] While a positive step, the voluntary nature of these standards leaves room for inconsistency and non-compliance. Introducing mandatory regulations would likely be more effective in ensuring responsible, industry-wide adoption of AI and its supporting infrastructure.

Meeting AI’s growing energy demands will require major investment in both infrastructure and policy reform. Yet AI is evolving rapidly, outpacing the development of domestic and global energy systems. Without timely and consistent investment, energy prices may surge – ultimately leaving consumers to bear the cost of the AI revolution.

International responses

United States of America

The United States has adopted a multi-pronged strategy to manage rising AI-related energy demand, focusing on investment, regulation, and research. Through the Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS and Science Act, the federal government is directing billions of dollars toward grid modernisation, clean energy expansion, and semiconductor manufacturing critical to AI development.[8] The Department of Energy is also conducting assessments on improving data centre efficiency and developing performance standards in light of growing AI workloads.[9] However, the continued viability of these federal programs remains uncertain under the Trump administration, which has expressed a desire to repeal the Biden-era AI and clean energy initiatives.[10] As a global hub for AI, the United States’ regulatory volatility will influence the industry’s future growth.

China

China’s energy generation development and policy has shifted significantly as AI becomes a cornerstone of the digital economy. China has responded to escalating AI energy demand by implementing its “Eastern Data, Western Computing” policy. This police relocates energy intensive computing centres to western provinces with abundant renewable resources.[11] Also, new data centres must meet stringent energy efficiency and carbon intensity benchmarks, with projects failing to comply denied approval. The policy is designed to balance regional development, reduce pressure on eastern urban grids (which trend toward higher residential concentration), and align AI infrastructure with China’s broader dual-carbon goals: peak emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.[12]

Ireland

Ireland is a case study on AI regulation and infrastructural lag. The nation is facing an unprecedented surge in energy consumption from AI and data centre operations. In 2024, data centres accounted for 21% of the nation’s total electricity use, overtaking all urban residential consumption.[13] This rapid growth has raised concerns about energy affordability, grid reliability, and compliance with European climate targets. In response, Ireland’s energy regulator has proposed a policy requiring data centres to match their energy load with equivalent new power generation.[14] This approach shifts the burden of infrastructure expansion – across generation, transmission, and storage – onto developers, effectively making data centre approval contingent on securing additional supply.[15]

Looking Forward

The energy demands of AI are no longer a future challenge but a present and escalating reality. Countries at the forefront of AI adoption are beginning to experiment with policy tools to avoid grid instability, rising costs, and environmental backsliding. Internationally, a clear trend is emerging as governments shift responsibility for infrastructure upgrades onto data centre developers. While the regulatory mechanisms vary, the common goal is to integrate AI into energy systems without compromising grid security or climate targets.

In Australia, a more coherent, enforceable framework is necessary. Current state-federal fragmentation, coupled with voluntary AI guidelines, lacks the clarity and enforceability needed to support long-term planning. Looking ahead, policy reform will likely focus on mandatory emissions reporting, enhanced environmental approval standards, and greater integration of data centre load into national transmission planning. Australia may also consider following international models by linking new data centre approvals to infrastructure contributions or renewable procurement. If the energy transition is to remain viable in an AI-driven economy, legal frameworks will need to evolve just as quickly as the technologies they aim to govern.

A few years ago, oil companies found natural gas off the coast and now plan to drill Colombia's deepest gas wells there.

It's been more than a century since Colombia began drilling for petroleum. But the country's president, Gustavo Petro, wants these wells off the coast to be among Colombia's last.

Petro is one of the world's most outspoken leaders on the need for urgent climate action. Key to his administration's climate agenda is transitioning the country away from fossil fuels, the single-biggest driver of global warming.

In 2023, Petro pledged to stop approving new exploration contracts for oil, gas, and coal. On the world stage, this was a big deal. Colombia is the biggest coal producer in South America and one of the region's largest oil producers. Scientists say that to reach global climate targets, some fossil fuel producers will have to leave oil, gas and coal in the ground. Stopping new fossil fuel exploration is a pivotal step.

Now the question is: how is Colombia's energy transition going?

When it comes to growing its renewable energy sector, the country has made progress, says Margarita Nieves Zárate, director of the Colombian Offshore Wind Research Network, a research group. Meanwhile Colombia's government oil company, Ecopetrol, is continuing its multi-year strategy of diversifying away from oil.

But Colombia's energy transition has also faced obstacles - some external, and some of Petro's own making, says Ana Carolina González Espinosa, senior director at the nonprofit Natural Resource Governance Institute. While Colombia has become a global poster child for saying no to fossil fuels, it isn't such a simple story, González Espinosa says.

""I remember the international community, and especially the climate community, clapping,"" she says. ""But maybe they didn't look at all of the challenges that this government would have to overcome.""

""It is not a happy story, it is not a sad story, it's just a real story,"" she says.

Why Colombia is doing this

Many in Colombia's government see the transition away from fossil fuels not just as good for the climate, but as a prudent economic strategy.

Colombia is not a petrostate with extreme reliance on fossil fuels like its neighbor, Venezuela, is. It has manufacturing and tech industries, agriculture, and a growing tourism sector.

But the oil and coal industries are still critical sources of taxes and export revenues. Demand for fossil fuels is expected to fall over time with the global energy transition, and that poses serious risks for the country, according to a study from insurance broker WTW and the Universidad de los Andes. The study found that if Colombia is too slow in transitioning away from fossil fuels it could face lost economic output equivalent to around 27% of its GDP between now and 2050.

Also, Colombia's oil sector isn't very competitive compared to some regional neighbors, says Guy Edwards, who researches Colombia's energy transition at the University of Sussex. He points to Colombia's declining oil reserves, and how – even before Petro pledged not to award new oil and gas exploration contracts – the country wasn't seen as a great place to find oil. A recent oil industry bright spot was the major gas discovery in the Caribbean, but it's deep and expensive to develop.

"" If we don't think about how to diversify the economy,"" González Espinosa says, ""then we are going to be in trouble.""

Today Colombia's national oil company, Ecopetrol, is diversifying, says Julián Lemos, corporate vice president of strategy and new business at Ecopetrol.

The year before Petro took office, the company acquired an electricity transmission company. In recent years, they've acquired more solar and wind projects. And they're investing in geothermal energy, drilling deep into the earth to create electricity.

""The hydrocarbon business will remain as part of our company,"" Lemos says, ""but we will gradually increase the participation of businesses that are not related to crude oil, such as renewable power, transmission.""

""We need to, as a company, be prepared to lead the country in the transformation of our fuel system. And in the transformation of our energy supply matrix.""

Renewable progress and failures

A key part of Colombia's transition away from fossil fuels is growing the renewable energy sector. Much of that growth has come from solar, says Andrés Camacho, the former minister of mines and energy under Petro.

Solar made up around 9% of the country's total installed power capacity in 2024, according to data from XM, Colombia's electricity market operator. That's up from roughly 1.5% in 2022.

Petro's government has introduced something called ""energy communities,"" funding solar and battery projects for Colombian communities that lack regular electricity. The government is trying to attract international financing for some of these community-scale renewable projects. And the government recently streamlined the environmental licensing process for solar making it more efficient, says Manuel Schulte, chief executive of Colombian renewable developer Colibri Energy.

But Colombia's renewable energy sector has faced challenges. In some parts of Colombia the grid still isn't big enough to handle many of the new renewable projects. And many of Colombia's big wind, solar and transmission projects are on land belonging to indigenous communities. The government and private sector still haven't done enough to involve indigenous groups in planning, Nieves Zárate, the renewable energy researcher, says.

Struggles with local communities are among the reasons why some foreign investors have given up on renewable projects, particularly wind projects. The national oil company, Ecopetrol, has acquired some of these abandoned wind projects.

Losing the messaging fight

Petro's energy transition policies haven't been popular with many Colombians. According to Susana Muhamad, former environment minister in Petro's cabinet, the government often encountered the ""myth,"" she says, that the country's energy transition ""will be an economic hindrance.""

"" The opposite,"" Muhamad says. ""What we see is that making [an energy transition] that is planned will be economically beneficial.""

Edwards says a lot of opposition to Petro's energy transition agenda was stirred up in the Colombian press. His research finds several Colombian newspapers and magazines have mostly framed the pledge not to award new oil and gas contracts as ""disastrous for the Colombian economy.""

Still, González Espinosa thinks Petro's government fumbled the ball on messaging. She says the government didn't focus enough on the local benefits of the energy transition, like how it will help the Colombian economy, and the health advantages of moving away from fossil fuels.

"" They didn't resonate with the national audience,"" González Espinosa says in an email. ""It was all about climate and that argument is not always very easy to sell without connecting it to local realities.""

Looking to the future

Petro's term ends in 2026. Looming over next year's election is a question: Will Petro's policies around stopping fossil fuel expansion outlast his administration?

Colombia's president is a vocal opponent of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a type of oil and gas extraction. Many of the presidential candidates have indicated they'll authorize fracking. While Petro's government has put forward legislation in congress to ban fracking, they haven't been able to get it to a vote.

As for Petro's pledge to stop awarding new exploration contracts for oil, gas, and coal, Estefanny Pardo, mining attorney at Holland & Knight, says a right wing government could reverse it.

""The current government has made a mistake, which is that instead of processing everything as a law to be approved by the congress of the republic, they have issued their own decrees and resolutions that could be repealed or changed by the next government,"" Pardo says in Spanish.

An upcoming conference

Andrés Gómez is Latin America coordinator of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation treaty, an initiative to make a global treaty to phase out fossil fuels. Colombia was one of the first oil-producing countries to join the movement in 2023.

Modeled after treaties to stop nuclear proliferation and landmines, the goal is to create a binding international agreement to stop expanding fossil fuel production.

Next spring, before the country's presidential election, Colombia will host the first international conference for the phase-out of fossil fuels.

If the upcoming conference marks the formal beginning of the treaty-making process, Gómez says in Spanish the incoming Colombian government may still be interested in seeing it through.

""Steps are being taken that have never been taken before.""
