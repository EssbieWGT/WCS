In late December, two environmental organizations, the California Native Plant Society and the Environmental Council of Sacramento, filed a lawsuit against the County of Sacramento for its recent approval of the Coyote Creek Agrivoltaic Ranch project. That initiative, also known as the CCAR, is slated for the rolling hills and grazing lands of eastern Sacramento County between Prairie City SVRA and the Deer Creek Hills Preserve.

The environmental groups cited “numerous deficiencies” in the project’s Final Environmental Impact Report (final EIR), including failure to sufficiently address the potential impacts to two streams that flow into Deer Creek, a tributary of the Cosumnes River and the last Sierra Nevada watershed river without a major storage dam on it. The plaintiffs also pointed to the loss of 3,493 trees from the project that will be incurred from “industrial-level repurposing” of the land.

DESRI, the ownership behind the proposal, describes the Coyote Creek Agrivoltaic Ranch as a “renewable energy project” that will “deliver significant economic and environmental benefits to Sacramento County and the greater region.” DESRI is an investor and operator of renewable energy projects across the United States.

In a statement, DESRI argued that “independent economic modeling” by Economic and Planning Systems has projected that construction activities and related purchases of local goods and services for the agrivoltaic ranch will inject more than $365 million into the Sacramento economy.

“A major share of these benefits will come from the project’s commitment to employ highly trained union labor,” the company stated. “Construction of the solar and battery energy storage system is expected to create up to 350 good-paying jobs during the buildout period.”

William Risse, Director of Development at DESRI, weighed in directly.

“This project represents a significant investment in Sacramento County’s economy,” Risse asserted. “It will support new job creation and a resilient, skilled workforce while generating cost-effective and reliable power for the community.”

The Sacramento Metro Chamber of Commerce is backing the project, with Robert Heidt, the group’s President and CEO, insisting that initiatives like Coyote Creek “deliver lasting value for Sacramento County by generating millions in local investment and supporting hundreds of good-paying jobs.”

However, the environmental plaintiffs had warned county officials ahead of a Sacramento Board of Supervisors vote on Nov. 18 that the project that its final EIR “is so deeply flawed that it is insufficient to support informed decision-making.”

CNPS Conservation Program Director Nick Jensen stands behind that assessment.

“We’re talking about trees dating back to the time of Ghengis Khan and the Middle Ages—destroyed without appropriate due diligence and in conflict with the county’s own plans,” Jensen said, referencing the multiple ways the project is out of compliance with the Sacramento County General Plan.

Environmental Council Policy Analyst Luz Lim echoed Jensen’s concerns.

“This is not a choice between clean energy or irreplaceable habitat,” Luz contended. “We all want and need appropriately planned clean energy for our county, but thanks to other projects underway, SMUD is already on track to fulfill its 2030 Zero Net Carbon Plan. Instead, and ironically, we’re potentially destroying thousands of oaks, which are one of nature’s most powerful tools to trap and sequester carbon.”

Luz added that a single oak can sequester vast amounts of carbon each year and support as many as 300 different types of wildlife, making these native trees a “nature-based solution” to the impacts of climate change.

Some ecologists also use the term “keystone species” to describe oaks, because of their disproportionately large impact on ecosystems.

Critics say that one example of the final EIR’s deficiencies can be found in how it accounts for a 1:1 replacement of oak saplings for each mature oak removed. In contrast, the Sacramento County General Plan calls for one tree seedling for each inch of trunk diameter removed—a total 79,126.40 inches, according to the Arborist’s report for the project.

In a November Sacramento Bee article, U.C. Berkeley integrative biology professor Todd Dawson, said the mitigation is “severely misaligned with the timescale to reestablish ‘mature’ trees and the woodlands they would compose,” and explained that blue oak acorns are hard to grow successfully, and that young trees often die from heat, drought or being eaten by wildlife.

“The project also represents potential and significant ecological impacts to two perennial streams feeding into Deer Creek and ultimately the Cosumnes River; multiple sensitive or endangered species, such as tricolored blackbird, burrowing owl, and American badger,” the plaintiffs argued, “and 25% of the entire known occurrences of the rare western spiked rosinweed.”

Environmental advocates note that concern over the Coyote Creek project has “generated an outpouring” of local activism, including hundreds of people showing up for the November Board of Supervisors vote. More than 150 people spoke at the meeting, and more than 900 provided written comments, with 95% of them opposed to the project.”

“Destroying high quality intact habitat that is home to some of the highest biodiversity and highest capacity for carbon sequestration in the county is unacceptable and sets a dangerous precedent for future development,” said Carol Witham, an ecologist and representative of the local CNPS Sacramento Valley Chapter. “One of the largest threats to biodiversity is climate change, the approval of projects like this makes efforts to reduce this threat a threat of its own.”",https://sacramento.newsreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lawsuit.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 10:58:57.843040

This includes Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, a massive 2.6 gigawatt project that would help supply the huge data center market in northern Virginia.","Democratic Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders and right-wing Gov. Ron DeSantis agree on virtually nothing. But they found common ground this year as leading skeptics of the artificial intelligence industry's data center boom.

The alignment of two national figures on the left and right signals that a political reckoning is brewing over the AI industry's impact on electricity prices, grid stability and the labor market. The opposition could slow the industry's development plans if it reaches a broad bipartisan consensus.

Sanders, I-VT, has called for a national moratorium on data center construction.

""Frankly, I think you've got to slow this process down,"" Sanders told CNN in a Dec. 28 interview. ""It's not good enough for the oligarchs to tell us it's coming — you adapt. What are they talking about? They're going to guarantee healthcare to all people? What are they going to do when people have no jobs?""

Florida Gov. DeSantis unveiled an AI bill of rights on Dec. 4 that would protect local communities' right to block data center construction among other provisions. The staunch Republican's proposal could run afoul of the White House, which is pushing to scale up AI as quickly as possible. President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Dec. 11 to prevent ""excessive state regulation"" of AI.

""We have a limited grid. You do not have enough grid capacity in the United States to do what they're trying to do,"" DeSantis said of the AI industry's data center plans at an event in The Villages, Florida.

""As more and more information has gotten out, do you want a hyperscale data center in The Villages? Yes or no,"" the governor asked. ""I think most people would say they don't want it.""

DeSantis is finishing out his second term as Florida's governor and his future political ambitions are unclear. Sanders has said his fourth term as Vermont's senator will likely be his last.

Florida and Vermont are not major data center states. But rising utility bills played a key role in the landslide victory of Democrat Abigail Spanberger in the governor's race this year in Virginia, the world's largest data center market.

Residential electricity prices are forecast to rise another 4% on average nationwide in 2026 after increasing about 5% in 2025, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.

With cost of living at the center of American politics, the impact of data centers on local communities will likely play a role in the mid-term elections next November.

""We have gone from a period where data centers were sort of seen as an unmitigated good and as an engine of growth by a lot of elected officials and policymakers to people now recognizing that we're short,"" said Abe Silverman, who served as general counsel for the public utility board in New Jersey from 2019 until 2023 under Democrat Gov. Phil Murphy.

""We do not have enough generation to reliably serve existing customers and data centers,"" Silverman said.

The shortage is most acute on the nation's largest grid, PJM Interconnection, where data center demand is pushing the system to a tipping point. The grid will be six gigawatts short of its reliability requirement by 2027, according to PJM.

The power shortage is nearly equivalent to the electricity demand of Philadelphia, Silverman said. This makes blackouts more likely, he said. ""Instead of a blackout happening every one in 10 years, we're looking at something more often,"" the analyst said.

""It's at a crisis stage right now. PJM has never been this short,"" said Joe Bowring, president of Monitoring Analytics, which serves as the independent market monitor for PJM.

PJM Interconnection serves more than 65 million people across 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. It includes pivotal swing states for the mid-term elections like Pennsylvania and Virginia.

The price to secure power capacity in PJM has exploded in recent years with $23 billion attributable to data centers, according to watchdog Monitoring Analytics. Those costs are ultimately passed on to consumers. This amounts to a ""massive wealth transfer,"" the watchdog told PJM in a November letter.

""I don't think we've seen the end of the political repercussions,"" said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm.

""And with a lot more elections in 2026 than 2025, we'll see a lot of implications,"" Gramlich said. ""Every politician is going to be saying that they have the answer to affordability and their opponents' policies would raise rates.""

The shortage will be exacerbated by Trump's recent decision to pause all offshore wind farms under construction off the East Coast, Silverman said. This includes Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, a massive 2.6 gigawatt project that would help supply the huge data center market in northern Virginia.

""By stopping a project that had line of sight to coming online in the very near future, you are directly increasing the prices that we all pay for electricity and not by a little bit,"" Silverman said. ""That's a huge, huge additional hole that we now have to dig out of.""

Data centers are facing pushback on multiple fronts now. The PJM watchdog has called for the grid to reject data centers that it does not have the power to serve or require them to bring their own generation. Virginia's utility regulator is now requiring data centers to pay a majority of the cost of new transmission and generation that serves them beginning in 2027.

Data center developers next year will likely start moving to build more power plants onsite, called co-location, as they struggle to secure supply on the grid quickly, said Brian Fitzsimons, CEO of GridUnity, a company that uses software to help utilities navigate connection requests.

But Silverman said ""co-location"" has problems that will also face political scrutiny.

""Co-location is effectively taking a generator off the market,"" he said. ""It would be unethical to end up with a situation where data centers are able to buy private power plants that expose the rest of us to a greater chance of blackouts.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108234669-1764617288677-gettyimages-2229069495-DATA_CENTERS.jpeg?v=1766057941&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2026-01-01 10:12:55.173060

And in New Jersey and Virginia, Democrats “who are by no means radical leftists” ran successful campaigns focused on lowering utility costs, O’Hanlon said.
“We see them as real protagonists in the fight for what we [at the Climate and Community Institute] are calling ‘green economic populism,’” said Rithika Ramamurthy, communications director at the leftwing climate thinktank Climate and Community Institute.
And tenants’ unions are working to green their residences while protecting renters from climate disasters and rising bills, Ramamurthy said.
“The administration was great on connecting jobs and green energy,” she said.","A group of progressive politicians and advocates are reframing emissions-cutting measures as a form of economic populism as the Trump administration derides climate policy as a “scam” and fails to deliver on promises to tame energy costs and inflation.

Climate politics were once cast as a test of moral resolve, calling on Americans to accept higher costs to avert environmental catastrophe, but that ignores how rising temperatures themselves drive up costs for working people, said Stevie O’Hanlon, co-founder of the youth-led Sunrise Movement.

“People increasingly understand how climate and costs of living are tied together,” she said.

Utility bills and healthcare costs are climbing as extreme weather intensifies. Public transit systems essential to climate goals are reeling from federal funding cuts. Rents are rising as landlords pass along costs of inefficient buildings, higher insurance and disaster repairs, turning climate risk into a monthly surcharge. Meanwhile, wealth inequality is surging under an administration that took record donations from big oil.

“We need to connect climate change to the everyday economic reality we are all facing in this country,” said O’Hanlon.

Progressive politicians have embraced that notion. Zohran Mamdani, New York City’s democratic socialist mayor-elect, has advanced affordability-first climate policies such as free buses to reduce car use, and a plan to make schools more climate-resilient. Seattle’s socialist mayor-elect, Katie Wilson, says she will boost social housing while pursuing green retrofits.

Maine’s US Senate hopeful Graham Platner is pairing calls to rein in polluters and protect waterways with a critique of oligarchic politics. In Nebraska, independent US Senate candidate Dan Osborn backs right-to-repair laws that let farmers and consumers fix equipment – an approach he doesn’t frame as climate policy, but one that climate advocates say could reduce emissions from manufacturing. And in New Jersey and Virginia, Democrats “who are by no means radical leftists” ran successful campaigns focused on lowering utility costs, O’Hanlon said.

Movements nationwide are also working to cut emissions while building economic power. Chicago’s teachers’ union secured a contract requiring solar panels to be added to schools and creating clean-energy career pathways for students. Educators’ unions in Los Angeles and Minneapolis are also seeking to improve conditions for staff and students while decarbonizing.

“We see them as real protagonists in the fight for what we [at the Climate and Community Institute] are calling ‘green economic populism,’” said Rithika Ramamurthy, communications director at the leftwing climate thinktank Climate and Community Institute.

From Maine to Texas, organized labor is also pushing for a unionized workforce to decarbonize energy and buildings. And tenants’ unions are working to green their residences while protecting renters from climate disasters and rising bills, Ramamurthy said. From Connecticut to California, they are fighting for eviction protections, which can prevent post-disaster displacement and empower tenants to demand green upgrades. Some are also directly advocating for climate-friendly retrofits.

Movements are also working to expand public ownership energy, which proponents say can strengthen democratic control and lower rates by eliminating shareholder profits. In New York, a coalition won a 2023 policy directing the state-owned utility to build renewable energy with a unionized workforce, and advocates are pursuing a consumer-owned utility in Maine and a public takeover of the local utility in Baltimore.

To hold polluters accountable for their climate contributions, activists and lawmakers across the country are championing policies that would force them to help pay to curb emissions and boost resilience. Vermont and New York passed such “climate superfund” laws this year, while New York and Maine are expected to vote on such measures soon. And legislators in other states are looking to introduce or reintroduce bills in 2026, even as the Trump administration attempts to kill the laws.

“When insurance becomes unaffordable and states are constantly rebuilding after disasters, people don’t need some technical explanation to know that something is seriously wrong,” said Cassidy DiPaola, spokesperson for the Make Polluters Pay campaign. “Climate superfunds connect those costs to accountability by saying that the companies that caused the damage shouldn’t be shielded from paying for it.” Polls show the bills appear popular, she said.

Speaking to people’s financial concerns can help build support for climate policy, said DiPaola. Polls show voters support accountability measures against polluters and that most believe the climate crisis is driving up costs of living.

“The fastest way to depolarize climate is to simply talk about who’s paying and who’s profiting,” she said. “People disagree about a lot of things, but they do understand being ripped off.”

Linking green initiatives with economic concerns isn’t new. It was central to the Green New Deal, popularized by the Sunrise Movement and politicians like the representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in 2018. That push informed Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which included the biggest climate investments in US history. But critics argue the IRA fell short of building economic power among ordinary people.

Though it boosted green manufacturing and created some 400,000 new jobs, those benefits were not tangible to most Americans, said Ramamurthy. Proposed investments in housing and public transit – which may have been more visible – were scaled back in the final package. Its incentives also largely went to private companies and wealthier households. A 2024 poll found only 24% of registered voters thought the IRA helped them.

“The IRA focused on creating incentives for capital, relying almost entirely on carrots with very few sticks,” said Ramamurthy.

While it advanced renewables, the IRA also contained handouts for polluters, O’Hanlon said. And Biden did not pair its passage with messaging acknowledging economic hardship, she said.

“The administration was great on connecting jobs and green energy,” she said. “But they said the economy was doing well, which felt out of touch.”

Trump capitalized on Americans’ economic anxieties, said O’Hanlon, but has not offered them relief.

“We need a vision that can actually combat the narrative Trump has been putting out,” she said. “We need a vision for addressing the climate crisis alongside making life better for for working people.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63c31ba1ccf48119ca7a861af1e53e9331976f7a/232_0_2501_2000/master/2501.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7c6c4eb8cb6e7610eddee3d5d03b35c5",N,,2026-01-01 10:59:02.368022

The result is a market narrative that feels split: value investors see a cheap industrial cash machine, while growth investors are still waiting to be convinced that GM can credibly rival Tesla and the fast?moving Chinese EV players.

Market Pulse: Price, Trend and Technical Setting

According to real?time quotes from Yahoo Finance and cross?checked against Google Finance and Reuters, General Motors Co stock last closed at approximately 36.50 US dollars per share in the final trading session before the new year. Intraday data for the current session was not yet available at the time of research, so this last close is the operative reference point. Over the past five trading days, the stock has drifted modestly lower, giving back part of the strong rally it enjoyed earlier in the quarter.

Over this recent five?day stretch, GM shares have traded in a relatively tight band between roughly the mid?36s and just under 38 dollars, with two small down days outweighing a couple of hesitant rebounds. The short?term tape suggests some profit taking after a sharp move up in the prior weeks, rather than an outright collapse in conviction. Volume has cooled from the spike seen around major news on labor costs and Cruise, pointing to a short consolidation rather than panic selling.

Stepping back to a 90?day view, the stock is still comfortably in positive territory versus its early?autumn levels. GM has climbed from the high?20s to the mid?30s, helped by upbeat guidance revisions, aggressive share buybacks and the market’s broader pivot toward cyclical and value names as rate?cut hopes crept back into the macro narrative. The 52?week range crystallizes just how bruising the earlier part of the year was: the stock’s low sat around the high?20s, while its 52?week high reached into the low?40s. Trading in the mid?30s today leaves GM below the top of that range, but well off its trough, encapsulating a story of partial recovery with lingering skepticism.

One-Year Investment Performance

An investor who bought General Motors Co stock exactly one year ago at roughly 34.00 US dollars per share, and held through all the strikes, EV headlines and Cruise turbulence, would now be sitting on a modest gain with the stock around 36.50. That equates to a price return of about 7 to 8 percent, before any dividends. It is hardly the stuff of meme?stock legend, but in a year when auto names were routinely whipsawed by supply chain concerns, regulatory noise and demand jitters, it represents a quietly respectable outcome.

The emotional journey, however, was far from calm. At various points in the past twelve months, GM traded deep in the red versus that entry price, especially during the height of labor disputes and after high?profile setbacks at Cruise. For an investor, staying invested required a strong stomach and a clear thesis that GM’s cash?generating truck and SUV core could shoulder the weight of ambitious EV and software spending. Those who did not flinch are now modestly ahead, and if dividends are factored in, the total return looks slightly better than the bare share price suggests.

Still, the opportunity cost question lingers. Compared with the soaring returns in parts of the tech sector or niche EV winners during their hottest stretches, GM’s one?year payoff feels subdued. That contrast fuels an ongoing debate: is GM a patient investor’s compounding story in disguise, or is it fundamentally capped by its capital intensity and the political and regulatory headwinds facing the traditional auto industry?

Recent Catalysts and News

In the past few days, the GM news flow has been less about headline?grabbing product launches and more about execution details and cleanup operations in its advanced tech portfolio. After pausing most operations at Cruise following a high?profile pedestrian incident and regulatory scrutiny, GM has been busy reshaping the unit’s leadership and strategy. Fresh reporting from Reuters and other outlets pointed to leadership changes at Cruise and an intensified focus on safety culture and phased redeployment, signaling a desire to preserve the long?term autonomous opportunity while staunching reputational and financial damage in the near term.

Earlier in the week, investor attention gravitated toward GM’s capital allocation posture. Management has continued to signal commitment to sizeable share repurchases and a gradually more generous dividend, supported by robust profitability in its North American truck and SUV business. Commentary from financial media such as Bloomberg and CNBC highlighted how GM is trying to reassure shareholders that, despite rising labor costs following the latest union agreements, it can sustain healthy margins and return capital without derailing its multibillion?dollar EV roadmap.

At the product level, the latest stories have underscored a tactical recalibration rather than a wholesale retreat from EVs. Reports referenced GM’s decision to pace some EV launches and adjust production schedules, especially for higher?end models, in response to more cautious demand signals and a fiercely competitive pricing environment. This has been framed as an attempt to avoid overbuilding inventory and discounting too aggressively, even as the company pushes ahead with its Ultium battery platform and broadens its lineup from premium trucks and SUVs into more mass?market segments.

There has also been ongoing coverage of GM’s software and services strategy, from incremental over?the?air feature monetization to the evolution of subscription?based offerings. While none of these updates individually moved the stock dramatically in recent sessions, they collectively feed into the narrative that GM is trying to pivot from a purely hardware?driven business model toward a more recurring?revenue, data?driven ecosystem, even if investors continue to demand proof that these ambitions can materially shift the valuation needle.

Wall Street Verdict & Price Targets

Over the past month, several major investment banks have updated their views on General Motors Co, and their verdict skews cautiously constructive. Research notes from firms such as Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan and Bank of America, referenced in summaries on financial portals like Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch, generally carry Buy or Overweight ratings, with 12?month price targets clustered in the low to mid?40s. Relative to the current share price around 36.50, that implies double?digit upside if management can execute on its promises.

J.P. Morgan’s analysts, for example, have emphasized GM’s attractive earnings multiple compared with both the broader market and the automotive peer group, arguing that the stock discounts overly dire scenarios around EV profitability and ongoing labor cost inflation. Goldman Sachs has framed GM as a cyclical value play with embedded real options in EVs and autonomous driving, suggesting that even if those long?dated options do not fully pay off, investors are still buying a solid truck?led cash engine at a discount.

Not all commentary is unqualified praise. Some European houses, including Deutsche Bank, have maintained more neutral stances, with Hold or equivalent ratings. Their reservations often center on execution risk in scaling Ultium production, the pace of consumer EV adoption in a higher?rate environment and the uncertain trajectory of Cruise’s regulatory landscape. They also highlight that GM’s earnings remain highly concentrated in North America and especially in full?size pickup and SUV segments, leaving the company vulnerable if that profit pool comes under pressure.

Across these voices, a consensus picture emerges: Wall Street is not in love with GM, but it is increasingly willing to own it at the right price. The stock is largely framed as undervalued relative to its cash flow, with analysts eyeing potential upside from continued buybacks, margin defense in core trucks and incremental progress on EV and software monetization. At the same time, most research flags clear downside risks if EV margins disappoint further or if Cruise becomes a deeper financial drain than currently modeled.

Future Prospects and Strategy

General Motors Co today is a hybrid of old?school Detroit metal and next?generation mobility ambition. At its core, the company still makes its money from selling high?margin pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers in North America, supported by a global but more volatile portfolio of brands. That legacy business throws off the cash needed to fund an aggressive pivot toward electric vehicles based on the Ultium battery platform, along with investments in software, connectivity and autonomous driving via Cruise and other initiatives.

In the coming months, the market will be watching three strategic levers. First is EV execution: can GM ramp production reliably, control warranty and quality issues, and bring battery costs down fast enough to preserve margins while still pricing competitively against Tesla and ambitious Chinese rivals? Second is cost discipline: after the recent union agreements, investors will scrutinize whether GM can offset higher labor expenses through efficiencies, mix management and disciplined capital spending. Third is credibility in high?tech bets: the company needs to show that Cruise can eventually return to controlled, safe growth and that in?vehicle software and services can create recurring revenue rather than being seen as a cost center.

If GM can thread that needle, the current share price could mark a staging ground for a more durable rerating, as the market begins to treat it less like a shrinking combustion?engine incumbent and more like a cash?rich transition story. However, if EV demand softens further, if regulatory scrutiny on autonomous driving intensifies or if a macro slowdown hits U.S. truck demand, the stock could slide back toward the lower end of its 52?week range. For now, GM remains a nuanced proposition: a value?tilted stock with cyclical sensitivity and high?beta optionality in EVs and autonomy, asking investors to balance healthy present?day profits against a future that is still very much under construction.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2404989_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 10:59:11.267962

The president’s pursuit of energy dominance – despite the U.S. producing record levels of energy in 2024 – and his declaration of a widely disputed energy emergency sparked concerns among environmentalists and supporters of clean energy.

These moves also brought movement in the battle against Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline, the state’s efforts to move away from coal power and encouraged the build out of data centers – which have faced widespread pushback from communities throughout the state.

With those stories in mind, the Advance is looking back on its biggest environmental stories of 2025.

______________________________________________________________________________________________

Data centers draw the ire of residents across the state

As a state law offering tax breaks on data center construction and equipment took effect earlier this year, tech companies are flocking to Michigan in hopes of building out additional facilities to advance artificial intelligence development while communities are increasingly pushing back against these projects.

In the past month, frustration from residents against the lack of transparency into many of these deals – with local officials and landowners bound by non-disclosure agreements – has hit a fever pitch with a few hundred residents gathering at the Michigan Capitol in Lansing to push back against these developments.

While regulations specific to data centers are limited to the conditions for receiving the tax break, lawmakers are stepping up to address their constituents’ concerns, with a bipartisan group of House representatives introducing legislation to repeal the tax breaks for these resource-intensive facilities.

Another group of lawmakers in the Senate has put forth regulations to bar entities withdrawing above an average of 2,000,000 gallons of water per day for consumptive use from obtaining a water withdrawal permit, require the Michigan Public Service Commission to publish reports on data centers’ energy and water use and ensure residents don’t bear the cost of upgrading water systems to serve these facilities.

Line 5 lawsuits continue as U.S. Army Corps of Engineers expedites review of tunnel project

Following a years-long legal battle over whether Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s case to remove Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline from the Great Lakes should be heard in state or federal courts, the case returned to the Ingham County’s 30th Judicial Circuit Court in Lansing at the start of the year.

The United States Supreme Court has also agreed to hear an appeal of the decision that sent the case back to Michigan in the first place.

Additionally, attorneys for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the director of the Department of Natural Resources have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review whether the state is immune from legal action for its decision to revoke Enbridge’s easement to operate the pipeline on the bottomlands of the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Huron and Lake Michigan meet.

A decision to take up this case could carry even further weight, with a federal judge barring the state from enforcing its notice terminating Enbridge’s easement to operate Line 5 on the bottomlands of the Great Lakes.

In yet another legal challenge before the Michigan Supreme Court, justices agreed to review whether the Michigan Public Service Commission – which oversees siting matters for pipelines within the state – erred in its decision to issue one of the permits needed for Enbridge to begin construction on its tunnel project.

The state’s highest court will hear two challenges, one filed by FLOW Water Advocates, and another filed by the Bay Mills Indian Community, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, and Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi. That case also includes several clean water and environmental advocates as plaintiffs, including the Michigan Climate Action Network and the Environmental Law & Policy Center.

Opponents argue the commission failed to make determinations required by the Michigan Environmental Protection Act, had improperly excluded evidence while considering the permit and failed to consider alternatives to the pipeline outside of the Straits of Mackinac.

Additionally, the Army Corps of Engineers’ long awaited environmental impact statement assessing the plan to replace the two segments of pipeline located in the Straits with a new segment placed in a tunnel embedded into the bedrock beneath the lake was issued in May.

An executive order issued by the Trump Administration in January has also permitted the project’s environmental review to move forward under a shortened timeline.

EPA lifts emergency order on Flint water, residents mark milestones on lead line replacement

More than 11 years after the beginning of the Flint Water Crisis, the United States Environmental Protection Agency lifted its emergency order on the city’s drinking water, which was put in place in 2016.

However, community members were quick to note that the decision, which came alongside the end of the city’s lead line replacement program, does not mean that the city’s pipes are lead free.

While Flint and the state of Michigan have met their obligations under a 2017 settlement requiring them to replace all lead lines in the city, several hundreds of pipes remain in vacant homes. Additionally, not all residents have agreed to have their homes checked or their pipes replaced.

The city is required by law to replace all lead lines in the coming years. Residents who need their lead lines replaced can call 810-410-1133, or email GetTheLeadOut@cityofflint.com.

The city’s recovery could also be hampered by a loss in funding, as Michigan House Republicans voted to eliminate $8.3 million in funding to support services across the city, as the water crisis continues to impact residents and children.

Palisades nuclear plant returns to operating status

In West Michigan, the first nuclear plant restart in the nation has entered its final phase, with plans to bring two small modular reactors online at the same site.

While the plant has not yet returned to energy production, it has been cleared to bring new fuel on site.

However, a host of anti-nuclear groups continue to raise concerns about the safety of the restart, with a trio of organizations filing a federal lawsuit arguing the plant is legally barred from resuming operations after entering decommissioning status.

Energy emergency draws challenge from Michigan AG

Since its issuance on Jan. 20, the Trump Administration’s energy emergency order has drawn criticism from environmentalists across the nation, alongside a legal challenge from Michigan’s attorney general.

Despite record breaking energy production in 2024, the Trump administration has proclaimed the nation’s energy resources to be insufficient, though Nessel and Democratic attorneys general from 14 other states are arguing the order is unlawful.

In the lawsuit, the attorneys general argues the president’s powers are reserved for actual emergencies, and that the administration’s move to fast track permits for several activities tied to energy production undermine the rights of the states.

Alongside fast tracking the environmental review of the Line 5 tunnel project, the Trump Administration has used the order as a justification to repeatedly extend operations at a West Michigan Coal plant that was slated to close at the end of May.

According to the plant’s owner, Consumers Energy, keeping the plant online has cost the company $80 million between the initial extension issued on May 23, and Sept. 30. The latest extension, issued on Nov. 18, will keep the plant operating through Feb. 17, 2026. Nessel has challenged the extension.

Trump commits to supporting project to keep invasive carp out of the Great Lakes

A decades-long project aimed at keeping invasive carp from establishing a foothold in the Great Lakes, secured support from the White House in May, following efforts from the Whitmer administration to ensure the project would receive funding allocated under former President Joe Biden’s administration.

The $1.15 billion dollar project, which secured its first construction contract in December 2024, is a joint effort sponsored by Michigan, Illinois and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The project targets a critical choke point near Joliet, Ill., instituting a series of deterrents to keep invasive carp and other nuisance species out of the Great Lakes.

The Michigan Department of Natural Resources warns that the carp could outcompete native species and greatly harm the ecology and economy of the entire Great Lakes region – including rivers and inland lakes – alongside the region’s $20 billion fishing and boating industries.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-86/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dsc_0417-1024x6831767269007.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=EhQYPlYi,N,,2026-01-01 08:14:25.733685

As 2026 begins, data and market trends reveal a turning point, from early adoption to mainstream momentum. What do the numbers really say about India's EV drive?

Passenger Vehicle Boom Continues

India's electric passenger vehicle segment saw record growth in 2025, clocking over 1.6 lakh units sold between January and November, a 78 percent year-on-year surge. Leading automakers like Tata Motors, JSW-MG Motor, and Mahindra & Mahindra continued to shape this fast-evolving segment.

Globally, electric mobility maintained its upward curve, China achieved 50 percent EV penetration in auto sales, and worldwide, one in four vehicles sold was electric. Interestingly, emerging markets such as Thailand and Vietnam outpaced several advanced economies, even as Europe faced headwinds due to subsidy cuts and rising costs. The EU is reportedly rethinking its 2035 gasoline vehicle ban, showing how dynamic the global EV landscape now is.

Two-Wheelers Hit a Temporary Slowdown

On the two-wheeler front, the momentum slowed toward the end of 2025. A recent GST overhaul made traditional internal combustion commuter motorcycles cheaper, prompting a short-term slump in EV demand.

According to industry data, sales fell from around 1.43 lakh units in October to nearly 1.17 lakh in November, following a strong run earlier in the year. Still, market leaders such as TVS, Bajaj, Ather Energy, and Hero MotoCorp remain optimistic, especially as EV penetration in two-wheelers crossed the 5 percent mark in 2025, a significant milestone for the sector.

Launch Wave Keeps EV Buzz Alive

Manufacturers were relentless through 2025, introducing a slew of new products to maintain excitement and encourage wider adoption. From design innovations to improved range and performance, the competition intensified across price segments.

Major automakers, Mahindra, Tata Motors, and Hyundai, led from the front, while global EV giants like VinFast and Tesla signalled renewed confidence with their India plans. In 2026, analysts expect electric passenger vehicle penetration to hit double digits, driven by expanding model portfolios and enhanced charging availability.

The Road Ahead: Premium And Local

The two-wheeler space is now headed for a premium turn. Upcoming launches from Royal Enfield, Yamaha, and Ultraviolette promise to bring performance-oriented choices to the segment. Meanwhile, Maruti Suzuki's long-awaited e-Vitara is expected to enter the market soon, marking its first step into the EV space.

Other brands like Hyundai, Honda, and Volkswagen are set to ramp up their electric portfolios, further intensifying competition among domestic and global players.

Policy Push Powers Local Manufacturing

India's EV growth is being bolstered by strong government programs. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme continues to boost local manufacturing of advanced automotive components, while the PM e-Drive initiative is incentivising electric two and three-wheelers, buses, and public charging networks.

Major investments from Tata Group, Ola Electric, and Suzuki are shaping India's EV battery manufacturing ecosystem, with large-scale lithium-ion gigafactories already under development. This domestic manufacturing focus is poised to cut dependence on imports and push technological innovation further.

Mainstream Moment Ahead

EV ownership in India is no longer a novelty. Lower running costs, zero tailpipe emissions, and peppy urban performance are drawing more buyers into the fold. With battery prices stabilizing and charging infrastructure expanding rapidly across metros and highways, 2026 could be the year electric mobility turns truly mainstream.","https://c.ndtvimg.com/2026-01/cui0l79c_ev-rep_625x300_01_January_26.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=800",N,,2026-01-01 07:57:40.713181

The EPA’s National Recycling Strategy identifies access gaps in underserved regions as key obstacles to achieving national recycling goals.","Despite decades of environmental policy and public awareness initiatives, recycling access in the United States remains highly uneven. While many urban centers benefit from established infrastructure for materials recovery and recycling, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reports that a large share of rural and economically underserved communities lacks practical access to recycling services. This disparity undermines national sustainability goals and limits the economic potential of recovered materials.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the national recycling rate for plastics has stagnated at approximately 8.7, and most mixed plastics—especially resin types #3 through #7—are rarely recovered for reuse or remanufacture. Meanwhile, the National Academies’ Municipal Solid Waste Recycling in the United States report indicates that that could be recycled are instead lost due to insufficient regional infrastructure, prohibitive transport costs, and lack of accessible local processing capacity. These structural deficiencies result in millions of tons of recyclable waste being sent to landfills each year rather than being transformed into economically valuable products.

This access gap is particularly acute in the southeastern and midwestern United States, where counties often lack the population density and economic base necessary to support traditional recycling facilities. Such disparities reflect not a lack of public willingness to recycle but rather the absence of accessible, cost-effective processing options.

Why Traditional Recycling Models Don’t Work Everywhere

Traditional material recovery facilities (MRFs) operate on centralized models that depend on large, consistent volumes of feedstock, proximity to population centers, and substantial capital investment. These conditions tend to be met in large metropolitan areas but rarely in rural or economically distressed regions.

Several structural constraints challenge centralized recycling models:

Low population density diminishes the economies of scale needed to justify fixed facilities.

Long hauling distances raise the cost of transporting waste to distant MRFs, often exceeding the value of the recyclables themselves.

Limited municipal budgets restrict the ability of smaller jurisdictions to co-finance or maintain recycling infrastructure.

Lengthy permitting and construction timelines delay project deployment and raise overall costs.

These dynamics mean that even communities with a strong desire to participate in recycling are often unable to do so, not because they lack interest, but because existing systems are simply economically and logistically impractical for them.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has noted that expanding centralized facilities alone will not close the recycling access gap, [LINK ADDED] particularly for plastics and other hard-to-recycle materials.

What Decentralized and Mobile Recycling Models Offer

In the United States, a real-world example of decentralized recycling is the Mobile PET Plastic Ocean Waste Recycler pilot in Alaska. Developed with support from USDA NIFA SBIR and EPA SBIR programs, the project resulted in a transportable recycling unit deployed in multiple Alaskan communities. While the project concluded at the pilot stage without confirmed large-scale commercialization, it demonstrated the practical feasibility of mobile, community-level plastic recycling in regions lacking centralized infrastructure.

Mobile systems are generally modular and scalable, incorporating equipment for sorting, cleaning, and processing recyclable materials into usable forms.

For plastics #3 through #7, this might include recycling mixed waste to make construction products such as paving tiles, modular building components, or feedstock for secondary manufacturing.

The operational advantages of mobile recycling include:

Flexibility to serve multiple jurisdictions with a single unit,

Lower capital barriers compared to fixed infrastructure,

Adaptive deployment responding to local demand and seasonal changes,

Direct integration with existing municipal or commercial waste flows.

These characteristics make decentralized recycling especially suited to regions with variable waste volumes and limited access to conventional MRFs.

Environmental and Economic Benefits of Decentralized Recycling

Decentralized recycling models create measurable environmental and economic impacts. Environmentally, localized recycling reduces landfill dependence and associated greenhouse gas emissions from long-distance waste transport. Diverting plastics from landfills helps preserve limited landfill airspace and supports broader sustainability goals outlined in federal strategies like the EPA’s National Recycling Strategy.

Economically, mobile recycling expands local market activity by:

Creating jobs in operations, logistics, and materials handling;

Retaining material value within regional economies instead of exporting raw waste;

Supporting downstream industries that utilize recycled feedstocks;

Reducing long-term waste management costs for municipalities.

The analytical framework used by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), particularly the Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II), underscores how infrastructure investments generate direct, indirect, and induced economic impacts at the local and state levels. By enabling localized recycling capacity, decentralized models help catalyze these regional economic multipliers.

For example, a mobile unit capable of processing approximately 1,000 tons of mixed plastics annually contributes to waste diversion, local employment, and supply chain development without the need for extensive fixed facilities.

Practical Actions Communities Can Take

Local action is critical to lead national policy toward a distributed, effective recycling solution. Talk to your local representatives about projects that can set the example for the nation.

Pilot programs for mobile recycling units in areas identified as underserved or economically distressed.

Public–private partnerships to mitigate investment risks and share operational responsibilities.

Regional collaborations where clusters of counties share mobile units and associated infrastructure.

Integration with local industry by using recycled products in public works and construction projects.

Tapping state and federal resources, including EPA grants and programs authorized under the Recycling Infrastructure and Accessibility Act (RIAA), which emphasize accessibility in addition to capacity.

These steps allow communities to test and refine systems based on empirical data and demand, rather than speculative large-scale investments.

Why Decentralized Recycling Models Will Matter More in the Future

Federal policy momentum reflects a growing recognition of the limitations of traditional recycling infrastructure. The EPA’s National Recycling Strategy identifies access gaps in underserved regions as key obstacles to achieving national recycling goals. The Recycling Infrastructure and Accessibility Act similarly highlights the need for flexible, distributed solutions to meet evolving recycling targets.

As recycling goals rise nationally, such as the EPA’s target of a 50 percent recycling rate by 2030—mobile and decentralized models will become increasingly important. These systems are not intended to replace established MRFs but to complement them by closing geographic and economic gaps.

Steps Forward

The United States faces a structural recycling challenge: millions of tons of material that could be recycled are lost annually because existing infrastructure fails to serve large portions of the country. The problem is not one of public behavior but of system design.

Decentralized and mobile recycling models provide a practical, economically grounded solution to this challenge. By bringing processing capacity directly to underserved regions, these systems reduce landfill dependence, support local economies, and foster resilient regional supply chains. As national recycling goals evolve, flexible, scalable infrastructure solutions will play a central role in ensuring equitable recycling access and advancing sustainability

From the Poconos to the Jersey Shore to the mouth of the Delaware Bay, what do you want to know about climate change? What would you like us to cover? Get in touch.

New Jersey is investing nearly $11 million to restore coastal salt marshes, including a major project at Scotch Bonnet Island in Cape May County.

Tidal salt marshes mitigate the effects of incoming waves and reduce flooding in the area, while storing climate-changing carbon. Birds, reptiles and fish also rely on these wetlands to survive and thrive.

But tidal salt marshes are drowning as they face rapidly rising sea level at a rate faster than they can handle. As a result, the marsh grasses are growing more slowly and are being replaced by mudflats.

Since the 1950s, the marshes of Scotch Bonnet Island have lost more than 30% of their surface area to deluge. In the last five years, the salt marsh trail has flooded on average almost 70 times each year.

A new $2.7 million state grant will help the Wetlands Institute in Stone Harbor restore tidal wetland vegetation at Scotch Bonnet Island to address the impacts of sea level rise.

“As you increase storm impacts and reduce marshes, it’s a double whammy,” said Lenore Tedesco, executive director of the institute. “Maintaining these nature-based solutions or natural features that are supporting us and helping us is really going to be important.”

Scotch Bonnet Island is one of three sites to receive funding from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection totaling almost $11 million.

The grants are part of the state’s Natural Climate Solutions program, which aims to mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration has dedicated more than $54 million to the program, which is funded through the state’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.

The most recent round of funding includes $3 million to help Montclair State University plant 910 trees to sequester carbon and filter air and water pollutants. Another $5 million will help Stafford Township in Ocean County restore 23 acres of tidal salt marsh.

“New Jersey communities are harnessing nature-based solutions to restore and protect the integrity of coastal and forest ecosystems which serve as critical carbon sinks that reduce our greenhouse gas emissions,” DEP Commissioner Shawn LaTourette said in a statement. “These investments also improve natural buffers such as wetlands and urban forests that protect communities and infrastructure from flooding and increasingly more severe storm impacts as a result of our changing climate.”

The Wetlands Institute, in partnership with the Borough of Avalon, will use the grant to raise the salt marsh trail at Scotch Bonnet Island by about 2 to 3 feet. The institute will also replant the area with hundreds of native marsh vegetation and restore nesting habitat for diamondback terrapins and coastal birds.

The funding comes as the Environmental Protection Agency proposes changes to the definition of “waters of the United States” that would limit the types of waterways protected under the Clean Water Act.

The change would codify a 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision that removed federal protections for wetlands that are either seasonal or aren’t connected to streams, lakes, rivers and oceans. Specifically, the revisions establish that protected waterways must be “navigable” or have a continuous water connection, making some types of wetlands vulnerable to development.

In New Jersey, property owners can’t fill, dredge or build on a wetland without a permit. Other states like Delaware have more limited wetland laws.

“Whether it’s water supply, whether it’s for irrigating crops, for people’s drinking water, we don’t have enough, and it’s getting more and more critical. At the same time, during storms we have too much water,” Tedesco said. “Whether it’s salt water or fresh water, wetlands really are the cornerstone to the whole system.”",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-jersey-coastal-salt-marshes-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 09:57:29.419655

“I’m much more concerned about damage that will happen rather than achieving anything new and good,” said Sarah Lynn Cunningham, co-founder and executive director of the Louisville Climate Action Network. “I feel more like we’re in a defensive posture to prevent regression.”

From conservative lawmakers worried about Kentucky’s energy industries to people like Cunningham fighting society-driven climate change, they all agree the biggest issue coming before the legislature in the new year will be what to do about the resource-intensive data centers tech companies are hungry to build as they invest in artificial intelligence.

But they say other proposals on energy and the environment are also likely to come up as the General Assembly begins work in January.

‘A pretty good record’

This year legislators will approve a new, two-year budget for the state government, and environmental advocates hope they’ll spend extra on conservation efforts.

A report from The Nature Conservancy compared Kentucky to 11 “peer states” and found it lags in estimated annual conservation funding. At about $2.4 million, the report said Kentucky fell $9.1 million behind the next-lowest contributor: Indiana, at $11.5 million.

Conservation projects can serve multiple purposes, from shoring up a town against future floods to opening up green spaces for recreation to shielding water resources needed by residents and businesses, said Nick Hart, water policy director for the Kentucky Waterways Alliance.

“There's data out there that shows that every $1 spent for conservation funding and flood resilience returns back to us threefold in economic development,” he said.

Senator Robby Mills, a Henderson Republican who chairs the Senate’s majority caucus, indicated conservative lawmakers are open to discussing how to better support conservation efforts.

“But I think we have a pretty good record on conservationism. And if opportunities availed itself, I wouldn't say that we would shy away from it. We’d look at it,” he said.

‘Aggressive assault’

In 2025, the legislature ended a decades-old tradition in Kentucky of giving state-level protections against pollution to basically all waters in the commonwealth.

Under a new law, Senate Bill 89, the state mostly follows the federal government’s lead on which waters to safeguard. The law’s Republican supporters said this will reduce unnecessary red tape burdening businesses.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration announced in November that it wants to reduce the types of waterways that qualify for Clean Water Act protection. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates less than 15% of Kentucky wetlands would stay shielded.

“I would like to think that this aggressive assault on the integrity of what remains of our wetlands would sort of spur some folks to revisit the fact that we’ve entirely laid ourselves bare,” said Michael Washburn, executive director of the Kentucky Waterways Alliance.

But Republican lawmakers likely aren’t interested in taking up that issue again, at least so soon after passing SB 89. Mills said he expects legislators and their staff to watch what happens with federal regulations over the next year.

Similarly, Senator Scott Madon, a Pineville Republican who was SB 89’s lead sponsor, said he isn’t interested in revisiting the law in 2026 and thinks Gov. Andy Beshear’s administration could do a better job implementing it.

He pointed to Beshear’s claim that the state required an extra $1.8 million annually for staff to review water permit renewals under the new rules.

“Well, we never did really understand what he needed 1.8 for,” Madon said.

Going nuclear

It’s a safe bet some Republican lawmakers’ interest in nuclear energy will persist.

Mills said he sees continued support of coal and other fossil fuels as a bridge to get Kentucky to a future that’s powered significantly by nuclear energy.

“If there were targeted investments that we could make as a legislature to help our fossil fuel plants continue to burn for another 10 or 15 years, those could be investments that you see,” he said.

Madon said he’s afraid a day is coming when enough coal won't be available. Kentucky must diversify its energy portfolio, like states that are mixing solar, wind, gas and other power sources.

“I'm not saying anything against coal. I just think we need some other avenues to go along with our coal,” he said.

PFAS, tires, invasives

Advocates from environmental groups listed off various legislative proposals they hope will gain momentum this year.

Hart of the Kentucky Waterways Alliance, for example, said the legislature ordered the state government to produce a report with recommendations on how to tackle the vehicle tires that litter streams. They expect it will lead to concrete policy proposals.

Lane Boldman, executive director of the Kentucky Conservation Committee, said she hopes lawmakers will advance legislation to create a working group on PFAS, the so-called “forever chemicals” leaked into environments worldwide, and require manufacturers to disclose details when they add PFAS to products.

She and other environmental advocates also say they’d like to see progress on proposals to fight the spread of invasive plant species and stop utilities from cutting power during extreme weather to customers with overdue bills.

They’re also wary of possible budget cuts to the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet and the Public Service Commission.

Both agencies historically have been understaffed, but their work is needed to meet obligations under U.S. environmental laws and take action when people break the rules on, say, pollution limits, said Audrey Ernstberger, an associate attorney with the Kentucky Resources Council.

“We want to make sure that these agencies continue to have reasonable amounts of funding to do their jobs,” she said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4116845/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2F11%2Fa9b31f9749878e9b24804b8f157a%2Fimg-4497.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 09:57:33.451000

Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse of the 2nd Congressional District said he wants to deliver results for Coloradans.
Democratic Rep. Jason Crow’s focus is on the mid-term elections and Democrats retaking the House.","Congress returns in early January, and members of Colorado’s congressional delegation each have their own priorities for the new year.

Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet said accessible health care will remain a top priority.

“I have not given up on extending the premium tax credits, and I have introduced legislation to create a public option for Americans who want a Medicare-administered plan. I will also continue to fight to protect our public lands,” he said in a statement.

Congress failed to renew the enhanced premium tax credit for those who buy health insurance on the state ACA marketplace. But a bipartisan group of lawmakers is still trying to get it passed in the new year.

GOP Rep. Jeff Hurd from the 3rd Congressional District is hoping an extension of the tax credit includes some reforms. Still, he said in the new year, Republicans and Democrats need to be talking about “how to lower the cost of healthcare.”

Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper also said he’ll focus on affordability and health care. He’s got a bipartisan bill that would make health care costs more transparent. “But also, we’ve got to look at how are we going to make this economy better and grow again without tariffs that works for everyone.”

The two senators also said they’d remain vigilant against Republican attempts to sell off public lands.

GOP Rep. Gabe Evans, who represents the 8th Congressional District, said he’s hoping the cost of living takes center stage when Congress comes back. He pointed out Colorado is one of the most expensive states and is focused on “doing everything that we can at the federal level to roll back these suffocating leftist regulations that are crushing our economy.”

An example he gave is his bipartisan FIRE Act, which ensures states aren’t punished for smoke and emissions they cannot control.

Democratic Rep. Brittany Pettersen of the 7th Congressional District also had addressing costs as her priority. She’s focused on housing and investing in kids and childcare.

""There’s 10,000 women who say they want to be in the workforce, but they can’t afford child care in Colorado. So it’s a huge issue,"" she said.

Many Colorado lawmakers’ priorities are focused close to home.

Hurd said his local issues for the new year include getting $40 million from the Interior Department for the Shoshone water rights, as well as serious legislation on public safety, economic development and Indian health service through.

Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse of the 2nd Congressional District said he wants to deliver results for Coloradans. “That means getting these bills on wildfire mitigation, watershed protection across the finish line in the same way that we did the Secure Rural Schools program.”

And while he criticized the first year of the 119th Congress for being one of the most “dysfunctional and unproductive,” his goal is to get as many of his bills signed into law as he can. (Neguse noted the longest government shutdown, where the House was out of session for more than seven weeks, and the low number of bills signed into law.)

GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert of the 4th Congressional District, however, points to successes out of the Republican-controlled Congress, such as their tax and spending bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill, and from the Trump Administration’s actions to control the border.

And unlike some of her other Republican colleagues, she’s not giving up on getting a second reconciliation bill passed. It’s a budget maneuver that allows the Senate to bypass the filibuster and is how the OBBB got passed.

Still, she also wants to see some of her bills get over the finish line. Her bill to delist the Gray Wolf from the Endangered Species Act and to establish new zip codes are both now in the Senate. She and Colorado’s senators will also have to address President Trump’s veto of the Finish the AVC Act and see if there is any appetite from Republican congressional leaders to try and override the veto or include it in a larger piece of legislation.

And Boebert noted that Congress still needs to figure out how to fund the government by January 30. “Is it going to be an omnibus? A minibus? I'm not sure exactly what it's going to look like, but we've got to get focused on this because there are amazing projects in my district that I want to see funded.”

Some others, however, are also looking at the big picture.

“I think next year my priority is going to be standing up for democracy and fighting against Donald Trump's illegal abuse of our system,” said Democratic Rep. Diana DeGette of the 1st Congressional District.

Democratic Rep. Jason Crow’s focus is on the mid-term elections and Democrats retaking the House.

“Things are getting substantially worse for Americans, so we have to establish a check. We have to reestablish some sanity [in Congress], which is why retaking control of the majority and reestablishing that check and balance and reasserting Congress's authority over many issues [is important],” Crow explained.

He thinks a change in leadership in the House could also help some of his legislative priorities, like campaign finance reform, gun violence prevention and affordable health care, move forward.

GOP Rep. Jeff Crank of the 5th Congressional District declined to speak with CPR News about his priorities.

Getting anything big passed this year will likely hit a big speed bump: the mid-term elections.

Compliance will cost Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association and the other owners of the Craig Station power plant in northwestern Colorado.
“The Trump Administration is committed to lowering energy costs and keeping American families safe,” Wright said in a release.
Colorado officials criticized the Trump administration order as a disservice to electricity users.
The power plant was completed in 1980.","The Trump administration has told another coal-fired power facility to remain open, this time ordering the owners of a Colorado electricity generating unit to keep it running beyond its Wednesday retirement date.

Compliance will cost Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association and the other owners of the Craig Station power plant in northwestern Colorado. The plant owners will need to fix a broken valve that put the power plant's 446-megawatt Unit 1 out of operation on Dec. 19, Tri-State said in a statement.

The order from Energy Secretary Chris Wright follows recent Department of Energy moves to keep coal-fired power stations open in Indiana, Washington state and Michigan despite efforts by their owners to close them.

It’s part of President Donald Trump’s push to revive the U.S. coal industry at a time when many utilities are shifting to cheaper, less-polluting energy sources such as natural gas and renewables. The administration, meanwhile, has blocked renewable energy, including wind power.

The 45-year-old generator in Colorado, one of three at Craig Station, had been scheduled to close at the end of 2025.

“As a not-for-profit cooperative, our membership will bear the costs of compliance with this order unless we can identify a method to share costs with those in the region,” Tri-State CEO Duane Highley said in the statement.

The power plant's owners had been planning since 2016 to shut down Unit 1 for economic reasons and to comply with “numerous state and federal requirements.”

Asked how much returning the unit to operation would cost and how long that would take, Tri-State spokesperson Amy Robertson said by email that the utility had no further information to share.

The generator must remain operational to address a shortage of electricity and electrical generation in the northwestern U.S., Wright wrote in Tuesday's emergency order keeping the unit operational.

“The Trump Administration is committed to lowering energy costs and keeping American families safe,” Wright said in a release.

Wade Gerber, who works at the power plant, said the announcement changes little for Colorado’s coal country, which is undergoing a long-term shift away from the fossil fuel as a pillar of the local economy.

He sees Craig — a city of about 9,000 people — as caught in the middle of a dizzying political battle.

“What does this administration get to do? What does the next administration get to do? Is it going to make (coal) any long-term thing? No, probably not,” Gerber said.

Gerber recently opened a distillery that caters to the cocktail lounge his wife owns next door, with plans to begin distributing more widely in 2026.

“I already told both my bosses, if that blows up even a little bit, I can tell you: ‘Here’s my two-week notice,’” Gerber said.

Colorado officials criticized the Trump administration order as a disservice to electricity users.

“It is unacceptable to burden ratepayers with these unnecessary costs,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet said in a statement.

The power plant was completed in 1980. Its No. 2 and No. 3 units have been scheduled to be retired in 2028. The plant’s fuel is mined at the nearby Trapper Mine, which is also scheduled to close.

Not so fast, state environmental officials are reminding Rhode Islanders, as even after trees stop sparkling, they can still contribute something to the world.

The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management and the Rhode Island chapter of Trout Unlimited will hold their annual “Trees for Trout” collection on Saturday, Jan. 10, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Arcadia Check Station.

The check station is located in the Wood River Arcadia Management Area at 2224 Ten Rod Road in Exeter.

Since 2018, DEM and Trout Unlimited, a national nonprofit that works to conserve rivers to nurture fish populations, have collected Christmas trees to build conifer revetments in the state’s freshwater habitats. The revetments act like retaining walls and are used to build up the eroding banks of rivers, which can make rivers too wide and shallow to serve as suitable breeding and living grounds for fish, especially wild brook trout, or Salvelinus fontinalis.

A 2021 article by DEM noted numerous poor land use practices that lead to these suboptimal waters: “Dams create barriers and discharge warm water to the otherwise cold stream below. Cattle trample stream banks causing instability, sedimentation and high nutrient run off. Clearcutting removes trees and brush which otherwise filter water before reaching a stream. And the list goes on.”

Building up the river banks with revetments helps to mimic the natural shape and habitat of rivers. The revetments are fashioned by bundling together several dozen conifer trees with stakes and biodegradable twine. The bundled trees are then attached along riverbanks and extend into the channel, where the trees help to stem the flow of water, trapping sediment, sands, and other organic matter over time. As the dead trees build their detritus collections, they form new chunks of riverbank.

Conifers are evergreen trees that bear cones, and this group of trees includes most of the popular Christmas tree choices like firs, pines and spruces. The trees’ densely needled, many-branched bodies provide the perfect surface to fortify riverbanks against erosion.

“Conifer revetments help to narrow the river channel and confine the flow so that during low flows, there is deeper water, thereby creating more habitat for fish,” the DEM article noted.

Trees eligible for use in the trout project need to follow a few rules from DEM to be donated:

Only real trees can be used. Artificial or fire-retardant trees are not allowed.

All ornaments, decorations, stands and lights need to be removed.

Whole conifer trees are needed, so trimmings or clippings can’t be donated.

Trees over 5 feet tall are preferable.

People who want to drop off five or more trees will need to email Rhode Island Trout Unlimited in advance of the Jan. 10 event.

Other options and guidance for Christmas tree disposal can be looked up online via the website of the Rhode Island Resource Recovery Corporation, the quasi-public agency which runs the state’s Johnston landfill.

General Motors Co stock insights, products and corporate strategy at General Motors Co

Market Pulse and recent price action

Based on cross checked data from major financial portals, including Yahoo Finance and Reuters, the latest available quote for General Motors Co stock corresponds to the most recent market close. US equity markets were not trading on the reference day, so the figure represents the last close rather than an intraday price. That close leaves GM roughly in the mid range of its recent 52 week band, well above its yearly low but still meaningfully below the high watermark that briefly ignited hopes for a sustained rerating.

Over the last five trading sessions, the stock has moved in modest increments, alternating between small gains and pullbacks. The resulting pattern is a shallow upward slope over the week, barely outpacing the broader US auto and components group. Daily volumes have hovered around or slightly below their 90 day average, a signal that institutional investors are watching rather than aggressively repositioning.

Zooming out to the last 90 days, GM has staged a more visible recovery from earlier-year weakness. After carving out a bottom not far from its 52 week low, the stock climbed steadily as investors responded to disciplined cost control, resilient US truck and SUV demand and a more measured electrification roadmap. The 90 day trend is mildly bullish, yet the trajectory has flattened in recent weeks, suggesting that the easy rebound from pessimistic levels may be over and that fresh catalysts are needed.

In terms of trading boundaries, the latest data show a 52 week high that reflects the market’s most optimistic moment about GM’s ability to convert its internal combustion engine cash cows into an electric and software ecosystem. The 52 week low, by contrast, came when concerns over pricing pressure, EV adoption speed and union related cost inflation dominated the narrative. Today’s last close sits comfortably above that low but is still at a discount to the peak, keeping the valuation in value territory rather than full blown growth mode.

One-Year Investment Performance

For investors willing to look back instead of staring only at blinking tickers, the one year scorecard for General Motors Co stock is a reminder of how sentiment swings can reshape portfolios. Using verified historical close data, the stock price from exactly one year ago was materially lower than the latest last close. That translates into a solid double digit percentage gain over twelve months, even after factoring in the recent consolidation. A hypothetical investor who had put 10,000 US dollars into GM at that earlier close would be sitting on a sizable profit today, plus dividends, rather than licking wounds.

Emotionally, this one year journey has not felt like a straight climb. There were moments when headlines about slowing EV demand or software delays made it look as if the market had given up on the Detroit icon’s transformation. Yet those who held their nerve and treated GM as a multi year capital return and restructuring story, rather than a quarterly EV scoreboard, have been rewarded. The percentage gain over the period underscores that sometimes the best opportunities emerge when the narrative is dominated by doubt rather than consensus optimism.

Of course, the one year gain also raises a harder question for new money: is the easy part already done? Valuation metrics now embed at least some recognition that GM can balance legacy profitability with future technologies. Anyone deploying capital at current levels needs to decide whether the next twelve months will add another leg of upside or flatten into a grinding range where dividends and buybacks do most of the heavy lifting.

Recent Catalysts and News

Earlier this week, news flow around General Motors Co stock centered on operational fine tuning rather than blockbuster announcements. Coverage from outlets such as Reuters and Bloomberg highlighted how GM is recalibrating its electric vehicle rollout, prioritizing models and geographies where demand visibility is highest and infrastructure is more supportive. That message resonated with investors tired of loss making EV headlines and signaled a pragmatic shift toward profitability and capital discipline in the transition phase.

A few days prior, additional reports focused on GM’s software and services ambitions, including its evolving approach to in vehicle digital platforms and monetization of connected car features. Commentators noted that, while Cruise continues to face regulatory and public perception hurdles after its autonomous operations reset, GM is not backing away from the broader thesis that software based revenue can supplement traditional hardware margins. The nuance in recent commentary suggested that the market is starting to distinguish between short term turbulence at Cruise and the longer term opportunity to embed recurring revenue streams in GM’s massive installed base.

Over the last week, there has also been attention on GM’s ongoing cost initiatives and capacity adjustments in response to a more normalized post pandemic demand environment. Analysts pointed to GM’s cautious stance on incentives and production schedules as evidence that management is prioritizing pricing and margin stability over sheer market share. While such moves can cap unit growth, they also protect earnings quality, which matters when investors are increasingly selective in cyclical sectors.

Notably, there have been no seismic shifts in top leadership or emergency guidance cuts in the very recent news cycle. Instead, the tone is one of incremental adjustment, with GM fine tuning its mix between combustion, hybrid and electric products and managing inventory flows in North America and key international markets. For traders hunting for big headlines, this may feel underwhelming, but for long term holders, steadier news can signal a consolidation phase in which the company executes rather than constantly redefines its story.

Wall Street Verdict & Price Targets

Sell side sentiment on General Motors Co stock, based on recent research notes from major investment banks, has tilted moderately positive while stopping short of unanimous conviction. Over the past several weeks, houses such as Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley have reiterated or updated their views, with a cluster of ratings in the Buy and Overweight camp and a meaningful minority sticking with Neutral or Hold stances. The common thread is that GM screens as undervalued on traditional metrics like price to earnings and free cash flow yield, but the market is skeptical about how smooth the EV and autonomous transition will be.

Goldman Sachs, for example, has maintained a constructive view on GM, emphasizing the strength of the North American truck and SUV franchise and the potential for shareholder returns through buybacks and dividends. Its price target, sitting noticeably above the current trading level, implies double digit percentage upside if execution unfolds as planned. J.P. Morgan’s analysts have also leaned positive, highlighting GM’s cost discipline and the optionality embedded in its software and EV operations, though they flag cyclical risk if macro conditions deteriorate.

Morgan Stanley’s approach has been somewhat more cautious, acknowledging GM’s progress on capital allocation but warning that the pace of EV adoption and regulatory uncertainties keep the risk profile elevated. Bank of America and Deutsche Bank, in recent notes, have pointed to GM as a value play within the global auto sector, with price objectives that cluster in a range comfortably above the latest last close. When aggregated, these views translate into a consensus that could be summarized as a soft Buy or positive Hold: attractive upside on paper, tempered by execution and cycle risk that investors cannot ignore.

For market participants, the key takeaway from this chorus is that Wall Street is no longer treating GM purely as an old economy automaker. Price targets increasingly bake in a multi pillar story that spans legacy combustion profits, emerging EV and software revenues and a still uncertain but potentially powerful contribution from autonomous technologies. The verdict is not a euphoric stamp of approval, yet it is clearly more generous than the deeply discounted valuations seen at previous points of pessimism.

Future Prospects and Strategy

At its core, General Motors Co still earns the bulk of its money by designing, manufacturing and selling cars, trucks and SUVs, with North America as its profit engine. That traditional business funds the company’s ambitious strategy to reinvent itself as a mobility and technology platform. GM is investing heavily in Ultium based electric vehicles, battery plants and an ecosystem of charging and software services, while also nurturing Cruise and other advanced technology bets. The challenge is to manage this portfolio so that legacy operations stay profitable long enough to finance the new world without exhausting investor patience.

Over the coming months, several factors will shape the performance of General Motors Co stock. First, macro conditions and consumer credit trends will influence demand for big ticket vehicles, especially in the lucrative pickup and SUV segments. Second, the trajectory of EV adoption, particularly in North America and China, will determine whether GM’s capacity investments translate into growth or margin pressure. Third, regulatory decisions and public acceptance around autonomous driving will influence how quickly Cruise can move from experimental to commercial scale.

On the positive side, GM’s balance sheet is stronger than in past cycles, and management has signaled a firm commitment to returning capital when cash flows allow. Continued share repurchases and a growing dividend could provide a floor for the stock, even if topline growth is choppy. On the risk side, any missteps in product launches, software reliability or safety incidents in autonomous trials could quickly erode the fragile confidence built over the last year. In this sense, GM’s future is a test case for whether a legacy industrial champion can pivot fast enough to compete with both traditional rivals and nimble tech oriented entrants.

For investors, the current setup around General Motors Co stock is less about chasing a momentum story and more about judging execution over a medium term horizon. The recent consolidation in the share price, coupled with supportive though not euphoric analyst coverage, hints at a market in wait and see mode. If GM can string together several quarters of steady margins, disciplined EV rollouts and clearer milestones for software and autonomous revenues, the path toward the upper half of its 52 week range and beyond remains open. If not, the stock risks slipping back toward its value trap reputation, with the last year’s gains looking like a temporary reprieve instead of the start of a durable rerating.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405001_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 07:57:54.130846

Compliance will cost Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association and the other owners of the Craig Station power plant in northwestern Colorado. The plant owners will need to fix a broken valve that put the power plant's 446-megawatt Unit 1 out of operation on Dec. 19, Tri-State said in a statement.

The order from Energy Secretary Chris Wright follows recent Department of Energy moves to keep coal-fired power stations open in Indiana, Washington state and Michigan despite efforts by their owners to close them.

It’s part of President Donald Trump’s push to revive the U.S. coal industry at a time when many utilities are shifting to cheaper, less-polluting energy sources such as natural gas and renewables. The administration, meanwhile, has blocked renewable energy, including wind power.

The 45-year-old generator in Colorado, one of three at Craig Station, had been scheduled to close at the end of 2025.

“As a not-for-profit cooperative, our membership will bear the costs of compliance with this order unless we can identify a method to share costs with those in the region,” Tri-State CEO Duane Highley said in the statement.

The power plant's owners had been planning since 2016 to shut down Unit 1 for economic reasons and to comply with “numerous state and federal requirements.”

Asked how much returning the unit to operation would cost and how long that would take, Tri-State spokesperson Amy Robertson said by email that the utility had no further information to share.

The generator must remain operational to address a shortage of electricity and electrical generation in the northwestern U.S., Wright wrote in Tuesday's emergency order keeping the unit operational.

“The Trump Administration is committed to lowering energy costs and keeping American families safe,” Wright said in a release.

Wade Gerber, who works at the power plant, said the announcement changes little for Colorado’s coal country, which is undergoing a long-term shift away from the fossil fuel as a pillar of the local economy.

He sees Craig — a city of about 9,000 people — as caught in the middle of a dizzying political battle.

“What does this administration get to do? What does the next administration get to do? Is it going to make (coal) any long-term thing? No, probably not,” Gerber said.

Gerber recently opened a distillery that caters to the cocktail lounge his wife owns next door, with plans to begin distributing more widely in 2026.

“I already told both my bosses, if that blows up even a little bit, I can tell you: ‘Here’s my two-week notice,’” Gerber said.

Colorado officials criticized the Trump administration order as a disservice to electricity users.

“It is unacceptable to burden ratepayers with these unnecessary costs,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet said in a statement.

The power plant was completed in 1980. Its No. 2 and No. 3 units have been scheduled to be retired in 2028. The plant’s fuel is mined at the nearby Trapper Mine, which is also scheduled to close.

Recently, although the stock price of Rivian Automotive (RIVN) remains significantly below its peak at the time of its 2021 IPO, it has rebounded from recent lows, partially reviving market optimism. The company’s third-quarter 2025 financial report showed a notable year-over-year increase in revenue, with deliveries exceeding production and a small positive gross profit achieved. Management highlighted operational progress, including advancing plans for the R2 model with a starting price of $45,000 and constructing large-scale new facilities and the Georgia plant to support production. However, its quarterly deliveries still fall far short of both existing and planned production capacity. With the expiration of federal electric vehicle tax credits, market demand faces a test. Meanwhile, the company’s net cash on the balance sheet is limited, while future capital expenditure needs are substantial. Unless the R2 model achieves significant success, the company could face severe challenges.

The More Severe Dilemma of Lucid Group

The situation of Lucid Group (LCID) is considered even more difficult. Despite its models receiving favorable reviews from the media, its products are priced at a premium. Although sales have grown, gross losses and operating losses continue to widen, presenting a scenario of “selling more, losing more.” The company’s free cash flow is deeply negative, and its cash reserves are lower than its total debt. To sustain operations, Lucid has engaged in financing that may lead to equity dilution. Its overall financial condition indicates that the company is under significant pressure, and survival risks cannot be ignored.

Tesla’s Contrast and Resilience

While Rivian and Lucid face significant difficulties, Tesla (TSLA), as a pioneer in the electric vehicle field, presents a different picture in terms of its fundamentals. Although the company also faces certain public relations challenges brought about by its CEO, its financial performance remains relatively solid. Over the past 12 months, Tesla has achieved considerable profitability, with cash reserves significantly exceeding its debt and consistent positive free cash flow generation. Compared to many cash-burning competitors, Tesla demonstrates stronger financial resilience and self-sustaining capability. From a specific investment perspective, among current electric vehicle stocks, Tesla may still be viewed by some as a potentially more promising choice.

Conclusion

In summary, both Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group face severe challenges such as mismatches between sales and production capacity, continuous losses, and tight cash flow. Their survival and development depend on the success of future models and effective fundraising. In contrast, Tesla, with its achieved profitability, healthy cash flow, and solid balance sheet, demonstrates stronger operational resilience amid industry volatility.",https://nai500.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/From-Rivian-and-Lucid-to-Tesla-A-Game-of-Survival-and-Triumph.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 03:57:40.190179

The proposed 318,000-square-foot facility would require the filling of saturated areas on about 6 acres, according to the construction application. Members of the public may comment online by Friday.

Public comment closes Friday, Jan. 2, on a construction application for a warehouse in the wetlands near the Eugene Airport. The application has been filed by a developer with ties to Amazon.

Both state and federal regulators require such applications for projects that disturb wetlands to monitor compliance with the Clean Water Act.

TC Pursuit Services Inc. filed the application Nov. 3 with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Oregon Department of State Lands. But the public comment period seemingly opened weeks later, just before the Christmas holiday.

Titled “Clear Lake E-Commerce,” the project includes a 318,000-square-foot building, semi-trailer parking and stormwater treatment infrastructure. The application does not name Amazon but describes the tenant as an “e-commerce company with economic interest in the area.”

TC Pursuit Services is a subsidiary of Trammell Crow Co., a Dallas-based commercial real estate developer that has built facilities for Amazon and other companies, according to reports from Texas, Washington and Wisconsin on similar fulfillment center proposals.

The construction application documents environmental impacts, including the filling of about 6.5 acres of saturated soil with imported earth or engineered materials such as concrete. The application states that no species protected under the federal Endangered Species Act rely on the site’s habitat.

However, it acknowledges documented sightings of the Western pond turtle in the surrounding area. That species is classified as “sensitive-critical” on Oregon’s State Sensitive Species List.

The application did not elaborate on emissions tied to the 976 fleet vehicle parking spaces and the roughly 2,600 daily vehicle trips the project could generate. It remains unclear how many of those vehicles would be electric, diesel-powered or a combination.

The Environmental Protection Agency has long linked vehicle exhaust to asthma and other respiratory illnesses, with children particularly vulnerable because of their developing lungs.

To regulate emissions, the Lane Regional Air Protection Agency approved an air permit in September. That permitting process garnered its own round of public comments.

While the project is located in a zoned industrial development area that the city designated to concentrate heavy uses away from residential neighborhoods, public concerns remain about its broader impacts.

Specifically, commenters raised concerns about truck traffic that could still cut through nearby neighborhoods, including Trainsong and Bethel. Residents from those areas wrote that their communities have already “suffered too much” from industrial pollution.",https://i0.wp.com/lookouteugene-springfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-31-at-4.15.46-PM.png?fit=1018%2C678&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-01 04:58:09.702301

With 2026 midterms on the horizon, North Carolinians should welcome the season not with campaign slogans, but with a clear-eyed demand for good public policy.

As we head into the new year, the question voters should ask is simple: Are lawmakers or candidates truly heroes of liberty in the ways that matter, or just in stump speeches?

Over the past decade, North Carolina has offered a case study in what accountable, liberty-minded governance can look like. Lawmakers pursued tax reform, regulatory restraint, and policies that expanded opportunity rather than dependency. The result has been sustained economic growth, more families moving to the state, and an environment where individuals can define their own destinies.

Those outcomes didn’t happen because of clever messaging or polished speeches. They happened because policymakers made choices and voters were able to judge them by their effects. In 2026, the same principle applies: the measure of leadership is in real-world impact, not talking points.

Too often, election seasons devolve into clickbait headlines, abstract promises, dire warnings, and partisan labels. But North Carolina’s recent history shows that the most meaningful question for voters is practical:

Did this leader make it easier to work, start a business, or keep more of your paycheck?

Did they give parents real authority over their children’s education?

Did they protect individual liberty by limiting the reach of unelected bureaucracies?

These are the questions that matter when deciding who truly deserves to be called a champion of freedom.

Redistricting has already sharpened the focus on several congressional and legislative races. New maps mean new political dynamics, but they do not change the underlying responsibility of those seeking office. Representation is not about geography alone. It’s about performance in defending liberty and opportunity.

A new year is also an opportunity for citizens to learn more about what liberty-based policy looks like in practice. The Carolina Liberty Conference, held this year Feb. 27-28 in Raleigh by the John Locke Foundation, offers a chance to explore the principles that underpin North Carolina’s most successful policies and understand how informed, principled leadership can expand prosperity.

North Carolina voters have repeatedly shown they are pragmatic. The recent rise in voters registering as independent shows that they are open to new ideas, not necessarily partisan labels. The skepticism of political parties is healthy. A free society depends on citizens who evaluate outcomes, not intentions.

As the new year begins, candidates know they have precious few seconds to capture public attention and midterm turnout, especially in primaries, is notoriously low. This year, let’s look for those willing to talk policy on the campaign trail, not just politics.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/north-Carolina-flag-scaled-e1647285502935.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 05:57:13.597755

Electric cars aren’t political, but they rely on political support Electric vehicles aren’t really a left-or-right issue.","Five years ago, spotting a hybrid or electric car was a rare treat. Tesla sold about half a million EVs globally in 2020, proving the technology worked, while the Toyota Prius led hybrids in the US with 43,500 sales.

By 2025, the landscape has shifted dramatically. EVs grabbed 10.5 percent of new-car sales by Q3, thanks in part to expiring tax incentives.

Hybrids are even hotter, making up roughly one in five new vehicles sold. The Camry going hybrid-only is a clear marker of just how far the segment has come.

The Toyota Camry ushers hybrids into a golden age

The Toyota Camry made waves last year when news broke that the new model would be hybrid-only. Some longtime buyers weren’t thrilled, ready to say goodbye to the familiar nameplate.

Still, with a 17-horsepower boost over the 2024 Camry Hybrid, the new model is capable enough to quiet a lot of the early criticism.

If we had a choice, we’d pick a real 8-speed automatic over a CVT any day. But judging by the latest sales numbers, most Americans don’t seem to mind.

Here’s a look at how Camry sales have shaped up over the past five years.

These numbers don’t include December 2025.

The Camry has been averaging 24,056 units sold per month, so even with an average final month, the hybrid-only model could hit around 312,929 sales.

That would mark its second-highest sales this decade—and that’s a conservative estimate.

The 2025 Camry marks a milestone for hybrids

The Toyota Camry has been America’s favorite car—counting only sedans and coupes—for decades. Its only slip came in 2001, when the Honda Accord edged it out by a slim margin.

You might think Honda would have a shot at reclaiming the crown, but the Camry going hybrid-only hasn’t dented its sales one bit.

Toyota likely expected some drop in sales when it ditched the ICE Camry, but that never materialized.

While EVs may have been overhyped, with many brands dialing back their all-electric promises, hybrids are quietly proving they’re the real future of the auto industry.

A strange year for electrified vehicles

We’re still waiting on the year-end numbers for EVs and hybrids, but so far, things are going “according to plan.”

The news that EV tax credits would expire at the end of September gave the entire electrified segment a nice boost.

The Tesla Model Y sold 25,800 units in August and then posted its best month of the year in September with 30,702 units.

Tesla’s Q4 results are still up in the air, as is the bigger question of EV sales in a post-credit world.

Industry experts predicted exactly what we saw: a sharp spike as buyers rushed to grab expiring EV incentives.

We probably won’t see a total crash, but the September surge looks more like a one-time boom than a lasting upward trend.

Tesla stays king of EVs through the highs and lows

A quick look at Tesla’s stock over the past year tells the story: dramatic swings, soaring highs, and gut-dropping lows. It’s been that kind of strange, roller-coaster year.

Early in the year, Tesla’s stock nosedive and the rise of competing EVs had some wondering if its reign as the EV leader was ending. That clearly hasn’t happened.

Even so, electric vehicles are still a niche compared with hybrids.

Are we truly ready for an all-electric future?

Fully electrified highways may be inevitable—gasoline won’t last forever, and a switch to diesel isn’t very likely. Early estimates suggest it won’t happen for at least 25 years.

The real question isn’t if we’ll get there, but whether it’ll happen in the next five to ten years.

Without getting political, the facts are clear: it’s not going to happen during this administration.

The bipartisan infrastructure bill under President Biden helped put more charging stations on the map and encouraged buyers to cash in on EV tax credits.

On the other hand, President Trump has shown little interest in supporting or nudging the EV market, slowing much of the momentum it had gained.

Electric cars aren’t political, but they rely on political support

Electric vehicles aren’t really a left-or-right issue. Driving a Tesla doesn’t reveal your politics, and the word “bipartisan” played a key role in Biden’s infrastructure bill.

Major changes in the American auto industry have always leaned on government support. Think Eisenhower’s 1956 Highway Act or Obama’s $7,500 EV rebate—big shifts rarely happen without it.

Cars are heavily regulated because the government runs the roads and aims to keep cities smog-free. Without ongoing support, major changes in the industry are nearly impossible.

For now, electric cars are more of a “definitely someday” deal. We could see another big push toward electrification by the end of the decade.

But don’t expect it in the next three years. Whether that’s good or bad is up to you, but in the meantime, hybrids are likely to keep selling like crazy.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/c3P7Vy5gYMiEtIyPYP0Sow--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/how_to_geek_999/835cd552f76c5a11485235b0a04c2ae2,N,,2026-01-01 02:57:19.177687

Statewide emissions of carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide, in particular, reached all-time lows in 2022, the latest year for which data are available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

According to the report, statewide emissions of the air pollutants regulated under the federal Clean Air Act have declined sharply from 1990 through 2022. Specifically, emissions fell:

• 95% for sulfur dioxide (SO2)

• 74% for carbon monoxide (CO)

• 71% for nitrogen oxides (NOx)

• 48% for fine particles (PM5)

• 67% for volatile organic compounds (VOCs)

Measured concentrations of those air pollutants have been below every federal health-based standard for more than a decade. Average concentrations of SO2, for example, are 95% below the federal standard; annual nitrogen dioxide concentrations are 89% below the standard.

North Carolina’s transition away from coal for power generation has been a major driver of these changes. More of the state’s power now comes from clean sources such as solar, wind and nuclear energy. Energy efficiency improvements in homes and buildings also reduce emissions from power plants.

Cars, trucks and other vehicles on North Carolina roads also emit far less pollution than older vehicles, thanks to improved engine and fuel standards and more advanced emissions controls. From 1990 through 2022, CO, NOx, and VOC emissions have declined by 81%, 72% and 85%, respectively, from these on-road sources of air pollution.

According to MIT Solve, climate change is reshaping communities, infrastructure, and the future of work across Brazil, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. Brazil has experienced a 460 percent increase in climate-related disasters since the 1990s, from the drought-vulnerable Amazon to flood-prone urban centers. Australia faces harsher fire seasons and intensifying extreme weather, while the Pacific Islands will experience at least 15 centimeters of sea level rise by the 2050s. At the same time, these countries’ energy systems and natural resource management require dramatic transformation to meet growing demand while minimizing environmental impact.

This transition to low-carbon and resilient infrastructure creates unprecedented workforce demands and opportunities. Jobs in renewable energy recorded the highest annual growth rate in 2023, reaching 16.2 million globally, with projections suggesting this could need to double by 2030 tion. Yet communities often lack access to the training, resources, and employment opportunities needed to join this workforce or build local capacity for resilience. This gap is particularly acute in underserved communities across these regions, where climate impacts hit hardest but pathways for skilled employment remain limited.

Examples of the many areas for climate resilience technology and innovation include AI-powered early warning systems and climate risk assessment tools, infrastructure hardening, flexible microgrids to maintain essential services, and broader deployment of nature-based solutions rooted in Indigenous and ancestral knowledge. When combined with new workforce pathways, climate resilience becomes an economic opportunity that strengthens communities while protecting ecosystems.

The Macquarie Community Resilience Prize seeks scalable, technology-enabled solutions that address these interconnected challenges across Brazil, Australia, and Pacific Islands, simultaneously strengthening climate resilience and developing the skilled workforce for the transition to a green economy. Solutions that integrate ancestral and Indigenous knowledge are especially encouraged to apply. The prize seeks solutions that address both community resilience to climate change and workforce training, including solutions that:

Address the following community resilience dimensions: Enhance infrastructure resilience for electrical, water, and other technical systems; reduce community risks from hazards such as wildfires, flooding, drought, and extreme heat; and strengthen climate-adapted agriculture and food systems, particularly those that protect and restore natural ecosystems.

And the following workforce and skilling dimensions: Train and upskill workers in trades for enabling infrastructure resilience and adapting communities; provide tools and opportunities that allow current workers to adopt climate resilience work within their portfolios; and enable new funding and employment models to support long-term community resilience and transition work.

Prize benefits include access to a prize pool of up to $1 million, which will be awarded to up to 10 winning teams. Award amounts could range from $50,000 to $250,000.

CANONSBURG, Pennsylvania — Noble Environmental, Inc. (“Noble”) completed the sale of approximately $34.8 million in Investment Tax Credits (“ITCs”) generated by two of its renewable natural gas (“RNG”) facilities, along with the commencement of commercial operations at three new facilities, two of which were included in the transaction.

The three newly commissioned facilities upgrade landfill gas into pipeline-quality RNG. By capturing methane that would otherwise be emitted into the atmosphere, these projects deliver some of the most immediate and impactful greenhouse gas reductions available today.

“I am proud of the RNG development team, led by Andrew Yohe, Eric Kettering, and Andrew Thomas, for their tireless work over the last 12 months to build high-performing plants quickly,” said Nick Stork, Chairman of Noble. “RNG continues to play a critical role in the energy transition, and we look forward to unlocking more RNG value at Noble landfills in the near term.”

RNG is increasingly recognized as a scalable decarbonization tool for the waste, transportation, industrial, and utility sectors. Compared with conventional natural gas, RNG can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by more than 50% and air pollutants by up to 90%. The fuel is fully compatible with existing pipeline networks and end-use equipment, providing a drop-in solution for organizations seeking real, measurable emissions reductions.

Colorado Approves Scout's Sales Model

According to Automotive News, Colorado’s Motor Vehicle Dealer Board recently granted a dealer license to Scout Motors in the state of Colorado. The board voted six to two to approve Scout’s application to become a dealer in the state. With the dealer license, Scout Motors will be able to sell vehicles directly to consumers in Colorado. Scout’s license in Colorado is valid from December 16, 2025, to October 31, 2026.

The board’s decision comes at a tense time in the automotive industry, as more automakers look to adopt direct-to-consumer sales methods and face strong opposition from dealers. While it’s an early win for Scout, it’s a win nonetheless. And the win comes in a state that’s shaping up to be a key one for the automaker. Colorado is one of the larger electric vehicle markets in the U.S., and the state was identified as a prime location for Scout’s planned stores and experience centers.

Dealers Push Back on the Decision

While Scout is happy with the board’s decision, Colorado dealers aren’t as thrilled about the decision. “We’re disappointed,” Colorado Auto Dealers Association CEO Matthew Groves told Automotive News. “We have a law that specifically prohibits manufacturers from having control of the dealership, and now the state’s just granted a manufacturer control of the dealership.”

From Groves' perspective, he believes that Scout is inherently different from Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid, which have been able to sell vehicles directly to consumers for some time now. Groves believes that these automakers are different and should be allowed to have a direct-to-consumer sales model because they do not have franchise agreements in place with legacy automakers, reports Automotive News.

Scout Faces Challenges Outside Colorado

While Volkswagen owns the Scout brand, the German automaker claims that Scout Motors is an independent startup. Additionally, the Colorado Motor Vehicle Dealer Board ruled that Scout is not a same-line manufacturer as VW, Audi, or Porsche, according to Automotive News. That ruling may have played a large role in Scout receiving a dealer license, as it means that Scout doesn't have any existing franchise agreements in the state.

In a statement to Automotive News, Cody Thacker, Scout’s vice president of commercial operations, thanked Colorado’s Motor Vehicle Dealer Board for their decision to grant the automaker a dealer license. “Despite repeated attempts by dealer lobbyists to unfairly prevent Colorado consumers from choosing how they want to buy cars, today’s decisive approval by the Dealer Board ensures that we can continue moving forward with our business plans to invest in Colorado, employ Colorado workers, and deliver a modern, customer-focused experience for thousands of future Scout owners in the state,” said Thacker.",https://cdcssl.ibsrv.net/cimg/www.carsdirect.com/618x348_100/432/spare-wheel-stored-in-a-traveler-759432.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 04:58:18.922123

AI also got some agentic legs, meaning it could go out onto the internet and do tasks for you, like plan a vacation or order a pizza.

Despite these advancements, we might still be far off from artificial general intelligence, or AGI. This is a theoretical future when AI becomes so good that it's indistinguishable from (or better than) human intelligence. Right now, an AI system works in a vacuum and doesn't really understand the world around us. It can mimic intelligence and string words together to make it sound like it understands. But it doesn't. Using AI daily has shown me that we still have a ways to go before we reach AGI.

As the AI industry reaches monstrous valuations, companies are moving quickly to meet Wall Street demands. Google, OpenAI, Anthropic and others are throwing trillions in training and infrastructure costs to usher in the next technological revolution. While the spend might seem absurd, if AI does truly upend how humanity works, then the rewards could be enormous. At the same time, as revolutionary as AI is, it constantly messes up and gets things wrong. It's also flooding the internet with slop content -- such as amusing short-form videos that may be profitable but are seldom valuable.

Humanity, which will be the beneficiary or sufferer of AI, deserves better. If our survival is literally at stake, then at the very least, AI could be substantively more helpful, rather than just a rote writer of college essays and nude image generators. Here are all the things that I, as an AI reporter, would like to see from the industry in 2026.

It's the environment

My biggest, most immediate concern around AI is the impact massive data centers will have on the environment. Before the AI revolution, the planet was already facing an existential threat due to our reliance on fossil fuels. Major tech companies stepped up with initiatives saying they'd aim to reach net-zero emissions by a certain date. Then ChatGPT hit the scene.

Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.

With the massive power demand of AI, including Wall Street's insatiable need for profitability, data centers are turning back to fossil fuels like methane gas to keep the GPUs humming, the tools that perform the complex calculations to string words and pixels together.

There's something incredibly dystopian about the end of the planet coming at the hands of ludicrous AI-generated videos of kittens bulking up at the gym.

Whenever I get an opportunity, I ask companies like Google, OpenAI and Nvidia what they're doing to ensure AI data centers don't pollute the water or air. They say they're still committed to reaching emissions targets but seldom give specific details. I suspect they aren't quite sure what the plan is yet, either. Maybe AI will give them the answer?

At the very least, I'm glad that the US is reconsidering nuclear energy. It's an efficient and largely pollution-free energy source. It's just a bit sad that it's market demands that'll bring back nuclear and not politicians fighting to protect the planet. At least the US can take inspiration from Europe, where nuclear energy is more common. It's just frustrating that it takes five or more years to build a new plant.

I want my phone to be smarter

For the past three years, smartphone makers such as Apple, Samsung and Google have been touting new AI features in their handsets. Often, these presentations show how AI could help edit photos or clean up texts. Even then, consumers have been underwhelmed by AI in smartphones. I don't blame them. People turn to smartphones for quality snaps, communication or social media. These AI features feel more like extras than must-haves.

Here's the thing: AI has the capability to fix many pain points in smartphone usage. The technology is way better at things like vocal transcription, translation and answering questions than past ""smart"" features. The problem is that for AI to do these things well, it requires a lot of computing. And when somebody is trying to use speech-to-text, they don't have time to wait for their audio to be uploaded to Google's cloud so that it can be transcribed and beamed back to their phone. Even if the process takes 10 seconds, that's still too long in the middle of a back-and-forth text chain.

Local AI models are available to run on-device to do these sorts of quick tasks. The problem is that the models still aren't capable of getting it right all the time. As a result, things can feel haphazard, with quality transcriptions working only some of the time. I'm hoping that in 2026, local AI on phones can get to a point where it just works.

I also want to see local AI models on phones that can be more agentic. Google has a feature on Pixel phones called Magic Cue. It can automatically pull from your email and text data and intuitively add Maps directions to a coffee date. Or if you're texting about a flight, it can automatically pull up the flight information. This kind of seamless integration is what I want from AI on mobile, not reimagining photos in cartoon form.

Magic Cue is still in its early stages, and it doesn't work all the time or as you'd suspect. If Google, OpenAI or other companies can figure this out, that's when I do feel consumers will really start to appreciate AI on phones.

Is this AI?

Scrolling through Instagram Reels or TikTok, whenever I see something truly charming, funny or out of the ordinary, I immediately rush to the comments to see if it's AI.

AI video models are becoming increasingly convincing. Gone are wonky movements, 12 fingers and perfectly centered shots with uncanny perfection. AI videos on social now mimic security camera footage and handheld videos, and added filters can obscure the AI-ness of a video.

I'm tired of the guessing game. I want both Meta and TikTok to straight-up declare if the video uploaded was made with AI. Meta actually does have systems in place to try and determine if something uploaded was made with generative AI, but it's inconsistent. TikTok is also working on AI detection. I'm not entirely sure how the platforms can do so accurately, but it'd certainly make life on social far less of a puzzle.

Sora and Google do have watermarks for AI-generated videos. But these are getting easier to evade, and many people are using Chinese AI models, such as Wan, to generate videos. While Wan does add a watermark, people can find ways to download those videos without it. It shouldn't be incumbent upon a few in the comments section to delineate whether a video is AI or not. (There are even subreddits that survey users trying to discern if a video is AI.)

We need clarity.

I'm tired of the constant guesswork. C'mon, Meta and TikTok -- what's the point of all the billions in AI investment? Just tell me if a video on your platform is AI.",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/637a4d749e079618cf8b715975b255948fad6f9b/hub/2025/12/29/a553678d-a231-4284-85af-01d688b1cbba/gettyimages-2252210703.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,N,,2026-01-01 05:12:44.115574

While Indiana lawmakers typically schedule most new laws to begin July 1, some provisions are delayed until the start of the year. For 2026, several of those changes center on taxes, along with a mix of unrelated measures affecting daily life for Hoosiers.

Property tax changes begin phasing in

Several provisions of Senate Enrolled Act 1, Indiana’s major property tax reform law, take effect Jan. 1, 2026.

The law reduces property taxes by increasing exemptions and deductions so less of a property’s value is taxed.

For 2026, the standard homestead deduction will remain at $48,000. At the same time, the supplemental deduction will increase from 37.5% to 40%. The standard deduction will gradually phase out and be eliminated by 2031, while the supplemental deduction will rise to two-thirds of a property’s value by that year.

A new homestead tax credit will also take effect. Property owners will receive a credit equal to $300 or 10% of their property tax bill, whichever amount is lower.

Additional changes include the elimination of the 30% tax floor on depreciated business equipment purchased in 2026 or later, meaning businesses will no longer be required to pay taxes on at least 30% of the original purchase price.

Rental properties and farmland will also receive a new supplemental deduction that begins at 6% in 2026 and increases to one-third of the gross assessed value by 2031.

The Department of Local Government Finance is required to launch an online property tax transparency portal by Jan. 1. The portal is intended to allow property owners to compare their current tax bill with alternative tax rates and provide feedback to state and local governments.

State income tax decrease

Indiana’s state income tax rate will decrease slightly at the start of the year, dropping from 3% to 2.95%.

The reduction stems from the 2023 budget cycle. For someone earning $100,000 annually, the change amounts to about $50 in yearly savings.

SNAP purchase restrictions

Under Indiana’s “Smart SNAP” initiative, SNAP recipients will no longer be allowed to use benefits to purchase certain sugary snacks and drinks.

According to the Family and Social Services Administration, the change affects about 450,000 Hoosiers and roughly 5,000 retailers statewide.

Data privacy updates

A consumer data privacy law will give Hoosiers new rights over how their personal data is collected and used by companies.

Consumers can request access to their personal data, correct inaccuracies, request deletion under certain conditions and opt out of targeted advertising.

Businesses are required to disclose how data is collected and used, implement reasonable security practices and respond to verified consumer requests. The Indiana Attorney General’s office is responsible for enforcement, with an emphasis on compliance.

Other laws taking effect Jan. 1

Several additional provisions begin with the new year:

Under House Enrolled Act 1380, electric vehicle registration fees will no longer apply to motorcycle owners.

Senate Enrolled Act 108 limits facilities that host bingo or casino game nights to no more than three nights per week.

House Enrolled Act 1004 requires the Department of Health to establish a reporting process for violations related to health insurance commission disclosures.

House Enrolled Act 1285 requires schools to ensure at least one employee on site during the school year has received nonviolent crisis intervention training.

Senate Enrolled Act 331 requires drivers who change a vehicle’s color through paint or vinyl wraps to notify the Bureau of Motor Vehicles within 30 days. Failure to do so could result in a warning from law enforcement.

Both chambers of the Indiana General Assembly will reconvene for the 2026 legislative session on Monday, Jan. 5, at 1:30 p.m.",https://www.wishtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/28/BRAUN-BILL-SIGNINGS-VO.transfer.transfer_frame_290.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 00:13:03.800327

My V-Dub is the latest in a line that dates back to the original Rabbit-based GTI from1976 — the car that arguably launched the “hot hatch” segment.
“The decline in hot hatch popularity since the ‘90s can be attributed to several factors: Changing consumer preferences toward SUVs and many (automakers) deciding to exit the sedans and coupes market,” said Owen Peacock, general manager of Toyota Marketing.
It’s a long drive and I have plenty of time to ponder the state of hot hatches in America.
“We keep these cars relevant by continuously refining their driving dynamics, powertrains and technology to meet modern expectations while preserving the core excitement that defines a hot hatch,” Peacock said.","It’s noon, and I’m sitting in Jackson, Tennessee, a waypoint on Interstate 40 an hour east of Memphis. My husband calls and wants to know if I’ll be home in Indianapolis for dinner. I look at the Volkswagen GTI while knowing there are hours of challenging roads ahead.

“Yeah, I’ll be there,” I said. I threw my bags under the hatch, slid into the tartan-upholstered seats, and stomped the turbo-four onto the highway.

My V-Dub is the latest in a line that dates back to the original Rabbit-based GTI from1976 — the car that arguably launched the “hot hatch” segment. They’re practical rides with enough sporting pleasure to fill weekend back roads with revving engines, tight suspensions and crisp transmissions. The GTI is also affordable at $32,445.

While there once was an array of choices for enthusiasts, it’s waned precipitously since the 1990s.

“The decline in hot hatch popularity since the ‘90s can be attributed to several factors: Changing consumer preferences toward SUVs and many (automakers) deciding to exit the sedans and coupes market,” said Owen Peacock, general manager of Toyota Marketing.

It’s a long drive and I have plenty of time to ponder the state of hot hatches in America.

The Honda Civic Type R could have taught my V-Dub a few lessons since it broke the front-drive lap record time of 7 minutes 44.881 seconds on Germany’s treacherous Nürburgring. To accomplish that feat, it employed a 315-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, six-speed manual transmission, Brembo brakes, wing and adaptive suspension. All that for $45,895.

Who buys cars like this?

“It’s a very specific product purchase,” said Jonathon Rivers, the department lead for customer experience at American Honda Motor Co. “It’s somebody who knows every single detail about that car — need a track-capable vehicle, but something that’s also reliable and with extra usability. It’s an awesome blend of a visceral experience, but owners can switch drive modes and put things in the huge hatch.”

How has Honda addressed what these buyers really want?

“What makes the Type-R stand out is its heritage,” Rivers said. “It stands out because it is front-wheel-drive when many competitors use AWD. With dual axis front suspension technology, you can still put the power down and provide a very dynamic driving experience. It has a big wing on the back, scoop on the hood, but still looks very mature.”

If that seems intense, Honda also introduced a Civic Hybrid Hatchback for 2025 dishing 200 horsepower and 50/45 MPG city/highway. Hybrid hatches start at $30,495.

“It’s been great, Car of the Year — done very well from a customer perspective,” Rivers continued. “It brings us a lot of credibility with the Honda Prelude.”

Indeed, nostalgia bites harder for 2026 as Honda marks a new Prelude sport coupe that looks equal parts Porsche and Civic, employing the latter’s hybrid system and chassis from the Typer R. Combined system output including the 2.0-liter engine totals 200 horsepower. Leather-trimmed sport seats with houndstooth pattern, flat-bottom steering wheel and Bose audio encourage grand touring. Load the hatch and go.

Interstate 40 across Tennessee is not the Nürburgring, but it can feel like it when chicaning semis through sweeping hills and a fast crossing of the Tennessee River. Across hill and dale, the GTI is rock steady at triple digits with one hand on the wheel. The 2.0-liter turbo-four dances with 241 horsepower and available adaptive suspension.

If I was going to choose another whip, I’d consider the Toyota GR Corolla. This is not your nephew’s dorm shuttle! Developed by Toyota’s GAZOO Racing, the widened hatchback employs a 1.6-liter turbo-three engine dishing 300 horsepower through a six-speed manual transmission (automatic optional) and all-wheel-drive. Deeply bolstered seats and a head-up display encourage track days. Prices start at $39,160.

“Our performance hatchbacks attract a passionate, diverse group,” Peacock said. “Typically, these buyers are driving enthusiasts who value a blend of everyday practicality and spirited performance. They tend to be younger professionals or enthusiasts who want a car that’s fun to drive — whether it’s for spirited canyon runs or just enjoying a dynamic daily driver.”

I strafe Nashville before pointing North. Passing through Bowling Green, Kentucky, I spot the red spire of the National Corvette Museum. America’s dream car straddles the worlds of gas-burning Nirvana and the EV age with two hybrids. Which makes me wonder about the future of hot hatches.

We get a hint with the all-electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, boasting 641 horsepower, 221-mile range and 0-60 mph in 3.25 seconds. It sports out with a lowered suspension and sueded seats. You know you’re going to have fun when a car has a “drift optimizer” and “N Grin Boost” for optimum acceleration — all for $66,200.

Going further, Hyundai recently unveiled the Concept Three with compact three-door profile looking like a next-generation Veloster. It’s interior trades giant touchscreens for smaller screens around the steering wheel while integrating recycled wool and aluminum.

Looking 10 years into the future, how will this segment look?

“There are opportunities for a multitude of platforms and powertrains to co-exist,” Rivers said. “It’s up to customers. The reason you want a hot hatchback is because it’s fast and fun to drive. There’s always a way to evolve, like with automated shifting and sound technology, that take what made those cars great and bring it forward.”

As much as I’m enjoying my romp across the Ohio River, I can’t help but wonder how long VW’s party can last.

Our region is fortunate to have a community foundation, especially one that is a hub for these partnerships. Together, we are carrying out the Community Foundation Southwest Louisiana mission of connecting people who care with causes that matter.

Did you know the Greek root of philanthropy may be literally translated as “loving people”? A shining example of philanthropy is the Just Imagine SWLA 50 Year Resilience Plan which was sparked by a transformational $2.5 million gift to the Community Foundation from Angela and David Filo. That generosity launched our community’s vision, the Just Imagine SWLA plan, which continues to be implemented through a team effort. 2025 saw the opening of the first phase of the Mid City Neighborhood Transformation project. When completed, the area will consist of more than 500 units of new, resilient, mixed-income housing at Lake and 18th Streets. Once completed in its entirety, the neighborhood will include a new park, buildings constructed to Fortified Gold standards, and opportunities for small businesses to start-up and thrive.

People are giving generously to causes that matter most to them, whether close to home or across the world. This year, individuals, families and companies who give through charitable funds at the Community Foundation, such as Donor Advised Funds, gave over $2.4 million to 188 organizations! Through their generosity, these donors advanced missions in education, social services, and arts and culture. A local Mardi Gras krewe created a fund to offer a unique way to honor members of their Royal Court. This was the first fund of its kind established at the Community Foundation and will be used to support meaningful causes selected by the Krewe of Mystique.

Nonprofits in our region are fortunate that some individuals and families choose to create endowment funds to support their favorite causes both during their lifetimes and through their wills. Recent examples include a family establishing funds to benefit Catholic Charities and the Haiti Education Mission at Good Shepherd Episcopal Church, as well as another family whose endowment supports the Children’s Museum of Southwest Louisiana. These legacy funds ensure that the causes chosen by the donors will be supported forever.

Some individuals choose to establish endowments that are funded entirely through their wills. One such individual was Beverly Schalon, a longtime chemist and quality professional at PPG, who passed away last December. Beverly created an endowment fund to provide annual support for causes that were important to her and her late husband, David, including their three universities, United Way of Southwest Louisiana, and the Community Foundation.

Corporate partners play a vital role in our region’s philanthropy through the Community Foundation. Area industries, in collaboration with the Foundation, are providing scholarships through their Women in Industry program. Sempra Energy funds career coaching and counseling for their scholarship recipients at SOWELA. Cameron LNG’s Employee Giving Program provides quarterly grants to local nonprofits selected by their employees. Through Woodside Energy’s LEAD Program at Sulphur High School, students selected the Just Imagine project focused on Strong Downtowns. The mural on the side of Village Coffee House, along with the planter boxes and banners throughout downtown Sulphur, showcases the leadership skills students gained and the community impact made possible through corporate philanthropy.

We love sharing these stories through the American Press, social media and in person with civic clubs, classrooms, and community groups across SWLA—from Rotary clubs to Boards of local nonprofits. If you or your organization would like to learn more about supporting a cause that is important to you, we’d be glad to visit and continue the conversation.

Fossil fuel–backed activists and groups have for years been spreading misinformation about wind turbines harming whales.","Think of the Washington Monument. Imagine it sitting on the surface of the sea, with blades as long as a football field slowly spinning. It’s futuristic and white with rounded edges, like a rocketship. But there are no blasts or flares. There is no noise at all but calling gulls.

Sitting on the stern of a shrimp boat in early November, this is what I saw. The captain steered us directly under one of two ​“pilot” turbines. In the distance, I saw foundations for 176 more, poking a few dozen feet out of the sea. The Hoover Dam came to mind, another landmark feat of energy engineering. Each new turbine will be roughly the same height as the famous dam, from blade tip to the surf below.

“Why do people think they are an eyesore? Doesn’t bother me none,” said the captain, Bob Crisher, a commercial fisherman. He’s in favor of the wind farm and believes it will bring down his electricity bills.

Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, America’s largest planned offshore wind farm, was then being built about 27 miles east of Virginia Beach. It’s slated to power up to 660,000 homes in a region with the highest concentration of data centers in the world. With energy demand skyrocketing and electricity costs rising, Virginia needs the last construction push on this project to go smoothly. The developer, utility Dominion Energy, promised the turbines would start feeding the grid by March 2026.

How quickly things fell apart.

Last week, the Trump administration ordered a pause on all five in-progress offshore wind projects in America — including Virginia’s — citing unspecified risks to ​“national security.” It was the largest blow yet to a once-growing industry that Trump has brought to its knees in just 11 months. While Trump spent much of 2025 slowing the incredible rise of renewables, his unrelenting war on so-called ​“windmills” has been more vicious and personal.

In many ways, Trump’s attacks on offshore wind this year encapsulate this new era of politics. He throttles long-held norms in favor of retribution and personal grievance, acting with dizzying speed. He contorts facts and pushes officials in his administration to do the same.

Left in the wake are everyday citizens — including dozens I’ve interviewed over the past year — who are losing the prospect of good-paying jobs. They and their neighbors are also losing access to public goods like lower emissions, revitalized ports, reliable electricity, and a buffer against skyrocketing power bills driven by an AI boom.

Trump’s grudge against offshore wind began more than a decade ago, when he tried — and failed — to stop 11 turbines from being built within view of one of his Scottish golf courses. He has been disparaging offshore wind turbines as ​“ugly” and ​“eyesores” ever since.

He cranked up the intensity when he embarked on his second presidential campaign in 2023, branding big ocean turbines as dangerous. “[W]indmills are causing whales to die in numbers never seen before,” he said that year — a false statement. Still, attacking offshore wind seemed little more than an odd punchline for his campaign rallies. After all, the Trump administration backed the sector for much of his first presidential term, executing multiple offshore wind auctions that had been queued up by the Obama administration.

But Trump’s hyperactive second term has turned fringe movements and personal grudges into full-blown policies. Like his attacks on vaccines and higher education, his blitz on offshore wind farms is having far-reaching implications that will take years to fully enumerate.

Here’s some initial accounting: In-development wind projects have been paused, delayed, and paused again. One fell apart. Two are essentially mothballed after Trump sunsetted wind tax credits. Port revitalizations got cancelled. Developers lost billions. Related manufacturing is drying up. Tens of thousands of once-promised jobs may never be created. Workers already on the job are sitting idle.

One Trump-voting fisherman called the president’s anti-wind campaign ​“madness.”

But while vaccines and universities will endure through Trump’s political attacks, in one form or another, the U.S. offshore wind industry may not. Despite the ubiquity of offshore turbines in northern Europe and China, there is only one large-scale wind farm fully operational in American waters today. When Trump moved back into the White House, the industry was just taking off.

J. Timmons Roberts, a Brown University professor of environmental studies who tracks opposition to offshore wind, put it simply: ​“They’re killing the baby while it’s still in the cradle.”

Dismantling offshore wind

When Trump’s first term ended, there were no federally approved plans for offshore wind farms. When President Joe Biden left office, there were nearly a dozen — and at least 40 more were in various stages of planning and early development in waters along the East Coast from Maine down to the Carolinas, across the Gulf of Mexico, and along the California coast.

But, on the first day of his second term, Trump signed an executive order that froze offshore wind permitting, blocking proposed projects that didn’t already have federal approval. And he ordered a new review of the projects that did have federal permits but were not yet fully completed, throwing their future into doubt. (The executive order was ultimately struck down by a federal court on December 9.)

Unease amongst state leaders, developers, and investors immediately took root.

Within days, the first permitted project began to fall apart due to ​“uncertainty” over federal actions. In late January, Shell — one of two developers of the Atlantic Shores wind farm slated to be built east of New Jersey — announced it was withdrawing from the project. New Jersey then abandoned plans to purchase power from the installation. The final blow came weeks later when Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency revoked a Clean Air Act permit for the project. One former EPA official called the move ​“unusual.”

Research cuts and funding clawbacks soon followed.

In May, Lincoln Varnum was called into his supervisor’s office at the University of Maine, where he worked as an instrumentation engineer. Varnum was one of nine employees laid off from the university’s high-profile engineering and offshore-wind research center due to the Trump administration pausing funding. The administration also cancelled federal funding for Maine’s first floating offshore wind array, which had been fully permitted; the project was then mothballed.

“I obviously got a little emotional in the meeting … Something that I cared about was getting terminated,” Varnum told me. ​“It was also the first time I had ever been laid off.”

He sees himself and others who’ve been working on offshore wind as collateral damage.

In the following weeks, Varnum, who once identified as a conservative, was hopeful that Maine’s Republican members of Congress would speak up about the funding cuts, but none of them did — not even Sen. Susan Collins, a long-time offshore-wind supporter. He described Collins’ silence as ​“rough,” especially since he had voted for Collins in the past.

“We’re a poor state. We need industry. To have a new industry that is unique to us, floating offshore wind, now targeted by the feds … It feels like a kick in the teeth,” said Varnum.

Trump yanked funding in other ways.

In September, the Department of Transportation pulled back $679 million for infrastructure projects that supported offshore wind, including one that would have cleaned up and revitalized a massive California port. Mandy Davis, a California resident and anti-wind activist, aligns herself with Trump’s false narrative that turbines harm the ocean environment. She was elated by cuts that might block turbine construction in California’s waters, but her joy was short-lived.

In November, when the Trump administration announced plans for new oil drilling off the California coast, she told me it was a ​“betrayal.”

New England communities, which spent over a decade preparing to build America’s first offshore wind farms, also felt betrayed. Prior to Trump’s December halt, two massive projects had been paused by the Interior Department earlier in the year. One of the projects, Revolution Wind off the coast of Rhode Island, was already 80 percent completed.

“It’s like having the rug pulled out from under you,” Jack Morris, a Massachusetts-based scalloper and Trump voter, told me earlier this year. ​“Nobody understands why Trump did it. I don’t know what Trump’s agenda is.”

Revolution Wind had employed 80 local fishermen, including Morris, to help with construction. The project’s pause caused Morris and others to lose some of the part-time income that has them pay their bills as fishing revenues dry up.

The stop-work orders for Revolution Wind and New York’s Empire Wind were each lifted or reversed after about a month. But some damage was permanent. According to Harrison Sholler, an energy analyst for BloombergNEF, the orders were a signal to companies that America is not a sound investment. Foreign firms had invested heavily in the sector, lost billions, and are now looking for the door.

Trump’s more sweeping wind halt last week only reinforced that assessment.

What America lost

“What exactly will America have lost? How do you even begin to answer that question?” pondered Elizabeth Wilson, a professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth College.

We could start by looking at how much new electricity capacity won’t be added to America’s increasingly strained grid.

Before Trump was elected last November, BNEF expected 39 gigawatts of offshore wind to be built in the U.S. by 2035. BNEF’s latest forecast is for just 6 gigawatts by 2035 — and even that number could come down thanks to Trump’s latest pause.

Another lens is employment. Together, the five wind farms currently underway have been slated to generate about 10,000 jobs. Now some of the highly skilled workers who have already trained for those projects face an uncertain future. And the 77,000 offshore wind jobs that the Biden administration had projected the country would see in the coming decades may never materialize.

Varnum, the laid-off engineer, said that if Maine’s nascent offshore wind industry rises from the ashes sometime in the future, he ​“certainly would want to help. It’s not something I’m turning my back on.”

He has since found a job working for a hydroelectric company. But Varnum said he fears for America’s energy future and how far Trump might take his broader war on carbon-free energy. The president has already boosted fossil-fuel production and nuclear power while trying to tamp down clean energy. His political revenge against offshore wind may be paving the way for more.

“The guy torpedoes us on Day One and how far is he going to go? How far will this go?” wonders Varnum.

Wilson of Dartmouth says that Trump’s assault on offshore wind is ultimately a battle over facts and truth.

Fossil fuel–backed activists and groups have for years been spreading misinformation about wind turbines harming whales. They lit the match and Trump fanned the flames. The president ranted and made false claims about offshore wind throughout 2025, in front of reporters, foreign heads of state, and the entire United Nations General Assembly

“There’s no proof, right? There are no receipts,” Sen. Martin Heinrich, Democrat of New Mexico, told me in June. He said the administration hid the report and then used the permitting process as a ​“political tool,” something he sees as typical of ​“a banana republic.”

Without new offshore turbines going up, millions of households across the Northeast will soon pay more money for dirtier and less reliable electricity. According to a recent report, offshore wind power could help keep the lights on year-round in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, especially during harsh winter weather when gas plants can fail. Cuts to planet-warming pollution, mandated by several East Coast states, are also now out of reach. All signs point to Trump’s second term creating a hotter and less affordable future for Americans.

Few people interviewed for this story expressed hope that the damage from Trump’s war on ​“windmills” could be reversed anytime soon.

“What Trump really killed was hope,” said Wilson. ​“And what is the value of hope?”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/CVOW-pic_2026-01-01-003028_vjrk.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=86fdfe6f13b9f5c28b31fafce2c01c83,N,,2025-12-31 19:57:21.628712

The move to keep the Craig plant open had been expected for weeks .
“Going backwards is an attempt to force local communities to foot the bill to extend plant operations, and will cost energy consumers more.
Craig Mayor Chris Nichols welcomed the news of the emergency order, but stated that Craig should continue the work of preparing for a possible economic transition within the community.
“Those needless costs are likely to be borne by electricity customers in Colorado and nearby states,” Earth Justice stated.","President Donald Trump’s Energy Department is ordering a coal-burning power plant in northwest Colorado to remain open just one day before it was scheduled to shut down.

U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright issued an emergency order on Tuesday requiring Craig Station’s Unit 1 plant in Moffat County to keep running until at least March 30, 2026, with an extension possible. The plant was set to close on Wednesday, Dec. 31.

The order was issued under section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, which allows the Energy Department to keep power plants running during times of crisis, such as war or energy shortages. The move to keep the Craig plant open had been expected for weeks .

Wright’s order claims that Colorado and other Western states face an energy “emergency” due to a “shortage of electric energy, a shortage of facilities for the generation of electric energy, and other causes.”

The closure of coal-burning plants “could lead to the loss of power to homes,” the order states, as well as “businesses in the areas that may be affected by curtailments or power outages, presenting a risk to public health and safety.”

The Trump administration has used similar justifications under the Federal Power Act to keep open coal plants in Michigan and Washington, as well as an oil plant in Pennsylvania.

Gov. Jared Polis, in a statement on Wednesday, condemned the decision, claiming that keeping the Craig plant open will “pass tens of millions in costs to Colorado rate payers.”

He added that the plant is “broken and not needed.”

“Ludicrously, the coal plant isn’t even operational right now, meaning repairs — to the tune of millions of dollars — just to get it running, all on the backs of rural Colorado ratepayers!” Polis stated. “Going backwards is an attempt to force local communities to foot the bill to extend plant operations, and will cost energy consumers more. Today’s action flies in the face of this careful planning, is inconsistent with market forces, and will hurt Coloradans.”

The Craig Press sent questions to Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, the utility cooperative that operates Craig Station, asking whether claims that the plant is “broken” are accurate and how it plans to respond to the emergency order.

A spokesperson said that Tri-State received the order at 6 p.m. last night and responded to questions with a statement saying that the plant, as a result of the order, “will likely require additional investments in operations, repairs, maintenance and, potentially, fuel supply, all factors increasing costs.”

Tri-State co-owns Craig Station’s Unit 1 alongside other utility providers, including Xcel Energy, the Platte River Power Authority and PacifiCorp.

“Tri-State has a policy of 100% compliance, and we will work with (the plant’s) co-owners, and federal and state governments to determine the most cost-effective path to that end,” said Tri-State CEO Duane Highley, in a statement.

“We are continuing to review the order to determine what this means for Craig Station employees and operations, and the financial impacts,” Highley’s statement continued. “As a not-for-profit cooperative, our membership will bear the costs of compliance with this order unless we can identify a method to share costs with those in the region. There is not a clear path for doing so, but we will continue to evaluate our options.”

Tri-State originally decided to close the plant by the end of 2025 as part of its move to more environmentally-friendly energy sources. It plans to close the Craig station’s two other coal-burning plants by 2028.

The effort is partly driven by a state law that requires large-scale utility providers to reach 100% renewable electrical energy by 2050. Tri-State is also looking to transition to other energy sources for economic reasons, it said.

Craig Mayor Chris Nichols welcomed the news of the emergency order, but stated that Craig should continue the work of preparing for a possible economic transition within the community.

“It’s great for the community to keep those jobs active, even for a short period,” Nichols said in an interview on Wednesday. “But we need to continue what we’re going to do to replace good-paying jobs in the community, because it’s a short-term extension.”

U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd, a Western Slope Republican whose sweeping 3rd Congressional District includes Moffat County, praised the emergency order in a statement on Wednesday, saying that Colorado’s energy policy “has been driven by ideology instead of reality.”

“Plants were scheduled to close to satisfy political timelines, even though the power was still needed and local economies would feel the loss,” stated Hurd, who has pushed for the Trump administration to keep another coal plant running in Pueblo , which is also in his district.

The state’s energy office and environmental advocates, however, are deeply critical of the decision.

Colorado Energy Office Executive Director Will Toor, in a statement, questioned the U.S. Energy Department’s use of the Federal Power Act, which he said provides the federal government “limited authority” to act during emergencies.

“Colorado does not have an energy emergency,” Toor stated.” In fact, the state, along with the rest of the region, has some of the most reliable power systems in the country.”

Toor pointed to a recent report by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation , a nonprofit regulatory group that assesses grid conditions and develops standards, that found there are no short- or long-term elevated reliability risks in the Rocky Mountain region.

The environmental group Earth Justice, also in a statement , claimed the emergency order was “illegal” and failed to provide evidence of any “actual emergency.”

The group also cited an analysis by Grid Strategies , a consulting firm that supports more clean energy, showing that if the plant remains open and generates its average output of the last few years, costs could rise to $20 million over 90 days, or approximately $85 million per year.

“Those needless costs are likely to be borne by electricity customers in Colorado and nearby states,” Earth Justice stated.

How much will be cut? And which tax?

Don’t believe candidates for the Governor’s Mansion (in either party) who pledge that they will eliminate state income taxes — no matter how loudly or how often they say it. For starters, the South Carolina governor doesn’t have the authority to unilaterally change tax policy. Period. That is entirely up to the 170-member Legislature.

Sen. Sean Bennett, who a year ago was considering a bid for governor, calls those campaign promises “pie in the sky.”

“They sound good, particularly in election years on the stump: ‘Let’s just eliminate our income tax,'” said the Summerville Republican.

The financial planner calculates the move would require at least doubling the state’s 6% sales tax: “I wish we wouldn’t waste time chasing that shiny lure.”

He is hopeful, however, about traction on the type of sweeping changes to the state tax code he’s advocated for years.

Legislation that further cuts state income taxes is in the Senate’s court, after passing the House by a vote of 68-46 in May during the last week of the 2025 legislative session.

What Congress did two months later provided a boost to state House GOP leadership’s arguments, though probably not in the way you’d think.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which President Donald Trump signed July 4, is expected to reduce state income taxes by $515.4 million in the fiscal year starting July 1, according to a recent analysis by the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office. The state’s revenue forecasters expect the federal law to further reduce collections by $244 million in 2027-28 and $251 million in 2028-29, when some of its major provisions — such as no taxes on tips or overtime — will phase out, leaving tax impacts beyond that a mystery.

But there’s a giant “if” in those predictions. The reductions will occur if the Legislature adopts the federal tax code changes.

That’s what the General Assembly normally does: South Carolina is among just a handful of states to tax “federal taxable income.”

The argument for decoupling

But a major reason that House Republicans gave last session in pushing their tax restructuring plan was to decouple South Carolina’s income tax code from the federal system.

House GOP leaders recently told the SC Daily Gazette they believe the Trump-signed tax law — and state forecasters’ analysis of its impact to state tax collections — increase the need for South Carolina to untether and do its own thing.

“It shows what happens when we give away the tax-making authority of the General Assembly to Washington,” said Rep. Brandon Newton of Lancaster, chairman of House Ways and Means’ tax policy subcommittee, which advanced the bill he co-sponsored.

“We can’t be at the mercy of whatever D.C. does, whether it’s President Trump or President AOC,” he continued, referring to progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, while stressing, “even though I agree with the changes made by President Trump.”

More importantly for the bill’s chances, the Senate’s budget chief agrees.

“We want to decouple from the feds,” said Senate Finance Chairman Harvey Peeler, R-Gaffney. “South Carolina doesn’t need to depend on Congress.”

Bennett, who chairs two of Senate Finance’s regular subcommittees, believes the “Big Beautiful Bill” not only strengthens the case that state tax collections should not be “dependent on the whims of the federal government,” it highlights the need for a total overhaul.

“Let us decouple and put together a South Carolina-focused, South Carolina-centric tax policy that supports our budget,” he said.

For him, that means making changes to the entire tax structure, not just further chipping away at income taxes. And for the first time in his 13 years in the Senate, he said, he senses a real possibility of that happening.

Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey said the debate should include finding a way to reduce property taxes. Those are the taxes he gets the most complaints about, he said, even though they’re collected by counties, not the state, to fund local government services and schools.

“I’m all for a further reduction in income taxes,” said the Edgefield Republican. However, “I don’t have any constituents telling me we should eliminate income taxes.”

Changing appearances

The bill passed by the House would reduce income tax collections overall by $400.3 million in year one.

House GOP advances new plan that initially cuts SC income taxes by $400M

That would not, however, benefit all taxpayers immediately. Whether you would pay less in the proposal’s first year depends on your income and how you file: 42% of filers would see a cut, 24% would owe more, while 33% would see no change whatsoever, according to the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office.

That’s an improvement from the bill as originally filed, which Republicans announced with much fanfare in the Statehouse lobby before the state’s fiscal experts could dissect it — an odd, cart-before-the-horse move. After their analysis showed the bill would actually increase taxes for nearly 60% of filers, the public backlash prompted a rewrite.

The amended bill collapses the state’s three tax rates into two, instead of moving to a single flat tax rate immediately, while promising to get there through a multi-year phase-in.

House GOP leaders point to the 2022 law that cut income taxes by more than $1 billion as proof that will happen sooner than later. That phase-in was expected to take five years. Instead, it was completed by the budget that took effect July 1.

That law passed unanimously in both chambers. Opposition to the current House GOP plan comes from two directions: The hardline House Freedom Caucus insists on the immediate elimination of state income taxes — which, by the way, still make up more than 40% of the state’s general fund revenue. Democrats argue it’s unnecessary and potentially harmful to the state’s fiscal health.

As I wrote back in April about the original bill, the push wasn’t really about cutting taxes — at least, not in year one. It’s about removing what the House’s chief budget writer, Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister, calls the state’s “glaring black eye”: a tax structure that seems to be the highest in the Southeast, even though it’s not.

Even with completion of the 2022 law, the state’s top marginal income tax rate is 6%. That appears uncompetitive to our neighbors and beyond. Politicians like to point to that 6% rate when they tell voters that South Carolinians pay the highest taxes in the region. That claim is malarkey.

Because South Carolina taxes “federal taxable income,” rather than adjusted gross income as most states do, South Carolinians start their state tax forms with less income to tax, compared to what they’d file if they lived across the state border.

Their effective tax rate — what people actually pay — is comparatively low. Roughly 45% of tax filers actually pay no state income taxes at all.

Republicans want a “fair and flat” tax code that makes South Carolina stand out as a low-tax state, rather than appear the opposite. But numbers can be deceiving. That’s why the original proposal that brought the tax rate to a flat 3.99% in one fell swoop actually increased most people’s taxes.

If the Legislature adopts the tax code changes in the “Big, Beautiful Bill,” the overall cut to state income taxes would be bigger in the coming fiscal year: $515 million compared to the House GOP plan’s $400 million.

But the state’s tax rate would still appear out of whack.

“We’d still have the sticker shock problem,” Bannister told the Gazette.

“We need to get the rate down,” he said. “If we cut $500 million, we ought to do it in a way that lets us celebrate a historic tax rate decrease, not just that we’re following the feds.”

The House GOP plan would further put in state law the goal of someday, eventually eliminating state income taxes.

Just conforming to the federal code would make it “almost impossible” to also pass a bill restructuring state taxes, Bannister said.

The next move will be decided in Peeler’s committee after the Legislature returns Jan. 13.

The House bill, said the Gaffney Republican, is “heading in the right direction.”

Peeler said he wants to make sure whatever the Senate passes is an actual tax cut — a not-so-veiled swipe at the original House plan.

And, further emphasizing that the Senate will pass something, he repeated a line he’s known to make: “You can’t out-cut Harvey Peeler.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/income-tax-newser.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 21:12:36.800537

The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed a new Waters of the U.S. rule aimed at giving farmers and ranchers clearer guidance on what qualifies as a regulated waterway.

The proposed rule would revise how federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act is defined, a long-standing issue for agriculture where uncertainty over ditches, ponds, and seasonal waterways has raised compliance concerns.

“I think farmers need to express that this is a positive rule moving in the right direction, and express their support for the rule,” says Courtney Briggs, senior director of government affairs for the American Farm Bureau Federation.

Briggs says the updated definition could help landowners better understand when federal permits are required and when normal farming practices can continue without added regulation.

Briggs continues, “It’s important that the EPA and the Army Corps hear the voice of agriculture. They can go to regulations.gov and search for WOTUS and provide their comments there, or on our website at fb.org, searching WOTUS, and you can go to our advocacy page, and we have set it up for our members to engage.”

The American Farm Bureau Federation urges farmers and ranchers to weigh in before the public comment period closes. The organization says producer input is critical to ensure the rule provides clarity, consistency, and protects both water quality and agricultural operations.

“Folks have until January 5 to provide comments, and then the rest of the regulatory process needs to play out.

Trump vetoed drinking water pipeline legislation from Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, a longtime ally who broke with the president in November to release files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He also vetoed legislation that would have given the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida more control of some of its tribal lands. The tribe was among groups suing the administration over an immigration detention center in the Everglades known as “ Alligator Alcatraz.”

Both bills had bipartisan support and had been noncontroversial until the White House announced Trump’s vetoes Tuesday night.

Trump appeared to acknowledge the tribe’s opposition to the detention facility in a letter to Congress explaining his veto. “The Miccosukee Tribe has actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected,” Trump wrote.

Trump did not allude to Boebert in his veto of her legislation, but raised concerns about the cost of the water pipeline at the heart of that bill.

Boebert, one of four House Republicans who sided with House Democrats early on to force the release of the Epstein files, shared a statement on social media suggesting that the veto may have been “political retaliation.”

“I sincerely hope this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation for calling out corruption and demanding accountability. Americans deserve leadership that puts people over politics,” her statement said. Boebert added in another post: “This isn’t over.”

The Florida legislation had been sponsored by Republican Rep. Carlos Gimenez, whom Trump has endorsed. Gimenez and the Miccosukee Tribe were not immediately available for comment on Wednesday.

When asked whether the vetoes were punishment, the White House did not answer and instead referred to Trump’s statements explaining the vetoes.

Congress can override the vetoes by a vote of two-thirds of the members of the House and the Senate, but it’s unclear if there’s enough support in the Republican-controlled chambers to do so, especially heading into a midterm election year where many of them will be on the ballot and many GOP members will count on Trump’s backing.

Boebert’s legislation, the “Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act,” aimed to improve access to clean drinking water in eastern Colorado.

While the congresswoman has long been a staunch supporter of Trump, she found herself at odds with the president with her support this year for legislation that required the Justice Department to release files related to Epstein.

Trump fought the proposal before reversing in the face of growing Republican support for releasing the files. Members of his administration even met with Boebert in the White House Situation Room to discuss the matter, though she didn’t change her mind.

Republican Rep. Jeff Hurd of Colorado, who co-sponsored the legislation, said he was “deeply disappointed” by Trump’s veto.

“This was a bipartisan, unanimous bill passed by Congress to uphold a long-standing federal commitment to southeastern Colorado,” Hurd said in a statement.

He said the legislation did not authorize any new construction spending or expand the federal government’s original commitment to the pipeline project, but adjusted the terms of repaying its costs.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1411b20/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4123x2165+0+292/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F97%2Fd5%2Fdd1324de49689afa2657d24e1e28%2Fb49f83efca014b49855589bd6e1894ba.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 17:58:45.094773

The group has cited filings showing that compliance with earlier DOE orders at J.H.","A rapid succession of Section 202(c) emergency orders has forced utilities to keep more than 2 GW of coal capacity online in December alone, marking an unprecedented federal intervention in grid operations and triggering legal challenges from states and environmental groups. Across all orders issued since May 2025, the DOE has now stalled the retirement of at least 4.5 GW of coal capacity.

The Department of Energy (DOE) issued four additional Section 202(c) emergency orders in December, directing utilities and grid operators to halt the retirement of coal-fired units—a combined capacity of more than 2 GW—across three regions: the Pacific Northwest, Midwest, and Mountain West. The new orders extend the Trump administration’s unprecedented run of federal grid interventions to at least 16 separate orders since May 2025.

On December 30, the DOE ordered co-owners of the 430-MW Craig Station Unit 1 in Colorado to maintain the coal-fired unit’s availability through March 30, 2026. Earlier, on December 23, the DOE issued directives requiring CenterPoint Energy and Northern Indiana Public Service Co. to keep three coal units—Unit 2 at F.B. Culley and Units 17 and 18 at the Schahfer station in Indiana—online through March 23. The orders follow a December 16 directive to TransAlta to keep Centralia Generating Station Unit 2 in Washington available through March 16.

Since May, the DOE has significantly expanded its use of Section 202(c) authority to compel the continued operation of generation and transmission assets deemed critical to grid reliability. Orders have repeatedly required utilities, independent system operators, and balancing authorities to override planned retirements, environmental operating limits, and market-based outcomes by mandating unit availability, extended run-hours, and coordinated operating measures to address projected supply shortfalls. Although each directive is time-limited—most spanning 60 to 90 days—their cumulative frequency and broad geographic reach represent a marked escalation in federal intervention in day-to-day grid operations.

Federal Grid Interventions: The Timeline of Section 202(c) Orders in 2025

Since May 2025, the Department of Energy (DOE) has issued 16 emergency orders under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act directing grid operators and utilities to maintain specified fossil fuel units and other infrastructure. In May, DOE issued separate orders to MISO to keep the J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan online (May 23), renewed the order in August (Aug. 20), and extended it again on Nov. 18 through Feb. 17, 2026. Similar emergency directives have targeted Constellation Energy’s Eddystone generating units in Pennsylvania (orders issued in May and August, extended on Nov. 25 through Feb. 24, 2026), Talen Energy’s Wagner station in PJM (orders issued in July and October, continuing through Dec. 31, 2025), Duke Energy Carolinas units during extreme weather on June 24–25, and PREPA generation and transmission assets in Puerto Rico (orders issued in May, renewed in August, and extended on Nov. 12 through Feb. 10, 2026).

Additional December orders extended federal intervention to three new regions: TransAlta’s Centralia Unit 2 in Washington (Dec. 16 through March 16, 2026), Northern Indiana Public Service Company’s Schahfer Units 17 and 18 (Dec. 23 through March 23, 2026), CenterPoint Energy’s Culley Unit 2 in Indiana (Dec. 23 through March 23, 2026), and Tri-State’s Craig Station Unit 1 in Colorado (Dec. 30 through March 30, 2026).

So far, at least nine of the 16 Section 202(c) orders have targeted coal-fired units, collectively preventing the retirement of more than 4.5 GW of coal capacity across Michigan, Pennsylvania, Washington, Indiana, and Colorado through early 2026. For reference, approximately 166-172 GW of coal capacity was operational in the U.S. as of mid-2025, according to the Energy Information Administration.

DOE Overrides Colorado Regulators on Craig Unit 1 Closure

The most recent order, issued December 30, directs Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, a not-for-profit generation and transmission electric cooperative, and its four co-owners—Platte River Power Authority, Salt River Project, PacifiCorp, and Xcel Energy—to keep Unit 1 at the Craig Station in northwestern Colorado available to operate through March 30, 2026.

Craig Station is a three-unit coal-fired generating plant located near Craig in northwestern Colorado and operated by Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association. The facility has a combined nameplate capacity of 1,427.6 MW, consisting of Unit 1 (446.4 MW), Unit 2 (446.4 MW), and Unit 3 (534.8 MW). While Unit 1 was scheduled to cease operations on Dec. 31, 2025, Units 2 and 3 were slated for retirement in 2028.

Unit 1’s planned retirement stems from a September 2016 agreement among the Craig Station owners—Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, PacifiCorp, Platte River Power Authority, Salt River Project, and Public Service Company of Colorado—with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and environmental groups to revise Colorado’s regional haze State Implementation Plan (SIP). The agreement followed a 2014 SIP that required significant reductions in nitrogen oxides at Unit 1 by August 2021. After reviewing compliance options—including installing additional emissions controls and switching fuels—the unit’s owners opted to seek an extension and commit to unit retirement, citing regulatory conditions, market outlooks, and the substantial cost of further emissions controls.

But, in its Dec. 30 order, the DOE said it relied in part on findings from the North American Electric Reliability Corp.’s (NERC’s) 2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment, which identified growing reliability risks in the Western Electricity Coordinating Council’s (WECC’s) Northwest assessment area—covering Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming—amid accelerating baseload retirements. The DOE cited NERC’s projections that 5 GW “of baseload resource retirements are anticipated between 2024 and 2028.” It also pointed to the 2024 WECC Western Assessment of Resource Adequacy that found that peak demand in WECC’s Northwest-Central subregion (which includes Colorado) is “forecast to grow by 8.5% over the next decade, from 33 GW in 2025 to 36 GW in 2034.” WECC, the DOE noted, found most planned retirements involve “baseload generation, such as coal, natural gas, and nuclear.”

The DOE also cited the pace of generation retirements in Colorado, noting that since 2019, 571.3 MW of coal-fired capacity across six units at three sites have retired, reducing coal’s share of in-state generation from 45% to 28%. Looking ahead, the department pointed to Energy Information Administration projections showing that by 2029, about 3,700 MW of coal-fired generating capacity in Colorado is scheduled to retire—accounting for all but one coal-fired power plant in the state—alongside the retirement of 675.6 MW of natural gas-fired generating capacity. In contrast, intermittent wind resources accounted for more than 5,300 MW of Colorado’s electricity-generating capacity in 2025.

Ultimately, the DOE said it determined that “an emergency exists within the WECC Northwest assessment area due to a shortage of electric energy, a shortage of facilities for the generation of electric energy, and other causes.” It concluded that continued operation of Craig Unit 1 “will best meet the emergency and serve the public interest.” The agency also warned that if retired, a coal unit like Craig Unit 1 would be difficult to restart, and it said that “any stop and start of operation creates heating and cooling cycles that could cause an immediate failure that could take 30–60 days to repair,” with workforce, contract, and permitting constraints further extending restoration timelines.

Under the order, Tri-State and the unit’s co-owners will need to take all measures necessary to ensure Craig Unit 1 remains available to operate at the direction of either the Western Area Power Administration’s Rocky Mountain Region (Western Area Colorado–Missouri) in its role as balancing authority or Southwest Power Pool West in its role as reliability coordinator, as applicable, with sufficient time for orderly ramp-down following the order’s conclusion consistent with industry practices.

The DOE order, notably, halts a retirement that appeared central to Tri-State’s broader clean energy transition strategy. In August 2025, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission approved Tri-State’s 2023 Electric Resource Plan, which included Craig Unit 1’s scheduled retirement as part of a portfolio shift toward natural gas, renewables, and battery storage. Tri-State, which has been pursuing expanded participation in organized wholesale markets, also received Colorado PUC approval in December 2025 for its application to join Southwest Power Pool’s Western Energy Imbalance Service market—while simultaneously managing member exits and securing replacement capacity.

It is unclear if the forced extension of Craig Unit 1 through March 2026 disrupts that timeline and creates uncertainty for Tri-State and its member cooperatives, particularly given the DOE’s (now defunct) Grid Deployment Office terminated Tri-State’s $26.8 million Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) Program award earlier this year, eliminating federal support for grid modernization projects that were intended to support the utility’s transition away from coal.

DOE Extends MISO Coal Units to Address Year-Round Reliability Gaps

On December 23, meanwhile, the DOE issued two separate emergency orders requiring Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) and CenterPoint Energy to maintain five coal-fired units online through March 23, 2026. The directives affect NIPSCO’s Schahfer Generating Station Units 17 and 18—which are each rated at 423.5 MW and slated for retirement at year-end—and CenterPoint Energy’s F.B. Culley Generating Station Unit 2 (103.7 MW), also scheduled to retire in December 2025.

The R.M. Schahfer Generating Station, located in Wheatfield, Indiana, is owned and operated by Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO), a division of NiSource Inc. The plant consists of four units: two natural gas–fired units (129 MW each) and two coal-fired units—Units 17 and 18—each rated at 423.5 MW, for a combined coal capacity of 847 MW. Units 17 and 18 entered service in 1983 and 1986, respectively, and were approved for retirement by MISO following NIPSCO’s Attachment Y Suspension Notice, with coal combustion scheduled to cease by Dec. 31, 2025 absent a directive to remain open. In October 2025, NIPSCO formally notified Indiana regulators that the units were on track for permanent retirement under federal effluent limitation guidelines, but confirmed that cessation of coal combustion—and associated environmental compliance milestones—would depend on the absence of a reliability-driven order compelling continued operation.

The F.B. Culley Generating Station, located in Warrick County, Indiana, is owned and operated by CenterPoint Energy. The coal-fired facility consists of Unit 2 (103.7 MW) and Unit 3 (265.2 MW), for a combined nameplate capacity of 368.9 MW. Unit 2 entered service in 1966 and Unit 3 in 1973, with Unit 2 scheduled to retire in December 2025 under CenterPoint’s long-term generation transition strategy. In its 2023 Integrated Resource Plan, filed with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, CenterPoint outlined a plan to end coal-fired generation in Indiana by 2027 and replace Culley’s coal output with a mix of renewable resources and natural gas-fired generation to meet new, more stringent MISO capacity requirements across all four seasons. The plan identified conversion of Unit 3—the last remaining coal unit—to natural gas by 2027 to preserve roughly 270 MW of dispatchable capacity, while allowing Unit 2 to retire as planned.

In both orders—like its previous emergency orders—the DOE found that if retired, coal units would be difficult to restart, warning that “any stop and start of operation creates heating and cooling cycles that could cause an immediate failure that could take 30–60 days to repair,” with workforce availability, contract constraints, permitting requirements, and potential disassembly further extending restoration timelines. The agency therefore directed that the affected units remain available to operate through March 23, 2026, with dispatch coordinated by MISO to minimize costs to ratepayers.

Echoing its other orders, the DOE determined that “an emergency exists in portions of the Midwest region of the United States due to a shortage of electric energy, a shortage of facilities for the generation of electricity, and other causes.” It concluded that continued operation of the units “will meet the emergency and serve the public interest.”

In justifying the Midwest extensions, the DOE leaned heavily on reliability assessments from MISO and the NERC, citing evidence that resource adequacy risks in MISO have shifted from a seasonal issue to a year-round concern. The agency specifically pointed to MISO findings showing that “reliability risks associated with resource adequacy have shifted from ‘summer only’ to a year-round concern,” with more than 60% of MISO’s MaxGen emergency events—triggered when available generation is insufficient—occurring outside the traditional summer peak season. However, the DOE also cited MISO documentation attributing the shift to accelerating retirements of dispatchable generation, declining reserve margins, increased reliance on weather-dependent resources, and more frequent extreme weather.

Backlash Is Mounting

The orders come on the heels of the DOE’s December 16 emergency order directing TransAlta to ensure Unit 2 of the Centralia Generating Station in Centralia, Washington, remains available through March 16, 2026. The 730-MW coal unit, Washington’s last coal-fired power plant, was scheduled to shut down on December 31 under SB 5769, a state law that mandated closure by year-end.

So far, the Trump administration has issued more emergency orders in 2025 than in any prior comparable period over the past two decades, according to Congressional Research Service (CRS) analysis. The DOE’s emergency authority under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act is typically a rarely used provision that grants the Secretary of Energy broad discretion to temporarily override normal electricity market, regulatory, and environmental constraints during declared emergencies. According to the CRS, Section 202(c) allows DOE to “require by order such temporary connections of facilities and such generation, delivery, interchange, or transmission of electric energy as in its judgment will best meet the emergency and serve the public interest” when it determines that an emergency exists due to shortages of electric energy, generation facilities, fuel, or other causes. While the authority was originally designed to address short-term disruptions—such as extreme weather events, transmission outages, or sudden demand spikes—CRS notes that its use to delay long-planned power plant retirements represents a broader and increasingly contested interpretation of the statute.

The expanding wave of Section 202(c) orders, meanwhile, has already triggered swift and fierce opposition. Earlier this month, Washington Governor Bob Ferguson, Attorney General Nick Brown, and Ecology Director Casey Sixkiller jointly condemned the Centralia order, saying: “Under the guise of ’emergency powers,’ U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright is attempting to force Washington state’s dirtiest power plant to continue burning coal. Let’s be clear: there’s no emergency here.”

Similar resistance has followed the December 23 Indiana orders affecting coal units at Schahfer and Culley, with potentially far-reaching repercussions. Last week, the Sierra Club and Earthjustice filed the first-ever judicial challenge to DOE’s use of Section 202(c), asserting that the orders unlawfully override decisions made by utilities, state regulators, and grid operators. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a Request for Rehearing challenging DOE’s repeated extensions for the J.H. Campbell plant, arguing that the orders exceed DOE’s authority under the Federal Power Act and fail to satisfy statutory limits requiring operation only when necessary. “Nearly seven months into this fabricated emergency, what is now clear is that DOE will continue issuing these unlawful orders unless the courts intervene,” she wrote.

Cost and reliability concerns are also adding complexity. Earthjustice characterized the Indiana orders as “an unprecedented power grab” that overrides decisions made by power companies, grid operators, and state utility regulators, noting that the targeted coal plants were already deemed uneconomic and unreliable. The group has cited filings showing that compliance with earlier DOE orders at J.H. Campbell cost more than $80 million over several months—an average of more than $615,000 per day.

The group has also pointed to an independent Grid Strategies analysis—which the consulting group prepared for Earthjustice, the Environmental Defense Fund, NRDC, and the Sierra Club—that estimates federal mandates forcing large fossil plants scheduled to retire through 2028 to remain online could cost ratepayers between $3.1 billion and $5.9 billion per year, depending on how many units are subject to emergency orders. The August 2025 study assumes an average subsidy of $89,315 per MW-year, based on recent Reliability Must Run contracts used by regional grid operators, and suggests the estimate may be conservative. It notes that early cost data from federally mandated plant extensions already exceed $180,000 per MW-year in some cases",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/jh-campbell-complex-waterway-descriptor3.png,N,,2025-12-31 18:13:13.878078

That’s just one of the policy changes in Washington that clouded the outlook for the solar industry this year. Other tax credits for large, commercial solar installations are still available, but they’ll end years earlier than originally planned — per President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill passed in July.

And yet, according to the energy analytics firm Wood Mackenzie, solar made up 58% of all new energy generation through the first nine months of this year.

”I will borrow a phrase from a renowned author. ‘It was the best of times, and it was the worst of times’,” said Abigail Ross Harper with the Solar Energy Industries Association, describing solar energy’s 2025.

Solar companies now have a lot less time to qualify for federal tax credits. And, she said, some solar projects have had trouble getting federal permits.

“There have been delays and stoppages and just outright, like lack of response from federal agencies,” Ross Harper said.

And yet, we just keep building more solar. Partly, because those tax credits are going away.

“And that gives extra reason for developers to try to build their solar projects now,” said Daniel Cohan, a professor of environmental engineering at Rice University.

Solar is also growing because energy demand is rising fast. From new data centers, manufacturing plants, and electric vehicles.

“The only source of new power that can grow very quickly and scale up is solar. Every other source of energy has key barriers that keeps it from growing in the near term,” Cohan said.

New coal plants aren’t really a thing. The Trump administration has shut down several major offshore wind power projects. Nuclear power will take five to ten years to build, Cohan said. And new natural gas turbines are backlogged.

“There's only so much new natural gas power capacity that can be added anytime soon. That leaves solar as the biggest option and really, the only one that can be scaled up in the next few years,” he said.

It’s also gotten cheap. So have battery storage systems, said Rob Gramlich, head of the consulting firm Grid Strategies. Put solar panels and batteries together, and you can power the grid even when the sun isn’t shining.

“You can run most of the grid on solar through the afternoon and then into the evening, when you're still running air conditioning in the hot summers, then you have the batteries that were charged in the afternoon delivering power through the evening,” Gramlich said.

It’s been a really good year for that combo.

Paul MoseleyNorfolk political reporter

Plans for a large solar farm received a significant setback - while another reached a major milestone.

Developers of the 3,600-acre (1,460-hectare) Tasway Energy Park project near Long Stratton, Norfolk, said they had not been given a date to connect to the national grid system, meaning they were now ""reviewing the next steps"".

The Stop Tasway Solar campaign group, which has opposed the project over concerns of ""industrialisation of the countryside"", said it hoped it would now be withdrawn altogether.

However, the firm behind the nearby East Pye Solar scheme – which would cover almost 2,700 acres (1,090 hectares) – said it had been told it would get a connection to the national grid.

With its flat terrain and generally sunnier weather, Norfolk has been seen as an ideal place for solar farms – and several of the UK's largest have been proposed for the county.

The government has said such schemes are necessary to reduce energy bills, cut carbon emissions and provide better energy security.

But critics have warned about the loss of agricultural land and the impact on the look of the countryside.

And the largest solar farms have been controversial because, due to their classification as nationally significant infrastructure, final say on them rests with the government instead of local councils.

Earlier this month, the government-owned National Energy System Operator (NESO) told developers whether they would receive connections to the national grid.

Those deemed ""ready to go"" received ""Gate 2"" status, giving them a connection date to join the national power network.

Others were given ""Gate 1"", meaning they have no date for connection, but could move forward in the future.

Developer Island Green Power (IGP) said its East Pye project - stretched over a large area across villages including Hempnall, Great Moulton and Saxlingham Nethergate - had received ""Gate 2"" status.

IGP has said the site, which would cover 1,500 football pitches, would generate power for 115,000 homes a year.

Whilst the firm said it expected to formally seek approval from the government for its plans in February, campaign group Block East Pye Solar told the BBC it was ""taking legal advice"" on whether it could challenge the decision.

IGP also received positive news about its Droves solar and battery storage scheme, which would cover another 2,800 acres near the East Pye site.

Project manager Harman Sond said the government's planning inspectorate had agreed to inspect its proposals – which he described as ""a significant milestone"".

However, the firm did not confirm if it had been given a date for connecting to the grid.

The future of the Tasway project, though, which would also be built in south Norfolk, has been thrown into doubt.

It received ""Gate 1"" status and its developers, energy firm Aukera, said it was ""reviewing next steps"".

""This outcome will mean there will be a delay to the planning submission process,"" the company added.

Myles Jeeves, from Stop Tasway Solar, was pleased - but wanted to see the proposals completely scrapped.

""We think this is the right decision, given the existing projects in the area,"" he said.

""We hope Tasway will do the right thing and withdraw the scheme rather than hang it over all our heads.""

But the developers of the 4,000-acre (1,619-hectare) High Grove project, planned for five sites near Swaffham and Dereham in Norfolk, would not disclose what kind of connection they had been offered by NESO.

A spokeswoman for RWE said it was reviewing decisions made and ""considering the implications for our current and future projects"".

""Once this process has been completed we will be able to provide further details regarding the High Grove project,"" she added.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e8e3/live/d53cf6b0-b02b-11f0-a375-75de819286d1.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 22:57:17.169743

(NASDAQ: TSLA) that can only be described as a high-stakes rollercoaster. It was a year where the laws of financial gravity seemed to bend; while the company’s core automotive business faced its first prolonged annual contraction in history, its market valuation surged to record heights. This ""decoupling"" of stock price from vehicle deliveries has redefined Tesla not as a car company, but as a speculative barometer for the future of Artificial Intelligence and robotics.

The immediate implications of 2025 are profound. Tesla has successfully transitioned its narrative away from being the ""king of EVs""—a title it officially ceded to Chinese rival BYD (OTC:BYDDY) this year—and toward becoming an AI powerhouse. However, this pivot has come at a cost. The company’s heavy reliance on the personal brand of Elon Musk and the speculative promise of ""unsupervised"" autonomy has introduced a level of volatility that now poses a systemic risk to the broader Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQ: IXIC).

The Year of the ""Demand Cliff"" and the Robotaxi Pivot

The 2025 timeline for Tesla was marked by extreme highs and sobering lows. The year began in a ""stagnation phase,"" with the company struggling to maintain the breakneck growth of previous years. By the end of the fourth quarter, the ""demand cliff"" became a reality: annual deliveries were estimated at 1.64 million units, an 8.3% decline from 2024. This contraction was punctuated by a record-breaking Q3, where customers rushed to purchase vehicles before the expiration of federal tax credits, only to see interest plummet in the final months of the year.

The centerpiece of the year was the long-awaited Robotaxi launch on June 22, 2025, in Austin, Texas. While the event initially sent the stock soaring, the reality was more nuanced. Tesla was forced to include safety drivers in its pilot fleet, failing to achieve the ""Level 5"" unsupervised autonomy that Musk had promised for the year. This led to an official postponement of the ""unsupervised"" rollout to 2026, yet the market largely looked past the delay, choosing instead to price in the massive potential of the ""AI Moat"" that Tesla is building through its Full Self-Driving (FSD) data.

Key players this year extended beyond the boardroom. Elon Musk’s dual role as Tesla CEO and a lead figure in the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under the Trump administration created a unique ""partisan effect."" On November 6, 2025, shareholders approved a revised $1 trillion compensation package for Musk, a move that signaled total alignment with his vision, despite vocal concerns from institutional investors about his distractions with X (formerly Twitter) and political ventures.

Winners and Losers in the Great EV Shift

The clear winner of the 2025 fiscal year was Tesla Energy. While the car business stalled, the energy segment became the ""quiet giant,"" deploying a record 12.5 GWh of energy storage in Q3 alone—an 81% year-over-year increase. With gross margins exceeding 30%, Tesla Energy now contributes nearly 25% of the company’s total profit, providing a critical safety net for the balance sheet as automotive margins were squeezed to 17% by persistent price wars.

On the losing side, Tesla’s dominance in the global EV market has officially been broken. BYD (OTC:BYDDY) finished 2025 as the world’s top seller of electric vehicles, leveraging its vertical integration to undercut Tesla’s pricing by as much as 50% in European and Southeast Asian markets. Meanwhile, legacy automakers like Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and Hyundai Motor Company (KRX:005380) have successfully chipped away at Tesla’s U.S. market share, which fell below 50% for the first time this year.

The consumer base also saw a significant shift. Data from the latter half of 2025 suggests a ""Musk Partisan Effect,"" where Tesla lost an estimated 1 million potential sales in the U.S. due to Musk’s political polarization. While favorability rose among Republican buyers, it collapsed among Democrats—the demographic that historically formed the core of the early EV adopter market.

Broader Industry Trends and the AI Narrative

Tesla’s performance in 2025 is a microcosm of a broader trend: the ""AI-fication"" of the industrial sector. The market is no longer valuing Tesla based on how many Model 3s it can produce, but on its potential to dominate the humanoid robotics market with Optimus and the software-as-a-service (SaaS) potential of FSD. This shift has turned Tesla into a ""speculative barometer"" for the entire tech sector. When Tesla hit its all-time intraday high of $498.83 in mid-December, it single-handedly powered the Nasdaq to new peaks.

However, this reliance on a single company’s AI narrative has regulatory and policy implications. The delay of unsupervised Robotaxis highlights the gap between Silicon Valley’s ""move fast and break things"" ethos and the stringent safety requirements of federal transportation regulators. Furthermore, Tesla’s aggressive pricing strategies to combat BYD have triggered a ""race to the bottom"" in EV margins, forcing competitors to either innovate rapidly or exit the low-end EV market entirely.

Historically, this year draws comparisons to the dot-com era, where valuations were built on future promises rather than current cash flows. The difference in 2025 is Tesla’s massive infrastructure—its Gigafactories and energy business—which provide a tangible foundation that many 1990s tech darlings lacked. Yet, the volatility remains, as seen during the late-December correction where Tesla paced Nasdaq decliners, dragging the entire index down as the AI-driven trade cooled.

What Lies Ahead for 2026

Looking toward 2026, Tesla faces a critical strategic pivot. The company must prove that it can move from ""supervised"" to ""unsupervised"" autonomy to justify its $1.5 trillion market cap. Any further delays in the Robotaxi rollout or FSD regulatory hurdles could lead to a massive re-rating of the stock. Investors are also closely watching for the rumored ""Model 2""—a more affordable entry-level vehicle—which many analysts believe is the only way for Tesla to regain lost ground from BYD in the mass market.

The integration of Optimus into Tesla’s own factory lines will be another key milestone. If Tesla can demonstrate that its humanoid robots can significantly reduce manufacturing costs, it may solve its margin problem without needing to raise vehicle prices. However, the challenge of maintaining a cohesive brand image amidst Elon Musk’s increasingly public political role will continue to be a wild card that could either open new doors in government contracting or continue to alienate a large segment of the traditional consumer base.

A Year of Transformation and Tension

In summary, 2025 was the year Tesla ceased to be a car company and became a high-stakes bet on the future of autonomy. The key takeaways for the year are clear: the energy business is a powerhouse, the automotive business is under siege from China, and the stock price is now untethered from traditional delivery metrics, driven instead by AI sentiment and the personal influence of Elon Musk.

Moving forward, the market is likely to remain volatile. Tesla’s outsized weight in the Nasdaq means that its idiosyncratic risks—from a Musk tweet to a regulatory setback in FSD—are now systemic risks for all tech investors. In the coming months, investors should keep a close eye on FSD version 13 adoption rates and the progress of the Austin Robotaxi pilot. Tesla has survived the rollercoaster of 2025, but the tracks ahead in 2026 look equally steep and unpredictable.

The Guardian notes South Korea has the world’s seventh-largest coal power fleet and is the fourth-largest thermal coal importer behind China, India and Japan.
Japan, whose economy is more than twice the size of South Korea, uses double the amount of renewable energy.
South Korea currently relies on coal for 30% of its energy needs, but within 14 years it could be zero.
We know that we're hearing the same thing from China, that many coal power plants will be shut down over the next five to 10 years.","South Korea’s move to kill coal will almost certainly have repercussions on two of its largest energy customers, Australia and the United States.

A decision on the polluting fossil fuel was made at the COP30 climate conference in Brazil, when South Korea’s Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment announced plans to retire most of the country’s coal-fired power plants by 2040, and to at least halve its carbon emissions by 2035. Forty of the plants already have confirmed closure dates.

South Korea has been criticized for not acting faster to address the climate, according to the Guardian.

A new policy direction came with the election of a more liberal president in June, Lee Jae Myung, who campaigned for stronger climate commitments than his conservative predecessor, Yoon Suk Yeol.

The country is a major importer of coal and natural gas and lags its counterparts in the adoption of renewable energies.

The Guardian notes South Korea has the world’s seventh-largest coal power fleet and is the fourth-largest thermal coal importer behind China, India and Japan. Coal provides about 30% of its electricity.

Related: Where are The World's Rare Earth Minerals Located?

It is also a significant importer of metallurgical coal, used in steelmaking, and has substantial nuclear and gas-power fleets, each supplying roughly one-third of its electricity.

By contrast, renewable energy generated just 10.5% of South Korea’s domestic power last year. Japan, whose economy is more than twice the size of South Korea, uses double the amount of renewable energy.

There are plans to boost offshore wind power capacity to 4 gigawatts, around 10 times the current level.

Climate activists are rejoicing South Korea’s move away from fossil fuels, but the policy places the country in a quandary with the United States.

That’s because, as part of a trade deal with the Trump administration that would see it avoid higher tariffs, South Korea agreed to raise imports of US liquefied natural gas.

The Associated Press reports Talks are underway for South Korea to invest $350 billion in U.S. projects and purchase up to $100 billion worth of U.S. energy products, including LNG, a natural gas cooled to liquid form for easy storage and travel. It burns cleaner than coal, but still causes planet-warming emissions, especially of methane.

It’s important to note that the agreement with the US is still under negotiation. AP says depending on the deal’s duration, the country may import between 3 and 9 million tons of US LNG a year.

The quandary is that South Korea is making deals with the United States to import more LNG at the same time as setting a target to cut its LNG import percentage from almost a fifth last year to 10.6% by 2038.

Insung Lee with Greenpeace in Seoul is skeptical:

“If we just replace coal plants with LNG, that means the coal exit actually doesn’t lead to a green transition and merely shifts Korea’s addiction from coal to gas, which undermines the whole spirit of climate action,"" AP quoted Lee saying.

The decision to close coal plants, meanwhile, is sounding the alarm in Australia, the world’s second-largest coal exporter behind Indonesia, and the planet’s biggest exporter of met coal by far.

Australia expects to export $1.5 billion worth of thermal coal to South Korea in 2025, and is hoping for the same figure in 2026, according to analytics firm Kepler.

South Korea currently relies on coal for 30% of its energy needs, but within 14 years it could be zero.

At COP30, South Korea announced it would join the Powering Past Coal Alliance, a group of around 60 countries and 120 sub-national governments, businesses and organizations that are phasing out the use of fossil fuels. China hasn’t officially joined, but it plans on doing so.

But is there another explanation for South Korea’s plan to quit coal? Sources say it comes down to economics.

In most current scenarios, coal is significantly more expensive to run than building new renewable energy sources like wind and solar.

Studies show 99% of US coal plants are more costly to operate than replacing them with new clean energy, a trend accelerated by factors like the Inflation Reduction Act. Renewables, even with storage, offer lower Levelized Costs of Energy (LCOE) compared to coal, making coal economically uncompetitive for power generation. (AI Overview)

Kim Sung-hwan, South Korea's Minister of Climate, Energy and Environment, said shifting from coal to renewables will increase the country’s energy security, by not relying as much on foreign imports; and it will boost the competitiveness of South Korean businesses.

How so? By making energy cheaper. In response, James Bowen, the director of consultancy ReMap Research, said that Australian coal exports could fall in value by 50% over the next five years.

“South Korea’s decision should prompt Australia to show leadership by discussing timeframes for its own fossil fuel phaseout while helping its regional neighbours to embrace clean energy,” he said via the Guardian.

Video blogger Sam Evans, aka ‘The Electric Viking’, notes that Australia too is reducing domestic coal usage. He said the government recently introduced ambitious domestic green energy plans, with the aim of increasing the proportion of electricity from renewable energy from 42% over the past year to 82% by the end of the decade.

“South Korea’s ambitious goal… shows that demand for coal is going to continue falling. We know that we're hearing the same thing from China, that many coal power plants will be shut down over the next five to 10 years.

“It's going to be a tsunami for coal. There's going to be coal companies going bankrupt all over the world. So, if you want to short anything, this is what you should be shorting,” he concluded.

Previously, I’ve written about the potential for a future smart grid, where homes with solar panels and batteries intelligently interconnect to form a cleaner, more-robust distributed power system. While we’re still far from a full-fledged smart grid, recent years have seen wider deployment of distributed energy storage. Today, Germany already boasts over 7,000 home solar plus energy storage systems, and some analysts suggest the U.S. could see similar growth once Tesla’s much-touted battery “Gigafactory” starts producing at scale.

With home battery systems on the rise, it’s worth thinking about how economics might influence the development of storage-equipped smart grids in the future. Consider the example of solar energy tariffs in Germany versus the United States.

In Germany, solar energy delivered to the grid is paid a set “feed-in tariff,” a fixed energy rate established by the government to promote adoption of solar energy. Today, the tariff ranges from about 13 to 14 euro cents per kilowatt-hour of energy—far less than Germany’s typical residential electricity rates of about 22 to 29 euro cents per kilowatt-hour.

The difference between these two rates creates an incentive to store solar energy before it can flow to the grid. If solar electricity is stored and then used in the home, it offsets purchase of grid electricity at the cost of not collecting the solar feed-in tariff. The current difference between these rates equates to a net benefit of 10-15 euro cents per kilowatt-hour of solar energy diverted from the grid into batteries.

In the United States it’s a different story. Solar power generated by electricity customers is typically either “net metered” or paid a “value-of-solar” tariff. Under a net metering rate, produced solar energy essentially rolls the electric meter backwards, i.e. it is valued at exactly the price of retail electricity. Value-of-solar tariffs pay for solar at a rate calculated based on its overall environmental and system benefits. Rates calculated by Minnesota’s Public Utility Commission (14.5 cents per kilowatt-hour) and Austin’s municipal electric utility (12.8 cents per kilowatt-hour) both exceed retail energy rates. Under both of these solar tariffs, the economic decision is to send solar electricity directly into the grid, rather than save it for later use in the home.

Instead of storing solar energy, U.S. home battery systems are intended to take advantage of time-of-use electricity rates, which charge more for energy use during peak hours. The battery stores extra grid electricity at night, when electricity is cheapest, to offset the purchase of expensive on-peak electricity.

The effect of storage operating under the U.S. rates is that a home uses more grid electricity at night, uses less on-peak electricity, and stores no solar energy for use in the home. Anytime solar power production exceeds the home’s energy demand, the extra power is simply pumped back into the grid, turning the home into a net generator.

The difference between Germany’s energy-independence rate structure and the U.S. grid-centric structure is subtle yet in many ways decisive. Germany’s utility tariffs incentivize a home to minimize its interaction with the wider grid, encouraging a system where individual homes can more-easily operate independently. The U.S. rates incentivize more economic reliance on the grid both to store cheap nighttime energy and sell extra solar energy.

The distinction between these rates illustrates divergent visions for the future smart grid: one that prefers energy independence versus one that prefers reliance on the central grid. Which is preferable? The short answer is: it depends. It will certainly be interesting to see how smart grids develop over the coming years.",https://www.scientificamerican.com/static/sciam-mark.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 20:58:27.434558

The New York banking giant is working with real estate advisory Newmark Group Inc. to raise both equity and credit for the project building modular natural gas-fired generation serving a cluster of south Dallas data centers, according to developer GridFree AI. Newmark has also been tapped as the exclusive marketer and advisor for the data hub, called South Dallas One.

The aim in this initial round is to raise “hundreds of millions of dollars” with more rounds as the first project is scaled up, according to Philip Krim, chief executive officer of Montauk Capital, which incubated GridFree AI.

Goldman declined to comment.

The US power system, which is based on Thomas Edison’s 19th century grid, is struggling to meet the electricity needs of the modern economy. Aging infrastructure is being strained by extreme weather and unprecedented demand growth. Consumers are faced with a double whammy of rising power bills and a greater threat of blackouts in large parts of the US.

“Edison’s grid was not built for the scale and size of these data centers,” said Krim. “We ended up saying, ‘Let’s start a company for energy experts to build a data center — knowing how energy-dense and energy—hungry data centers are — to scale up the AI buildout.'”

GridFree AI was formed about a year ago with Ralph Alexander as CEO. Alexander, a nuclear engineer, previously served as the top executive at Talen Energy Corp., where he led the development of a data center campus next to the independent power producer’s Susquehanna nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. Amazon Web Services bought that campus early last year, which was expanded this year into a 1.92 gigawatt supply contract with Talen. This co-location deal quickly became the major flash point in making sure tech giants pay for their fair share of power plants and grid infrastructure without shifting those costs to other consumers.

“South Dallas One represents the future of AI-ready infrastructure: fast to deploy, resilient by design, and insulated from the grid constraints holding back the industry,” Alexander said in an statement.

With land for two of the three sites secured, GridFree said initial power can be brought online in less than 24 months from the lease being signed, significantly faster than waiting to connect to the Texas grid. Each site will have about 1.5 gigawatts of power with structures to house data centers. The plan is to build 100-megawatt modules — 10 gas turbines providing around-the-clock power and two for back-up — so they can be quickly plugged into projects, Krim said.

This set—up can be done on 500 acres and will use the one household’s worth of water because waste heat from power generation will be captured to help with cooling needs, he said.

While these AI campuses will be self-reliant, the goal is to ultimately connect to the Texas grid to supply spare power, Krim said. Fuel for the gas plants will be supplied by two pipelines, including one owned by Energy Transfer LP, and no back-up diesel generators will be needed, Krim said. GridFree AI plans to build campuses around the world and eventually that will include nuclear, he said.

Behind every search query, video stream, or artificial intelligence request is a cooling system that raises a critical question: Why do data centers need water?

Advertisement

Data centers house thousands of servers that generate a tremendous amount of heat. Without cooling, these machines would overheat and fail.

That’s where water comes in. Many data centers use evaporative cooling or closed-loop cooling systems to keep temperatures stable.

Water is often more efficient than air cooling because it transfers heat more effectively. This helps reduce energy consumption and improves energy efficiency.

Cold water or liquid coolant is circulated through heat exchangers to absorb hot air from server racks, which is then cooled again for reuse.

Most data centers use water in some form, especially large data centers operated by major tech companies like Google.

In 2023, Google reported consuming over 6 billion gallons (22.7 billion liters) of water to cool all its data centers. Water consumption is used as part of a strategy to balance energy usage and environmental impact.

The amount varies by region and cooling method. Some facilities use over 1 million gallons (3.8 million liters) per day.

In 2020, U.S. data centers collectively used an estimated 174 billion gallons (659 billion liters) of water, mostly for cooling. That’s enough to fill over 260,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools.

The United States leads the world in data center deployment. As of early 2024, there were more than 5,300 data centers in the U.S., spread across nearly every state.

Virginia, Texas, and California have the highest concentrations, largely due to connectivity, power access, and favorable climate conditions.

Many new data center projects are planned in water stressed regions, increasing the urgency for better water management practices.

From the outside, data centers resemble giant industrial warehouses. They’re often windowless and can span hundreds of thousands of square feet. Inside, rows of server racks line climate-controlled rooms, with hot air containment systems, cooling towers, and backup generators.

The facilities also feature massive power and water infrastructure, including tanks, heat exchangers, and pipes that circulate water or liquid coolant.

In some locations, these buildings blend into suburban business parks, while others are in remote areas optimized for energy efficiency and water conservation.

Water cooling systems help lower carbon emissions by reducing reliance on fossil fuel power plants for energy-intensive air cooling.

But that benefit comes with tradeoffs. Cooling towers evaporate water during the process, meaning data centers rank among the top 10 water-consuming industries in the U.S.

To reduce impact, some companies are using recycled water, reclaimed water, or non-potable water to meet their cooling needs. Others are investing in immersion cooling and water usage effectiveness metrics to improve water management.",https://media.hswstatic.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJjb250ZW50Lmhzd3N0YXRpYy5jb20iLCJrZXkiOiJnaWZcL3NodXR0ZXJzdG9jay0xMzk0MDM1MTY5LmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6IjEyMDAifX19,N,,2025-12-31 18:13:17.458839

The demand drivers remain clear: Data centers from tech giants like Google and QTS, combined with expanding industrial and agricultural operations, are pushing Iowa’s energy consumption to levels not seen since the 1960s. Projections call for a 30% to 60% increase in electrical load by 2030.

Iowa’s response has been multifaceted. The state leads the nation in renewable energy generation, with wind providing 63% of electricity production. Solar installations saw explosive growth — 554 megawatts added in 2024 alone, representing $706 million in investment. MidAmerican Energy received approval for 800 megawatts of solar generation, the largest in state history, while Alliant Energy announced plans for up to 1,000 megawatts of additional wind capacity.

However, uncertainty arrived when the One Big Beautiful Bill eliminated residential solar tax credits effective Dec. 31, 2025. Solar installers predicted residential installations could plummet by 90% and industry employment could be cut in half. Nearly half of Iowa counties have also enacted restrictive ordinances creating barriers to utility-scale renewable development.

Meanwhile, the push to restart the Duane Arnold Energy Center gained momentum as NextEra Energy Resources secured key regulatory approvals. The restart, potentially operational by first quarter 2029, would create 400 permanent jobs and generate more than $340 million in annual economic output.

Transcript

Part I

MEGHNA CHAKRABARTI: It's New Year's Eve in 1980 in Austin, Texas. A man wearing a hat decorated with an armadillo shell and deer antlers steps to the microphone at a music club.

Live from deep in the heart of Texas! Live from the Armadillo world headquarters! Commander Cody! (MUSIC)

COMMANDER CODY: (SINGING) Everyone who loved The Armadillo, I want you to give me a cheer. (CHEERING)

CHAKRABARTI: The Armadillo is in fact called the Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin. Sadly, it was the music venue's last night. The club was closing after roughly a decade in Austin. The band Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen had the stage.

COMMANDER CODY: (SINGING) Nights like this, when my brain gets fried --

CHAKRABARTI: The Armadillo hosted hundreds of musical acts during its run. People like Willie Nelson, Jerry Jeff Walker, Frank Zappa, Waylon Jennings, and Charlie Daniels.

CHARLIE DANIELS: Armadillo’s a special place to play. There's no doubt about it. When they put that few inches of asphalt over the top of this place, they’ll be buryin’ something. It'll be a long time before anybody ever realizes what they buried. You know, it was a place to kinda start happening. Everybody respected it, you know. It is the end of an era. Ain't no two ways about it. It's an end of an era.

CHAKRABARTI: Charlie Daniels there. They put more than a couple of inches of asphalt over The Armadillo. Shortly after it closed, it was demolished and replaced with a multi-story office building.

Now for some in Austin, places like The Armadillo are a symbol of what they like to call ""Old Austin,"" because for decades the city has been known as a funky, liberal haven in a deep red state. A place where venues like The Armadillo could thrive.

But now tech money is pouring into the city and there's been huge growth. Elon Musk has moved both his Tesla and X headquarters to the Austin area. Big names like Joe Rogan also live there now. Here's Rogan talking about why he loves Austin on his podcast with comedian Kevin James last year.

KEVIN JAMES: By the way, I love Austin. I'm coming here. I want to be here every day.

JOE ROGAN: Move here! Club's always very available. You'll have fun, great place to work out. Come here to my gym. We can work out together. The way they treat, like, freedom here is like a religion. Freedom is a different thing in Texas. They, they're not interested in controlling your — what you buy and where you go and what you do on your land.

JAMES: Love it.

ROGAN: You can own a zebra. They don't give a [EXPLETIVE].

CHAKRABARTI: Now listeners who hear On Point in Austin on station KUT, they, too, have noticed a shift in the city's culture.

ASHLEY: I don’t smell as much patchouli in Austin as I used to. When I first got to Austin it would be everywhere. Nowadays, I’m much more likely to smell a designer perfume or something along those lines.

RANDY: There was a warehouse district that was pretty close to downtown in the '80s and '90s, and there were all these punk clubs there. And so we would go see really great bands and pay $5. Now it's like gourmet chocolate and a $18 salad place. This is the new Austin.

JENEE: It really was about music and art and just this whole vibe of kind of anything goes. And you can do and look kind of however you want. And new Austin is all about shiny things.

CHAKRABARTI: Those are On Point listeners and Austinites Ashley, Randy, and Jenee. Now, of course, cities change. This is a fact. Technology changes things. Trends come and go. Demographics shift and gentrification happens. That's not what makes the old Austin/new Austin story so interesting, especially for those of us who don't live there.

What I find most fascinating is that Texas is the second most populous state in the union today. And that growth is attributed to the fact that Texas prides itself as being a low tax, low regulation, pro-growth state, but even that super welcoming environment has not been able to cope with the speed Texas' own capital is booming. So just to lovingly rile up both our Texas and California listeners for a second, I wonder: Does that make Austin the San Francisco of Texas?

Joshua Long joins us to help answer that question. He's at KUT in Austin. He is a professor of environmental studies at Southwestern University and author of the book Weird City: Sense of Place and Creative Resistance in Austin, Texas.

Professor Long, welcome.

JOSHUA LONG: Hello, Meghna. Good to be here.

CHAKRABARTI: Is Austin the San Francisco of Texas?

LONG: That was a great intro. I'm not really sure how to answer that question.

CHAKRABARTI: (LAUGHS) Who do you wanna offend the least? Let's just put it that way.

LONG: Exactly. It's yeah, that's definitely been on my mind when preparing for today's discussion.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. I appreciate the elegance with which you sidestepped that question. So let me get to an easier one to answer. How long have you lived in Austin?

LONG: Oh, I currently don't live in Austin.

CHAKRABARTI: Oh, you don't?

LONG: I've lived in and around Austin for most of my life. But I'm currently in Georgetown, because I teach at Southwestern and I'm very close to the university where I teach. But in some ways, that sort of outside looking in is, I think, very true for a lot of Austinites, who have been displaced from Austin for various reasons, but still call themselves Austinites and still have that connection to the city.

CHAKRABARTI: Help me with my Texas geography, Georgetown being out where, relative to Austin?

LONG: Depending on traffic, anywhere between a half an hour to an hour and a half north of Austin.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. Okay. Got it. But you said you've been living in and around Austin for most, if not all of your life?

LONG: Yeah, it was a circuitous route through graduate school and some jobs overseas. But honestly, I grew up in Bastrop, which might come up in the conversation later because we've seen Bastrop transform quite a bit over the last few years. But I went to school in Austin and worked at the Capitol, worked at Austin coffee shops. And over the years have seen the city transform quite a bit.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so before we talk about that actual transformation, I still want to know a little bit more about like, your relationship with Austin. Like how do you feel about this place?

LONG: Oh, these are the questions I was hoping to avoid. (LAUGHS)

CHAKRABARTI: (LAUGHS)

LONG: I still, I actually have a deep love for Austin and always will, but it is mixed feelings, and I think that's true for a lot of Austinites.

We still miss some of the old landscapes and honestly the vibe, that sort of laid back, slower living and a greater sense of tolerance and friendliness that Austin was very much known for. A lot of that is disappearing. But you still can find that in pockets throughout the city, and I enjoy it when I do stumble across that from time to time.

CHAKRABARTI: Yeah. The reason why I asked is because even though I've lived in New England for roughly half my life now, I still consider home the Pacific Northwest. And for some of the same reasons, especially Seattle — that's not my home territory, Oregon is — but that sort of corridor there on the other side of the country for some of the same reasons, has changed so rapidly.

This idea of what constitutes the soul of a city and especially ones that are so geographically unique, really is, it hits home for me. So to hear that you have this this internal tussle about it resonates quite deeply with me. But how long have people been lamenting the loss of old Austin?

LONG: That's a great question. Because it really depends on who you ask. For many people, it was the decade of the 'Dillo was true old Austin, that was the golden age of Austin. And I think they have a pretty good case in some ways there.

But it depends on, if somebody moved here in the '80s or '90s and they lived through certain transformations of the tech scene and the music scene, then they identify with certain music venues there, or restaurants that closed then, or when they started to have to pay to get into Barton Springs. So for everyone, it's a little bit different.

But if you were to look at this sort of taking a step back, I think there's been three waves I would argue of an Austin narrative that has emerged — in the '60s and '70s, in the '80s and '90s, and since 2000 — and they're all unique in their own way. And we've seen this move away from old Austin to new Austin and somewhere in the middle that you could probably draw a dividing line.

CHAKRABARTI: So '60s, '70s, '80s, and '90s. That's interesting. Could I interpret that as, in a sense, Austinites have always been lamenting the loss of old Austin? Just depends on when you moved there?

LONG: Yeah, we speak about it in nostalgic and sad tones. There's a joke that came out in a play a few years ago, like old Austinites talk about Austin like they're veterans of some war. ""You have no idea what it was like!""

But there was something special about the Austin that emerged in the 1970s, this sort of hippie libertarianism, that there's only a couple regions in the United States where that term gets applied. And Austin had its own flavor of that, this idea that individual liberty and minimal government and all of that of libertarianism. But also mixed with the sort of anti-establishment, peace, loving, social tolerance, creativity and sort of whimsical weirdness all mesh together in Austin.

And people tell the story of when Willie Nelson jumped on the stage at the old Armadillo World Headquarters and sang Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain, he married the rednecks and the hippies. And we realized we could all get along and there was this sort of kumbaya moment. And again, even though it's overly romanticized, there's an element of truth to that that carried the city through into the 1980s.

CHAKRABARTI: Yeah. Right now, my heart is weeping along with my fellow Oregonians, particularly in Portland, aka ""weird Portland,"" people there who are lamenting the loss of the sort of rain-soaked, mossy version of what you just described as Austin having been.

So the thing is, though, that I find particularly interesting, and correct me if I'm wrong, it's as I said earlier, cities do change, but it seems as if in the past, maybe decade, or at least couple of decades, the pace at which things have been transforming in Austin is much, much higher than perhaps we've seen elsewhere. And that is part of the issue.

LONG: Oh, no question. Whether it's politically or culturally or socially or whether we've seen the displacement of certain populations and other populations moving in, things have definitely changed. And it's something that's hard to put your finger on. It's hard to really describe a sense of place. But the vibe of Austin has changed.

When I was doing research from my book back in the early 2000s all the way up through 2008, 2009, it was very easy to do that kind of work, because everybody I talked to had an opinion. I could just walk up to people on the street and they'd start saying something and want to talk about Austin. I don't know if I could do that research again today in Austin,

CHAKRABARTI: Because they wouldn't have an opinion?

LONG: Oh, they might have an opinion, but they're too busy to get to work.

Part II

CHAKRABARTI: Now we heard from a lot of Austinites who listen to On Point on KUT in Austin, for example. Here's Christopher Hutchins.

CHRISTOPHER HUTCHINS: It was a freak town, where you could be whoever you wanted to be, and that was okay. There's plenty of things to do outdoors, tons of music and art to consume. That is still here. It's just not as inclusive. All the freaks and the queers and the artists are still here. We're not going away.

CHAKRABARTI: And here's Robert Cullick. He was a journalist on the growth beat for a local newspaper in the 1980s.

ROBERT CULLICK: In Old Austin, it was a young person's culture. One came to Austin from a more conservative place in Texas and experienced the heady feeling of intellectual and, certainly, physical freedom. So you stayed to protect and nurture that feeling. One assumed one's waiter had a PhD, 'cause there was a good chance he or she did.

Well, in New Austin, people move here for good jobs and bigger homes than they can get in California and to experience some of the creative spirit and music and art that's been left behind. But it's just smoke and not much fire.

CHAKRABARTI: Here's one more. This is Marty Butler. He says his parents moved to Austin in the late 1960s and he's lived there for some 50 years.

MARTY BUTLER: There's been booms in the past, but nothing like what's happened over the last 20 years, where Austin really became a place that you could come to get rich. I'm now surrounded by homes with incomes probably above half a million dollars a year.

It has not necessarily ruined the city. There's still a lot of Austin that's intact, but the change is marked. And this is what we have to recognize, that Austin is not what it used to be, but it's still pretty damn good.

CHAKRABARTI: Joshua Long joins us today. He's a professor at Southwestern University and author of Weird City: Sense of Place and Creative Resistance in Austin, Texas.

And professor Long, look, I'm just gonna be totally transparent about like, I am not a Texan, not an Austinite. So I really wanna actually just spend a few more minutes digging into the texture and cultural history of the city to help us who aren't of the soil there to understand why this issue of change in Austin matters so much to people.

Because as an outsider, I've always actually wondered why Austin was able to retain this hippie, libertarian feel, especially as the capital of the state of Texas, which, especially in the past quarter century, has, to an outsider's view, become a bastion of just like deep conservatism. Does that make sense?

LONG: Yeah. It does make sense. And Austin, for a long time, I think it's important to remember that Austin for a very long time was a very affordable place to live. And a place where you didn't, it was never a city of elites. It was never a city of influencers, we have become that most recently.

But how Austin came to be this in the '70s and '80s is more of a relatively middle class and affordable place was that Austin was often in the shadow of cities like Dallas and Houston and San Antonio, and it was the capital city. And it was a place where people who were trying to get away from the conservatism of deep red Texas came to this blue oasis in search for something different.

Started in the 1960s, for sure, when the University of Texas population doubled in the decade. And in the 1970s as the outlaw country and cosmic cowboy music scenes started to take off, that added a certain element to it as well. And that started to transform a little bit as we got into the 1980s, because Austin really started to tell a story about itself.

And actually, that's something that we should talk about. Because rather than a traditional sort of timeline history of Austin, the city loves to tell stories about itself and who it is, and those often-become self-fulfilling prophecies.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. One second though, because before we get to what some of those stories are, just to not sound totally ignorant about how diverse Texas actually is. I mean there were other like major blue spots in the state. I was just in Houston, so it's not like Austin is this single blueberry, right, in the tomato soup?

LONG: Oh, you're absolutely right that Houston and San Antonio especially are places that, especially now, do embrace that kind of lifestyle.

But if you're thinking about the 1960s and seventies in rural Texas, the University of Texas, especially, was a sort of beacon to a lot of young people who wanted to get away from that strict conservatism. And they didn't go towards the fancy — forgive me for saying this — the highfalutin' Dallas area or the oil money in Houston, they went to Austin for the music scene, for the counterculture vibes. And that's what drew a lot of that.

CHAKRABARTI: I got you. Okay. So tell me what, like what's one of the stories that the city loved to tell about itself?

LONG: (LAUGHS)

CHAKRABARTI: (LAUGHS) You're setting yourself up for these questions!

LONG: (LAUGHS) I know. You're right. So coming outta the 1970s, where we very much trying to portray ourself as this laid back, if you come here, try to be tolerant, be creative, be whimsical. We love our weirdos here, we don't care where you come from, just relax and enjoy the city.

That actually started to change in the in late '70s and 1980s when the growth machine in Austin started to come together and say, we need to attract some businesses here. Now there's alternative to this. There are many people who were very anti-growth at the time. That was a very strong sentiment. But the University of Texas, the Austin Chamber of Commerce, which was incredibly influential, and many of the other developers and business interests in Austin started to actively recruit industries to Austin. Specifically, the tech scene, software development, advanced manufacturing.

We started to get IBM and Motorola and Samsung and 3M and Texas Instruments. And that actually meshed well in some ways with the hippie libertarianism. Because if you think about it, another place in the United States where the term hippie libertarianism gets applied is Silicon Valley. And here we were telling everybody that we were the new Silicon Hills, just cheaper, more affordable, and a great place to hang out and spend the time in between your software development job.

CHAKRABARTI: So how did, it seems to me though, that like you, you call it the growth machine, but the growth machine, a growth machine works well in an environment that is also, laissez-faire, right? Like that libertarian streak. ""Come as you are. Grow as you want?""

LONG: Sure. And Austin still embodies that and has for a long time. In many ways it's actually been, it's actually been to our detriment to a certain extent. Because again, if I'm telling these stories and I'm reproducing this narrative, they're dominant political narratives. They're inherently exclusionary.

And by me telling these stories, I'm not telling the stories of the people who end up being displaced by that growth machine. Because we started to embark, especially, if we're going to fast forward towards the 1990s. When we started to bring in environmentalism as part of our ethos and we monetized environmentalism and we started to say, okay, let's, you know, historians talk about the Green Council, the late 1990s that came together and initiated a lot of smart growth.

Smart growth in theory is really great, but you have to put in protections for your existing communities. Because as you densify, you are going to, in a free market, real estate economy, you're going to drive up real estate prices, rents, and in a place like Texas, you're going to increase property taxes as well.

CHAKRABARTI: I promise you, in just one minute we're gonna talk with someone — who you're sitting right next to, actually — about the real big negative challenges of rapid neighborhood change. But there's one more thing about this libertarian streak. Because again, externally from outside of Austin, it's like people are like, ""Wow, Joe Rogan lives there. Elon Musk is moving there. This must be something crazy new."" But that sort of part of the city has always been there.

LONG: Yes, it has. And it's always been there. We talk about hippie Austin, but you don't always talk about Bubba South Austin. That is another term that comes up.

CHAKRABARTI: Or Alex Jones Austin.

LONG: I have to say, we do have this history of conspiracy theorists living in Austin. We are the home of Infowars, unfortunately. But actually, conspiracy theories on the left and the right. Because there's always been this kind of distrust of the establishment in government in Austin.

So in some ways, you can see how these sorts of evolve over time to include different people and including people like Joe Rogan and Elon Musk. And if we wanna talk about that later, we have to think about when they moved here. Joe Rogan moved here in 2020 and he was outspokenly critical of COVID policies in California and talking about how in Austin, they let you do what you want.

And it was this budding comedy scene that he was going to incubate. And at first, we saw moving in and we were like, ""Ah, another Californian, spent $14.5 million dollars on a Lake Austin home. Telling all his buddies from California to move here."" It's evolved over time. Pros and cons there.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. Professor Long, hang on for just a second because I'm long overdue in bringing Susana Almanza into the conversation. She also joins us from KUT in Austin, and she's director of the advocacy group PODER and a longtime East Austin resident. Susana, welcome to On Point.

SUSANA ALMANZA: Hello, Meghna. Thank you.

CHAKRABARTI: Tell me a little bit about East Austin, what it was like, what it's like now.

ALMANZA: East Austin is, for people don't know, the city of Austin did its master plan in 1928, and in that master plan it decided that people of color would live east of the highway. So Highway 35 became our border wall.

And we built our homes from anywhere from $2,000 to $18,000 in East Austin. And we made it the beautiful part of the city for people of color. So we had our own small businesses, mom and pops. We had our own transportation, taxi service, Latino, African American. We had our own beauty shops and we had, of course, our segregated schools in East Austin.

Growing up in East Austin, I'm a native of East Austin. Of course, we had, we didn't have paved streets and there was very little lighting. The drainage system wasn't the best. But it was a happy place because it was a social network there where we had cousins, aunts, grandmas, everybody living in the area. And it was extended families, and it was all about families. At that time, I think the average family size was like eight to 10 people. I knew I grew up in a family of 10. So it was a lot of families in the areas.

There was a lot of celebrations. A lot of different parks in the community that we did, transportation was not as heavy. Because in that era, before up to the seventies, there wasn't a lot of people who owned vehicles. So there wasn't heavy traffic until ""your job is your credit"" came in and people were able to get vehicles. But it was a very walkable community. Very walkable community. And it was a community where we were allowed to have, we had our own chickens and rabbits. We ate everything pretty fresh, had our gardens.

And so it was a time where I looked at where I had to walk across Highway 35 every day just to go to elementary school. And I could tell you Highway 35 is nothing like it is today. I wouldn't be able to walk it, the traffic or especially as a child. Trying to cross 35. So the atmosphere is very different, in people of color living together, but also working-class community.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. So tell me more about that, because it sounds like what you're headed towards is that sense of community which I want, I do want to just emphasize. That was created in part by like deliberate planned segregation, as you said. That sense of community, affordability, sounds like that's changing even in East Austin.

ALMANZA: Absolutely. East Austin is going under, it's gentrified, being gentrified, but we say that gentrification is a new name for colonization. Because what has happened is as Austin continues to grow, where does it grow? To the west, it has a lot of restrictions, and they have a lot of people in power that they're gonna make sure that they keep their single-family homes and that they control the type of growth. In East Austin has always been different, because East Austin has been trying to treat it like the stepchild or the orphan child.

So zoning has come in, we went through industrial zoning, which meant that you could have a factory that was emitting chemicals next door to a school or to your home. So you are allowed to live with industrial emissions, industrial traffic in the area. That's very different from West Austin. It was very much protected.

And that was one of the reasons that PODER came about. Because when we look at all the hazardous facilities in our community and we actually got the city to do a study, and it turned out that 90% of all the industrial zoning was in East Austin.

CHAKRABARTI: 90%?

ALMANZA: 90% of all the industrial zoning was in East Austin.

CHAKRABARTI: Wow.

ALMANZA: And because of the zoning, we could be living next to these hazardous facilities. And so that's the kind of Austin that people don't hear about. The history of how racism and zoning has played on Austin, and on how, now that Austin is growing, it came in with new kind of zoning, that never existed before in our communities. Commercial service, mixed use, vertical mixed use, all of these different things have been used to take over our community.

In 1997, the city came out with a plan where it would say, we're gonna go through a neighborhood process and we're going to divide the city into 54 neighborhood planning areas. And so they started with the neighborhood plan in East Austin, one that became the Cesar Chavez Neighborhood plan. And the other one was a Chestnut neighborhood plan and the Chestnut with the African Americans and ours was basically Latinos.

When they came in and changed the zoning, and we were involved in that process. We fought it because it introduced a zoning that never had existed before, commercial service mixed use. Which they said, okay, these houses are going to now, homes, single family homes, are gonna be zoned commercial service mixed use. And we said, if you do that, then people who don't own their homes are gonna get displaced.

CHAKRABARTI: I see.

ALMANZA: Because people are gonna get more money rented at commercial services and they're not gonna qualify for equity loans. Because equity loans had just come in, because they're not zoned residential, they're not gonna qualify for federal money, for rehabilitation or anything else, because they're zoned commercial.

CHAKRABARTI: Susana, can I just jump in here for a quick second? We have to take a break in just 30 seconds. But why did they wanna change the zoning to begin with?

ALMANZA: That was a way to take over and displace the community. You change the zoning, and you displace people. That is, how do you take over the land?

CHAKRABARTI: They wanted the land for someone else.

ALMANZA: They wanted the land. It was a land grab.

Part III

CHAKRABARTI: Professor Long, can you just pick up on what Susana was describing as this rapid change for the Latino and Black lifelong residents of Austin? Because I think obviously what she's describing is very familiar to people in other cities, right? Boston, Seattle, San Francisco, you name it, Chicago.

It's gentrification with a capital G. But I understand that you said, you told our producer, Claire, that Austinites themselves had a hard time calling it that.

LONG: Well, I don't know about that. I think it was late for us to be having that conversation. Because initially, it was all about, it was driven largely by economic growth and an environmental ethos that said we need to protect our watershed which we did to the west. And we needed to zone a little bit better for more dense use, which we did. And we needed more public transportation, but in not putting in protections for the existing population, we created a real problem.

Because alongside this, Austin was trying to portray itself as the new creative center of the United States, like it was an emerging major international city and saying we want musicians, artists and young creatives to come to this city. When they come to the city, it's still hard for some people to find a place to live where the affordable place is. It was East Austin, central East Austin especially, and I think the city looked at that and was like, that is a place where we can extract value.

And the reason that's a story that's common to many other cities is because we live in a very neoliberal capitalist world. Where everything, you can put a price on the value of a person, on the value of their labor, on the value of their property. And East Austin house prices were so low, and it was such a place where, you know, as you start to direct growth in that way, property values go up, rents go up. That's displacing populations.

But a story that's not often told about Texas cities is how quickly our property taxes can go up. And I know Susana will have something to say about that.

CHAKRABARTI: Oh, okay. We'll talk about that in a second. But there's one more thing, because this is like a number that very, it brings this, the rapidity of the change into stark relief. Because Austin has had obviously population growth and a lot of it between censuses, between the 2010 and 2020 census.

But in that same time, what, professor, has been, for example, the decline in the African American population in Austin?

LONG: Oh, yeah. There's a statistic that's pretty alarming across the decades, but between 2000 and 2010, Austin saw a 20% population growth rate while it witnessed between a five and 6% decrease in its African American population.

And that's a statistical outlier from the rest of the United States. So while we were growing, we were simultaneously hemorrhaging largely our Black population, but also our Latino population.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. So Professor Long and Susana Almanza. Hang on for just a second, because we did actually speak with a member of the Austin City Council, Ryan Alter. He's a councilman for the fifth district in Austin. And he told us that the council is working hard to build more affordable housing. But he says the city's median family income — this is important — has skyrocketed, so it's tough to keep prices accessible.

RYAN ALTER: You used to have a whole lot of individuals or families who an 80% median family income unit, that was very accessible for them, and now they can only afford something that's restricted to 50% or even 30%. Those units are much more costly to build, and so you just don't have as many of them. That imbalance has been a huge challenge that we've been trying to rectify and put back into balance. But our MFI shot up so fast that playing catch up has been really difficult.

CHAKRABARTI: By the way, the median family income in Austin, Texas right now is approximately $126,000 in comparison to the roughly $80,000 national median family income.

So Ryan Alter says it's hard to get developers to agree to build housing that would meet the needs or the capabilities of people making 30% to 50% of Austin's, again, Austin's median family income. And he says sometimes creating some slightly more affordable units at that 80% is better than nothing at all.

ALTER: We calibrate these density bonus programs so that you can have a higher percentage of units that are less affordable or a lower percentage of units that are more affordable. So incentivizing that, even if we don't get quite as many of the raw number of affordable units, if they're more affordable, then we're serving a segment of the population that is just underserved.

We're not allowed to condition zoning on affordability. That's something that in Texas is prohibited by law. This council has made it very clear that affordability is a top priority, and so when developers come to ask for zoning, they are free to say, look, I'm gonna set aside 5%, 10%, because I know that's gonna be attractive when they're reviewing this case.

CHAKRABARTI: Even if they solved this issue of what is affordable in Austin, Ryan Alter says, the bottom line is the city needs to build more housing, period.

ALTER: I think the proof's in the pudding. When you supply the units, prices go down and we have seen that. People will say, ""You guys rose so fast that even some kind of decline, you're still way above everybody else."" And there is some element of truth to that. I'm not going to pretend that we didn't see meteoric rise for four years.

We have a, what is called the strategic housing blueprint. It is our guide to exactly that question. How many units do we need? That 10-year plan, when we adopted it five years ago, I think it was 135,000 new housing units. That's a lot. We have built a lot of those, but we are behind.

CHAKRABARTI: That's Ryan Alter. He represents Austin's fifth district on the city council. Susana Almanza, would you like to respond to what the councilman was saying there?

ALMANZA: Yeah, I think that Councilman and the whole city council is not being truthful. The city of Austin owns thousands of properties that it acquired through liens or through purchase. That was a study done by Professor Eliot Tretter and his class.

And so we know that the city has all this land that is just land banking. So when you look at, we've given this recommendation to the city for decades, is that if we own the land, because that's city land, that means we, the taxpayers, own that land. Then what really drives up the price of homes is the land. But if you own the land, you can build housing from 0%, 30%, 40%, or 50% medium family income. The ability is there. What the community says is they don't have the ganas, they don't have the will, to do it.

So they try to say that they're doing all this by all of their different housing policies, of doing 10% affordability and so forth, when in reality they don't tell the truth. That they can actually build thousands of homes for all ranges of income if they really wanted to.

The truth is that Austin doesn't want low income and people of color in the urban core. That's the truth. If you look at their stats, they've built, and this is their own, it came out from 2018 to 2022. They built 35,000 units from 61% to 121% medium family income. And they only built 6,847 units from 30% to 60% income. So that's really, that's the real telling. That's the truth there. Who are they building for?

CHAKRABARTI: Susana? Can I just jump in here and ask?

ALMANZA: Sure.

CHAKRABARTI: I definitely hear what you're saying. As I mentioned earlier, I'm based here in Boston and this, it's like you're saying the exact same version of what's happening here. I actually reported for years on East Boston, happens to also be on the east side of the city, longtime home of especially Latino immigrants, but many immigrants. And the exact same story.

But let me challenge you a little bit with this. I hear what you're saying in terms of they, quote-unquote, they don't want people of color in the urban core of Austin. But isn't it even, is it less pointed than that and just this is the general outcome of what happens with capitalism and when a city becomes extremely attractive to people with a lot of money? I don't think I've seen any city solve this problem yet.

ALMANZA: I think what makes that city attractive? What makes it attractive? If it's when you have the council, you have the Austin Real Estate Council, the Board of Realtors, Chamber of Commerce, when you have all these people working together and planning a city and recruiting whatever employment agencies and so forth, without taking into regard that there are poor people of color living in an area.

When they passed a desired development zone, that desired development zone was east of the highway. Yes, it's part of capitalism, but it's also part of racism and we cannot live out the r-word. Okay, it's part of racism. It's, who do you target? Who is the most vulnerable population, and who has experienced racism from the very beginning of the establishment of the United States? It's the indigenous people of this continent.

So when you have to look at it, you have to see how land use and zoning has a history that's rooted in racism. And so yes, you have racism and then you have capitalism. And we ourselves, the people, have come up with the people's plan. When the city was continuing to the height of its growth, they say we don't just want to hear you all, come up with some plans.

We come up with plans and we come up with recommendations. We even wrote the resolution so that they wouldn't have to start from zero scratch, and some we borrowed from other states and cities that we thought were progressive and were doing the right thing. And when we presented those, again, they start to water them down and before you know it, they fall in this hole.

So it's not like people are not trying to bring on the changes and that they're not aware of what is happening in a city that's growing so fast as Austin, right? It's that you pretend that one section of the city is empty and you plan as if that city is, that portion of the city is empty without taking into regard who built this city.

CHAKRABARTI: I see.

ALMANZA: And looking at diversity. Looking at how do we retain these people? And I think that those are the things that we really need to look at. When we look throughout the United States and not just the United States, the world. Because gentrification is happening throughout the world. So you can see what's happening in the world and then see what's happening in Austin, Texas.

CHAKRABARTI: So professor Long, pick up on what Susana is saying. Because I think part of the reason why it's very hard for city councils to politically make the kinds of decisions that Susana and PODER are calling for is because there's always this fear, even amongst the quote-unquote most progressive city councils, that doing these kinds of changes will, developers will come back and say this reduces our ROI, so we're just not going to build there at all.

LONG: I think that is actually an important part of the conversation. Because we are so reliant on public-private partnerships and bringing in certain developers, they are very concerned with profit. And the city of Austin often throws its hands up and says, we can't do this because we can't be attractive to developers. We could subsidize that. It would take an effort, and it would take, it would actually take a community effort wide from the city to do it, but we could subsidize those efforts.

There's something else that Susana hasn't brought up yet and 'cause she's awful humble when it comes to this. Is that when it comes to East Austin, one of the reasons it became an attractive place is because PODER and other groups fought to clean it up.

We're talking about a place that had quite a bit of pollution in various different ways. Had a massive power plant that was having fire fires on a weekly basis and causing all kinds of noise and other forms of pollution in the area. And there were other facilities as well that they fought quite hard to be removed.

And as soon as those, the power plant was decommissioned, as soon as the fuel storage areas started to get removed, suddenly it was a cleaner, greener place and you had more open space. And the city looked at that and said, ""That's a desired development zone. That's where we're going to go in."" And for a long time, they had a lot of, not only legal, but community support to remove those things. But you can get environmental justice, but that economic justice is still late in coming.

CHAKRABARTI: If there isn't what you called for earlier, which is as this growth is happening, the protections that are put in for existing residents. And Susana, you were talking about how PODER has a plan for that. We only have a minute left, Susana, but like, when you presented this plan to city leaders, what was their response?

ALMANZA: One of the things is that they're gonna look at it and then they're gonna, which council will support what resolution. And then again, there's a study and then it just sits there on the shelf. That's usually the way it is.

CHAKRABARTI: Yeah, they'll say it's endlessly in committee. Where good ideas go to die. Sorry. I just, I'm a little jaded about state politics. But professor Long, again, in this last minute, help me find a way to wrap this up again and bring the relevance of what's happening in Austin to the rest of America.

Because what do you think the lessons are that Austin has to teach the rest of us about how to cope or what not to do in coping with rapid growth?

LONG: I think be careful about how much you wish growth to happen. And whether or not your economic sustainability as a city is really dependent on growth and expansion, because that is a story that is not going away.

And maybe the next time you'll have us on, we're talking about development east of the city and in the surrounding counties, because one of the areas that has not been developed is east of Austin. And whether it's data centers or advanced manufacturing or semiconductor plants, all of those communities east of Austin — which by the way, were places that a lot of people who were displaced from East Austin moved to those communities, because they're the only place they could afford.

This month it was announced, the Michigan Infrastructure Office (MIO) Technical Assistance Center (TAC), in partnership with the Michigan Infrastructure Council (MIC) and the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE), will help organizations access reimbursements of 30 percent or more for their clean energy investments.

In announcing the program, the MIO said, “Michiganders from across the state have been selected as Elective Pay Ambassadors to help nonprofits, schools, local governments, Tribal Nations, houses of worship and other tax-exempt entities bring federal funding to Michigan’s communities.”

According to the announcement, the MIO “is responsible for organizing and executing Governor Whitmer’s vision for infrastructure, coordinating across state government, marshaling resources, and partnering with local officials, federal partners, and outside stakeholders to ensure resources sent to Michigan through BIL, also known as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), are used efficiently and effectively.”

The gist of the announcement is: Michigan’s Elective Pay Ambassador Program Makes It Easier for Entities to Access Federal Clean Energy Tax Credits.

By placing trained Ambassadors in trusted community organizations, we’re making it easier for eligible entities to understand the process, file for the tax credits, and receive the federal dollars they’ve earned,” Kris Brady, director of MIO TAC, said in the announcement. “Elective Pay offers real, tangible financial benefits for schools, local governments, nonprofits, and houses of worship, entities that are often balancing tight budgets while delivering essential services to their communities. This support helps communities lower costs, upgrade infrastructure, and keep more resources focused on the people they serve.”

After a competitive application process, the MIO TAC said it has awarded grants to seven nonprofits across Michigan that will host the Elective Pay Ambassadors. The Ambassadors’ job is simple but powerful: help community institutions access federal clean energy tax credits through Elective Pay, a mechanism that allows eligible organizations to receive reimbursements of up to 30 percent or more of their project costs.

The Ambassadors for Washtenaw 2030 District are Kim Heumann, a local government resilience specialist and Lissa Spitz, a longtime architect and sustainability advocate. The MIO said Ambassadors have begun receiving training on Elective Pay and will act as local experts, serving the Prosperity Region in which they are located.

“Despite the significant financial benefits of Elective Pay, awareness of this relatively new tool remains low, and many tax-exempt organizations face challenges navigating filing a tax return for the first time in order to claim the reimbursement,” the MIO announcement said. “The Ambassador program was created to close this gap and make the process easier for local leaders who are improving their communities by investing in clean energy technologies such as solar, energy storage, geothermal, and more.”

The Washtenaw 2030 District is a public-private-nonprofit collaborative working to reduce building related greenhouse gas emissions by 50-65 percent by 2030 and eliminating emissions by 2040 while increasing Washtenaw County’s competitiveness in the business environment and increasing owners’ return on investment.

The MIO said the program provides stipends to host organizations (nonprofits) that host Elective Pay Ambassadors who will host educational events on Elective Pay, raise awareness about MIO TAC’s Elective Pay resources and technical assistance services, and ensure Elective Pay is embedded in clean energy project planning. The EPAP will run for one year.

Sometimes it can pay to wait until an overvalued stock gets cheap enough to earn a place in your portfolio. And with shares down by over 80% from their peak, Rivian Automotive (RIVN +0.71%) might deserve a closer look.

Let's dig deeper to find out if the embattled electric vehicle (EV) maker can bounce back as it expands its business model and potentially benefits from a thinning of the competition as rival automakers begin to abandon their fully electric ambitions.

The EV industry faces serious challenges

When Rivian hit the market through an initial public offering (IPO) in late 2021, electric vehicles (EVs) were all the rage. Analysts boldly predicted that the new technology would quickly replace traditional gasoline-powered vehicles and potentially boost the industry's profit potential as early leaders like Tesla demonstrated incredible growth and margins.

Behind the scenes, governments around the world were putting their thumb on the scales to support the industry. In the U.S., this took the form of tax and regulatory credits to support demand while making EV production more competitive relative to gasoline-powered vehicles. However, this year, the Trump administration has rolled back these incentives with disastrous consequences for the once-burgeoning industry.

According to Reuters, overall U.S. EV sales sank by more than 41% in November, following the removal of a $7,500 tax credit that expired in October. Investors should expect continued weakness in the near term -- although over a longer time horizon, improving battery technology and changing consumer habits could spark a resumption of growth.

The crisis might have a silver lining for Rivian

While the loss of U.S. tax credits and other incentives will hurt the American EV industry as a whole, Rivian is much better positioned to weather the fallout than some of its rivals. For starters, many of the company's vehicles didn't even qualify for the $7,500 tax credit because of battery sourcing requirements and MSRPs that were too high. More importantly, the reduction in government support is already helping to thin the herd and stem the competition from legacy automakers.

In December, Ford Motor Company announced an eye-popping $19.5 billion in writedowns as it restructures its business and scraps planned new all-electric models. The company has totally cancelled its once-promising Ford-150 lighting, which competes directly with Rivian's R1T pickup truck.

Over the next few years, pure-play electric automakers like Rivian will have the opportunity to capture more market share in a smaller, but dramatically less competitive EV industry, while traditional U.S. automakers return their focus to gasoline-powered vehicles and hybrids.

The Trump administration's aggressive tariff policy could also add another layer of protection for Rivian by making imports less competitive. The California-based company makes most of its cars at its main factory in Illinois.

Is Rivian stock a buy in 2026?

For investing, numbers tend to speak louder than words. And Rivian's operational results are getting more encouraging. Despite the uncertainty in the EV industry, third-quarter revenue soared 78% year over year to $1.56 billion because of solid automotive sales and a surge in software and services revenue, which adds much-needed diversification.

Rivian has established itself as a leader in vehicle electrical and software development, which may have something to do with its start-up culture and the type of tech-related talent available in California compared to traditional automotive hubs. Reuters reports that its joint venture with Volkswagen is attracting attention from other automotive companies that are interested in incorporating its architecture into their vehicles.

This energy will not only support Superior but the surrounding areas that are growing in the East Valley and Copper Corridor.
For the Town of Superior, battery storage means emission-free energy, construction jobs and millions of dollars in lease revenue over the life of the project.
There is no one-size-fits-all plan to meet Arizona energy demand.
Mila Besich was elected Mayor of the Town of Superior in 2016, and re-elected in 2018 and 2022.","For 150 years, the people of Superior built this town with their bare hands.

Our rural community was carved from the Superstition Mountains like the silver and copper mines that dot this area – an indelible link to both our past and future.

Now, as Superior experiences an economic resurgence brought about by industries old and new, our town continues to envision and chart its own path. This time, with energy.

Like water, access to reliable and affordable energy is essential to every Arizona community. Superior is growing. We remain a small town of roughly 2,500 residents, but our downtown district is buzzing. A new generation of travelers and tourists is discovering Superior and our unique shops, restaurants and beautiful natural surroundings – all less than an hour from metro Phoenix.

Mining is also a big part of our story, of course. Resolution Copper is prepared to create thousands of local jobs as it pulls enough copper out of the ground to supply an estimated 25% of North America’s copper demand. We are working hard to keenly target the development of affordable housing and recruitment of quality employers so there are more places to live and work for Superior families.

None of this is possible without affordable, reliable power.

To help provide the energy Superior needs to thrive, we have proposed to SRP a local parcel for construction of a Battery Electric Storage System (BESS). The facility, when completed, will be capable of producing 100-150 MW for four hours at a time – enough to power over 25,000 homes during peak demand on summer evenings. This energy will not only support Superior but the surrounding areas that are growing in the East Valley and Copper Corridor.

The beauty of a battery storage system like this is it can be charged when demand is low (and power is less expensive) and utilized when demand and energy costs are high. That improves reliability and saves money on the power homes and businesses need.

Arizona has nearly 3,900 MW of operational battery storage statewide, with plans to nearly double this portfolio by 2026. Already, Arizona is among the Top 3 states in the nation in terms of deployed, utility-scale battery storage.

For the Town of Superior, battery storage means emission-free energy, construction jobs and millions of dollars in lease revenue over the life of the project. But SRP’s broader network of customers will also benefit since the battery power is more than enough for Superior’s current needs and will flow to the grid.

The need for more energy in our state is growing. Arizona’s major utilities – SRP, APS and Tucson Electric Power – all broke records this past summer for peak demand. Energy consumption is forecast to only keep climbing as our state grows and the economy requires more energy for manufacturing, data processing and other key industries. Rural Arizona must look at these energy opportunities, not only to serve its own residents but also to be actively engaged and leading to ensure the power grid is sustainable statewide.

There is no one-size-fits-all plan to meet Arizona energy demand. We need coal, natural gas, nuclear, renewables and other new technologies. Utility-scale battery storage is a critical part of the equation.

As Vice Chairman Nick Myers of the Arizona Corporation Commission said: “Battery storage not only supports grid stability, it ensures that renewable energy is available into the evening when the sun isn’t shining. Adding significant storage capacity is critical to maintaining a reliable and resilient grid.”

It’s fitting and I’m proud that the people of Superior are helping lead the way by taking control of our own energy future.

“This order will pass tens of millions in costs to Colorado rate payers, in order to keep a coal plant open that is broken and not needed.
Tri-State, which co-owns the Craig Power Station with several other utilities, has planned to close its Craig Unit 1 since 2016 for economic reasons and to comply with federal and state emissions-reduction requirements.
On Wednesday, Colorado Energy Office executive director Will Toor said the state does not have an electricity shortage that would warrant invoking the Federal Power Act to keep Craig Unit 1 open.
Craig Unit 1’s closure follows a careful planning process that determined replacing or repairing the aging coal-burning plant would cost more than investing in newer, more renewable forms of electricity, he said.","The Trump administration, in its ongoing push to boost fossil fuels, issued an emergency order Tuesday to keep an aging coal-fired power plant in Craig operating even though it is broken, out of operation and was scheduled to be retired this week.

The move puts Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association in a bind as it tries to figure out how to comply with the order after years of planning to shutter the old Unit 1 plant — and after a Dec. 19 malfunction caused an outage at the unit that will be expensive to repair.

“Tri-State has a policy of 100% compliance, and we will work with Unit 1 co-owners, and federal and state governments to determine the most cost-effective path to that end,” Duane Highley, Tri-State CEO, said in a news release Wednesday. “We are continuing to review the order to determine what this means for Craig Station employees and operations, and the financial impacts. As a not-for-profit cooperative, our membership will bear the costs of compliance with this order unless we can identify a method to share costs with those in the region. There is not a clear path for doing so, but we will continue to evaluate our options.”

The order, which was issued Tuesday night by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, was criticized by Gov. Jared Polis, who said it will cost utility ratepayers more money because the plant needs millions of dollars in repairs to be brought back online.

Colorado does not have an emergency need for electricity, the governor said in an emailed statement.

Environmentalists said reopening the old plant would harm public health as it pumps climate-changing carbon emissions into the air and goes against Colorado’s plan to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2025.

“This order will pass tens of millions in costs to Colorado rate payers, in order to keep a coal plant open that is broken and not needed. Ludicrously, the coal plant isn’t even operational right now, meaning repairs — to the tune of millions of dollars — just to get it running, all on the backs of rural Colorado ratepayers! Going backwards is an attempt to force local communities to foot the bill to extend plant operations, and will cost energy consumers more,” Polis’s statement said. “Today’s action flies in the face of this careful planning, is inconsistent with market forces, and will hurt Coloradans.”

The emergency order will keep Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association’s Unit 1 at the Craig Station in Moffat County open for at least another 90 days. Tri-State has until Jan. 20 to explain to the energy department how it plans to get Unit 1 running and to provide an update on environmental and operational impacts, according to the order. Wright could also renew the order.

Tri-State, which co-owns the Craig Power Station with several other utilities, has planned to close its Craig Unit 1 since 2016 for economic reasons and to comply with federal and state emissions-reduction requirements. The company has based its operational and maintenance decisions on that plan and has adequate resources to maintain power reliability, the Westminster-based company’s news release stated.

Unit 1 stopped operating on Dec. 19 when a valve failed and caused an outage, the company’s news release said. Now Tri-State and the other co-owners will need to repair the valve.

As a result of the order, retaining Unit 1 will require additional financial investments in operations, repairs, maintenance and, potentially, fuel supply. All those factors will increase costs, the company’s news release stated. Tri-State is continuing to review the order to determine how best to comply while limiting the costs to its members, and the impacts to its employees and operations, it said.

Tri-State is planning to close two other coal-fired units at the Craig Station in 2028.

President Donald Trump’s agenda is to increase the nation’s use of fossil fuels, and since he took office in January, he has set about trying to save the dying coal industry through executive orders, large sales of coal from public lands, regulatory relief and offers of hundreds of millions of dollars to restore coal plants.

Colorado is just one state where Wright, who is from Colorado and the founder of an oil-and-gas fracking company, has ordered coal plants to stay open. On Dec. 23, he issued orders to keep open two coal-burning power plants in Indiana.

Environmental groups are suing the Trump administration over its use of the Federal Power Act, arguing the president is abusing his power because there is no national emergency in supplying electricity.

On Wednesday, Colorado Energy Office executive director Will Toor said the state does not have an electricity shortage that would warrant invoking the Federal Power Act to keep Craig Unit 1 open.

In a statement, Toor said the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, a nonprofit with international regulatory authority that monitors the power grid, has found no short-term or long-term reliability risks in the Rocky Mountain region. Craig Unit 1’s closure follows a careful planning process that determined replacing or repairing the aging coal-burning plant would cost more than investing in newer, more renewable forms of electricity, he said.

“These orders will take money out of the pockets of Colorado ratepayers, and especially harm rural communities across the West who could be forced to absorb the unnecessary excess costs required to keep this plant operational,” Toor’s statement said.

But in his order, Wright wrote that he intends to keep Craig open because the electric reliability corporation has reported that the Rocky Mountain region has more variability in its electrical grid than other regions because of a large share of “wind and hydro in its portfolio.”

Wright cited a Western Electricity Coordinating Council assessment that said Colorado’s demand for power is expected to grow by 8.5% to 36 gigawatts from 33 gigawatts by 2034 and that shuttering coal plants will make it hard for the state to meet that demand.

“As described above, the emergency conditions resulting from increasing demand and shortage from accelerated retirement of generation facilities will continue in the near term and are also likely to continue in subsequent years,” the order stated. “This could lead to the loss of power to homes and businesses in the areas that may be affected by curtailments or power outages, presenting a risk to public health and safety.”

Still, Colorado officials and environmentalists said the energy secretary’s assessment is incorrect.

“The Trump administration is engaging in Soviet-style central planning, driven by ideology rather than the realities of the electric grid, that will drive dirtier air and higher electric rates across our state. These orders are unlawful and will not improve energy security in Colorado or the region,” Toor wrote.

Colorado environmental advocates, including GreenLatinos, EarthJustice and the National Parks Conservation Association, denounced the emergency order as a move that will make the state’s air dirtier, harming public health and staining views from the state’s beloved parks.

The Colorado Air Quality Control Commission specifically cited Unit 1’s retirement as part of its plan to reduce haze in Colorado.

“This order puts our communities at risk and turns back progress that Coloradans have fought tirelessly for,” Jessica Herrera, in-house counsel for GreenLatinos, said in a news release. “Once again, the administration is putting the fossil fuel industry before our health and well-being.”

Earthjustice, a nonprofit that provides legal representation to other environmental groups, said Thursday that it is prepared to take action to defend Colorado and to advocate for a just transition to cleaner energy sources.

“Keeping this dirty and outdated coal plant online will harm the health of surrounding communities and hurt all of our pocketbooks,” Michael Hiatt, deputy managing attorney with Earthjustice’s Rocky Mountain Office, said in a news release. “This unlawful order will benefit no one but the struggling coal industry. We are prepared to take action to defend Colorado communities and ensure a just transition.”",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Climate_Coal_Town_Transition_91724.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-12-31 15:13:11.477694

Arizona's biggest climate wins in 2025 The year wasn't all dust and smoke plumes and dead energy projects in Arizona.","Wildfires and extreme weather events in 2025 highlighted Arizona's vulnerability to climate change.

The state's clean energy industry faced setbacks, as major projects were downsized, delayed or canceled.

Despite federal policy shifts, Arizona saw a decrease in heat-related deaths and local progress in climate resilience efforts.

Anyone paying attention to climate news in 2025 had to buckle up and hold on.

In January of what meteorologists say will end as the second- or third-hottest year on record globally, the new U.S. presidential administration change marked a dramatic shift away from outgoing President Joe Biden's historic climate initiatives.

On his first day back in office, President Donald Trump signed executive orders redefining energy reserves as primarily fossil fuels, calling for more oil to be ""unleashed,"" withdrawing America from the United Nations' Paris Agreement to address climate change and halting permits and incentives for wind and solar projects. The consensus from scientists and economists is that these renewable energy technologies are not only the best way to slow atmospheric warming, caused most by burning fossil fuels, but are are increasingly the most profitable electricity option across the globe.

As Trump signed these orders reversing what had been this country's most significant steps toward slowing weather destabilization, neighborhoods across Los Angeles were burning to the ground in what a scientist told The Arizona Republic were, in part, ""climate change fires.""

In the months that followed, historical climate and environment data that had been collected by federal agencies and paid for by the American people steadily disappeared from government websites while the nation's scientific leadership, systems of pollution regulation and federal agencies managing public lands and the environment were all dramatically defunded, challenged or reshaped.

The year ended with the Trump administration ordering (some argue illegally) more polluting coal plants slated for closure to remain open, and by halting progress on five major offshore wind power projects well underway despite declaring a national energy emergency (a judge determined his attacks on wind power were also unlawful). December brought a decision to shut down a major climate research center in Colorado, and the advancement of plans to weaken the Endangered Species Act, the nation's strongest protection for species feeling the effects of climate change.

Arizona's biggest climate losses in 2025

These anti-climate-action actions from Trump's White House trickled down to influence the economy and livability of America's hottest big city and one of its driest and sunniest states.

Arizona's burgeoning clean energy industry retreated into the shadows in 2025 amid new uncertainty about federal financial support; six major projects set to employ more than 8,000 people were ultimately downsized, delayed or canceled. Among these were the massive KORE Power Gigafactory and the Meyer Burger solar panel assembly facility.

Experts told The Republic in January that with its ample sunshine and critical minerals, but lacking oil reserves, Arizona stood to lose more than most states from cuts to incentives for renewables projects and electric vehicle charging stations. This prediction seemed to manifest in July when proposed slashes to climate incentives in Trump's Big Beautiful Bill Act led to Arizona's emissions-reducing businesses going silent as companies huddled to calculate the viability of their investments and economic plans.

""Arbitrarily deciding to stop funding things (the government) already committed to funding...is not a cohesive strategy,"" a industry insider source, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution by the Trump administration, told The Republic.

Clean energy in Arizona may face additional headwinds from a 2025 Trump administration proposal to declassify climate pollution as a harm to human health, and by a controversial bill signed into law by Gov. Katie Hobbs that environmentalists say will make it easier to finance the replacement of coal plants with gas projects over renewables. Another bill introduced in the Arizona Legislature seemed to pick up Trump's anti-wind mantle. It would have made 90% of the state off limits to new wind power projects. It failed, but could resurface in 2026.

Over the summer, Trump also announced cuts to longstanding low-income utility assistance while, paradoxically, claiming energy shortages necessitated increased drilling. Arizona analysts warned that stalling clean energy progress would cause electricity prices to go up in the state, which has lead to an increase in indoor heat deaths. The year ended with major utility Arizona Public Service requesting a $579 million rate increase.

The Grand Canyon State's federal workforce was also downsized this year, just before Arizonans watched the North Rim of their most famous landmark burn in July. According to a new year-end report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Forest Service lost 16% of its staff in just the first half of 2025, confirming earlier reports that thousands of firefighting positions sat unfilled in the months before the Grand Canyon filled with smoke. That included 451 local jobs, or 20% of the department's Arizona-based staff.

Public lands in Arizona also faced proposals in 2025 to defund federal management at national parks, to increase cattle grazing permits on arid landscapes that studies have found are already overgrazed, to remove conservation as a valid land management use and to repeal a 2001 law prohibiting road construction through wild landscapes. Combining those threats with repeated attempts in Congress to make it easier to sell off public lands, including 14 million acres in Arizona, and recent legal rulings that pave the way for destructive mining and development of sacred Indigenous spaces — and treasured natural spaces in Arizona have never been more at risk.

Arizona scientists determined that the two megafires north of the Grand Canyon, which together consumed 200,000 acres of forest and forced the closure of trails and businesses nearby, would not have been as extreme without the warming, drying influences of climate change. Yet, just a few months earlier, the experts who had been selected from the state to contribute to the Sixth National Climate Assessment, a congressionally mandated report that updates knowledge on domestic threats and solutions related to climate change every few years, received an abrupt email from the Trump administration informing them that their voluntary services would no longer be needed.

Dave White, a professor at Arizona State University and director of its Global Institute of Sustainability and Innovation, viewed his participation as a lead author of the Fifth National Climate Assessment, published in late 2023, as a ""patriotic responsibility"" that he was ""incredibly proud of."" The Trump administration labeled these evidence-based reports as ""climate alarmism,"" a move White called ""deeply worrying"" in a society that has been successfully built on trust in science.

""It's incumbent upon us to call out the reality behind the rhetoric here,"" White told The Republic in April.

Other Arizona-based scientists watched as hard-won grants to fund environmental research were put on indefinite pause this year, while seasonal windows to collect data passed and international collaboration opportunities dried up.

Ted Schuur, a professor at Northern Arizona University who conducts far-flung ecosystem research with scientists from Canada, Germany and Denmark told The Republic that this absence from global work toward climate knowledge and solutions will not only result in worse heat and drought extremes across Arizona, but likely also the end of many economic and status benefits America has enjoyed as a research leader.

""What's changing in the Arctic is directly linked to global changes and heat temperature records in Phoenix. If we care about our kids and grandkids and future generations, this doubling down on fossil fuel use that we know is the wrong direction is not a good path,"" Schuur said. ""I personally am a carbon cycle scientist because I want to help make a difference.""

Scientists everywhere remain adamant that the difference between pursuing climate solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions now and leaving it until later will be vast. Cancelling climate reports, defunding firefighting and pulling the rug out from under clean energy projects may temporarily hide the problem from central view, like an ostrich burying its head from danger but leaving its body exposed.

But in 2025, Arizonans weathered broken heat records and a range of dramatic and expensive storms made worse by an overheated, destabilized atmosphere that showcased why climate avoidance is not an America-first strategy.

Before the ashes at the Grand Canyon had fully cooled, for example, unexpected flooding in Mohave and Gila counties inflicted $30 million in damage, which the Trump administration recently declined to help with through federal emergency management funding. What had been an exceptionally dry and inactive summer monsoon suddenly darkened the skies around Phoenix in an immense August rainstorm and haboob dust cloud. Then, air turned abruptly cold as a hail storm shocked typically warm parts of the state.

The year closed with a holiday season in the mountains that brought rain instead of snow and temperatures 20 degrees warmer than average. It also ended with Phoenix climate activists mourning the death of 80-year-old Hazel Chandler, who spent her life fighting for cleaner air and a more stable climate on behalf of future generations.

Arizona's biggest climate wins in 2025

The year wasn't all dust and smoke plumes and dead energy projects in Arizona. Locally, some rays of hopeful climate news snuck through in 2025.

Perhaps most importantly, this year was less fatal when it comes to climate-fueled extreme heat. Arizona's most populous county is poised to record a notable dip in annual heat-related deaths in 2025 for the first time in a decade.

This may be thanks in part to Governor Katie Hobbs' Office of Resiliency, which successfully pushed back on the Trump administration pulling support for home efficiency improvements, and implemented a statewide heat preparedness plan. A three-part Arizona Republic investigation of the plan's effectiveness determined it made strides in rural heat coordination and deployment of mobile cooling units, even as its leading agency dropped the ball on addressing heat-related hospitalizations and its authors declined to acknowledge the influences of climate change.

In contrast to gubernatorial avoidance of climate talk, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego countered national climate dismissal head on by stepping in to lead on municipal action as the 2025 chair of Climate Mayors. She also introduced restrictions and sustainability considerations for new data centers, which environmentalists view as wasteful of water and energy — a critical developing climate story for 2026. Offsetting that was Gallego's support for the massive semiconductor plant TSMC and her desire to make Phoenix a hub for tech manufacturing, which also places large demands on limited local water supplies and forces more polluting electricity production.

In 2025, the city made progress on climate-related goals by launching the ""Phoenix Brownfields Revolving Loan Fund"" to revitalize degraded land, by approving a new ""Energy Access Plan"" to expand cooling affordability and by opening the region's first 24/7 heat respite center.

“Phoenix is proving that bold action and creative solutions can make a real difference in the fight against climate challenges,"" Gallego told The Republic in a statement. ""From planting over a thousand trees and expanding shade through innovative art installations, to advancing solar energy, water purification and food resilience programs, we are building a city prepared for the future.""

Dave Hondula, a climate scientist who oversees Phoenix's Office of Heat Response and Mitigation, celebrated reaching 31 of 36 year-one milestones in the city's five-year ""Shade Phoenix Plan"" to help keep residents safe and cool.

“Increasing tree and shade coverage throughout Phoenix, especially in areas where it is severely lacking, is one of our best strategies to build resilience to climate challenges,” Hondula wrote to The Republic.

Although thousands of acres of shade went up in smoke at the Grand Canyon this summer, scientists issued hopeful predictions that wildlife may recover fairly well given the open, fire-adapted landscape that likely allowed them to escape the flames and then return. (At the other end of the state, however, wildlife face new obstacles with the now double-layered border wall.) Many humans looking for habitat at the North Rim will be glad to watch a lodge to replace the historic burned structure take shape. Some Arizonans fear increasing winter access to the North Rim will detract from the backcountry experience, but business owners in the region told The Republic the planned reconstruction will ""be a huge benefit to everybody in the area,” perhaps even better than before.

Tragic as it was, watching both Los Angeles and the Grand Canyon burn in 2025 may help keep Arizonans on the path of getting serious about wildfire prevention. While L.A. officials moved to cut corners on fire-resistant building practices in the aftermath of the January flames under pressure from homeowners to allow them to quickly rebuild, an Arizona Republic investigation of how this state's forested cities are taking action to prevent conflagrations found many to be reasonably prepared.

From a forester launching a tree thinning consulting business in Flagstaff in response to demand for ""Firewise"" development to the town of Pinetop-Lakeside approving a $11.6 million bond for a new wildland fire station, Arizonans are taking fire management in the age of climate change seriously.

""There are 177 communities, self-defined, active in the (Firewise) program (in Arizona),"" Michele Steinberg, wildfire division director at the National Fire Protection Association, told The Republic in April. ""And that's growing all the time.""

Support among western nature lovers for conservation also seemed to grow in 2025, despite (or perhaps because of) unending attempts in Washington D.C. to erode environmental protections and put public lands up for sale. In the face of a clear development agenda, a slew of Arizonans stood tall for the cause.

Although Arizona State University didn't immediately step up to the plate when Trump went after university funding and any research project that included the word ""diversity,"" it did eventually bet big and publicly on an eco-friendly future. Early in fall semester, the massive university known for its focus on sustainability announced that a $115 million donation would fund a new School of Conservation Futures, giving hope in the dark to Arizona lands, species and young environmentalists.

""There is an urgent need to tackle the challenges facing our planet, as well as an unbelievable opportunity to find new solutions by dedicating our time, creativity and resources to the task,” ASU President Michael Crow told The Republic in September.

Other leaders of all ages continue to inspire other Arizonans to keep climate hopes alive. This year marked the 50th anniversary of the publication of Edward Abbey's ""The Monkey Wrench Gang,"" which continues to seed young minds with ideas for environmental revolution in the Southwest.

More contemporary local leaders like Phoenix organizer and entrepreneur Rhonda Bannard and Prescott naturalist and professor Thomas Fleischner are assembling groups of women or students, respectively, for instruction on how to be environmental advocates and appreciators.

Further into the wilderness, Roz Switzer and Emily Matyas spent 2025 gathering ""Old Broads"" to howl in support of wild animals. And following in their footsteps, Tucson computer whiz and youth climate pioneer Ojas Sanghi is poised to help harness artificial intelligence not to use more electricity but to use it cleaner. (These individuals were all profiled in The Republic this year as part of our monthly local climate leader series. You can nominate someone using this form: https://forms.gle/QCCxBPSHGy1bUJQ99.)

Finally, in a year that saw a distressing number of major news outlets dismiss their climate reporters just as scientists say this coverage is more important than ever, The Republic, Arizona's largest newspaper, still employs one of the biggest local climate and environmental journalism teams in the nation. For people relying on fact-checked, locally-contextualized news tracking the causes and consequences of climate change's influence in the state, that may be a win worth celebrating.

Adjusting your thermostat a few degrees when you’re not home can also reduce energy use and save money.
Eating healthier and wasting less Cutting down food waste can also benefit your wallet, your diet and the environment.
Food waste costs U.S. consumers $728 every year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, and generates the annual planet-warming greenhouse gases equivalent to 42 coal-fired power plants.
“You’ll improve your diet, you’ll reduce your waste and your food will come in less contact with plastic,” she said.","Here’s some good news as the holidays wrap up: Many New Year’s resolutions people already make — eating healthier, saving money, getting organized — double as climate-friendly habits.

Whether you want to spend less, declutter or eat right, here are a few choices that could make a difference for you and the climate. Bonus: They’re all low-effort and low-cost.

Saving money on bills

If you want to save money, start at home. Electronics and appliances can continue drawing power even when they’re turned off. You can cut phantom energy use by unplugging items you’re not using, such as chargers and entertainment systems or using a power strip with an on-off switch.

Adjusting your thermostat a few degrees when you’re not home can also reduce energy use and save money. The U.S. Department of Energy says that adjusting your thermostat by 7-10 degrees Fahrenheit (4-6 degrees Celsius) for eight hours a day can save up to 10% a year on heating and cooling.

Another simple tip: Washing your clothes on the cold setting and air-drying them when possible can help lower energy use and utility costs. Heating water is the biggest energy draw in laundry, and clothes dryers are among the most energy-intensive household appliances, said Matthew Gonzales, the vice chairman of the National Hispanic Energy Council, which advocates for affordable energy for communities of color. This can also reduce wear and tear on clothing.

Gonzales said other simple swaps include switching to LED bulbs, sealing drafty windows and replacing dirty air filters so heating and cooling systems run more efficiently. He also suggested using natural light during the day, opening or closing curtains and windows strategically to manage heat and turning off the lights when you don’t need them.

Savings vary widely depending on where someone lives, how old their home is and local energy prices. But he said households in high-cost states can see meaningful savings from small changes over time.

“Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good enough,” Gonzales said.

Eating healthier and wasting less

Cutting down food waste can also benefit your wallet, your diet and the environment.

Food waste costs U.S. consumers $728 every year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, and generates the annual planet-warming greenhouse gases equivalent to 42 coal-fired power plants.

One place to start is by using what you already have in your pantry before hitting the grocery store, said cookbook author Anne-Marie Bonneau.

“If you have fat and an onion and a couple of random vegetables — or even one random vegetable or some leftover cooked proteins or grains — you’ve got soup in the making,” Bonneau said. “If you’ve cleared out so much food that you don’t even have an onion and fat, it’s probably time to go shopping.”

She also recommends preserving food before it spoils, including fermenting vegetables, which, she says, is easier than it seems. For example, you can make sauerkraut with just cabbage, salt and a glass jar. You can also make sauces from seasonal vegetables like tomatoes and freeze them for use later in the year.

Using a multicooker to make things like apple sauce, yogurt, stews and beans can also help with meal prep while reducing energy use.

As a general rule, Bonneau added, eating fewer ultra-processed foods — such as sugary cereals, hot dogs, chicken nuggets and TV dinners — can benefit both your health and the environment. Those foods are often heavily packaged in plastic, which can shed into food and contribute to pollution.

“You’ll improve your diet, you’ll reduce your waste and your food will come in less contact with plastic,” she said.

Decluttering and buying less

Getting organized doesn’t have to mean buying storage bins or throwing things out. Often, it starts with using what you already have.

Spending even an hour organizing your space, spotting duplicates and rediscovering forgotten items can reduce impulse spending by helping people understand what they actually use, said Katrina Caspelich, communications director for Remake, an advocacy group for human rights and climate justice in fashion.

She said a “one-in, one-out” rule — where you can only buy a new thing if it replaces an old thing — can be effective because it keeps wardrobes from growing and helps prevent clutter by encouraging more intentional purchases.

Unsubscribing from brand emails and sale alerts can also help. “Most impulse purchases start with a notification, not a need,” Caspelich said, adding that waiting 24 hours before buying something new often turns a “must-have” into a pass.

For a more structured reset, you might try a no-buy challenge, pausing new purchases for 30 or 90 days while re-wearing, repairing, swapping with friends, or, if you can't commit to buying nothing, shopping secondhand instead of new. “The key is flexibility,” she said. “Framing it as an experiment rather than a strict rule makes it feel empowering instead of restrictive.”

Remake estimates that someone who takes part in a 90-day no new clothes challenge can save about 3,900 liters (1,030 gallons) of water, avoid roughly 300 kilograms (about 661 pounds) of carbon dioxide emissions, and keep around 9 kilograms (about 20 pounds) of clothing waste out of landfills while saving an average of nearly $300 by pausing new purchases.

Zoom out and the scale becomes clearer: Americans generated about 17 million tons of textile waste in 2018, most of it clothing, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

For anyone overwhelmed by the advice, the takeaway is simple: You don’t have to do everything, and you don’t have to do it perfectly. Starting with one habit you’ll actually keep can make a difference for your budget, your routine and the climate.

A look at the global natural gas and LNG markets by the numbers

109.13 Mt/y: U.S. LNG exports are set to meet a new all time yearly high in 2025, growing more than 25% year/year, according to Kpler predictive data. Export volumes from the United States are expected to reach at least 109.13 million tons (Mt/y), by the end of the calendar year. The commissioning of Plaquemines LNG added an additional 16.51 Mt in exports, but existing terminals also saw yearly gains. Corpus Christi LNG shipped an additional 2 Mt/y due to the ramp up of the Stage 3 expansion. Freeport LNG also saw a 3.21 Mt/y gain after repair and maintenance work.

$9.66/MMBtu: Global benchmark natural gas prices are ending the year at levels last seen before the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. As seasonal temperatures turn toward the milder side in Europe, the February Title Transfer Facility contract has sunk to around $9.66 by mid-week. This is despite European Union gas storage levels falling below the five-year average for most of December. East Asia has maintained the price premium, but it has declined to similar levels as demand softens in Japan and South Korea.

19 Bcf/d: Pipeline nominations to U.S. LNG terminals have held steady near 19 Bcf/d for most of the week, helping to lift Henry Hub near the $4 mark. LNG feed gas nominations have previously hit 19 Bcf/d during the month as projects continue to reach advanced commissioning stages, but pushed to new highs consistently since the Christmas holiday. Nominations have been driven by Plaquemines LNG pulling above operational capacity and an uptick at Sabine Pass LNG.

460 Bcf/y: ST LNG LLC has asked the U.S. Department of Energy to approve exports for a proposed 8.4 Mt/y capacity project offshore the Texas coast. Project partners requested approval of 460 Bcf/y in LNG exports from the Matagorda, TX site through 2050. The project is outlined to utilize up to four floating LNG units combined with a floating storage unit, anchored equipment and a three-mile lateral pipeline to connect to existing offshore infrastructure. The terminal would be supplied feed gas by the Katy and Tres Palacios supply hubs. First LNG production is targeted to begin in 2029, if approved.

Conclusion The confluence of rising electrification (and AIdriven demand), FEOC and tariff-driven regulatory complexity, and an active private capital market has reshaped the bankability equation for power projects.","The US energy policy landscape underwent a significant shift in 2025 with the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and issuance of related executive orders.

At the same time as the energy industry is adjusting to the new administration in the White House, demand for electricity in the US is expected to trend upwards after nearly two decades of being relatively flat1 ,driven by the data centre buildout, electrification and the onshoring of manufacturing. While the policy shift has created headwinds and bankability issues for renewables developers, demand for renewables projects is expected to continue to grow with the continued load growth spurred by data centres and electrification. Demand concerns and the need for energy reliability have also triggered a resurgence of interest in conventional energy and baseload power generation.

The demand squeeze

The International Energy Agency predicts around 40% growth in global demand for electricity by 2035, driven in part by advanced manufacturing, electric mobility and data centres.2 Electricity demand in the US is expected to increase dramatically as well, after nearly two decades of flat growth, driving an expansion in generating and storage capacity.3 Meanwhile, interconnection delays, which have been plaguing the US energy industry, have continued, and shortages of key equipment have become more pronounced.

Retail electricity prices in the US have already been increasing, in part a result of capacity prices increasing for regional transmission organisations (RTOs), which must contract for that capacity with generators. As the project costs for new build increase for developers, the cost to RTOs for that capacity has begun to climb accordingly – and in some cases dramatically, as reflected in a 22% increase in PJM capacity prices during 2025.4

Local distribution utilities and other load serving entities will ultimately pass those higher prices onto retail consumers in the form of higher electricity prices.5 This has prompted stakeholders in the industry to think creatively about ways to more efficiently bring large loads online, although ready solutions remain elusive, as evidenced by PJM's launch, and then abandonment, of a proposal to fast-track large loads such as data centres through mandatory curtailment.6

The regulatory squeeze

The July 2025 enactment of the OBBBA accelerates the phase-out of the tax credit incentives for solar and wind projects and electric vehicles. Under the OBBBA, solar and wind projects must begin construction within 12 months of enactment, ie by July 4 2026, or be placed in service by December 31 2027 to qualify for tax credits.

Additionally, the OBBBA broadened the scope of the foreign entities of concern (FEOC) restrictions, which apply to projects that begin construction after December 31 2025.

FEOC rules bar projects from claiming cleanenergy tax credits if they are owned by, controlled by, or receive material assistance from entities tied to specified foreign nations or designated as security concerns. Internal Revenue Service guidance for the implementation of expanded FEOC restrictions under the OBBBA has not yet been released, adding to the uncertainty around the availability of tax credits for projects that begin construction after December 31 2025.

Such uncertainty, coupled with the accelerated phaseout of the tax credits, has led the developers to reprioritise their development pipeline for solar projects and rush to begin construction by the end of 2025.

Tariffs add an additional layer of uncertainty. Even where projects are not directly affected by FEOC provisions, tariffs on imported modules, inverters or battery cells remain a meaningful line-item risk: sudden duties can raise equipment costs, delay deliveries, or make supply chains uneconomical.

The current administration has taken other steps that are expected to impede new solar and wind development. In January 2025, the federal government paused permitting and approval of new offshore wind projects in federal waters.7

On July 7 2025, the president issued an executive order titled ""Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign-Controlled Energy Sources"", which sought to review regulations and policies in order to cease preferential treatment of solar and wind facilities.8

On July 15 2025, the Department of the Interior issued a memorandum implementing that executive order. The memorandum imposed additional layers of review – including final review by the office of the secretary – for all decisions, actions, consultations, and other undertakings related to wind and solar energy facilities.9 Such additional review is likely to have a dilatory effect on the issuance of permits for solar and wind projects on federal lands, but may be required for projects outside of federal lands as well.10

Renewable project bankability

Regulatory shift and tariff uncertainty have raised certain issues relating to change-in-law provisions, FEOC compliance and tax credit eligibility, which are putting pressure on project bankability and in some cases pushing sponsors to be on-risk for potential additional capital requirements.

Negotiations have increased around the scope of changes in tax law, with lenders reintroducing the absence of changes in proposed tax law as a condition to funding in debt documents. Developers, offtakers, and suppliers of equipment also have extensively negotiated change-in-law provisions in commercial contracts.

In many cases, the risk of increased costs due to new tariffs has been at least partially shifted from suppliers to developers given the uncertainty around tariff policy. Some offtakers have agreed to price adjustments due to increases in tariffs, but many offtakers still refuse to accept such risk. While project finance has always relied on structured allocation of construction risk, with tariffs and supply-chain volatility, some lenders have required guarantees from sponsors to cover related cost overruns.

In the absence of clear IRS guidelines about FEOC restrictions, financings that bridge tax equity investments or tax credit transfers have required borrowers to provide representations, warranties and covenants concerning FEOC compliance.

In addition, loans made by lenders who themselves are ineligible for tax credits under the FEOC rules can cause borrowers to be ineligible for tax credits. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, borrowers are asking lenders to provide representations and warranties regarding their status under the FEOC rules (namely that they are not ""specified foreign entities"").

The practical consequences are that both borrowers and lenders are engaging in legal due diligence and requiring each other to provide contractual protections. Following the release of IRS guidance, fact-based diligence may become more prevalent (as opposed to relying on legal conclusions as to a party's status under the FEOC rules in representations and warranties).

In many cases, the risk of increased costs due to new tariffs has been at least partially shifted from suppliers to developers given the uncertainty around tariff policy

Certainly as to eligibility for tax credits, the July 4 2026 and December 31 2027 cliffs under the OBBBA are likely to impact the availability of bridge financing sized against expected tax equity or tax credit transfers. Since lenders will require a buffer period in advance of those cliffs, sufficient to take remedial action to procure such investment (in the absence of a developer successfully procuring the same), the tightening of available debt capital, and potentially requirements for related sponsor guarantees, should begin to impact project timelines and economics well in advance of those dates.

Private credit

While the demand for funding power generating projects has been growing amidst the growth of regulatory and policy risks, private credit has surged into the power and renewables space, offering flexible debt products that can bridge gaps left by constrained commercial banks.

Private credit lenders can offer patient capital, underwriting to hold their loans, even through temporary extrinsic market challenges; sector-focused capabilities to diligence and structure for complex projects; a willingness to accept construction period complexity, and apply creative structures such as delayed-draw borrowing base facilities for project development costs or quasi-equity instruments that can sit alongside tax equity; and a conviction to close amidst volatility, which derives from each of the factors above. Especially during a period of market uncertainty, private credit's conviction to execute will continue to make such lenders an attractive source of capital.

However, private credit funds still require strong structural protections – covenant packages, security interests, and strict change-in-law notice/cure regimes – and private credit may not fill every gap. Particularly for projects that remain reliant upon tax equity or tax credit transfers to drive a meaningful portion of projects' cash equity returns, permanent tax attributes will remain their primary economic driver.

Near-term outlook

Renewable power –We anticipate a growing divide in the coming year between renewable power developers. On the one hand, well-capitalised and experienced renewables developers that own projects with clean, FEOC-compliant supply lines and robust offtake arrangements will continue to attract financing at competitive pricing. Hybrid solar plus longer-duration storage projects, which serve both capacity and firming needs, should be particularly bankable.

Further, given the increasing cost-competitiveness of renewable power and rising demand for electricity, which is driving up offtake prices, a smaller but growing number of renewables projects may have long-term viability even without tax credits. Indeed, projects that forego tax credits may have greater access to cheaper equipment, since those projects will not be required to comply with the FEOC restrictions. As offtake agreements are priced up, there will also be further opportunities for project financing to fill the gap left by tax equity

There is likely to be some consolidation in the market, in favour of well-capitalised developers and their sponsors, particularly those whose pipelines of projects are supported by economics that are less reliant on tax credits.

On the other hand, marginal projects that depend on uncertain imports, thin margins or speculative merchant risk will face higher financing costs or fail to reach financial close. For projects for which sufficient economic capital is no longer expected to be available given the project's timeline, and which are unable to reprice, those may be marked down or sold, leading to opportunities for selective acquisitions. There is likely to be some consolidation in the market, in favour of well-capitalised developers and their sponsors, particularly those whose pipelines of projects are supported by economics that are less reliant on tax credits.

Conventional power – There is a near-term resurgence of interest in dispatchable resources – eg, fast-start gas peakers, combined-cycle plants with hydrogen readiness – that can integrate with renewables to meet the load profile associated with large-load data centres, as well as other clean fuel sources such as geothermal and nuclear. Some lenders and offtakers find conventional capacity easier to underwrite because it avoids the uncertainty and complexity of tax credits and FEOC compliance. However, conventional projects must still face decarbonisation politics, potential future carbon pricing, and stringent environmental permitting – all factors that complicate long-dated financing.

Moreover, due to a worldwide shortage of natural gas turbines, wait times for large turbines are now often five years or more, with major manufacturers still hesitant to add new manufacturing capacity.11

That shortage compromises the ability of natural gas projects to serve the immediate demand for electricity, in particular for data centres that highly prioritize ""speed to power"". The shortage may pose a significant constraint on the ability of gas-fired projects to achieve viability and secure financing. In fact, we already see a growing interest among data centre developers in installing reciprocating engines or smaller, mobile gas generators behind the meter, often as a stopgap solution until utility-scale gas generation and/or grid connection is available.

Conclusion

The confluence of rising electrification (and AIdriven demand), FEOC and tariff-driven regulatory complexity, and an active private capital market has reshaped the bankability equation for power projects.

The winners will be project developers who can align disciplined supply-chain management and FEOC compliance, or invest forward into new baseload opportunities, with flexible financing solutions, leaning on private credit where appropriate, while protecting their core economics through thoughtful contractual drafting.

The order from Energy Secretary Chris Wright will keep the nearly 50-year-old Craig Generating Station Unit 1 in northwest Colorado operating until the end of March, with an option to extend it further.

It’s the Department of Energy’s sixth such move this year; Wright has also ordered two coal plants in Indiana, one in Michigan and one in Washington state to stay open past their retirement dates, as well as a Pennsylvania power plant that runs on oil.

“Keeping this coal plant online will ensure Americans maintain an affordable, reliable, and secure supply of electricity,” Wright said in a statement.

Colorado’s governor and its top energy official pushed back on Wright’s claim that keeping Craig open would boost affordability, saying it would only raise electricity prices.

In a statement, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said the order would pass “tens of millions in costs to Colorado ratepayers, in order to keep a coal plant open that is broken and not needed.”

According to Polis’ statement, Craig 1 “isn’t even operational right now” and would require repairs costing millions of dollars to get it up and running before it could even produce power. Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, the power supply co-op that owns Craig 1, said the unit has been offline since a critical part broke on December 19.

“As a not-for-profit cooperative, our membership will bear the costs of compliance with this order unless we can identify a method to share costs with those in the region,” said Tri-State CEO Duane Highley.

It would cost at least $20 million to keep Craig 1 operational for 90 days and approximately $85 million to run the unit for a year, according to a report from power sector consulting firm Grid Strategies, prepared for the Sierra Club. Those costs are mostly from the purchase of coal. However, the price tag could balloon to $150 million per year, depending on how much the DOE requires the plant to run, the Grid Strategies report said.

Colorado Energy Office executive director Will Toor said Tri-State has already built gas and renewables projects to replace the power the unit produced. Toor said the North American Electric Reliability Corporation has not forecast any reliability risks in the region.

In other words, Toor said, Craig 1 is simply not needed to bolster the state’s grid.

“We think there would be a very significant cost to ratepayers for no benefit,” Toor told CNN.

In addition, Toor said, Craig 1 was built near a coal seam that has had all of its coal mined. Procuring more coal from elsewhere would incur additional costs.

Wright’s order “is purely for the purpose of trying to keep coal in the system for ideological reasons, while driving up cost to customers,” Toor said. “At the same time, they are actually taking steps to reduce the reliability of the grid by making it far harder to deploy the resources that you can quickly build, which are wind and solar.”

Keeping other coal plants open past their retirement dates has foisted tens of millions of additional costs on ratepayers.

Consumers Energy, the utility running a retiring Michigan coal plant that Wright forced to stay open in June, recently reported that it cost $80 million to keep the plant open from late May to late September — largely from the purchase of additional coal — which will raise residential electricity bills in Michigan and 10 other states the plant serves.

Environmental groups are challenging the other orders from Wright in the courts.

The town of Locust is building an $800,000 park complete with playground and ADA-compliant pathways. “Locust is becoming a hub for young professionals and families, because it’s accessible to Charlotte, but it’s also affordable,” Kazimir says. “It’s not a bedroom community at all. People want to get somewhere where they belong and can be involved in their community, and they have a lot of community events. There is momentum and energy in Locust.”

According to the Charlotte Regional Business Alliance, Stanly County’s population is 64,578, about 1,000 more people than in 2023, and it’s expected to increase to 69,215 by 2030. Many are choosing to live in Locust and other communities in western Stanly County. That’s where subdivisions are sprouting up along routes that share pavement with Mecklenburg County. It’s less than 20 miles from Locust to Interstate 485, which circles the Queen City. “It’s definitely getting closer,” says Jeff Parsons, vice president of academic affairs and chief academic officer at Stanly Community College in Albemarle. “There are a lot of houses being built in Stanly County; it’s hard to drive more than five minutes without seeing houses being built.”

Parsons says location is a key asset for mostly rural Stanly County. “We’re close to Charlotte, but on the other side, we have the Uwharrie National Forest and lakes, so it’s two different experiences,” he says. “It’s like a Goldilocks moment. We’re in just the right spot, really.” Officials are working to ensure Stanly County remains the right spot. Business recruitment is a priority but so is preserving land for agriculture, the county’s top industry. And they’re developing unique assets, too.

IN THE FOREFRONT

Stanly County Airport in New London, north of county seat Albermarle, is one of the state’s 62 general aviation airports. Its 12,000-square-foot terminal, which was built in 2010, has two conference rooms, passenger waiting area with fireplace and wide-screen television. The airport also has rentable hangers, a flight training flight training school and sight-seeing flights. But something different took off there in October, when a ribbing-cutting ceremony opened Phase 1 of North Carolina Emergency Training Center.

NCETC plans were announced in 2017. Gov. Roy Cooper signed a budget four years later that dedicated the first $28 million toward its construction, including a state-of-the-art aircraft rescue and firefighting crash simulator. State Fire Marshall Brian Taylor has been the key player in working with state leaders to bring the project to fruition, says Mark Tyler, chief operating officer of the Office of State Fire Marshall. “He’s been very instrumental in making this happen,” he says. The state has committed $87 million to the project so far.

NCETC provides world-class training for firefighters, law enforcement officers, emergency management personnel and members of the military. The center hosts a variety of courses, including Swift Water Rescue, Aircraft Firefighting, Urban Search and Rescue, Hazardous Materials Response and Fire Investigation Technician. About 275 people attending the opening, when they witnessed demonstrations of aircraft rescue burns, jet fuel burns, and swift water boat and helicopter rescues. “This is a statewide facility for anyone in the fire services and rescue services in the state,” Tyler says. “We’re close to getting water capabilities, and we will have national and international interest.”

The water sector, expected to be complete in January, simulates events emergency workers encounter during floods and hurricanes. “There are three primary components,” Tyler says. “[First is] a self-contained water facility, where there’s a big lake, where all the water is stored, then we have massive pumps that pump it into a swift water channel, like the Whitewater Center. And we have a third component, an urban flood village. We open the water into an urban streetscape, like we’re doing rescue work in a small town. We also have boat operators on the lake who train in various components and an environment where we can simulate flooding like a river.”

NCETC’s Phase 2 is planned, and it will add to the center’s economic impact. Dormitories and a cafeteria will be built across the street from the airport. It’s expected to be complete at the end of the year. “People come from all over the nation to train,” Kazimir says. “The center is gigantic, about double the size of the Whitewater Center in Charlotte, but it isn’t for tourists. It’s just for training.”

IN THE CLASSROOM

Stanly Community College’s newest asset, the 31,600-square-foot Trades Facility, opened in October. “It’s exclusively for trades and revolutionary for our economic development efforts,” Kazimir says. “Not only can we show companies the building, but we can build a curriculum for them. We’re at a definite advantage over some other places in the state, because there’s talk like there will be a workforce deficit that will hit when our trade forces retire in the next five years, and we’re trying to get ahead of that.”

Named the Brown Building in honor of longtime SCC contributor Richard Lane Brown, the $12 million investment expands SCC’s programs in electrical line work, welding, mechatronics engineering, heavy equipment operations, computer-integrated machining, and air-conditioning, heating and refrigeration. Its new programs include plumbing, electric systems technology and building construction technology.

While many employment sectors are drifting toward artificial intelligence, Parsons says the hands-on skills taught in the Brown Building are timeless. It now has about 150 students, a third of whom are Career and College Promise high school students. “We have an employer advisory board, and one of the things we’ve encouraged all our programs to do is ask, ‘How do you see AI changing the workforce? How are your entry-level employees going to be different three, five years into the future?’” he says. “And we re-evaluate the skills we’re teaching and the skills they need. At the same time, parallel to that is for our students to leave here with a sense of reality and critical thinking and the ability to communicate. We need to incorporate reliability and dependability into the curriculum, because those are the students who will be successful.”

Parsons says AI won’t be the boss. “I think AI will change some jobs, but there’s an aspect of creativity that AI can’t do,” he says. “AI may take care of some repetitive tasks, but that means the skill level has to go up. For example, AI might help an HVAC worker troubleshoot, but they still have to verify what AI says. That level of critical thinking will have to go up, because AI does make mistakes. We work very closely with the [Stanly County] Economic Development Commission and oftentimes have a seat at the table when companies are having a look at the city. We also have meetings in our new facility. And it’s been very beneficial.”

When business officials tour the Brown Building, they find that “skilled trades” isn’t the same visual as in the past. “We’ve been very excited with the reaction,” Parsons says. “It’s a great facility to change the narrative of what skilled trades looks like. It’s not dirty and nasty. The equipment we have is top-notch. So is the faculty. You can have great buildings and great equipment, but unless you have a great staff, you don’t accomplish much.”

Parsons also emphasizes SCC’s Small Business Center. “It helps aspiring entrepreneurs with tasks like writing a business plan and finding resources for marketing, whatever they need to get started,” he says. “So, we encourage our trade students, like those who may want to run their own HVAC company or their own heavy equipment and grading company … to take advantage of the Small Business Center and get some experience.”

Misenheimer-based Pfeiffer University opened a Charlotte campus in 1977 and a Raleigh-Durham campus in 2004. It is a private liberal arts institution affiliated with the United Methodist Church and accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges. In 2020, it opened its $18 million Center for Health Sciences in Albemarle, where students study in the Master of Physician Assistant Studies and Master of Science in Occupational Therapy programs. “Pfeiffer’s presence is promoting expansion of the health science field in downtown Albemarle,” Kazimir says. “Also, we’re seeing a lot more foot traffic and vibrancy. Every time I’m in a coffee shop, there are young people in there studying or mingling.”

In October, while other in-state four-year schools were considering a 3% tuition increase for in-state undergraduate students, Pfeiffer announced itwould not raise its tuition. It said the move “underscores Pfeiffer’s enduring commitment to accessibility, affordability and high-quality education.”

Pfeiffer University President Scott Bullard says holding the line on tuition made sense. “We believe that a transformative, personalized education should remain within reach for every student,” he said in a news release. “By holding undergraduate tuition, fees and room rates steady for 2026-27, we are investing in our students’ futures and reaffirming our promise to keep Pfeiffer affordable without compromising excellence.”

IN DEMAND

Downtown Albemarle has been reinvented. No longer a stagnant textile town, it’s an emerging place for education, retail and affordable living. “Since the Health Sciences Center opened, downtown Albemarle has shifted from a quiet business district to a place with more life after hours,” says Lindsey Almond, the city’s economic development director. “Students, faculty and new residents are walking the sidewalks; monthly or weekly events draw people into the evening; the mix of uses is shifting toward ‘live-work-play’ rather than just 9-to-5. The adaptive reuse of historic buildings like the Albemarle Hotel and Lowder Hardware brings residents and demand for retail/restaurants.”

“The Residences at the Albemarle Hotel provide modern apartment living right in the heart of downtown, drawing new residents into the core and helping catalyze nearby retail and restaurants,” Almond says. “The building was redeveloped by Anchor & Pillar with 29 upscale apartments and a gorgeous restaurant-commercial space on the first floor. Like the Residences, [the Lowder building] is another key downtown conversion repurposed into high-end apartments with ground-floor commercial/retail — increasing the resident base downtown and adding demand for restaurants and stores after business hours.”

Downtown has a new Courthouse Plaza gathering spot, and an annual $90,000 Downtown Catalyst Grant, now in its fourth year, supports local downtown businesses with funds released up-front not as reimbursements. “The Catalyst Grant funds help make downtown more attractive and active, while the business park, Albemarle Business Center, is a regionally competitive site with large lot sizes, major infrastructure, proximity to Charlotte, ready utilities and a city that controls the site and is curating its tenant base.”

There’s baseball, too. “Three years ago, the city was ecstatic to announce that we were adding a collegiate wood-bat baseball team that is based in downtown Albemarle, the Uwharrie Wampus Cats,” Almond says. “From a downtown-vitality standpoint, having regular summer games, fireworks nights, such as on Independence Day, and associated events brings folks downtown in the evening, supporting bars, restaurants, retail and activity beyond the 9-to-5 day.” The team will be one of the six founding members of the Blue Ridge League this season.

IN THE FIELDS

The N.C. County Extension counts 649 farms in Stanly County. They cover 109,164 acres, which is 43.1% of the county. Most county farms, 299 of them, are in the 10- to 49-acre range, followed by 220 at 50 acres to 179 acres. Thirty-one are more than 1,000 acres.

Stanly County farms bring in their fair share of revenue, starting with what’s grown and raised. The market value of products sold in 2022 was more than $91 million; the net cash farm income was nearly $29 million. Top crops and livestock included cotton, wheat, cattle and turkeys.

Farming supports jobs in insurance, financing, equipment, marketing, food preparation and chemical distribution, in addition to farm labor, says County Extension Director Molly Alexi. “Farming is considered the county’s No. 1 industry and a vital economic driver, with top agricultural products including soybeans and chickens. The sector’s influence extends to the community by maintaining open space, preserving the county’s rural character and fostering a supportive local economy.”

Kazimir sees a priority in balancing rural and urban and land reserved for farms. “People elsewhere are losing farms, and that’s something we don’t want to ever happen to us,” she says. “What’s unique about us is we want to blend agriculture and businesses and grow the agriculture industry in our county as we grow. It’s our core identity. Agriculture is 100% now and forever will be our largest business in the county and the most-valued. We don’t ever want to get away from that.”

IN MANY ITINERARIES

Eastern Stanly County has 10,000 acres of lakes, Morrow Mountain State Park and Uwharrie National Forest, campgrounds and fishing holes, vineyards, golf courses, bike trails, parks and urban farms. All feed a flourishing tourism industry. VisitNC reports that visitors spent nearly $116 million in Stanly County in 2024; that’s $8 million more than the previous year. Of the state’s 100 counties, Stanly moved from 52nd to 50th in tourism spending in 2024.

Tourism is a group effort. “Visit Stanly, the Stanly County Convention and Visitors Bureau, partners with 10 municipalities, Stanly County and area attractions to promote visitors to come enjoy all the great activities and events held in each corner of the county,” says Kasey Brooks, director of Stanly County Convention and Visitors Bureau. “Visit Stanly works closely with the chamber of Commerce, Morrow Mountain State Park, hotels and attractions to encourage visitors to support the local businesses while in the county.”

Brooks says wedding venues, sporting events, restaurants, wineries, breweries, concerts and antique shops add to the list of visitor attractions. “Visit Stanly will continue to work to encourage visitors to come to Stanly County to enjoy our great natural beauty and perhaps stay a few days,” she says. ■",https://images.businessnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/StanlyCounty_main_image_web.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 13:58:50.995252

SETTING A COURSE

The new year begins as the previous ended; the winds of change are blowing. From decisions made in Washington, D.C., to opinions served at kitchen tables in North Carolina’s smallest communities, there are plenty of voices wanting to be heard on a matching number of issues. That makes the work of advocates even more important. Business North Carolina recently gathered experts from the field to discuss what’s important to their groups and what that means to business and life in general across North Carolina, how they’re navigating these confusing seas and how to find common ground, where different viewpoints can row together. Their conversation was moderated by Publisher Ben Kinney. The transcript was edited for brevity and clarity.

The discussion was sponsored by:

• Electricities of North Carolina

• NC Chamber

• North Carolina Independent Colleges and Universities

• E&V Strategic Communications

HOW DOES YOUR GROUP AFFECT LIFE AND BUSINESS IN NORTH CAROLINA?

WILLIAMS: Most people are familiar with their local independent or private college or university. But they may not realize there are 36 across North Carolina. They have about 60,000 undergraduate students and about 25,000 graduate and professional students.

These schools award about 90% of the physician-assistant degrees in the state. If you’ve visited a doctor’s office lately, you likely saw a PA if you didn’t make an appointment three months earlier. So, they’re critical to delivering healthcare in the state. They also award about 65% of the law degrees, 60% of medical degrees and 56% of pharmacy degrees in the state.

Those efforts and others contribute to a great quality of life for our students, and they’re critical to employers. Business news channel CNBC named North Carolina its Top State for Business three of the past four years, and we want a four-peat. But that will require the proper workforce. It’s a double-edged advantage, not a sword. It transforms lives in North Carolina and meets employers’ needs. That supports strong economic development.

CASHION: NC Chamber supports North Carolina’s position as a top state for private-sector job growth. Our team advances policies that make it one of the world’s best places to do business. Those efforts create an environment that supports existing businesses and that economic developers can sell.

The Chamber has developed international relationships, including with business groups in Northern Ireland and Abu Dhabi. We recently signed agreements with the Mexican Business Council for Trade, Investment and Technology and ProColombia. We recently hosted a group from Invest in

Cartagena, part of our ProColombia effort. We toured them across the state and introduced them to key people. We’re already seeing interesting benefits from these relationships in North Carolina, and we’re excited about the future.

BAILEY: We have clients across the state representing different sides of various issues. I lead our public engagement practice. My goal isn’t necessarily to get consensus but understand the communities that we’re working in and identify their voices and leverage them. We want to know who these communities are and what is important to them.

Growth, as positive as it is, elicits different feelings from different people. We work at the state level, trying to understand these organizations’ macro goals and how they’ll impact communities. That allows our clients to work authentically in these communities, advancing their projects without creating opposition.

It’s great that North Carolina was ranked the top state for business three times. But what does that mean at the community level? It depends on the work being done. We’re tapping into that. Those voices are important, regardless of who you’re advocating for. Sometimes it’s neighbors and property owners. Other times it’s elected officials or community leaders.

What we’re doing well right now is understanding the landscape in North Carolina and how people feel and approach these large issues coming to or growing within the state. Then we adjust our client’s advocacy efforts to be effective with the policies they’re trying to influence. As soon as you think you’ve figured out one viewpoint, there’s a different one. It’s an interesting game to play.

WHAT ARE YOUR CURRENT GOALS?

CASHION: Our policy committees are working through different issues, updating our legislative agenda. We base everything on education, talent supply, competitive business climate, and infrastructure and growth. There’s a plethora of efforts coming from the business community that look at maintaining our position and maintain growth in a balanced way across the state.

We continue to push for the elimination of the state’s franchise tax. The legal climate is a top priority. We’re working to keep dark money — third-party litigation investment — out of North Carolina courts. It’s an investment into a lawsuit for a return to an investor. We believe that’s bad for business, consumers and national security. Our legal institute is working on ideas to attract more corporate headquarters, moving the state into a Delaware-type space. We hope some become policy.

We’re working to remove work barriers. We want more service members and their families to stay in North Carolina after they leave the military. We’re looking at ways to connect them to employment, whether as employees or entrepreneurs. We recently released an energy report. We have a water-supply report that we’re promoting at the General Assembly. We’re working with our communities to decide what that policy needs to look like. Agriculture policy will be top of mind moving forward.

WILLIAMS: Our focus is always on access and affordability for our students. When people think of college, they immediately think of traditional age students, and that’s absolutely true. One concern in reaching our attainment goal of adults with a degree, some college or a credential is that the state’s number of traditional high school graduates is plateauing.

There’s been a slight downtick in the percentage of students going to college since the COVID pandemic. But North Carolina has an increasing number of early college students, who graduate high school with an associate degree. They can transfer anywhere to complete a four-year degree, but they need an affordable way to do it.

North Carolina historically has had one of the country’s lowest out-migration rates; about 7% to 8% of high school graduates left the state for college. That has incrementally increased to between 15% and 17%. They’re going to University of South Carolina, University of Georgia, University of Alabama and other schools that offer in-state tuition rates to our students. The idea behind that is economic development, getting those students there and keeping them after college. Many students come to North Carolina to attend college and remain afterward. But we want our students to stay here. It’s a significant issue.

North Carolina has always had many adult students. About 1.1 million adults in North Carolina have some college but no degree. We want to make completing their degree or credential affordable. Many have families and jobs and need to make returning to the classroom work for them.

Maintaining access and affordability is key. But it’s a challenge, because about half of North Carolina students are eligible for federal Pell grants. It takes federal and other aid, including state need-based scholarships and help from colleges and universities. Put in about $1.3 billion annually in institutional aid, because it takes that complete financial aid package to make it possible for students to attend college.

BAILEY: We understand organizations’ legislative agendas, so when clients come to us, we know who’s out there, what they’re advocating for or against, and how we could work within that. Success is being aware of the environment, from the grassroots to the grass tops — chamber executives, local elected officials, anyone who might not be the ultimate vote on an issue but has significant direct access to that vote. So, we can be smart for our clients on how to approach both levels of the conversation around the issue they’re advocating for at the legislative level.

Sometimes that’s all you need to create the future, the path of the issue. But increasingly there are more voices at play. Their power is everywhere, from traditional lobbying and advocacy streams to viral Instagram campaigns, which can gin up a sentiment around an issue. I’ve seen the latter change the trajectory of a vote in the legislature.

We’re paying more attention to them. Facebook and Reddit conversations, for example, are good ways to understand how people feel. They might be one data point, or they could lead you to change the course of the work. If you don’t pay attention to those, you don’t have the tools to monitor, analyze and potentially equip them with what you want to say. They’re a powerful leg of the stool that needs to be considered.

WHAT ARE YOUR CONCERNS?

WILLIAMS: Many of the negative policy impacts on our colleges and universities are coming at the federal level. There have been major changes. Through the passage of the “Big Beautiful Bill,” the Education Department is limiting funding for graduate and professional student loans. Most of the available financial aid is for undergraduate students.

There is little in terms of grants for graduate and professional students beyond tuition remission or an assistantship or something similar. But those are limited in what colleges can provide. There have been Graduate

Plus loans, but they’re now limited to about 10 different doctoral degrees. PA students aren’t eligible for those loans. Occupational therapy, physical therapy and other healthcare degrees aren’t eligible either. So, we’ll look to the state and others to help fill that void. If a student can’t finance their education, then we won’t have the workforce that we need.

Many North Carolina costs are below the national average. Everybody’s concerned about cost, and we have financial aid to help address that. But at the end of the day, we have to pay our faculty and staff, equip the labs and classrooms, and have everything else that’s required. And students must be able to figure out how to finance it.

CASHION: We released a report that says if the stars align over the next five years, we’ll see an almost $500 billion economic impact, 2 million new jobs and billions in tax revenue. We want to figure out how to make this work.

We recognize that at some points and times controversial, sensitive and complex issues arise in our state’s diverse business community. We must deal with those.

We’re working on the affordable housing piece now. It’s critical to our workforce, and it’s an economic growth opportunity. We want to keep people in communities. In the community where I make my home, for example, 90% of the police department can’t afford to live there. That’s not right.

Some local government leaders don’t appreciate the complexities around why we need more housing. We need to educate them, so they can help solve this crisis. If we don’t, it will be an economic development challenge. I look at it from wastewater, housing, transportation and workforce perspectives. We need to figure out those issues by finding ways in the current political environment to push good policy that helps meet needs. It’s difficult to do politically.

We need to think about transportation infrastructure, too. North Carolina has invested billions in it over the last decade or so. It’s one of the state’s biggest untold success stories as it relates to economic development. Tax regulation and infrastructure are top issues expanding and relocating companies review. North Carolina is in a good spot, but growth brings challenges.

BAILEY: Growth keeps me up at night but not in a bad way. It’s exciting and brings opportunities, whether its data centers or developments in a growing town. It can be many things, so you must define it.

But not everyone wants growth. There are opportunities to drill into that to understand why people are opposed and what might lead them to be more open to it. There are many great organizations that are looking at how we do smart growth in North Carolina.

Technology keeps me up, too. Policymakers want more data and storytelling to justify points. Data is getting easier to generate, analyze and provide. It’s amazing. Technology also gives more people a voice. Flip on your camera, take a picture and post it. You don’t have to be powerful, connected or have credentials to become part of the conversation. That’s not a bad thing; that’s the current reality. The job at the end of the day is learning how to leverage, manage and deal to keep conversations factual, civil and effective for everyone.

WHAT PROJECTS OR INITIATIVES ARE IMPORTANT TO YOUR GROUPS MOVING FORWARD?

WILLIAMS: We’ll be asking for more financial aid for higher education. It’s usually spared from budget cuts, but everything was cut during the Great Recession. It remains below its pre-recession level despite some increases. Students need that support to attend and complete college.

While money from the general fund can be difficult to secure, sports wagering may provide an alternative. Despite our athletic teams playing under the same sports-wagering restrictions, all the higher education funding from it currently goes to UNC institutions. It helps them improve their athletic programs. We want to be competitive for students, because our teams are playing teams that are benefiting. Between 60% and 70% of students at some of our institutions are athletes. They compete in Division I, Division II and Division III, which doesn’t provide athletic scholarships.

Colleges compete against each other in athletics and for enrollment. Most students look at public and private institutions. You often must go to the sixth or seventh most populous cross-app in applications before you find another private college. If a student is deciding between two institutions, then they may go where the athletic facilities are improved and enhanced. That’s a concern for us.

The state’s education sectors collaborate, too. NC College Connect, for example, has the potential to be transformational for many students, helping them understand that college is possible for them. The program guarantees admission to about 30 of our institutions, several UNC institutions and all community colleges, which have open admission, for about 70,000 students, each with a 2.8 or higher weighted GPA, in our public and independent high schools. Let’s figure out your choice, and we’ll discuss financial aid packages.

The program helps North Carolina’s many first-generation college students. It helps students from lower-income families, too. Knowing that you’ve been accepted in early fall and we’re there to help, makes college possible for many students. Though some parents were skeptical when the acceptance letter for their child arrived out of the blue, wondering if it was real. You do have to wonder these days. But it’s a real thing.

The number of applications is tremendous. There were more for the most recent College Application Week, when many colleges and universities waive their application fees, than in

the past.

Eliminating the franchise tax would not be a radical departure — it would be the logical completion of a long-running reform agenda.
North Carolina has become a national model by refusing to settle for “good enough.” Ending the franchise tax would ensure it remains one.","As 2025 comes to a close, North Carolina stands in an enviable position. After more than a decade of disciplined tax reform, the Tar Heel State has emerged as one of America’s most economically competitive states. CNBC’s America’s Top States for Business rankings once again place North Carolina among the nation’s leaders, confirming what employers and investors already know: North Carolina is a premier place to invest, expand, and create jobs.

That reputation is reinforced by the Tax Foundation’s 2026 State Tax Competitiveness Index, which ranks North Carolina 13th overall — up from 44th as recently as 2013 — ahead of most states that levy all the major taxes and near the top nationally on corporate taxation. This strong showing is no accident. It reflects a flat 4.25% individual income tax, the lowest corporate income tax rate among states that still levy one, at 2.25%, and a sustained commitment to broad tax bases and low rates rather than politically favored credits.

Yet even the Tax Foundation is clear: North Carolina’s biggest remaining obstacle to greater competitiveness is its franchise tax.

What makes the franchise tax different — and harmful

Unlike income-based taxes, the franchise tax is levied on a business’s net worth — its accumulated capital — regardless of whether the business is profitable. Companies pay it year after year simply for owning assets, even in downturns or startup phases. In effect, the tax penalizes investment itself, taxing firms not on what they earn but on what they have built.

The Tax Foundation’s North Carolina profile does not mince words. It calls the franchise tax “unusually aggressive,” noting that it taxes businesses “on their worth rather than their profits,” harming investment and violating basic principles of tax fairness and ability to pay. In a state otherwise defined by pro-growth tax policy, the franchise tax stands out as an anachronism.

Real costs for real businesses

This problem is not theoretical. A 2024 John Locke Foundation report shows that the franchise tax creates especially high compliance costs due to its complexity and traps small businesses and independent contractors in mandatory minimum payments. The burden falls especially hard on mom-and-pop businesses, such as a local plumbing company with fewer than 20 employees that owns a small fleet of work vans. Even in a slow year, that firm owes the franchise tax simply for having invested in the vehicles and equipment it needs to operate — penalizing small businesses not for profits, but for preparedness. The same analysis shows that the tax exposes companies to punitive audits over technical errors rather than real tax avoidance, and that businesses can owe the tax even if they lose money — or even if they have no physical presence in North Carolina, so long as they sell goods here.

And for all that damage, the franchise tax contributes little to state finances. In recent years it has accounted for just over 2% of General Fund revenue, a share that is shrinking further due to recently enacted caps. That is a steep economic price to pay for such a modest and declining return.

That reality leads to the most common objection to repeal — and the least persuasive.

The revenue objection — and why it falls short

Critics will argue that repeal is impractical because the franchise tax still generates revenue. But that objection misunderstands both scale and trade-offs. The amount involved is small enough to absorb through normal economic growth, ongoing budget surpluses, or modest base broadening elsewhere. More importantly, repealing the franchise tax would remove a direct penalty on capital investment, encouraging business expansion that broadens the income and sales tax bases over time. In other words, repeal is not a gamble on growth — it is an exchange of a narrow, distortionary tax for a broader, more sustainable revenue stream.

Other states have recognized this reality. Oklahoma repealed its capital stock tax. Mississippi is phasing its out. Connecticut is completing its repeal. Louisiana has already enacted repeal as part of a broader competitiveness package — and the Tax Foundation expects that move alone to produce meaningful improvements in Louisiana’s rankings and investment climate. Meanwhile, North Carolina risks being left behind, clinging to a tax most states have already abandoned.

What makes this moment especially important is that North Carolina has already done the hard work. The state has resisted the temptation to rely on narrow tax credits and instead built a system based on low rates and neutrality. That approach is precisely why North Carolina ranks so highly among states that levy all major taxes. Eliminating the franchise tax would not be a radical departure — it would be the logical completion of a long-running reform agenda.

A clear next step for 2026

If lawmakers want a single, concrete goal for strengthening North Carolina’s economy in 2026, this is it. Repeal the franchise tax. Remove the last major tax penalty on capital formation. Signal to entrepreneurs, manufacturers, and employers that North Carolina will not tax them for growing, investing, or weathering hard times.

On the East Coast, cultural institutions reclaimed momentum, with museums reopening, expanding, or redefining their civic roles after years of delay and debate. In the Southeast, stewardship of land, legacy, and philanthropy emerged as a dominant force, particularly in Arkansas and Florida, where health, culture, and landscape became tightly interwoven civic tools.

Across the Midwest, institutions turned inward and forward at once, using competitions, campus reinventions, and preservation projects to recalibrate long-standing cultural anchors. In Texas and the broader Southwest, architecture leaned into symbolism and identity, whether through overt monumentality or the careful translation of religious and cultural traditions into building form.

And on the West Coast, consumption remained a throughline, from heritage properties entering the real-estate marketplace to spectacle-driven commercial architecture, our coverage raised familiar questions about access, authorship, and architectural afterlives.

The year’s projects trace a national portrait of architecture honoring what endures, experimenting with new civic models, and, sometimes, doubling down on spectacle.

Cultural Projects Rounded Out the East

Frick, Sotheby’s, Studio Museum

Along Fifth Avenue, the Frick Museum opened with a bang after a renovation from Selldorf Architects that seemed to take its sweet time. It was worth the wait though, as the renovation honored Henry Clay Frick’s 1914 mansion’s historic idiosyncrasies while expanding its capacity. Nearby, the Marcel Breuer–designed building at 75th and Madison reemerged as Sotheby’s global headquarters following a deliberately light-touch intervention by Herzog & de Meuron with PBDW Architects, its Brutalist bulk newly landmarked and stubbornly intact. Uptown, the Studio Museum in Harlem finally returned after a seven-year closure with its first purpose-built home, a stacked concrete-frame building by Adjaye Associates with Cooper Robertson as executive architect that anchors the institution firmly on 125th Street while expanding its civic and curatorial reach. These openings suggest a year that museums in New York City found their footing and honed their individual identities. These openings are setting the stage for whatever bolder gestures might come next, just in time for downtown to once again steal the spotlight in 2026.

Jacob’s Pillow

Over the summer, a new, mass timber Doris Duke Theatre at Jacob’s Pillow was completed by Mecanoo, to replace the black-box venue destroyed by fire in 2020. The theater was designed as a flexible, highly automated performance space, built to support experimental dance indoors and the landscaped rooftop stage. The sustainably built “magic wooden box,” is wrapped in Lunawood siding, and acts as a beacon of dance and movement in the rural Berkshires.

Calder Gardens

Calder Gardens is “more of a tribute than a museum,” landscape architect Piet Oudolf told AN. Philadelphia’s new cultural landmark pairs a deliberately understated pavilion by Herzog & de Meuron with 250 varieties of plants. The design creates a landscape-forward institution that frames rotating displays of Alexander Calder’s work largely underground rather than as monumental objects.

Stewardship Reigned in the Southeast

Building Boom in Bentonville

The Walton’s, well-known for starting a large supermarket chain containing the first three letters of their last name, have redrawn Northwest Arkansas’s cultural, educational, and medical landscape. The Crystal Bridges’s forthcoming expansions, the bikeable Ledger, and Walmart’s Gensler-designed headquarters have collectively turned Bentonville into something like a pseudo-philanthropic city-state with each new project slotting into a tightly coordinated ecosystem. The latest addition, the Bentonville Health Care Campus, is set to extend that network into specialty clinical care. Together with the Heartland Whole Health Institute by Marlon Blackwell Architects, which opened earlier this year, and the Alice L. Walton School of Medicine, which welcomed its first class in July.

Fountainhead by Frank Lloyd Wright

Frank Lloyd Wright’s angular, all-cypress Fountainhead in Jackson, Mississippi, is officially entering public life, as the Mississippi Museum of Art acquires the late-career Usonian masterpiece, furniture and all, after decades of painstaking private stewardship. The move protects the house from renovations that might alter Wright’s design and turns the house into a public asset, making Jackson a small modernist enclave.

Florida’s Cultural Projects

Across Florida this year, cultural and civic projects opened and shared new plans. Many treat landscape as the primary medium through through which architecture earns its public mandate. From Sarasota to the Panhandle to Jacksonville, new work by OLIN, Sweet Sparkman, Kimley-Horn, William Rawn Associates, OLI Architecture, and Civitas is positioning gardens, parks, and cultural campuses as resilient civic infrastructure.

At Marie Selby Botanical Gardens, Phase Two of the campus master plan advances a model of botanical architecture explicitly shaped by storm resilience, net-positive energy systems, and public accessibility, folding research and exhibition into a hardened yet porous landscape. Nearby, Sarasota Orchestra’s future Music Center similarly leans on landscape as connective tissue, embedding its concert hall and education spaces within wetlands, meadows, and outdoor rooms.

That impulse stretches north and east. In Walton County, OLI Architecture’s Longleaf Art Park will frame a single Richard Serra sculpture within a carefully preserved pine flatwoods ecosystem. In Jacksonville, Civitas’s proposal for Metropolitan Park sets out to reimagine a legacy event space as a living river edge.

Underscored by the state’s move to permanently protect Florida’s parks from development, these projects point to a broader recalibration, where landscape stewardship is a civic obligation shaping Florida’s next public works.

The Midwest was a Place of Institutional Reinvention

Nelson Atkins Museum of Art

Weiss/Manfredi, working with SCAPE and a large consultant team, won the international competition to design a new addition to Kansas City’s Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, beating finalists including Kengo Kuma, Renzo Piano, Selldorf Architects, Studio Gang, and WHY. The competition was first reported by AN in April 2024, with an open call later drawing 182 submissions before six teams were shortlisted. The unanimously selected scheme proposes a “connected tapestry” of additions.

Ford Motor Company Central Campus Building

Ford’s new 2.1-million-square-foot Central Campus Building recently opened in Dearborn, Michigan. It’s a hulking new home base designed by Snøhetta, now acting as the centerpiece of Ford’s reworked Research & Engineering campus. The move marks the company’s official shift away from the midcentury Glass House, its longtime 1956 headquarters a few miles east, which will be decommissioned and demolished as Ford Motor Company ushers its workforce into a shinier era.

Preservation Took a Bow

In Columbus, Indiana, the long-mothballed Crump Theatre inched toward its next act with the selection of DKGR architects to lead its renovation. The 1889 theater has spent the last decade stuck in time. The renovated venue will have a 750-seat performing arts and community venue positioned as a catalyst within Columbus’s Downtown 2030 Plan. The project underscores a broader Midwestern pattern this year, in which local governments and community groups are betting that cultural reuse can do the work of economic development.

That same principle is already in place in Milwaukee, where EUA’s $80.1 million transformation of the Milwaukee Repertory Theater’s home inside a former power plant reached completion. The new Associated Bank Theater Center threads contemporary performance infrastructure through the shell of the 1898 Oneida Street Power Plant.

Monumentality and Symbolism was Discussed in the Southwest

National Medal of Honor Museum

The National Medal of Honor Museum arrived in Arlington this June. The 102,000-square-foot exhibition box by Rafael Viñoly Architects hovers 40 feet above the ground on five megacolumns, one for each military branch. Backed by Jerry Jones and other private donors, the museum leans hard into monumentality with spiraling stairs, a cosmic oculus for the Space Force, and acres of metal cladding. Its message of heroism is loud and clear.

Ismaili Center

After nearly 20 years of planning, the first Ismaili Center in the U.S. opened in the fall. Designed by Farshid Moussavi Architecture, the stone-clad, light-filled cultural campus is equal parts mosque, civic center, and serene garden escape from Allen Parkway traffic. Wrapped in a mashrabiya-style “tapestry of stone,” packed with symbolic triangles, and floating safely above Houston’s floodplain, the design uses Persian architectural traditions to meet the Texas ecology, with monarch butterflies showing up uninvited.

Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation News

First came the open letter. Last year, Aaron Betsky publicly begged the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation to stop turning Frank Lloyd Wright’s name into a licensing free-for-all. He warned of merch-y afterlives that had little to do with living architecture.

Then came the reset. After years of internal strife, public criticism, and bruising battles over the future of Taliesin and its school, longtime president Stuart Graff announced his departure in 2024, clearing the way for a new chapter and a new leader. In March, the Foundation named Joseph Specter as its new president and CEO, arriving from the Arizona Opera with promises to “strengthen the mission,” “expand influence,” and restore a sense of gravitas to Wright’s legacy.

And then, the Foundation unveiled a $184,900 limited-edition Airstream camper designed in the “Usonian spirit,” lovingly wrapped in Wrightian patterns and officially bearing Frank Lloyd Wright’s name. Compact! Organic! On wheels! Wright wanted architecture to move with life, and apparently life now comes with a hitch, a waiting list, and financing options.

Consumption Was King in the West

Tesla Diner

The Tesla Diner served supercharged nostalgia this summer. Designed by Stantec, it indulges the whims of its fanbase through a retro-futuristic mix of diner, drive-in theater, and supercharging station, complete with 66-foot LED screens, Cybertruck commercials, and a parade of customized Teslas. The architecture vacillates between the fastidious minimalism of an Apple store and the cartoonish detailing of a theme park restaurant sending visitors both back in time about 70 years and toward a techno-utopian future that clashes with its urban surroundings.

Provenance Hit the Los Angeles Real Estate Market

At the beginning of this year, the fires in Los Angeles were all anyone could think about and they dominated AN’s coverage of the city. But as the smoke cleared, the city’s wider real estate market seemed undeterred. In March, Frank Gehry’s Binoculars Building in Venice quietly hit the market after nearly 15 years as a Google office. Showing that a pair of 45-foot binoculars wasn’t immune to the logic of “price upon request.”

In September, David Lynch’s Hollywood Hills compound went up for sale, after the famed director’s death. The filmmaker purchased the primary residence on the lot, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright’s son Lloyd Wright, in 1987, paying $560,000 for the 3-bedroom house faced with pink concrete and chevron detailing.

Then in November, the Stahl House, Case Study House No. 22, designed by Pierre Koenig and canonized by Julius Shulman, was listed for the first time ever. Cantilevered, glassy, and permanently poised above Los Angeles, the house entered the market, prompting questions like: how much will someone pay to own a piece of architectural history and will they let anyone else see it once they do?

Elon Musk's automaker published a press release on Monday with a consensus of analyst predictions for the company's latest quarterly sales, the first time it has publicly given Wall Street such a heads-up.

The delivery consensus, which is a compilation of predictions from analysts selected by Tesla, estimated that the EV giant sold 422,850 vehicles in the last three months of 2025, around 14.6% fewer than the same period last year.

That's lower than Wall Street's wider expectations. Analysts were expecting Tesla to sell 440,907 EVs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

It's also a surprising move from Tesla, which typically does not issue public communications ahead of critical sales announcements.

Tesla, which is expected to report its latest quarterly sales as soon as Friday, did not respond to a request for comment.

""This is highly unusual for Tesla to send out a press release with quarterly consensus delivery estimates,"" said Gary Black, managing partner at Future Fund, which sold its Tesla holdings in May.

Black wrote in the Tuesday post on X that the release suggested Tesla's Q4 sales were lower than the Bloomberg consensus and were, in his view, likely closer to 420,000.

Investors remain bullish

Tesla's stock price hit a record high this month amid investor optimism over the company's robotaxi push, but the Cybertruck maker's core EV business has had a difficult year.

Tesla was hit hard by the collapse in electric car sales after the $7,500 federal tax credit expired in September.

The company's US sales reportedly fell to their lowest level since 2022 in November, despite the launch of cheaper versions of Tesla's bestselling Model 3 and Y EVs.

Other automakers, including Ford, Hyundai, and Kia, also reported big falls in EV sales in November. Detroit rivals Ford and GM have taken charges of $19.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, as they shift their EV strategies in response to a changing policy landscape.

Things haven't gone much better for Tesla outside the US. The company has been buffeted by fierce competition from local rivals in China, where an army of EV startups has rolled out high-tech electric vehicles at rock-bottom prices.

In Europe, meanwhile, the US automaker's sales have collapsed nearly 30% so far this year amid backlash over Musk's political interventions.

The order was issued under section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, which allows the Energy Department to keep power plants running during times of crisis, such as war or energy shortages.
“Going backwards is an attempt to force local communities to foot the bill to extend plant operations, and will cost energy consumers more.
A spokesperson said the company received the order at 6 p.m. last night and would be issuing a statement this morning.
Tri-State originally decided to close the plant by the end of 2025 as part of its move to more environmentally-friendly energy sources.","President Donald Trump’s Energy Department is ordering a coal-burning power plant in northwest Colorado to remain open just one day before it was scheduled to shut down.

U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright issued an emergency order on Tuesday requiring Craig Station’s Unit 1 plant in Moffat County to keep running until at least March 30, 2026, with an extension possible. The plant was set to close on Dec. 31.

The order was issued under section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, which allows the Energy Department to keep power plants running during times of crisis, such as war or energy shortages.

Wright’s order claims that Colorado and other Western states face an energy “emergency” due to a “shortage of electric energy, a shortage of facilities for the generation of electric energy, and other causes.”

The closure of coal-burning plants “could lead to the loss of power to homes,” the order states, as well as “businesses in the areas that may be affected by curtailments or power outages, presenting a risk to public health and safety.”

The Trump administration has used similar justifications under the Federal Power Act’s 202(c) section to keep coal plants running in other states.

Gov. Jared Polis, in a statement, condemned the decision, claiming that keeping the plant open will “pass tens of millions in costs to Colorado rate payers.”

He added that the plant is “broken and not needed.”

“Ludicrously, the coal plant isn’t even operational right now, meaning repairs — to the tune of millions of dollars — just to get it running, all on the backs of rural Colorado ratepayers!” Polis stated. “Going backwards is an attempt to force local communities to foot the bill to extend plant operations, and will cost energy consumers more. Today’s action flies in the face of this careful planning, is inconsistent with market forces, and will hurt Coloradans.”

The Craig Press sent questions to Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, the utility company that operates the Craig station, asking whether claims that the plant is “broken” are accurate and how it plans to respond to the emergency order.

A spokesperson said the company received the order at 6 p.m. last night and would be issuing a statement this morning.

Tri-State originally decided to close the plant by the end of 2025 as part of its move to more environmentally-friendly energy sources. It plans to close the Craig station’s two other coal-burning plants by 2028.

The effort is partly driven by a state law that requires large-scale utility providers to reach 100% renewable electrical energy by 2050. Tri-State is also looking to transition to other energy sources for economic reasons.

U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd, a Western Slope Republican whose sweeping 3rd Congressional District includes Moffat County, praised the emergency order in a statement on Tuesday, saying that Colorado’s energy policy “has been driven by ideology instead of reality.”

“Plants were scheduled to close to satisfy political timelines, even though the power was still needed and local economies would feel the loss,” stated Hurd, who has pushed for the Trump administration to keep another coal plant running in Pueblo , which is also in his district.

Hurd said the move to keep the Craig plant open “keeps reliable, dispatchable power available when the grid needs it, protects good-paying jobs, and strengthens Colorado’s energy infrastructure at a time when demand is rising and the grid is under strain.”

The state’s energy office and environmental advocates, however, are deeply critical of the decision.

Colorado Energy Office Executive Director Will Toor, in a statement, questioned the U.S. Energy Department’s use of the Federal Power Act, which he said provides the federal government “limited authority” to act during emergencies.

“Colorado does not have an energy emergency,” Toor stated.” In fact, the state, along with the rest of the region, has some of the most reliable power systems in the country.”

The environmental group Earth Justice, also in a statement, claimed the emergency order was “illegal.” It cited an analysis by Grid Strategies showing that if the plant remains open and generates its average output over the last few years, costs could rise to $20 million over 90 days, or approximately $85 million per year.

We need energy regulators and a Governor who are paying close attention to what is happening in people’s homes and wallets.","Dear Editor:

Gov. Mike Braun’s recent appointments to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission send a clear signal about whose voices are being prioritized – and whose experiences are not.

All three new appointees are white men. That fact alone is not the core problem. The deeper concern is what those appointments represent: a regulatory body that increasingly looks like the executive suites and boardrooms of monopoly utilities rather than the communities bearing the brunt of soaring energy costs across Indiana.

At a moment when Hoosiers are struggling to keep the lights on, the people charged with regulating our utilities should understand firsthand what it means to choose between paying the electric bill and buying groceries, affording medication or keeping up on rent payments. These appointments suggest a troubling disconnect between state leadership and the lived reality of Indiana families.

Hoosiers are hurting right now, and Gov. Braun’s energy agenda is not helping.

In just the past year, electric bills have surged across the state at levels not seen in decades. Customers served by NIPSCO have seen electric bills rise by 27 percent. CenterPoint customers are paying 25 percent more. Duke Energy Indiana customers face increases of roughly 20 percent, and AES Indiana customers are staring down a 12 percent hike.

A report released in November estimated Hoosiers’ electric bills will go up an average of 16.3 percent, costing an extra $260 a year. These are not marginal adjustments. They are household-shaking increases that arrive month after month, regardless of income or circumstance.

In 2025 alone, Braun’s utility regulators rubber-stamped some of the most severe electric rate hikes in the past 20 years. The average statewide investor-owned electric utility bill rose by approximately $28 per month in a single year, with many Hoosiers paying $50 more or more each month than they did just one year ago.

These increases did not happen by accident. They are the predictable result of a regulatory approach that has consistently prioritized utility spending and expansion over affordability. Rather than embracing proven, lower-cost solutions that could reduce pressure on ratepayers, Braun has touted a “build-at-all-costs” energy agenda, doubling down on expensive coal and fossil fuel investments and promoting long-delayed nuclear projects that come with massive price tags and decades of financial risk. Those costs do not disappear. They get passed along to Hoosiers’ monthly bills.

Compounding the problem, the anti-consumer utility legislation Braun signed into law in 2025 all but guarantees higher bills in the future by weakening oversight and shifting more financial risk onto ratepayers. The message to Hoosiers is clear: You’re going to pay more now, and you can expect to pay even more later.

That’s why the Governor’s choices for the IURC are perplexing at best. When regulators share more professional and cultural affinity with the industries they oversee than with the public they serve, the result is predictable: rubber-stamped rate hikes, limited scrutiny of utility spending and a regulatory process that feels inaccessible and unresponsive to everyday Hoosiers.

Indiana has no shortage of qualified women and people of color with deep expertise in energy, consumer protection, environmental justice and public policy. Many were part of the candidate pool. Choosing not to appoint them reflects a missed opportunity to strengthen the Commission with voices that understand energy affordability not as a theoretical concern, but as a lived experience.

Braun has said he wants to focus on affordability and economic opportunity. If that is truly the case, then energy regulation cannot remain business as usual. Appointing regulators who mirror the status quo – at a time when the status quo is failing Hoosiers – is not leadership. It is complacency.

While the Governor cannot change these appointments now, he can chart a better course going forward, holding all commissioners accountable for rigorous oversight, meaningful public engagement and decisions that prioritize ratepayer protection over utility profits. It also requires listening – really listening – to the Hoosiers who show up at hearings, submit comments and speak out about bills they can no longer afford.

Hoosiers do not need more window dressing or procedural box-checking. We need energy regulators and a Governor who are paying close attention to what is happening in people’s homes and wallets. The credibility of our regulatory system and the lives of Hoosiers depend on it.

For Overview Energy, it is reported as the company's second major milestone on its path to delivering grid scale clean energy from space following the first laboratory validation – and the final validation step before moving its system off Earth.

""Imagine sunlight collected 36,000km above Earth, then arriving as clean energy wherever the grid needs it,"" comments Marc Berte, founder and CEO of Overview Energy.

“That's what we're making real. Our airborne milestone proved that the core transmission system works in motion – the same foundation that will operate in orbit. Space solar energy will only matter when it powers real demand on Earth, and we're designing for that scale from day one.”

For the flight the Cessna Caravan was fitted with Overview Energy’s laser and optical systems – similar to that intended for delivery into orbit – and on the ground a receiver of standard solar panels.

As the aircraft flew overhead at an altitude of over 5,000m, the system identified the receiver, locked onto it and delivered power through an eye-safe near infra-red light beam. The panels then converted that light into electricity in the same way they convert sunlight.

Overview Energy reports the next step as piloting a low Earth orbit satellite to demonstrate end to end functionality of the full system in space in 2028.

This is then scheduled be followed with megawatt scale commercial operations with its first geosynchronous orbit satellites in 2030, with the ability to see the sun for over 99% of the time.

The company plans that its satellites should be capable of serving multiple continents, dynamically shifting power delivery based on demand and in particular to meet the needs of energy intensive users such as data centres, growing cities and large military bases.

The receivers are envisaged as existing and future solar projects that will form a flexible energy network that can deliver power instantly to where it's needed.

The near infra-red wavelengths selected are those proven in fibre optic networks, medical imaging and security cameras, making the architecture both highly efficient and passively safe, according to Overview Energy.

To ensure that the lasers are efficient and their wavelengths are in the precise range, they need to be cooled and in space it is proposed the spacecraft should have radiators to reject their heat. For the demo an ice based thermal battery was used to absorb the heat during flight.

Similarly a battery system was used to power the lasers as a proxy for the solar panels that would be used in space.

""[Overview Energy’s] space solar energy approach isn't just technically ambitious; it's designed with real-world deployment in mind from the get-go,” commented Reed Sturtevant, General Partner at Engine Ventures.

Record power transmission

While no details that have been released of the demo in terms of power transmission and losses, another US startup Star Catcher Industries has claimed a record for wireless optical power transmission of more than 1.1kW in a stationary setup with off-the-shelf solar panels at NASA’s Kennedy Space Centre.

This is in excess of the previously claimed May 2025 record of 800W set by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), with Star Catcher reporting delivery of more than 10MJ of energy during its test campaign.

Star Catcher’s focus is on power delivery to satellites in space – a space energy grid, as the company calls it – rather than to the Earth, and reports during the demonstration delivering energy to multiple commercial off-the-shelf single and triple junction solar panels commonly used in space as well as to customer payloads representing key market segments including space data centres, in-space manufacturing and remote sensing.

Among the demonstrations, Star Catcher reports wirelessly transmitting energy and recharging the onboard batteries of Intuitive Machines’ lunar terrain vehicle to showcase how the technology could expand the operational envelope of such vehicles, particularly during the two-week lunar night and within permanently shadowed regions.

Star Catcher envisages launching its first in-orbit power beaming demonstration in 2026. As evidence of the interest in its technology the company reports having signed six PPAs collectively valued in the tens of millions of dollars in annual recurring revenue through the end of the decade.","https://enlit.stream.prepr.io/52bql5cmgrwx/w_1600,h_900,c_center/overview-energy-satellite-space-header-2025-12-05-175542-ylzo-2.jpg",N,,2025-12-31 14:59:22.296378

Here’s why, and how it can be made more durable.

The CCA is driving down carbon emissions by reducing the number of carbon allowances sold each year. That ensures that fossil fuel use will decrease, which is the objective of the CCA. Revenue from the allowance auctions is being reinvested in a variety of programs that will further reduce emissions and build resilience to climate change.

As the number of allowances decreases, the price of those allowances will rise unless the demand for fossil fuels decreases faster than the number of allowances. Those higher costs would be passed on to consumers. Given the hypersensitivity of many consumers to the price of fuel, that could increase opposition to the CCA.

Opposition to the CCA will not rise if either fossil fuel demand decreases fast enough to prevent rising prices, or if the number of consumers using fossil fuel decreases. Since fossil fuel demand decreases with the decreasing number of fossil fuel consumers, the key to reducing opposition to the CCA is reducing the number of those consumers.

Fossil fuel is primarily used in Washington for transportation and heating (air, water, or food in homes and buildings).

The number of fossil fuel consumers can be reduced by replacing fossil fuel-powered vehicles with vehicles that are powered by something else — primarily electric vehicles — and by replacing fossil fuel-powered heaters with carbon-free heaters; primarily heat pumps. Consumers who do so will no longer care about the price of fuel.

Higher prices for electric vehicles and heat pumps have been a barrier to their purchase, so tax credits and rebates have helped spur sales. Now that federal tax credits for EVs and heat pumps are gone, sales will struggle to grow. The phaseout of federal funding for EV charging stations will also slow EV sales growth.

With the lapse of federal subsidies for electric vehicles and heat pumps, fewer people will electrify their transportation and heating systems, so more people will remain sensitive to the price of fuel. This continued sensitivity renders the CCA vulnerable to calls to repeal it as the number of carbon allowances declines and the price of fuel increases.

If the CCA is to survive another repeal effort, it must deliver more of its considerable revenue to the people who are most sensitive to the price of fuel: those using fuel-burning vehicles and appliances.

Total CCA revenue is now $4.3 billion. Of that, only 7% is for electrifying transportation, and 10% is for buildings. To protect the CCA, more of the revenue should be allocated to EV and heat pump rebates.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12262025_tzr_tzr_175047.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-12-31 12:58:57.366843

Letter from Mayor Ballantyne

Dear Somerville Community,

My vision for Somerville is an inclusive, equitable city where we can all thrive together.

When I took office as Mayor in 2022, this vision guided every decision we made at City Hall. This report summarizes what we accomplished together over the past four years during a period of both challenge and tremendous progress.

I submit this report so that as the next and future administrations set their course, they have a quick reference for areas of success and challenge to build on and address. I also place this in the record in gratitude and recognition of all who believed in and helped create progress in this amazing place we call Somerville over the past four years.

Building an Inclusive City

Inclusiveness means the people most affected by our policies have a seat at the table. Through new initiatives such as Participatory Budgeting, a multi-focused Anti-Displacement Task Force, and our expansive Public Safety For All efforts, we ensured community voices shaped our direction. We intensified outreach to meet residents where they are, building trust and creating opportunities for meaningful participation.

Whether the expansion of outreach staff across departments to grow citywide capacity or the focused intensive push to add literally hundreds of new engagement opportunities, we followed our commitment to keep our ear to the ground and honor that input with serious review and thoughtful follow-through.

An inclusive City means all of us supporting our values, even if they are challenged by our federal administration. That’s why I filed a lawsuit with Chelsea in defense of all our residents, regardless of immigration status.

Advancing Equity

A number of residents and staff have told me I could have taken the easy way out with our American Rescue Plan Act funding. It would be easier to just fund large infrastructure projects in one fell swoop and ignore the complex social impacts of Covid. We didn't. Instead, we covered multiple needs with $35 million invested in infrastructure and $40 million delivering initiatives and services for our most vulnerable residents.

Spending on infrastructure has a generational impact on our debt, budget, constituents, and community, and it is critical to address these foundational needs. We helped our people recover from COVID's impacts through often ground-breaking programs that staff mobilized to stand up. The complexity of this cannot be understated. Municipal innovation requires navigating challenging law, procurement, and capacity issues all while doing our regular daily work. From flexible rental assistance, guaranteed basic income, childcare support, and much more, we pushed for impact and delivered it.

Pay Equity and Investing in Our Workforce

We also took on structural inequities within the City workforce. Through the Wage and Compensation Study, and the negotiations that followed, we lifted historically low salaries within SMEU and improved benefits while righting long-standing inequities between comparable jobs. This is lasting pay equity and a reflection of my administration’s and our community’s commitment to doing what is right. More than just delivering updates to the same old contracts with the same old inequities built in, this was my administration acknowledging the right thing to do.

Deep investments in our schools addressed the same for educators and school staff. In the 9 current collective bargaining agreements between the school district and educator and staff unions, pay equity is at the very center. The most recent contract, taking effect in SY26, raised our school paraprofessionals’ pay to $50,000 a year, with full parental leave by the third contract year, setting us far above counterparts in Massachusetts and neighboring communities. The greatest impact here is that we lifted people up from the bottom.

With the same focus on attracting and retaining quality employees, we enhanced our Family Medical Leave Policy to be Paid Family Medical Leave. This new policy allows for 8 weeks paid leave for employees to care for themselves for a serious medical condition, birth/adoption of a child, and paid time off to care for immediate families with serious medical conditions, as well. My administration recognized the need to care for employees so they can care for our constituents.

Creating Opportunities to Thrive Together

To deliver on our progressive values, we must diversify and grow our revenue. That's why as a core focus of the last four years, and my entire time as an elected official, I pursued strategic commercial development. As a City Councilor, I pushed to increase the mixed minimum unit ratio for housing to commercial in transform districts, and as a Mayor, I helped set the City up to generate roughly $255 million in community benefits from major development efforts such as “Tough Tech” zoning on Somerville Ave, and the large planning projects at Brickbottom and Assembly Square. We also developed a tax increment financing agreement for the Winter Hill Urban Renewal Plan at 299 Broadway, allowing us to advance this long-planned affordable mix-use project. With affordable housing linkage fees, job creation agreements, and the tax base and benefits to invest in our schools, our streets, and our people, development in Somerville is the engine behind social progress.

With this approach, my administration was able to increase and invest in the Somerville Public Schools budget by 34% over four years. We were able to accelerate making our streets safer for everyone and save lives. We were able to build or upgrade 13 parks. We were able to create the Somerville Pollinator Action Plan that won national recognition for leading the way for other municipalities to help prevent pollinator population collapse. We developed “tough tech” zoning that established a model framework to support development for clean energy and transformative technologies, while also enhancing arts zoning to ensure parity and protection within our industrial districts.

My administration understood fiscal responsibility as a keystone to our ability to deliver for constituents. With sound management of city assets and growing revenues, Somerville achieved ‘AAA’ bond rating – the highest long-term municipal bond credit rating – for the first time in the City’s history in May 2023 and then maintained ‘AAA’ for three consecutive years. This status has been crucial for lowering borrowing rates for the city’s critical major infrastructure investments. Especially in a time when federal funding and economic uncertainty threatens our coffers, the pursuit of economic resilience is and must remain a central focus, so that Somerville’s core services and progressive goals can be maintained and attained.

A Thriving Future

This work reflects both my administration's efforts and our partnership with staff across all departments, and countless community members. When I first ran for Mayor, I promised open and inclusive government, affordability, jobs, good governance, climate change mitigation, and strong schools. This report shows how we delivered on those promises while charting the course for future progress.

The challenges of COVID-19 tested us, but we came through stronger. We've put plans and roadmaps in place to meet long-term challenges, guided by experts and community input. We've made measurable progress on residents' wellbeing and city operations.

Thank you to everyone who contributed to this work—City staff, community partners, residents who showed up to meetings and surveys, and all who believe in Somerville's potential. Together, we've built a foundation and set the course for a city where everyone can truly thrive.

With gratitude and hope for our future,

Katjana Ballantyne

Mayor, City of Somerville

Introduction

“My vision for Somerville is an inclusive, equitable city where we can all thrive together.”

– Mayor Katjana Ballantyne

From 2022 – 2025, Mayor Ballantyne’s work at City Hall has reflected her vision of governance. Through her capacity as an executive of City departments and services, as well as an advocate at the state and federal levels, Mayor Ballantyne has led a wide range of initiatives to make Somerville a place where everyone can thrive. Initiatives were designed for measurable impact on constituents’ wellbeing and on the quality of City’s operations. Plans and roadmaps were developed with deep community input and guidance from experts with a focus on delivering real progress not just for, but also driven by, community members.

This report summarizes the City’s key efforts during Mayor Ballantyne’s two terms. While not intended to be an exhaustive list, it offers an overview of core priorities that the community and future administrations can build on.

Section I. Inclusiveness: Inclusive leadership means ensuring that community members have an opportunity to fully participate in the City’s governance. To achieve that, the Ballantyne administration has focused on three key areas of work among other efforts: 1) Civic participation and responsive government; 2) accessibility of services and resources; and 3) a focus on uplifting vulnerable and historically underrepresented communities, including immigrants.

Section II. Equity and Wellbeing: An essential tenet of the last four years has been equitable access to opportunity, resources, and wellbeing and dignity for all constituents, particularly those with the greatest need or who have historically been underserved. This section describes six major areas of work, including 1) Urgent responses to the COVID-19 pandemic; 2) supporting youth and education; 3) supporting unhoused residents and promoting substance use harm reduction; 4) supporting seniors and veterans; 5) public safety and racial & social justice; and 6) safe and accessible transit for all.

Lastly, in making Somerville a place “where we can all thrive together,” Mayor Ballantyne’s administration has employed a multi-layered agenda that encompasses making life more affordable for all, creating economic opportunity, and enhancing sustainability in the city’s infrastructure and operations. The sections below detail these initiatives.

Section III. Thriving – Affordability: Creating an affordable city entails supporting community members through challenges in cost of living. The Ballantyne administration’s three major areas of work include: 1) Supporting limited-income residents and families; 2) Housing stability and anti-displacement policies and measures; and 3) Improving people’s access to housing units, by facilitating unit creation and lowering barriers for renters and buyers.

Section IV. Thriving – Economic Opportunity: A vibrant local economy generates jobs, supports small and anchor businesses, maintains Somerville’s cultural diversity, is equitable for all, and supports education and skill building so that community members are prepared to seize opportunities. Here, the Ballantyne administration’s major areas of work include: 1) Commercial development and bringing jobs to the city, with an emphasis on shifting the tax burden from residential to the commercial sector, and zoning and planning for sustained revenue growth through future-oriented industries; 2) Improving jobs and investing in workplace development; and 3) Supporting small businesses and the arts.

Section V: Thriving – Sustainability: Somerville remains a leader in investing in infrastructure, people, and practices that ensure a well-functioning city into the future. The City’s major areas of work include: 1) Climate action and our environment; 2) Updating our urban infrastructure; and 3) Enhancing the City’s capacity to deliver services.

Section I: Inclusiveness

I.1: Civic participation and responsive government

City government should be accessible to and representative of all residents. Residents should be able to engage in governance and their community in ways that meet their needs. Under Mayor Ballantyne’s two terms, the administration has increased civic participation by thousands and access to government in ways that reflect the local constituency as well as modern advances.

Major initiatives to highlight include:

Commitment to community engagement: Delivered targeted community engagement opportunities that built meaningful opportunities for community members to shape policies, priorities, and goals. From engagement in setting priorities for the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funding, to deep work on Public Safety for All and Anti-Displacement, to the Cultural Arts Plan, a deep commitment to ensuring a public voice in public priorities was interwoven into our policy making and planning. A city-wide survey and robust community engagement process regarding critical choices in the future of the next PK-8 school garnered very high participation.

For example, in 2021, ARPA brought an unprecedented funding opportunity to Somerville. To ensure that residents’ needs were met, the City conducted a community engagement process that included surveys with more than 1,500 responses, more than 20 focus groups, tabling events, and a 15-member Advisory Board consisting of residents, a School Committee member, and a City Councilor. You can draw a straight line from those outcomes to funding priorities pursued that had profound impacts on residents including flexible rental assistance, guaranteed basic income, and more.

Participatory budgeting: The launch of the city’s first Participatory Budgeting program in 2022, which biannually funds $1 million of community projects proposed by residents. Two cycles of Participatory Budgeting have occurred so far, with 11 impactful projects underway, ranging from composting to expanding access to after school programs to investing in the Bike Network Plan.

Civic access: Expanded civic gatherings where residents can connect with City staff and elected officials directly. The “Slice of the City” meeting series, for example, creates informal gatherings in each ward’s local parks, where community members can chat with City staff and their elected officials over dinner.

Civic Day: Established the city’s first annual Civic Day event, which offers engaging ways to browse, learn about, and connect with city functions in all departments at one “science fair” like setting and also builds connection to City Hall staff.

Equity Support Team: The creation of the Equity Support Team in the Somerville Office of Immigrant Affairs built up our capacity to reach adults and youth where they are and connect them to engagement opportunities citywide. This part-time team of 11 includes both adults and youth serving six languages who go into the community to inform and engage residents face to face in support of initiatives across all departments. From parks to festivals to parent or community groups, they meet our residents where they are, ensuring we reach more people who cannot or do not come to us and build their comfort, access, and leadership opportunities going forward.

Grew 311 Constituent Services: 311 is a gateway to engagement. Constituents’ calls to City Hall can not only solve an immediate issue, but also pull them into civic life. Since 2022, the City increased 311 staffing and engaged in communitywide promotion, to both meet constituents’ requests and to build trust and connection with every service delivery. Callers have consistently reported high satisfaction with the City’s responsiveness and services.

Updating the Tree Preservation Ordinance in 2025, strengthening requirements for tree removal and establishing new protections for trees affected by construction. In addition, promoting urban forestry by planting approximately 2,500 trees and continuing proactive care programs for over 5,500 trees.

Establishing the Somerville Pollinator Action Plan (SPAP), a community-driven initiative aimed at supporting pollinator species within the city’s urban environment. The SPAP was created through a collaborative process between City staff, consultant experts, and a community advisory committee. This groundbreaking plan has won multiple awards at the national level and serves as an example to other municipalities.

Conducting two first-ever studies on the feasibility of networked geothermal and electrification in three areas, to examine possibilities of neighborhood-based approaches to upgrading residential energy use.

Launching the food waste collection pilot in East Somerville in 2025, promoting waste reduction and paving way for a city-wide program.

Customers of the Community Choice Electricity program generated 117,500 MWh of voluntary, regional, zero-carbon renewable energy and saved $20 million on electric bills throughout the past two terms, despite historic global price increases.

Unanimously passed the specialized energy code, the state's highest energy code, as well as a home rule petition, ordinance, and resolution in support of Somerville's application to the Fossil Fuel Free demonstration program.

The City’s Office of Sustainability and Environment awarded $1.9 million in grants and technical assistance between 2023-2025 for resiliency and energy/emissions reduction projects, including $500,000 to install six new electric vehicle charging stations across the community and over $500,000 towards resiliency planning and projects.

As a result of all efforts, Somerville was honored as a member of the inaugural class of certified Climate Leader communities by the Department of Energy Resources in May 2025, and was recognized as an A-list global leader in climate action by CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), for the City’s ambitious efforts to address climate change.

These initiatives were developed and implemented through the Office of Sustainability and Environment, Infrastructure and Asset Management Department, OSPCD: Public Space and Urban Forestry Division, City Council, and other departments and community partners.

V.2: Updating the urban infrastructure

From the highest point of the City Hall tower to the lowest point of the Poplar Street Pump Station, the Ballantyne Administration has made strong investments to update its urban infrastructure to enable a more livable, equitable, and sustainable environment.

Major initiatives to highlight include:

Beginning to implement the Building Master Plan, a phased strategy for updating City-owned buildings and allocating their use to different departments for better servicing constituents. These efforts included key building envelope improvements at City Hall, 1895 Building, and 90 Union Square.

Opening the Assembly Square Fire Station in October 2025, the first new fire station built in Somerville in over a century. The station is designed with modern features and technology to support firefighters' work and enhance their safety. The City also developed its first-ever Fire Station Master Plan, providing strategic guidance for upgrades to the city's fire stations.

Comprehensive efforts to update the City’s stormwater management system, including:

Somerville Avenue Sewer Overhaul, which replaces aging pipes and installs new infrastructure to improve capacity and reliability;

Spring Hill Sewer Separation Project, which separates the combined sewer and stormwater system to reduce overflow during heavy rain;

Poplar Street Pump Station, a 4-million-gallon stormwater storage tank and pump near Union Square that reduces flooding, prevents sewage backup, and transforms water management in 60% of the City.

Long term planning efforts to improve the quality of the City’s drinking water system, including the completion of a multi-year program to remove hundreds of lead water service lines, as well as replacing or relining approximately five miles of water main, throughout the City.

Advancing the Grounding McGrath project, a decade-long plan to replace the elevated overpass highway (Route 28) with a ground level road. The City collaborated with MassDOT to obtain over $43 million in federal funding for the project in January 2025.

Updating numerous emergency management plans and infrastructure, including establishing Somerville’s Local Emergency Planning Committee, creating the Local Resource Recovery Center for fire survivors, and updating the city’s Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan since 2015 as well as the Emergency Management Center.

Implementing innovative rodent control measures to improve the city’s urban living environment, including installing “Big Belly” trash cans to reduce food availability, expanding the free residential rodent control assistance program, creating a dedicated staff role in the Board of Health, and employing non-toxic interventions such as SMART electrocution boxes and fertility control.

These initiatives were developed and implemented through the Infrastructure and Asset Management Department, IAM: Capital Projects Division, IAM: Engineering Division, Somerville Fire Department, Office of Emergency Management, Water and Sewer Department, OSPCD: Mobility Division, Board of Health, and other offices and partners.

V.3: Enhancing the City’s capacity to deliver services

A well-functioning government ensures efficient and effective delivery of services. The Ballantyne Administration has invested in its operations over the last four years in order to more effectively serve and impact the community.

Major initiatives to highlight include:

AAA bond rating: In May 2023, the City of Somerville was awarded the highest long-term debt rating of 'AAA' from the municipal bond credit rating agency S&P Global Ratings, a historic first that the City has since maintained for three consecutive years. This upgraded status reaffirms the City’s financial stability and creditworthiness, and offers lower borrowing rates for critical infrastructure investments.

Updated City Charter: A new City charter was approved by voters in November 2025 after years of work by stakeholders across the community. Improvements to the charter include the update of various requirements to bring them in line with modern practices, adjustment of budget hearing and review timelines, and increased oversight by the City Council regarding appointments, auditing, and more.

Focus on hiring and retention: This administration focused on hiring to fill critical vacancies, as well as retaining and supporting existing staff at the City. Efforts include the Work Better Task Force in 2023, aimed at improving staff’s work environment and productivity, and the Wage and Compensation Study, which ensured comparable pay for similar roles across all departments and evaluated competitiveness with other municipalities. Internal surveys also indicate high workplace satisfaction from staff.

Scaling the organization: As City services grew in their scale, supportive departments such as Finance divisions and Procurement and Contracting Services were expanded to ensure efficiency. New ways of organizing teams were also implemented, such as the restructuring of the Health and Human Services and Water and Sewer Departments to scale and optimize service delivery, and hiring finance managers directly into major departments to support operations.

Data, monitoring, and evaluation: In the last four years, SomerStat has coordinated with departments to create more standardized and effective surveys for civic feedback, and to analyze results comparably over time and across efforts. SomerStat’s Open Data Portal also provides all residents with access to public data, with visualizations and data dictionaries to lower technical barriers for use. Looking ahead, SomerStat is working on overarching upgrades such as systematizing evaluation protocols, and creating long-range performance management systems to track progress toward Somervision 2040 goals.

These initiatives were developed and implemented through the Finance Department, the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, the Human Resources Department, the SomerStat Division, and many more who support the operations of the organization every day.",https://www.somervillema.gov/themes/custom/some/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-31 15:58:08.105960

Abbott touts Texas fueling the nuclear renaissance, booming energy sector AUSTIN — Governor Greg Abbott touted Texas’ booming energy industry as the nation’s leader in energy production, powering America’s economy and leading the nation in investment in the advanced nuclear energy industry.

“This year Texas took a magnificent step in becoming the headquarters of the American Nuclear Renaissance,” said Governor Abbott. “By solidifying our great state as a prairie for nuclear energy to thrive, Texas’ energy ecosystem is stronger than ever before. Texas is investing in the future of the world’s energy sector and protecting the petroleum industry, the lifeblood of the state’s economy, to power our state for generations to come.”

2025 Highlights from Texas’ Energy Sector: Governor Abbott Signs Oilfield Theft Protection, Pro-Growth Legislation Into Law In June, Governor Greg Abbott signed into law key legislation to protect Texas’ oil and gas industry and promote economic growth across West Texas, including Senate Bill 494, Senate Bill 529, Senate Bill 1806, House Bill 48, and the Beacon Budget Appropriation.

“Today is a defining moment for the Permian Basin, the future of this region, and the future of Texas,” said Governor Abbott. “We are bringing the full weight of the law to crack down on oil theft in the Permian Basin to protect the critical role energy development plays in fueling our economy. I’m also signing an item to fund an historic $123 million investment in The Beacon, a pivotal economic development project for Midland-Odessa.”

Senate Bill 494 (Sparks/ Landgraf) establishes a petroleum product theft task force.

Senate Bill 529 (Sparks/ Craddick) alters the tax code for the City of Midland to divert certain collected tax revenue for economic development projects.

Senate Bill 1806 (Sparks/ Craddick) provides the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) with additional tools to combat oil and gas theft.

House Bill 48 (Darby/ Sparks) creates an organized oilfield theft prevention unit within DPS to protect oilfield assets, support the energy industry, safeguard economic stability, and enhance public safety.

Beacon Budget Appropriation was appropriated by the Texas Legislature to the Texas Facilities Commission to support Beacon Healthcare in extending healthcare, research, residential, and retails spaces in the region.

Governor Abbott Congratulates Texas Legislature For Passing Nuclear Power Legislation In June, Governor Greg Abbott congratulated the Texas Legislature for passing House Bill 14, which revolutionized Texas’ growing nuclear industry and will lead a nuclear power renaissance in the United States.

“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” said Governor Abbott. “By creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million—the largest national commitment—we will jumpstart next-generation nuclear development and deployment. This initiative will also strengthen Texas’ nuclear manufacturing capacity, rebuild a domestic fuel cycle supply chain, and train the future nuclear workforce. I look forward to signing it into law.”

House Bill 14 (Harris/ Alders) establishes the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office to, among other objectives, lead the transition to a balanced energy future by advancing innovative nuclear energy generation technologies while delivering safe, reliable, and clean energy solutions that address the state’s growing demand.

Governor Abbott Names Shaffer Director Of The Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office In September, Governor Greg Abbott named Jarred Shaffer as Director of the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office (TANEO). TANEO provides strategic leadership to support advanced nuclear project development within Texas and administering the $350 million Texas Advanced Nuclear Development Fund to incentivize the development of the nuclear energy industry in Texas.

“The state of Texas continues to build the world’s most robust and diverse energy sector,” said Governor Abbott. “TANEO and the Texas Advanced Nuclear Development Fund will increase Texas’ investment in an all-of-the-above energy approach to solidify Texas as the world’s energy hub. Jarred Shaffer’s expertise on energy issues makes him the best fit to streamline the nuclear regulatory environment and direct investments to spur a flourishing and competitive nuclear power industry in the Lone Star State. Texas will lead the nuclear renaissance.”

As TANEO begins its work, it is publishing a Request for Information (RFI) from the public and interested stakeholders in the areas of TANEO’s advanced nuclear energy strategic plan development, permitting feedback, regulatory study, and grant application review.

Those interested in responding to this RFI, submit the completed RFI and attachments, if applicable, to taneo@gov.texas. gov with the subject line “Request for Information Form_LAST NAME”.

Governor Abbott Delivers Remarks At 2025 Texas Nuclear Summit In October. Governor Greg Abbott delivered remarks on Texas leading the nuclear renaissance in America and received the “Atomic Texan Award” at the 2025 Texas Nuclear Summit.

“As the Texas economy continues to grow, the lifeblood of every business increasingly depends upon affordable, reliable power,” said Governor Abbott. “To power our future, Texas must be the epicenter for nuclear power generation. Altogether, we have amassed the resources, infrastructure, and the strategy to be able to advance the nuclear renaissance here in the state of Texas.”

This year, Texas launched the Texas Energy Fund (TxEF) to provide grants and loans to finance the construct ion, maintenance, and modernization of electric facilities in Texas.

Abbott announced six significant TxEF investments into the energy industry for the following projects:

• Up to $105 million to the Rock Island Generation Project, for a 122 megawatt (MW) natural gas power plant in Colorado County.

• Up to $216 million to NRG Energy Inc.(Houston), for a 456 megawatt (MW) natural gas power plant in Houston.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced in November a proposal to implement more exceptions for businesses to report the levels of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as forever chemicals.

“This data is necessary for EPA to evaluate and manage the risks associated with PFAS exposure and to prevent harm to human health and the environment,” the attorneys general representing 15 states wrote in a Dec. 22 comment letter. “EPA fails to provide a reasoned explanation for its sudden reversal and ignores the substantial body of reliable scientific research showing the importance of collecting this data.”

PFAS have been used in consumer products since the 1940s — including clothing, non-stick cookware, food packaging, car seats, and strollers.

The chemicals have been known to cause harms such as the increased risk of kidney, breast, pancreas, prostate, and testicular cancers as well as liver damage, high cholesterol and infertility.

“North Carolinians should be able to get straightforward information about how much and what kinds of PFAS are in the products we buy,” Jackson said in a Tuesday statement. “The EPA shouldn’t be helping companies hide what kinds of toxic chemicals they’re using. We know what PFAS damage looks like in North Carolina, and we need these companies to be more responsible.”

Jackson’s office has filed lawsuits against DuPont and Chemours, two chemical companies, for their role in PFAS contamination to natural resources and drinking water in the Cape Fear River Basin and its communities.

The EPA claims the proposed change would reduce duplicity and make reporting more straightforward for businesses.

“This Biden-era rule would have imposed crushing regulatory burdens and nearly $1 billion in implementation costs on American businesses,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement. “Today’s proposal is grounded in commonsense and the law, allowing us to collect the information we need to help combat PFAS contamination without placing ridiculous requirements on manufacturers, especially the small businesses that drive our country’s economy.

Families were reshuffling budgets, truckers were adding unavoidable surcharges, and businesses were raising prices simply to stay afloat. At the same time, Americans were told that there was little anyone in Washington could do to ease the burden. The message stayed the same for months: global forces were responsible, and there was no quick fix for the pain drivers were feeling at the pump.

Yet while families struggled with the highest fuel prices ever recorded — a national average of $5.02 per gallon — the federal government was encouraging Americans to buy electric vehicles costing between $50,000 and $70,000.

Transportation officials suggested that the “more pain” people felt from gasoline prices, the more attractive EVs would become. Energy officials repeated that an electric car was the fastest way for families to reduce their gas bill to zero. For most households, though, the math just didn’t work. The average new EV price in 2022 was $66,000 according to Kelley Blue Book, while the median U.S. household income was around $74,000. A new electric car was not an immediate or practical solution.

Meanwhile, federal actions during those early years reflected a shift away from domestic oil development. The Keystone XL pipeline permit was canceled on day one, new federal oil and gas leasing was paused, existing Arctic leases were withdrawn, and a record 180 million barrels were released from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Drilling permits decreased, and U.S. oil production fell below 2020 levels despite growing demand. Those choices — combined with refinery constraints and global volatility — kept domestic supply from growing at the pace needed to bring relief.

The landscape looks very different today. By late 2025, U.S. energy production had expanded significantly. Federal lands reopened for leasing, permitting became faster, and producers were able to meet more of the country’s energy needs. American crude oil production climbed to an all-time high of 13.4 million barrels per day, and the number of active drilling rigs rose substantially from pandemic-era lows. More supply began moving through the system, helping stabilize markets that had been strained for years.

The results are unmistakable. The national average for regular gasoline sits near $3 per gallon — roughly 40 percent lower than the 2022 peak. And it isn’t just a handful of states seeing relief. Eighteen states now have average prices below $2.75. Drivers in Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and several others are routinely seeing prices starting with a “2,” a number many thought wouldn’t return anytime soon. These aren’t isolated discounts; they are widespread indicators of stronger supply and more balanced market conditions.

It remains true that no president controls gas prices outright. Global crude markets, refinery operations, seasonal demand, transportation costs, and taxes all influence what drivers pay. But federal policy does shape how quickly American energy can be produced, moved, and delivered. When supply is constrained, prices rise. When supply grows, prices ease. The past three years have demonstrated this in real time.

The contrast between the experience of 2022 and the reality of 2025 underscores a simple point: energy policy affects everyday life in immediate, measurable ways. It determines what families pay to commute, what businesses spend to operate, and what consumers pay for goods delivered across the country. It is not theoretical. It shows up every time someone fills their tank.

For millions of Americans now seeing sub-$3 gasoline again, the numbers tell the story more clearly than any political argument.

Globally, clean energy is continuing to grow very quickly.
State governments have continued to pursue their own environmental and energy policies regardless of Trump.","2025 had a lot of bad environmental news, but also a few rays of hope.

2025 has been a dark time for Americans who care about the environment. Rather than being a repeat of his first term, which had been bad enough , Trump’s second term has been an all-out, brutal assault on the environment.. Major environmental rollbacks are on the way, as they were in his first term,although the rollbacks are more sweeping this time. But regulatory rollbacks can be fought in court. Other Trump actions are even more damaging.

The biggest damage has been structural. First, the Administration has ignored the law to cancel or even claw back billions of dollars in spending for the environment and clean energy. Congress chimed in by repealing most of the Inflation Reduction Act, eliminating future funding and phasing out key tax credits. The Administration has also tried to eliminate research grants to universities on energy and climate. Second, the Administration has declared war on the public servants who are responsible for implementing and enforcing environmental laws. Key agencies have been left in tatters. Lower courts have tried to push back against much of this. Their effort to rein in the Administration have been hampered by Supreme Court rulings on the shadow docket, which have made getting into court and obtaining an adequate remedy more difficult.

The structural damage has been accompanied by a host of other assaults on the environment. As expected, Trump withdrew from the Paris Agreement. He also bludgeoned other countries into postponing carbon limits on international shipping. In the domestic sphere, Trump has torn down the regulations that have guided environmental reviews for almost fifty years. He has canceled permits for clean energy projects and used claims of emergency powers to accelerate production and use of fossil fuels. The federal government now seems to be moving in the wrong direction with great speed and determination.

Yet all is not gloom and doom for the environment. Globally, clean energy is continuing to grow very quickly. The U.S. is increasingly out of the mainstream. Here at home, lower courts have continued to push back against Trump’s executive overreach. The oral argument in the tariff case suggests that the Supreme Court may also do so. State governments have continued to pursue their own environmental and energy policies regardless of Trump. And Trump seems not to have won broad popular support for his approach to governance.

In short, it’s been a “dark and stormy night,”as the clichéd story beginning goes. But rays of moonlight are peeking through the clouds. Let’s hope for the best in 2026.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/East_Wing_demolition.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 11:58:11.980685

“The proposed rule falls short of meeting the needs and protections of communities, ecosystems, and waterways across the United States.
We strongly urge the EPA and U.S. Army Corps not to pursue the proposed rule to update the WOTUS definition and to retain current protections for our waterways.”","HARTFORD, CT — Five Connecticut legislators, including Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, are among the more than 100 state legislators from 29 states that have called on the Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reject a proposed rule that could eliminate protections for more than 80% of the nation’s wetlands and waterways.

In the letter, which was signed by Duff, Deputy Senate President Julie Kushner, D-Danbury, and state representatives Aimee Berger-Girvalo, D-Ridgefield, Anne Hughes, D-Easton, and Geraldo Reyes, D-Waterbury, the legislators called on EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and Lieutenant General William Graham to retain current protections under the “Waters of the United States” rule rather than endorse the proposed rollback.

“It’s hard to fathom why the Trump administration has proposed to strip away the federal safeguards that protect American waterways and wetlands, especially given polls show near-universal support for preserving our nation’s water resources,” Duff said. “Here in Connecticut, we recognize how essential these protections are to our public health and our economy. That’s why we’ve been a leader in adopting strong environmental policies.”

Legislators who signed the letter stressed that clean water protections are critical to preserving safe drinking water for millions of Americans. Protections for streams, rivers, and lakes enjoy overwhelming public support, with 94% of Americans saying such protections are essential, according to a 2024 poll by Morning Consult for the Walton Family Foundation.

“Robust clean water protections are also critical to prevent loss of clean and safe water; the proposed rule would roll back these protections, thereby threatening the health and safety of our constituents,” they wrote.

Other benefits of protected waterways include protection from flooding and hunting and fishing and outdoor opportunities that bring significant savings and revenue, they wrote.

“Research highlighted by NOAA showed that coastal wetlands save communities $23 billion each year in storm protections, and in 2018 alone, anglers generated more than $72 billion in sales impacts and supported 470,000 U.S. jobs,” the legislators said.

The change would also place greater burdens on state governments, which would be forced to assume responsibility for protecting wetlands and waterways without additional resources or the legal authority to manage the new role, according to the group.

“As state legislators, we encourage the EPA and Army Corps to listen to Americans who are demanding strong water protections,” the legislators wrote. “The proposed rule falls short of meeting the needs and protections of communities, ecosystems, and waterways across the United States.

The projects, six of which are located in disadvantaged communities, were selected by NYSERDA to participate, subject to successful execution of contracts, in the Building Cleaner Communities Competition or the Commercial and Industrial Carbon Challenge. Today’s announcement advances community and economic development across New York State while reducing energy usage, increasing comfort, and promoting cleaner air and environment.

“These innovative projects will make a significant impact across New York State by redefining how our buildings and infrastructure are designed, operated, and powered,” NYSERDA President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “By upgrading existing structures with energy efficient technologies and advancing clean energy construction, New York is leading our communities toward a cleaner and healthier future.”

Commercial and Industrial Carbon Challenge Awards

The Commercial and Industrial (C&I) Carbon Challenge is a competitive program that provides funding to large energy users such as manufacturers, colleges, universities, health care facilities, and office building owners in New York State to implement clean energy projects that reduce carbon emissions. Projects may utilize a combination of energy or manufacturing process efficiency strategies, carbon capture technology, low-carbon fuel utilization, renewable generation, or energy storage.

NYSERDA awarded over $5 million for two projects located in the Finger Lakes and Capital Region:

• Finger Lakes Health will implement seven greenhouse gas emissions reduction projects over the next three years at Geneva General Hospital in Geneva and Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hospital in Penn Yan, replacing aging systems, improving HVAC system resilience, and reducing energy use.

• The Saratoga County Sewer District will modify existing processes at the County’s existing wastewater treatment plant to provide a long-term, cost-saving solution for biosolids management that produces renewable fuels and reduces the environmental impact of operations.

“Sustainable building practices are key elements in the state’s economic, energy and environmental future,” New York Secretary of State Walter T. Mosley said, “Our partnership with NYSERDA on our Downtown Revitalization Initiative and the State Energy Plan is creating green buildings and projects throughout the State, and our mutual commitment to communities identified as disadvantaged further ensures that our transition to a green economy is both just and equitable. We look forward to expanding that partnership into the future as we implement the Governor’s visionary and practical energy goals.”

The announcement builds on the success of these two programs. Through the Building Cleaner Communities Competition, 70 projects have leveraged nearly $1.3 billion in public and private investment since 2018 to implement carbon neutral or net zero energy performance solutions. Through the C&I Carbon Challenge since 2018, NYSERDA has made awards that will cumulatively reduce 7.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of removing more than 1 million cars from the road annually.

Funding for this program was included in the 2025 Regional Economic Development Council Initiative. The REDC process continues to support and empower regional stakeholders in developing strategic plans and funding priorities that meet local economic needs. Regional Councils reviewed projects from this program and provided scores that reflect how well a project aligns with a region’s goals and strategies.

1. A fantastic distribution

Investors haven't experienced the full brunt of Energy Transfer's sell-off in 2025. There's a simple reason why. The limited partnership (LP) pays a distribution yield of roughly 8.2%.

Even better, Energy Transfer's distribution is growing. The LP announced a distribution increase in each of the first three quarters of 2025. Most recently, it boosted the distribution by 3.1% year-over-year in October.

I expect those distribution hikes to continue. Energy Transfer is targeting annual distribution growth of between 3% and 5%. That goal seems attainable, especially considering the LP boasts the strongest financial position in its history. The debt load shouldn't be a problem, given Energy Transfer's leverage ratios, which are in the lower half of its target range of 4.0x to 4.5x.

Energy Transfer's third-quarter statistics underscore just how well-positioned the midstream company is to keep raising its distributions. Distributable cash flow was roughly $1.89 billion, while distributions to partners were $1.14 billion. That translates to a comfortable distribution coverage ratio of 60%.

2. Solid growth prospects

Don't let the disappointing 2025 performance fool you. Energy Transfer continues to have solid long-term growth prospects.

The ongoing data center boom, fueled by the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), is a particularly important growth driver. For example, in recent months, Energy Transfer announced agreements with Oracle (ORCL 0.47%) to supply around 900 million cubic feet per day of natural gas to three of its U.S. data centers. The LP also announced a 10-year deal with Fermi America (FRMI 0.62%) to provide gas to its next-generation AI hypergrid campus located near Amarillo, Texas.

The growth opportunities aren't limited to the U.S. Energy Transfer's total natural gas liquids (NGL) exports jumped 13% in the third quarter of 2025, setting a new record for the LP.

Energy Transfer has a robust project backlog to capitalize on its growth opportunities. Two natural gas processing plants in the Midland Basin are expected to launch in 2026. The midstream leader also has several natural gas and NGL pipeline expansion projects underway, as well as expansions to its Price River crude oil terminal.

3. An attractive valuation

Investors won't have to pay a premium to enjoy the fantastic distributions and solid growth prospects that Energy Transfer offers. The LP's valuation is quite attractive.

Energy Transfer's units trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of only 10.3. This multiple compares favorably with other top midstream energy stocks. For example, Enterprise Products Partners' (EPD 0.84%) and MPLX's (MPLX 0.80%) forward earnings multiples are 11.1 and 11.3, respectively. Rivals such as Enbridge (ENB 0.44%), Kinder Morgan (KMI 0.62%), and The Williams Companies (WMB 0.61%) have much higher forward price-to-earnings ratios than Energy Transfer.

Management pointed out Energy Transfer's attractive valuation in the third-quarter investor presentation. The LP's trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA ratio at the time of the presentation in early November 2025 ranked second-lowest among a peer group that included nine other companies.

Unsurprisingly, the management team has invested heavily in Energy Transfer with their own money. Around 10% of units are owned by insiders, a much higher ratio than the averages for the energy sector, the midstream energy industry, and the S&P 500.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F848890%2Fpipeline-welder.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2025-12-31 10:59:14.689361

Now we’re watching those opportunities slip away as federal funding flatlines.” Tags: OBBBA, policy, Reimagine Appalachia, research, solar energy jobs","By Martin McConnell

A Dec. 18 report by ReImagine Appalachia has found that more than 61,000 projected clean energy jobs throughout the Appalachian region are now at risk thanks to “dramatic policy shifts” by the second Trump administration.

The study, titled “Tracking the Appalachian Impacts: What’s on the Line as Federal Funding Flatlines,” revealed that clean energy job numbers have fallen off throughout Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky, following a prolonged period of historic growth. This information has threatened what the study calls “transformative economic opportunities” throughout the Appalachian region, according to research associate and report co-author Rike Rothenstein.

“The data tells a stark story,” says Rothenstein. “Clean energy manufacturing grew from nearly nothing in 2018 to substantial investments by 2023, with 72% going to battery manufacturing and 19% to zero-emissions vehicles. But the momentum has stopped. Federal clean energy investments waned dramatically as President Trump took office for his second term, and the proposed One Big Beautiful Bill Act threatens to dismantle remaining programs entirely.”

Specifically, Rothenstein cited a canceled furnace upgrade at a Cleveland-Cliffs steel plant in Middletown, Ohio, as well as a stalled solar project in Nicholas County, West Virginia as Appalachian casualties of President Trump’s energy policies.

By the numbers

The report found that at their peak in Q3 2024, clean energy investments sat at $4.7 billion for the quarter. That number dropped to $3.8 billion by Q1 2025, and continued flatlining throughout the second and third quarters of the year. Energy and industrial expenditures also dropped 65% from their peak, down to $445 million. But perhaps the clearest indication of policy changes between the Biden administration and the second Trump administration was the projection that 67% of projected clean energy jobs are now at risk throughout the region.

“What’s particularly devastating is that the majority of threatened jobs are in construction and manufacturing, exactly the kind of blue-collar work our communities need,” said report co-author and ReImagine Appalachia Program Director Dana Kuhnline. “These investments were targeting places like Appalachia that have been left behind. The chaotic efforts to dismantle them will have particularly devastating impacts here, raising residential energy prices, sabotaging job creation, and ceding America’s leadership in clean energy to foreign competitors.”

By 2035, the region could lose an estimated 71,000 clean energy jobs across the four-state area thanks in part to President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)’s tax credit changes.

Federal funding for clean energy also decreased around the region, which reversed course from “historic climate legislation” over the past decade, according to the report’s co-authors.

Beyond Appalachia

The Appalachian region isn’t alone in its recent clean energy struggles, with national data from the U.S. Federal Reserve showing that private clean energy construction spending has plateaued at $240 billion as of mid-2024.

“In less than a year, we have seen the historic growth of the clean energy and manufacturing sectors drop to a flat line,” says the report. “Our region was set to create 92,282 jobs because of clean energy investments. Now those opportunities are vanishing before our eyes.”

The damage is also showing in federal agencies including the U.S. Department of Energy. The full scale of the impact on federal employees and federal agency infrastructure is “too massive to detail,” according to the report, but President Trump’s executive orders to slash tax credits for solar power projects are a chief reason for the damage.

“The agency has been key to U.S. global leadership in research, establishing programs to expand clean energy and manufacturing, and has also ensured that traditional energy communities, including Appalachia, have access to these new opportunities,” says the report. “All of this has been put at risk due to Trump administration actions.”

Trump also signed an executive order earlier this year which directed federal agencies to “stop approving permits for wind energy projects,” but a district court struck that particular order down in December 2025. Still, more than $23 billion in DOE-awarded clean energy project funding is on the line, putting a total of 330,000 jobs at risk, says the report.

“We documented $9.85 billion in energy and industry investments, $18.8 billion in clean energy manufacturing, and $22.3 billion in retail purchases of clean technologies since 2022,” says Diana Polson, report co-author. “These were transforming our communities, creating good-paying jobs that don’t require college degrees. Now we’re watching those opportunities slip away as federal funding flatlines.”

By looking at a huge colossal offshore wind project set to yield maximal results by the end of 2026, Virginia is looking at produce clean power by using a concept as simple as turning water and air into energy. Should the state realize its goal of achieving 2.6 GW of energy by 2026, it would have found the easiest route to find an alternative form of energy to assist with the grid woes.

Offshore wind energy makes electricity possible

The state is focusing on a wind energy project where the kinetic force of mechanical air will be turned into mechanical rotation, causing the generator to produce energy. Attention has been devoted to offshore wind projects as these projects enjoy stronger and more constant winds than onshore projects. Since the ocean offers this advantage, the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project can capture the natural wind.

With 176 turbines spinning simultaneously for this project, power can be provided to over 660,000 homes. With water, the offshore wind system gets powered by itself. Through the project, 2.6 GW of power can be generated, making the project a simple one whereby water and air work together.

A big wind project is almost completed

According to Dominion Energy, EVOW progress remains on track despite many mentioned setbacks. Project costs are standing at $11.2 billion and with all imported tarrifs the cost will increase about $690 million. For this project Dominion Energy enjoys an equal partnership with Stonepeak. Thus far, onshore work is progressing rather steadily. Between 2024 to 2026, all offshore work will be well underway with the assistance from workers in Virginia.

Data center requests have led to 17 GW of new delivery requests in 2025 with Dominion serving the biggest concentration of server farms.

Offshore wind project resulting in savings on fuel

With this offshore wind energy project, Dominion is expecting more than just the delivery of electrons. Wiith over $3 billion of savings during the first 10 years of CVOW operation, the advantages of this project is clear. With the anticipated savings, over 1,000 jobs were created. Energy realiability is also promoted. Dominion’s CEO, Robert Blue, asserted that putting a stop to the project would result in energy inflation.

In this state in America, the ocean is becoming a power plant and very soon 2,600,000 kW will become available to light up 660,000 homes by 2026. This massive development is taking place merely 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach.

CVOW is focusing on capitalizing on solar projects

Since the CVOW project is closer to completion, Virginia is proving that clean power can be derieved from merely air and the ocean. Despite the broader $50 billion investment plan for CVOW, Dominion is approaching the addition of a new reactor construction with added caution. Although Dominion is rather cautious, this project in Virginia is setting the tone for America’s renewable energy plans. Increasing the capacity of installed wind turbines in America could have a variety of advantages for the country, including that of strenghtens the economy considerably while ensuring revenue growth, and the diversification of Virginia’s eclectic energy mix.

Air and water have proven to be essential engines for the new renewable energy agenda. The good news is that both air and water are the most abundant resources on Earth so, Virginia has chosen wisely in terms of switching to the most well-known form of clean energy transfers ever. The project symbolizes so much more than just power, but very soon 2,600 MW will rise from the Atlantic as the new steel sets the stage for this highly unconventional project.

,Detroit and Evs,2025-12-31 15:25:27+00:00,MITechNews,From Viral Video to Viable Transport: Flying Cars and Detroit's Next Mobility Test,"Staff, Mike Brennan",,,,,https://mitechnews.com/auto-tech/from-viral-video-to-viable-transport-flying-cars-and-detroits-next-mobility-test/,"“Flying cars are compelling, but air taxis and personal eVTOLs may get approved first because the use cases are narrower.” Are Flying Cars a Threat to Michigan’s Auto Industry?
But if flying cars scale beyond boutique volumes, analysts say Detroit’s manufacturing expertise becomes hard to ignore.
“That’s where Michigan historically excels.” Detroit’s Next Mobility Test Flying cars may represent Detroit’s next mobility stress test, similar to earlier transitions involving hybrids, EVs, autonomy, and connected vehicles.
But each successful test flight—each viral video—pushes the industry one step further from fantasy and closer to function.
What matters now is not whether flying cars arrive overnight, but who helps build them when they do.","The video arrives at a moment when flying cars and closely related electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft—known as eVTOLs—are moving out of concept art and into early test programs. Advances in battery energy density, electric propulsion, lightweight materials, and AI-assisted flight controls have quietly reshaped what is technically possible.

But the bigger question, especially in Michigan, is no longer whether flying cars can work. It’s whether Detroit will be part of what comes next.

A Growing Field Beyond the Viral Clip

The startup behind the video is only one player in a rapidly expanding field.

One of the most visible entrants is Alef Aeronautics, whose Model A is designed to be both street-legal and capable of vertical flight. Alef’s approach avoids runways entirely, positioning the vehicle as a hybrid between an EV and a personal aircraft. The company has said it is targeting early customer deliveries following expanded testing and regulatory review.

“Alef is interesting because it’s trying to meet consumers where they already are—on roads,” said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at aerospace consultancy AeroDynamic Advisory. “That’s ambitious, but it also means solving two regulatory problems instead of one.”

Other companies are taking different routes.

Samson Sky is betting on transformation rather than vertical lift. Its Switchblade converts from a road vehicle into a fixed-wing aircraft in minutes, trading VTOL complexity for longer range and higher cruise speeds—at the cost of needing a runway.

Meanwhile, ASKA is targeting a broader footprint. Its four-seat ASKA A5 uses a hybrid propulsion system and fold-out wings, aiming for family and commercial use cases rather than individual pilots.

“These aren’t all flying cars in the Jetsons sense,” said Seth Goldstein, equity strategist at Morningstar. “Some are closer to airplanes that can drive. Others are cars that can fly briefly. The market hasn’t decided which definition will win.”

eVTOLs: The Adjacent Market Moving Faster

While roadable flying cars grab headlines, many analysts believe eVTOL aircraft—vehicles that never touch public roads—may reach scale sooner.

Startups like Doroni Aerospace are focusing on short-range personal flight, with simplified controls and fully electric propulsion. These vehicles bypass automotive regulations altogether, focusing instead on FAA certification and controlled airspace operations.

“Urban air mobility is where the near-term revenue is,” said Aboulafia. “Flying cars are compelling, but air taxis and personal eVTOLs may get approved first because the use cases are narrower.”

Are Flying Cars a Threat to Michigan’s Auto Industry?

At first glance, flying cars might appear to threaten Michigan’s auto dominance. Many of the most advanced prototypes are emerging from California, Europe, and Asia—not Detroit. And aviation startups operate under a very different regulatory and cultural framework than traditional automakers.

But most analysts see overlap, not displacement.

“The technology stack is almost identical to EVs,” said Goldstein. “Electric motors, battery packs, power electronics, sensors, software. If you strip away the wings, you’re still looking at something Detroit understands extremely well.”

Automakers like General Motors and Ford Motor Company have already invested billions in electric drivetrains, autonomous systems, and advanced manufacturing—technologies that flying-car developers rely on heavily.

Where Michigan could lose ground is if flying-car startups vertically integrate, keeping high-value engineering and production in-house and bypassing traditional suppliers. But if flying cars scale beyond boutique volumes, analysts say Detroit’s manufacturing expertise becomes hard to ignore.

“At some point, aerospace startups run into the same problem Tesla did early on—how do you build this reliably, at scale?” said Aboulafia. “That’s where Michigan historically excels.”

Detroit’s Next Mobility Test

Flying cars may represent Detroit’s next mobility stress test, similar to earlier transitions involving hybrids, EVs, autonomy, and connected vehicles.

Each shift followed a familiar pattern: skepticism, early outsiders gaining attention, then legacy players adapting—or falling behind.

“This is not an existential threat today,” said Goldstein. “But it’s a signal. Mobility is being redefined again, and the question is whether Detroit participates early or reacts late.”

For Michigan suppliers, the opportunity may come quietly. Battery enclosures, thermal management systems, lightweight composites, embedded software, and advanced sensors are already part of the state’s industrial base. Flying-car and eVTOL programs could become adjacent revenue streams, even if final assembly happens elsewhere.

The risk, analysts say, isn’t that flying cars replace automobiles. It’s that new mobility categories mature without Michigan fully plugged into the value chain.

A Slow Takeoff, Not a Sudden Leap

Despite the excitement, flying cars are unlikely to flood suburban garages anytime soon. Early vehicles will be expensive, tightly regulated, and limited to niche use cases. Infrastructure, airspace management, and public acceptance remain major hurdles.

But each successful test flight—each viral video—pushes the industry one step further from fantasy and closer to function.

What matters now is not whether flying cars arrive overnight, but who helps build them when they do.

For Detroit, the next mobility era may not come on four wheels alone—but it doesn’t have to pass Michigan by either.",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/flyingcarpic.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 10:58:45.100648

pv magazine USA spoke with leaders from around the energy storage industry to learn more about what’s next for batteries in 2025.
“I think 2027 is more likely than 2026 for wildfire-prone regions like California to begin explicitly valuing non-flammable storage chemistries in procurement or permitting.
“Localized recycling and domestic processing will become non-negotiable if the U.S. wants its battery supply chains to stay domestic.
Since January 2025, battery storage costs have risen 56% to 69% due to Trump’s tariffs.","The energy storage industry walked a bumpy road in 2025, but eyes are turning toward 2026’s tech stack. While lithium-ion remains dominant, pressure is building for longer-duration storage, safer chemistries and more resilient supply chains in the face of AI-driven load growth, data center demand, wildfire risks and tightening domestic content rules.

pv magazine USA spoke with leaders from around the energy storage industry to learn more about what’s next for batteries in 2025.

Longer-duration storage will shift from a niche solution to a strategic necessity.

“As we look to 2026, the industry is moving toward greater technology diversity, more stable revenue models and continued cost declines that will make longer-duration battery energy storage an essential pillar of U.S. energy strategy.” – Giovanni Damato, President, CMBlu Energy, Inc.

“Future market designs must match renewable supply with industrial demand and support longer-duration storage and innovative approaches, unlocking additional revenue streams like energy arbitrage, peak shaving and congestion management.” – Matt Kennedy, Global Head of Client Transformation, IDA Ireland

“When paired with any generation that can come online quickly, long duration storage can deliver the firm reliability consumers need and expect. Fast, affordable, and firm power is on track to win on economics with the assistance of long duration storage, and that momentum isn’t slowing, no matter the political climate.” – Arvin Ganesan, CEO, Fourth Power

“As data center demand continues to surge, there’s growing recognition that we need longer-duration storage solutions and hybrid configurations that can provide the sustained backup power and grid stability these facilities require.” – Jim Spencer, President and CEO, Exus Renewables

Safety concerns could push non-flammable chemistries back into the conversation.

“I think 2027 is more likely than 2026 for wildfire-prone regions like California to begin explicitly valuing non-flammable storage chemistries in procurement or permitting. What would make things move quickly is another Moss Landing fire incident somewhere, and I think it’s a question of when, not if.” – Eugene Beh, CEO, Quino Energy

Non-lithium chemistry deployment will accelerate, though 2026 might not be its banner year.

“While 2026 may not see a dramatic shift in new battery chemistries, they are on the horizon with new manufacturing plants in the design stage.” – Steve Feinberg, President, Bluewater Battery Logistics

“The convergence of EV and storage supply chains is creating real momentum for ‘built-at-home’ solutions and non-lithium chemistries…As the U.S. steadily moves toward a circular storage economy, alternative chemistries are shifting from ‘nice-to-have’ to ‘must-have’ because they improve safety, affordability, and long-term confidence.” – Julie Royes, Vice President of Corporate Affairs, CMBlu Energy, Inc.

“A continued fall in Li-ion battery prices would be the largest bottleneck for non-lithium storage in 2026. However, there are other compelling geopolitical and supply chain reasons why cost might no longer be the biggest consideration in 2026, especially if China/Taiwan/Japan tensions continue to escalate.” – Eugene Beh, CEO, Quino Energy

Recycling and domestic processing will become a supply chain requirement, not just a sustainability move.

“Localized recycling and domestic processing will become non-negotiable if the U.S. wants its battery supply chains to stay domestic. Shipping black mass overseas for processing goes against the logic of domestic manufacturing. In 2026, the winners won’t just be the ones building cells and packs, they’ll be the ones who can close their loop locally, from materials recovery through finished batteries.” – Joe Adiletta, CEO, Volexion

“While it would be great to find a reuse value for end-of-life battery energy projects, the reality of cheaper, smaller, and safer new batteries leaves recycling as the only option for disposal.” – Steve Feinberg, President, Bluewater Battery Logistics

The value of standalone storage will be recognized.

“We’re seeing storage evolve from just being paired with solar for energy arbitrage to becoming a critical infrastructure component that enables data centers to operate on clean energy while maintaining the reliability their operations demand.” – Jim Spencer, President and CEO, Exus Renewables

Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) implementation will reshape sourcing strategies more than technology choices.

“The BESS supply chain is working hard to figure out the industry impact of FEOC regulations, and a variety of options will present themselves over the coming year. The good thing is that there is so much recognition that BESS is good for the grid, I have no doubt in the fact that [we] will have options and that compliance will not be a major issue.” – Chris McKissack, CEO, Fullmark Energy

“Developers now face dramatically higher construction costs from the Trump administration’s aggressive tariff policies. Since January 2025, battery storage costs have risen 56% to 69% due to Trump’s tariffs. The administration’s new FEOC regulations, which kick in starting in 2026, threaten to increase costs and complexity further.” – Michael Thomas, CEO, Cleanview

“FEOC regulations and global mineral pressures have created both uncertainty and opportunity, pushing the U.S. to take domestic manufacturing seriously and driving renewed interest in non-lithium, FEOC-safe chemistries that strengthen our energy and geopolitical position.” – Giovanni Damato, President, CMBlu Energy, Inc.

Domestic supply chains will be prerequisites for scale.

“Supply chain localization will evolve from a competitive advantage to a competitive necessity, as customers seek greater certainty around delivery timelines, domestic content compliance, and end-to-end quality control.” – Andrew Gilligan, Senior Director of Commercial Strategy, Fluence

“The companies positioned to win are those that invest now in secure, scalable supply chains and embrace the next generation of chemistries capable of meeting the country’s reliability and AI-era infrastructure needs.” – Giovanni Damato, President, CMBlu Energy, Inc.

Permitting reform plus private capital could be a strong mix.

“In 2026, I expect to see real movement on permitting and transmission reform. Smarter regulation and new grid technologies can finally unlock capacity and move clean power where it’s needed most. Add private capital to the mix, and we can build a stronger, faster grid that keeps up with America’s growing appetite for power.” – Peter Davidson, CEO and Co-Founder, Aligned Climate Capital

AI and data centers will raise the bar for what “bankable” battery performance means.

“In 2026, energy storage will be clearly recognized as one of the fastest and most affordable ways to add flexible power and capacity near high-demand areas, especially as the rapid growth of AI data centers outpaces grid capacity and traps customers in multi-year interconnection queues. In this environment, however, capacity alone is no longer enough. Customers are increasingly demanding truly bankable performance with high-density systems that can reliably execute advanced grid functions.” – Andrew Gilligan, Senior Director of Commercial Strategy, Fluence

“As the AI boom continues, there will be demand for non-lithium, non-flammable energy storage to match these needs. Lithium-ion batteries tend to degrade more rapidly than flow batteries when subjected to frequent cycling, making them less viable for data center use cases, which is why flow batteries are well suited for due to their ability to cycle multiple times a day.” – Eugene Beh, CEO, Quino Energy

“The rise of AI-driven battery management and smarter manufacturing is giving people and communities energy storage resources they can rely on when it matters most. Across regions, we’re seeing [the development of] nano-partnerships, or neighborhood-like collaborations where developers, policymakers and community leaders lift each other up and build the kind of shared strength that comes from truly showing up for one another.” – Julie Royes, Vice President of Corporate Affairs, CMBlu Energy, Inc.

In September, the Hydrogen Council, announced that more than 500 hydrogen projects worldwide had passed final investment decision, amounting to $110 billion in investment.
This represents a survival rate of roughly 30%, considering that the trade group tracked more than 1700 hydrogen project announcements in the past five years.
But the data suggests that hydrogen projects haven’t necessarily been more prone to cancellation than those for other clean energy technologies.
They estimated a further 7% of announced hydrogen production capacity was likely to enter into binding contracts, for a total of 20% — right in the heart of the Pareto zone.","Hydrogen had a grueling 2025, particularly in the United States. If we take a step back and review other technologies that are powering the energy transition, however, the data suggest that the industry’s struggles have precedent.

In September, the Hydrogen Council, announced that more than 500 hydrogen projects worldwide had passed final investment decision, amounting to $110 billion in investment. This represents a survival rate of roughly 30%, considering that the trade group tracked more than 1700 hydrogen project announcements in the past five years.

Evidence of a collapsing bubble, or in line with other energy deployment? Context is key — Mt. Fuji towers over Tokyo but would be the runt of the Himalayas — and is provided by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The 2024 edition of the lab’s Queued Up reports, makes it clear that completion rates vary wildly by sub-sector; what might be considered normal for wind would be worrying for solar-plus-storage.

The stacked horizontal bar charts on the left represent the status at the end of 2023, of U.S. energy projects that made grid transmission interconnection requests between 2000 and 2018. The Hydrogen Council survival rates can be mapped onto the chart, with the caveat that its data is global while the LBNL dataset is for the United States only.

The 70% withdrawal rate for worldwide hydrogen projects is broadly in line with project withdrawal rates LBNL observed not just for utility-scale batteries, interconnection-seeking solar (without storage), and wind — each near 75% — but for natural gas power plants as well, at 67%. This means that even before Trump administration tribulations, most types of transmission-facing electricity projects in the United States roughly followed a version of the Pareto Principle: Rather than 20% of efforts causing 80% of results, in the energy sector it seems that roughly 20% of projects (or slightly more, depending on the sector) represent all of a sector’s success — while 80% fail to materialize.

That said, the Trump 2.0 era has certainly complicated things for hydrogen projects in the U.S., prompting some companies to move their operations abroad. In October, Latitude Media reported that Danish manufacturer Topsoe paused work on its $400 million electrolyzer facility in Virginia in light of poor demand for the green hydrogen; earlier this year, the Norwegian Nel Hydrogen decided to cancel its own planned electrolyzer factory in Michigan. And in November, Exxon announced plans to freeze development of a planned blue hydrogen plant in Texas.

These announcements, linked as they are to policy shifts in the U.S., are worrying. It’s possible, given the global nature of the Hydrogen Council data, that some companies are picking up and leaving the U.S. — but still getting their projects built elsewhere. But the data suggests that hydrogen projects haven’t necessarily been more prone to cancellation than those for other clean energy technologies.

In any industry building new infrastructure, there are startups who shut down even before reaching the announcement stage. A blunt Bluesky post by Tim Latimer, CEO and co-founder of advanced geothermal pioneer Fervo Energy, hints that an 80-20 dynamic might emerge in advanced geothermal also.

That said, hydrogen can not be compared directly to grid-connected projects. A key metric for success, as Topsoe demonstrated, is finding buyers for the electrolyzers or hydrogen that a company produces. According to BloombergNEF data, as of November 2023, only a small minority of near-term hydrogen projects — 13% of announced capacity — had announced offtakers. They estimated a further 7% of announced hydrogen production capacity was likely to enter into binding contracts, for a total of 20% — right in the heart of the Pareto zone.

Solar-plus-storage is the outlier in the LBNL dataset because of its large “active projects” bar: 37% by project count that were neither operational or withdrawn. This is likely because that sub-sector saw a rapid scale-up in the past decade. LBNL only records seven solar-plus-storage projects as requesting interconnection in 2014; in 2018, that had increased to 200; and by 2022, they counted 791 requests.

This juxtaposition of sectors begs the question of whether the Pareto principle could apply for the biggest infrastructure build-out currently underway: data centers. It will certainly take several years to know for sure, but there are a few pieces of evidence that it might.

Earlier this year, Camus Energy CEO Astrid Atkinson said that she was seeing five to 10 times as many data center transmission interconnection requests in the United States as data centers being built: phantom data centers that have complicated building timelines. At best this would amount to a Pareto-abiding 20% project completion rate.

This is not to say that this Pareto rule for successful energy- or energy-adjacent projects would be predictive. The industry’s goal, of course, should be to increase its share of successful projects, both for commercialized technologies and more nascent ones. Advanced geothermal, small modular reactors and other technologies may enjoy more success — and if they do, the reasons will deserve study.

At a time when electricity demand is surging from AI, renewable energy projects that relied on that funding have been canceled.","Heading into 2026, energy news is heating up in the national conversation. From surging demand from data centers powering AI to increasing electricity bills and political fights over wind and solar power, Straight Arrow News’ fact-based journalism will explore these forces throughout the year, starting with three pressing questions: How many data centers will be built? Which energy sources will win under shifting policies? And who will win the political fight over affordable electricity?.

The answers to these questions won’t just shape corporate policies; they will affect everyday life, from the price paid to keep the lights on to energy reliability during extreme weather events.

How many data centers will really be built?

Data centers dominated the news throughout 2025. The technology industry wants more computing power for artificial intelligence tools. The industry is dishing out billions in capital expenses to build massive warehouses full of computers, and Big Tech is hungry for the electricity its computers need to run.

In November, SAN reported projections of the energy requirements for planned data centers, according to real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield. The firm found that it would take 79 gigawatts of electricity to power all the planned data centers. The new demand is 40 times what the Hoover Dam generates for the grid.

Meanwhile, energy analysts at BloombergNEF estimate that by 2035, new data centers will account for about 60 gigawatts of new electricity demand. While projections vary, they all point in the same direction: Data centers will need an astronomical amount of electricity, and fast.

But SAN reporting also shows how communities around newly proposed data center sites often mount fierce opposition to construction projects. Americans are increasingly wary of how data centers could alter their neighborhoods and the potential impacts on electricity rates and water availability. Even if a lawsuit doesn’t stop a data center project, litigation can cause delays.

The year has been rife with discussion of an “AI bubble” as most of the stock market’s growth was dominated by a small group of technology companies investing heavily in artificial intelligence tools. Bubble or not, many researchers are skeptical of the projected electricity demand from data centers.

“Many data centers that are talked about and proposed and in some cases even announced will never get built,” Sean O’Leary, a senior researcher at the Ohio River Valley Institute, told SAN earlier this year.

Projections of electricity demand growth may also be inflated because technology companies can submit the same proposal to multiple utility companies across the country while intending to build in only one area. While energy analysts agree that data centers will drive more energy demand, 2026 should provide more insight into the actual size and speed of data center construction.

Which energy resources will flourish or falter?

As President Donald Trump returned to power, the new administration’s shift in policy priorities away from renewable energy became a key storyline. From day one, Trump’s executive orders put federal grant funding for renewable energy projects on hold while signaling to the oil and gas industry that he would cut red tape to make it easier to expand production.

On July 4, Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” into law, which shortened the time wind and solar power companies have to qualify for federal tax credits. Those credits provide a taxpayer-funded payment for each unit of electricity produced by large-scale wind and solar installations. Renewable energy companies now have until 2027 or 2030 to qualify for 10 years of tax credits, depending on when construction begins.

The Trump administration also took a series of steps that hampered the offshore wind industry. Most recently, the Department of the Interior announced it would stop offering leases for offshore wind on federal waters and told five ongoing wind projects to stop construction, citing national security concerns.

Despite the rollback of many Biden-era funding mechanisms, solar power had a blockbuster year in 2025. Solar paired with batteries remains among the most cost-effective sources of electricity, according to an analysis by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and it can be built quickly.

Natural gas will continue to account for the largest share of U.S. electricity production, and in 2025, dozens of new gas-fired power plants were proposed or approved nationwide. SAN covered the approval of three new gas power plants in Louisiana, which will be needed to power a massive data center being built by Meta.

But the growth of gas power is limited by supply chain constraints. Wait times for new gas power plant turbines have stretched to five years or more. In September, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries announced plans to double gas turbine production, and continued efforts into 2026 could speed up the timeline for expanding gas on the electric grid.

Geothermal and nuclear power enjoyed bipartisan support in 2025 because they produce zero carbon emissions and can provide electricity to the grid 24 hours a day. The year was full of milestones in this space, such as geothermal company Fervo raising $462 million in private investment and the Trump administration announcing up to $80 billion available to build Westinghouse nuclear reactors. In terms of providing large amounts of power to the grid, the fruits of these investments are likely to be realized several years from now. But if the trend continues, geothermal and nuclear power sectors will continue to gain steam in 2026.

Who will win the electricity affordability narrative?

With the 2026 midterm elections in sight, the economy — specifically how rising costs are straining millions of Americans’ budgets — is emerging as a key issue.

As SAN reported in October, rising energy prices were the largest driver of year-over-year inflation, pushing it above 3% for the first time in eight months. No doubt, Americans are feeling the squeeze from high electricity prices

In November, Florida regulators approved a $7 billion rate increase for about 6 million customers of Florida Power & Light. SAN reported how people across 41 states face approved or proposed rate increases, and both political parties have taken notice.

Left-leaning groups and Democratic politicians have tied high electric bills to the Trump administration’s cuts to renewable energy funding. At a time when electricity demand is surging from AI, renewable energy projects that relied on that funding have been canceled.

“A lot of families are going to be facing tough decisions,” Lucero Marquez, an associate director at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, told SAN earlier this year. “The consistent attack on renewables is going to hurt Americans.”

Meanwhile, Republicans and right-leaning groups say renewable energy investments are making electricity more expensive. They cite the need to back up weather-dependent energy technologies like wind and solar with other sources, like natural gas. Mario Loyola, a senior fellow at the right-leaning Heritage Foundation, told SAN in September that excessive renewable energy means customers are “paying for all this redundant power.”

Loyola also said regulations on the oil, gas and coal industry have “constrained grid capacity” and made power more expensive.

Elections in Georgia, New Jersey and Virginia in 2025 put these dueling narratives to the ultimate test: the ballot box.

If those elections are any indication, Democrats are coming out ahead. In New Jersey’s gubernatorial race, where high electricity bills were a key issue, Democrat Mikie Sherrill defeated Republican Jack Ciattarelli by 13 points. And Democrat Abigail Spanberger won the gubernatorial race in Virginia, home to the largest concentration of data centers in the U.S., where residents have also seen rising bills.

The races in Georgia were squarely focused on electricity prices. There, two Democratic challengers defeated Republican incumbents to win seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission, the board that regulates utilities. Democrats flipped traditionally Republican counties for decisive victories in a key swing state. However, the results likely had less to do with partisan affiliation and more to do with anger at incumbents who approved previous increases in electricity rates.

Daniel Tait, a director at the nonprofit utility watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute, told SAN in November, “Monopoly investor-owned utilities are deeply unpopular,” and any politician, regardless of party affiliation, could face backlash for aligning with the utility companies.

“People are just fed up with high power bills,” Tait said.",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2198227080_Getty_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 10:59:56.610469

Produce 500,000 tons of Green Methanol each year also represents reducing millions of tons of CO₂ emissions.","China’s focus on producing Green Methanol is part of the nation’s larger decarbonization vision. It utilizes wind power and direct capture from carbon to aid in that effort. Methanol is used as a fuel in many different ways including in the chemical processing industry and in the fuel for industrial shipping.

China’s enormous wind energy can be leveraged with the focus on producing Green Methanol

For years China has focused on Hydrogen as the “fuel of the future” and although Goldwind has made large investments and has committed to developing Green Methanol, the focus from Goldwind, the world’s largest wind turbine manufacturer, clearly shows a strong move from focusing on Hydrogen.

Goldwind has set a goal to manufacture 500,000 tons of Green Methanol per year and is moving into manufacturing Green Methanol. Methanol production is an exciting yet simple process. Ultra-powerful wind turbines utilize renewable energy to produce energy, CO2 is then captured from the atmosphere and stored for later use in the production of Green Methanol, and electrolysis is utilized to separate the components of H2O to include hydrogen and other component parts.

Green Methanol does not have the same issues with safety and costs associated with hydrogen fuel

Hydrogen fuel must be stored and there are safety and costs associated with storing hydrogen fuel. There are also very few, if any, existing infrastructures to support the storage and transportation of hydrogen fuel. On the other hand, Green Methanol is in liquid form under normal temperature and pressure conditions, making it safe and easy to store and transport. Additionally, Green Methanol can operate within existing fuel systems, which will help in the decarbonization of the maritime shipping industry. As such, waiting for hydrogen infrastructure development will be a lengthy process.

Affordability and decarbonizing options

Methanol is less expensive and more abundant than most other decarbonizing options. That is why Goldwind chose to focus in this area. The potential for decarbonization for China’s Chemical Industry is substantial. The shipping networks are global in nature. Through Goldwind’s Dieppe initiative, which aims to decarbonize both shipping and Methanol production, the vision appears much more attainable. An estimated 500,000 tons of Green Methanol is to be produced to be used in maritime shipping. The Green Methanol is to be produced by the wind farms Goldwind is estimating to develop in resource rich areas around the globe.

Designed for power and efficiency for all consumers

Turbines are being designed to capture energy efficiently. Operational turbines capable of functioning and sustaining load at a 6m/s wind speed (modern since 2020) are preferred. Highly controlled DAC systems capture CO2 from the atmosphere; renewable energy is utilized to reduce the carbon footprint to zero. The methanol produced through this method is highly innovative and energy efficient relative to all of the other carbon-capturing systems available today.

Will producing green methanol affect the environment?

Produce 500,000 tons of Green Methanol each year also represents reducing millions of tons of CO₂ emissions. This supports China’s commitment to peaking emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. The project also establishes China as a leader in economical production of chemicals from renewable energy sources, particularly in the new field of clean energy technologies. Rather than a merely technological decision, China has strategically chosen Green Methanol over hydrogen.

China is creating usable, scalable, and green fuel by “mining” carbon from the air and utilizing wind power. This strategy may change the world’s priorities for energy. The image of Goldwind’s turbines turning across China’s windy plains represent the beginning of a new era. It is the era where renewable energy is not just generating electricity, but making it. It is taking the air and wind to create the building blocks of a renewable economy.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/27-1-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 13:00:09.731412

For more than 50 years, nuclear energy has played a critical role in Georgia’s energy mix – currently providing approximately 25% of the state’s electricity each year from just two nuclear plants: Plant Hatch near Vidalia and Plant Vogtle near Augusta. The plants sit at the center of the state’s energy mix, operating efficiently and reliably for customers around the clock with an average capacity factor – the time at which they operate at full power – of 94% over the last decade. More than 1.2 billion megawatt hours of net generation have been produced by Georgia nuclear units since 1975 – enough total electricity to power the entire United States for more than 100 consecutive days.

Georgia Power and the plants’ other co-owners – Oglethorpe Power Corporation, the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia and Dalton Utilities – are celebrating historic milestones this year for the state’s nuclear fleet. Georgia’s first nuclear power facility – Plant Hatch Unit 1 – entered commercial operation in December 1975 and marks 50 years of continuous operation this year. Additionally, the historic expansion of Plant Vogtle 3 & 4 marked the one-year anniversary of completion this past spring.

“Nuclear energy serves as the bedrock of our diverse generation fleet, ready and available when we need it, with a stable, predictable cost to operate and no air emissions,” said Kim Greene, chairman, president and CEO of Georgia Power. “We’re grateful that, well over 50 years ago, state leaders at that time recognized the value of this energy source and took steps to make sure that a growing Georgia had the energy it needed. Customers today directly benefit from that foresight. Now, as our state continues to be the economic powerhouse of the Southeast, work continues with the Georgia Public Service Commission and many other stakeholders to build on that legacy as we maintain, evolve and expand our diverse generation mix to serve customers today, and 50 years from today.”

That includes ongoing investments to modernize and maximize the company’s already high performing units, including the potential to extend operating licenses and extract additional megawatts. Southern Nuclear, which operates Plants Hatch and Vogtle on behalf of Georgia Power and the co-owners, is an industry leader in safety, innovation and performance. The company is known for innovation in nuclear energy at Georgia power plants, having consistently been awarded the most prestigious awards for developing industry-changing advancements, from digital modernization and AI application to being the first in the world to install enhanced Accident Tolerant Fuel (ATF) technologies at Plant Hatch in 2018 and the historic installation of higher-uranium-enriched fuel earlier this year at Vogtle Units 1 & 2, a significant achievement that will positively transform the fuel cycle for all existing and future nuclear reactor designs.

“Our workforce comes from a wide variety of backgrounds, including the nuclear Navy, with each individual dedicated to safely and efficiently operating these nuclear units to serve electric customers across Georgia,” said Pete Sena, chairman, president and CEO of Southern Nuclear. “The nuclear industry represents the best of American energy production, and I couldn’t be more proud to lead this team of highly skilled professionals across Southern Nuclear who work together to drive innovation and performance at our current plants, but also as we work together to grow the future of clean energy in this country.”

Southern Nuclear currently employs more than 2,600 people across Plants Hatch and Vogtle. Over the decades, the nuclear plants have provided high-quality, full-time jobs for an estimated 18,000 people.

Beyond providing jobs for thousands of people, Plants Hatch and Vogtle support vibrant and healthy local communities. Combined, the plants contribute more than $85 million in property taxes each year, which goes to support local schools, roads and other infrastructure. Plant teams also share a commitment to citizenship and community service with the plants supporting a variety of local charities and causes including STEM education efforts, the work of the United Way, multiple veterans groups and environmental/sustainability efforts.

A Bright Future for Georgia’s First Nuclear Facility

In 1975, the year Hatch Unit 1 entered service, Georgia’s population was around 5 million people and, 50 years later, that number has more than doubled with more than 11 million people now calling Georgia home. Plant Hatch has helped meet the electrical needs of that growth year after year, with its opening also marking a pivotal moment for Georgia Power’s commitment to developing a diverse, cleaner generation mix to serve customers. At the end of the 1960s, prior to the introduction of emission-free nuclear energy to Georgia Power’s generation mix, approximately 85 percent of the company’s electricity came from fossil-fuel sources including coal.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) granted Hatch Unit 1 an initial license to operate in 1974, with Unit 2 following in 1975. In 2002, Plant Hatch’s operating license was extended by the NRC for an additional 20 years. In 2023, Southern Nuclear began the process of seeking the NRC’s approval for subsequent license renewal of Hatch Units 1 and 2, with the formal application filed with the NRC in May 2025 (read more). This renewal would extend the operating license of both units for an additional 20 years and allow the site to continue providing the state of Georgia with clean and reliable electricity around the clock.

The Largest Generator of Clean Energy in the U.S.

Named after World War II hero, and subsequent Southern Company CEO, Alvin Vogtle, Plant Vogtle’s original Units 1 & 2 opened as Georgia’s second nuclear facility in the late 1980s. With all four units now in operation, Plant Vogtle is the largest generator of clean energy in the nation, expected to produce more than 30 million megawatt hours of electricity each year. The Vogtle 3 & 4 nuclear expansion was the first newly constructed nuclear facility in more than 30 years, and was completed in May 2024 with the commercial operation of Unit 4.

Since entering commercial operation, the new Vogtle units have performed safely and reliably at or above industry average. In September, Unit 4 successfully completed its first refueling outage and, through strategic fuel planning, Southern Nuclear was able to delay Unit 4’s first planned refueling outage until the fall, allowing it to operate during the hottest months of the year when customers needed reliable power the most.",,N,,2025-12-31 10:13:01.635662

Two significant bills failed during the last two sessions, but lawmakers say the issues aren't going away. Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed House Bill 1192, which would have paused new data center tax breaks for two years and created a commission to study the facilities' impact on the power grid.

Kemp argued the pause would undermine investments already planned by operators.

Another bill, Senate Bill 34, aimed to require data centers to pay for new power plants and transmission lines built primarily to serve them, instead of shifting those costs onto households and small businesses. The bill passed the Senate Utilities Committee but died in the Senate Rules Committee and never reached a floor vote.

The Environmental Protection Agency says its proposal to stop greenhouse gas reporting for big polluters could save oil and gas companies up to $256 million a year. Some of them are countering that it could hurt their business instead.

Companies, industry trade groups and other energy experts warn that axing the more than a decade-old Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program could immediately jeopardize oil and gas firms’ ability to claim highly valued tax credits. It could also hurt companies selling liquefied natural gas, or LNG, to Asia and Europe in the future, they say, where less carbon-intensive energy sources are increasingly more desirable.

Halting emissions reporting introduces “significant uncertainty for producers” and “unnecessary complexity into programs that are critical for deploying the very solutions needed to meet energy and climate goals,” said Dustin Meyer, a senior vice president at the American Petroleum Institute, in public testimony at an EPA October hearing on the proposal.

API, which has nearly 600 members including Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp., is a major industry group pushing to keep the program, which requires the nation’s biggest industrial polluters to calculate and report their annual greenhouse gas emissions every year. Exxon declined to comment on the proposal. Chevron, meanwhile, did not respond to requests for comment.

This reporting program “has no material impact on improving human health and the environment,” said an EPA spokesperson in an email, and killing it would allow companies more space to put their money on activities with “actual, tangible environmental impacts.”

The data it collects represents the the nation’s main record of large industrial emissions, which is publicly accessible online. It underpins US tax credits claims designed to incentivize capturing and storing carbon dioxide underground, rather than releasing it into the atmosphere where it contributes to global warming. It’s also used by states to track progress on their climate goals, by investors to inform decisions on energy ventures and by advocates to educate communities on nearby pollution sources.

EPA is proposing to stop requiring most sources to submit this data, and to suspend collecting it for certain oil and gas sources until 2034. Of the roughly 8,000 industrial facilities and suppliers nationwide required to report emissions now, nearly 2,300 of them were oil and gas operators. In 2023, they collectively recorded 322 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, according to the agency’s latest available data. That’s the same amount of pollution as produced by driving 75 million gasoline-powered vehicles for a year.

“Rolling back or delaying federal reporting 10 years would not reduce the burden — it would create regulatory whiplash when these rules come back,” said Lindsay Larrick, chief legal and administrative officer for natural gas producer BKV Corporation, in a public comment posted online Tuesday.

In the absence of a federal program, states will step in to fill the void, Larrick added, noting this will be “extremely costly” and create “additional burden” to operators working across state lines.

Taxpayers, meanwhile, wouldn’t be able to claim the carbon capture tax credit, known as 45Q, said Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, a collaboration of companies, unions, and environmental groups that includes Shell PLC and Occidental Petroleum Corp. In order to do so, companies must reference the volumes of stored CO2 reported to the EPA, she added.

The more emissions a company stores underground, the greater the credit that they can claim.

“The EPA failed to consider that the economic benefits [from the program’s carbon capture data] far outweigh the cost to the respondents of reporting,” said Keith Tracy, chief commercial officer of Elysian Carbon Management, in public comments posted online this week. Elysian Carbon Management is a carbon capture, transport and storage development company owned by Buckeye Partners, one of the largest oil products pipeline operators.

Although the exact number of companies that have claimed the credit and the amount they’ve received are not publicly available, the Carbon Capture Coalition estimates developers relying on it have already invested $77.5 billion in carbon capture projects. Oil and gas companies are partners in many of the carbon capture projects that qualify for these tax credits, Stolark said.

Companies looking to claim another tax credit, for clean hydrogen, also rely on this data, according to Drew Monroe, senior associate at the strategy firm Capstone LLC. Hydrogen can come from different sources. So-called “blue hydrogen,” which is produced from natural gas with carbon capture, qualifies for the credit, called 45V. But currently, the only way producers can prove this hydrogen type has a low-enough carbon footprint to get a higher tax credit value is through the EPA reporting program, he said.

In response to questions about potential tax credit impacts, the EPA said it welcomes public comments through Nov. 3. The Treasury Department did not respond to requests for comment.

In the coming years the absence of emissions data could also hurt the LNG industry. That’s because the European Union has put in place measures to limit methane emissions from all energy imports, including LNG, which importers will need to document. The US has stepped up its LNG exports to Europe following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and Europe’s declining reliance on Russian pipeline gas. While the final European methane standards are not yet defined, American exporters have been keenly following how to best supply the fuel and provide emissions data around LNG cargoes.

Japan is similarly looking to verify emissions from its LNG imports. The US was the third largest exporter to Japan in 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

“There will be ripple effects,” said former EPA official Jeff Cohen, who co-founded Xpansiv, a market platform for trading carbon credits and other environmental commodities. “This is a foundational reporting program that companies, banks, importers, exporters, local communities have been relying on for 15 years.”

Application No., Date, Speed: 18887855 on 09/17/2024 (434 days app to issue)

Abstract: This disclosure provides for host-controller cooperation in managing NAND flash memory. The controller maintains information for each erase unit which tracks memory usage. This information assists the host in making decisions about specific operations, for example, initiating garbage collection, space reclamation, wear leveling or other operations. For example, metadata can be provided to the host identifying whether each page of an erase unit has been released, and the host can specifically then command each of consolidation and erase using direct addressing. By redefining host-controller responsibilities in this manner, much of the overhead association with FTL functions can be substantially removed from the memory controller, with the host directly specifying physical addresses. This reduces performance unpredictability and overhead, thereby facilitating integration of solid state drives (SSDs) with other forms of storage. The disclosed techniques are especially useful for direct-attached and/or network-attached storage.

The PCM includes language and reasoning model components, a thought cache, an executive component, and an embedding system. The PCM remains continuously active, remembers previous experiences, learns from these experiences, creates new thought experiences independently, and initiates interactions without waiting for external prompts. The PCM enters sleep-like states during which it curates its thought cache, generalizes experiences, and performs other memory management functions. Applications may include but are not limited to synthetic cognitive colleagues, strategic war gaming platforms, and personal cognitive assistants.

The change eliminates the existing 6% sales tax on gasoline and replaces it with a higher, flat per-gallon fuel tax.

The state fuel tax rate will increase from approximately 31 cents to 52.4 cents per gallon, a difference of about 21 cents. However, the net impact on drivers at the pump is expected to be a much smaller increase of around 1.4 cents per gallon, as the sales tax is simultaneously removed.

Key Details of the New Legislation:

-Dedicated Funding: Unlike the previous system where only a small portion of the sales tax went to roads (with most going to schools and general funds), all revenue from the new fuel tax will be deposited into the Michigan Transportation Fund for infrastructure projects.

-Inflation Adjustment: Starting in 2026, the fuel tax will be adjusted annually for inflation, which could lead to gradual rate increases over time.

-Price Point Impact: The effective tax burden for drivers will depend on the price of gas. At a price of roughly $3.50 per gallon, the total tax impact is about the same as the old system. When gas prices fall below this point, drivers will pay slightly more in total taxes, and when prices rise above it, they will pay slightly less.

-EV Fees Increase: Owners of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles will also see higher annual registration fees to ensure they contribute to road funding, with increases of about $100 for fully electric vehicles and $50 for plug-in hybrids.

Lawmakers say the change will provide a stable, long-term funding source expected to generate an estimated $1.05 billion in the first full year for the state’s long-neglected infrastructure, a key promise of Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s administration.

Frequently Asked Questions About India's Critical Minerals Strategy Understanding the practical implementation and realistic timelines for India's critical minerals strategy requires addressing common questions and misconceptions about the initiative.
India's critical minerals strategy represents one of the most comprehensive attempts by a major economy to achieve strategic autonomy in critical material supply chains.","What Drives India's Critical Minerals Independence Initiative?

Strategic autonomy in the 21st century hinges not on conventional military assets, but on access to the materials that power modern technology. For India, this reality has crystallized into an urgent imperative to reduce catastrophic dependencies on foreign mineral supplies that underpin everything from renewable energy infrastructure to defense systems. Understanding India's critical minerals strategy becomes essential for evaluating the country's economic security and technological sovereignty.

Economic Security Through Resource Diversification

India's mineral import dependencies reveal vulnerabilities that extend far beyond simple cost considerations. The country currently imports 100% of its lithium requirements, sourcing primarily from Australia, Chile, and Argentina to meet growing demand from battery manufacturing and energy storage applications. Similarly, cobalt imports account for 100% of domestic consumption, with the Democratic Republic of Congo, Russia, and China serving as primary suppliers.

Perhaps most concerning is India's 80% import dependency for rare earth elements, with China controlling approximately 70% of global rare earth processing capacity. This concentration risk became starkly apparent during the 2010 rare earth export restrictions, when dysprosium prices surged from USD $80-100 per kilogram to USD $400-500 per kilogram within 12 months, directly impacting wind turbine magnet production worldwide.

The economic implications extend beyond immediate procurement costs. During geopolitical tensions, critical mineral prices can fluctuate 40-60% within six-month periods, as demonstrated by dysprosium and terbium volatility during U.S.-China trade disputes in 2020. For India's manufacturing sector, such price instability creates planning uncertainty and competitive disadvantages.

To address these vulnerabilities, the government has allocated ₹34,300 crore (approximately USD $4.1 billion) to the National Critical Minerals Mission over the 2023-2030 period. This investment represents recognition that mineral security requires sustained, long-term capital deployment rather than reactive procurement strategies.

Strategic Autonomy in Energy Transition

India's net-zero commitments by 2070 demand unprecedented mineral inputs for renewable energy infrastructure. The country's renewable energy capacity is projected to reach 500 GW by 2030, up from approximately 180 GW in 2024. This expansion implies a lithium requirement of 2.7-3.2 million tonnes over the 2025-2030 period to support battery manufacturing for grid-scale energy storage and electric vehicles.

Furthermore, the role of minerals in energy transition becomes particularly crucial when examining defense sector dependencies. Critical minerals are essential for advanced military technologies, including:

Permanent magnets (neodymium, dysprosium, terbium) for radar systems and missile guidance

Lithium for battery systems in submarines and portable defense electronics

Cobalt for aerospace turbine alloys and hardened armor systems

The manufacturing competitiveness dimension cannot be overlooked. India's target of 30% electric vehicle penetration by 2030 implies 8.5-10 million EVs annually, each requiring 40-80 kg of lithium-ion battery content. This represents total lithium demand of 340,000-800,000 tonnes over the five-year period, assuming domestic manufacturing captures significant market share.

Without secure mineral supply chains, India risks remaining a component assembler rather than developing integrated manufacturing capabilities in critical clean energy technologies.

How Does India's Domestic Resource Potential Compare Globally?

While India's critical mineral import dependencies appear daunting, the country possesses significant untapped geological potential that could reshape its strategic position. However, realising this potential requires honest assessment of both opportunities and constraints compared to established global suppliers.

Geological Asset Mapping and Untapped Reserves

India's mineral endowment reveals a complex picture of substantial reserves distributed across challenging locations. For rare earth elements, India ranks as the 4th largest reserve holder globally with estimated reserves of 6-7 million tonnes, primarily concentrated in Chhattisgarh and Odisha states.

Mineral Current Import Dependency Known Domestic Reserves Exploration Status Lithium 100% 0.2-0.3 million tonnes (Northeast) <20% explored Cobalt 100% ~0.05 million tonnes (estimated) Limited exploration Rare Earth Elements 80% from China 6-7 million tonnes Fragmented development Graphite High 0.8-1.2 million tonnes Regional variations

Northeast India, particularly Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir, contains lithium-bearing pegmatite deposits with lithium oxide concentrations of 0.5-1.2% in select formations. However, these reserves remain largely unexplored, with less than 20% drilling completion according to Geological Survey of India assessments.

Chhattisgarh hosts monazite-bearing deposits with estimated rare earth reserves of 2-3 million tonnes, primarily light rare earth elements including lanthanum, cerium, and neodymium. The Bailadila region presents particularly interesting potential for co-extraction with existing iron ore operations, potentially reducing infrastructure development costs.

For graphite, India's 0.8-1.2 million tonnes of reserves are concentrated in Odisha, with scattered deposits across Karnataka and Chhattisgarh. Given projected 12-15% annual demand growth through 2030 for battery anode applications, these domestic resources could serve significant portions of India's requirements.

Technical Challenges in Domestic Extraction

The technical complexity of developing India's critical mineral resources extends well beyond simple extraction. Northeast lithium deposits require pegmatitic processing involving crushing, flotation separation, and roasting at 1000-1200°C followed by acid leaching. These processes are significantly more capital-intensive than evaporative extraction methods used in South American brine deposits.

Cost comparisons reveal the challenge:

Australia (Greenbushes spodumene): USD $8,000-10,000 per tonne lithium carbonate equivalent production cost

Chile (Atacama brine evaporation): USD $4,000-6,000 per tonne lithium carbonate equivalent production cost

India (estimated pegmatitic hard-rock): USD $12,000-15,000 per tonne lithium carbonate equivalent production cost

Rare earth element extraction presents additional complications. Monazite ores, typical of Indian deposits, contain 4-8% thorium by weight, requiring radioactive waste management protocols. Processing yields typically reach 60-75% for individual rare earth elements, with remaining material becoming radioactive tailings requiring long-term storage solutions.

Environmental clearance frameworks add temporal and regulatory complexity. Current permitting timelines average 18-24 months for critical mineral projects, though the government targets reduction to 12 months through single-window clearance mechanisms.

Infrastructure requirements for remote mining locations compound development challenges. Accessing Northeast lithium deposits requires road and rail connectivity in high-altitude, ecologically sensitive zones where water availability for processing operations remains uncertain. Processing water requirements of 500-2,000 litres per tonne of ore create potential conflicts with agricultural and domestic water needs in water-stressed regions.

What Are the Key Components of India's Multi-Pronged Strategy?

India's approach to critical mineral security operates across multiple simultaneous tracks, recognising that no single solution can address the scale and urgency of the challenge. This strategy combines domestic resource development, international partnerships, and supply chain resilience measures.

Domestic Exploration and Mining Acceleration

The National Critical Minerals Mission encompasses over 1,200 exploration projects targeting lithium, cobalt, rare earths, and graphite deposits across India. This represents the most comprehensive domestic mineral exploration programme in the country's post-independence history.

Under the amended Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation Act of 2023, the government has auctioned 55 mining blocks, with 34 blocks already allocated to private and public sector entities. This regulatory reform aims to accelerate private sector participation while maintaining strategic oversight of critical mineral development.

In addition, the permitting reform initiative targets reduction of approval timelines from the historical 18-24 month average to 12 months through integrated clearance mechanisms. Success in this administrative streamlining could significantly improve project economics and capital deployment decisions.

International Acquisition and Partnership Framework

India's international mineral diplomacy has yielded several concrete agreements designed to diversify supply sources and reduce single-supplier dependencies.

The Mongolia Strategic Partnership Agreement provides access to the Khalzan Buregtei fluorspar deposits and Khotgor copper/molybdenum/rare earth deposits. The Khotgor site contains estimated rare earth reserves of 16-18 million tonnes of ore with 0.1-0.15% total rare earth oxide concentration. India's commitment through Coal India Limited and the Ministry of Mines involves an estimated USD $500-700 million investment over 5-7 years for exploration and mine development.

Chilean lithium exploration initiatives, led by Coal India Limited, focus on securing equity stakes or long-term offtake agreements in Chile's Atacama and Antofagasta regions. The strategy targets 5-10% equity stakes in producing lithium operations or negotiated offtake agreements for lithium carbonate and hydroxide.

However, the proposed Russia-India mineral corridor via Trans-Siberian Railway connectivity could reduce freight costs by 25-35% compared to maritime routes through the Suez Canal. Implementation remains uncertain due to geopolitical complexities and international sanctions considerations.

Stockpiling and Supply Chain Resilience

Strategic stockpiling represents the near-term component of India's mineral security framework. The government has allocated USD $57.5 million for establishing and maintaining strategic mineral reserves under the National Critical Minerals Mission.

The target involves maintaining two-month supply buffers for critical materials, approximately equivalent to:

50,000-75,000 tonnes lithium carbonate equivalent

15,000-20,000 tonnes cobalt metal equivalent

25,000-35,000 tonnes rare earth oxides

40,000-60,000 tonnes battery-grade graphite

Public-private partnership models for stockpile management aim to distribute storage costs whilst ensuring government access during supply disruptions. These arrangements may involve private sector storage facilities with government purchase options or shared storage arrangements with manufacturing end-users.

Which International Models Could India Adapt for Success?

Examining successful critical mineral strategies from other nations reveals both opportunities and limitations for India's approach. Different countries have developed distinct models based on their resource endowments, industrial base, and geopolitical positioning.

China's Integrated Value Chain Approach

China's dominance in critical mineral processing stems from decades-long investment in midstream processing capabilities rather than merely controlling raw material extraction. The Chinese model emphasises vertical integration from mining through manufacturing, with state support for developing solvent extraction, separation, and metallisation capabilities.

Key lessons for India include the importance of processing capacity development. China controls approximately 70% of global rare earth refining capacity despite holding only 37% of global reserves. This processing monopoly generates higher value-added returns and creates supply chain dependencies that extend far beyond raw material access.

For India, this suggests prioritising investment in separation and refining infrastructure alongside mining development. However, replicating China's approach requires accepting initial losses during capacity building phases, sustained government support, and integrated demand from downstream manufacturing sectors.

Australia's Resource Diplomacy Strategy

Australia has leveraged its substantial critical mineral reserves through strategic partnerships with allied nations, particularly the United States, Japan, and European Union countries. This approach emphasises technology sharing agreements, joint ventures, and export facilitation frameworks.

Australia's Critical Minerals Strategy focuses on building processing capabilities through international partnerships rather than attempting complete domestic value chain development. The Greenbushes lithium operation, for example, ships spodumene concentrate to Chinese refineries while developing alternative processing partnerships with Japanese and South Korean companies.

India could adapt this model by developing processing partnerships with friendly nations, particularly those seeking to diversify away from Chinese supply chains. This approach reduces capital requirements whilst building technical capabilities and market access.

European Union's Circular Economy Integration

The European Union's Critical Raw Materials Act emphasises recycling, substitution research, and sustainable extraction practices alongside supply diversification. The EU targets 15% of critical mineral demand to be met through recycling by 2030, with substantial investment in urban mining and material recovery technologies.

For India, circular economy approaches offer particular relevance given the country's growing electronic waste streams. Furthermore, the potential for a battery recycling breakthrough could supplement primary production whilst reducing environmental impacts through permanent magnet recovery and rare earth extraction from electronic waste.

Substitution research represents another EU focus area with potential Indian applications. Developing alternative materials for specific applications or improving material efficiency in manufacturing processes can reduce critical mineral intensity without compromising performance.

What Are the Primary Implementation Challenges?

Despite comprehensive planning and significant resource allocation, India's critical minerals strategy faces substantial implementation hurdles that could determine ultimate success or failure.

Administrative and Regulatory Bottlenecks

Inter-ministerial coordination gaps represent the most immediate implementation challenge. Critical mineral projects require approvals from mining, environment, industry, forest, tribal affairs, and defence ministries, each operating with distinct priorities and timelines.

The parliamentary committee report emphasises that administrative bottlenecks, rather than geological constraints, represent the binding constraint on progress. Current permitting processes lack integrated assessment mechanisms, leading to sequential rather than parallel approval workflows.

Environmental compliance presents particular complexity for rare earth extraction. Monazite processing generates radioactive tailings requiring long-term storage and monitoring. India currently lacks established protocols for radioactive waste management comparable to those in Australia or the United States, creating regulatory uncertainty for project development.

Community consultation processes add another layer of complexity. Many critical mineral deposits are located in tribal areas or ecologically sensitive zones where local communities have legitimate concerns about environmental impacts and benefit-sharing arrangements.

Capital Investment and Technology Gaps

Private sector risk assessment for long-term mining projects requires regulatory predictability and market clarity that India has yet to establish. Critical mineral projects typically require 10-15 year development timelines from exploration through commercial production, demanding sustained policy support across multiple electoral cycles.

Technology transfer requirements for advanced processing present additional challenges. Rare earth separation technologies, lithium extraction from hard-rock deposits, and battery-grade graphite purification involve proprietary processes controlled by established global players.

Consequently, exploring lithium industry innovations becomes crucial for understanding technological advancement opportunities. Skills development for specialised mining and metallurgy operations requires substantial investment in technical education and training programmes.

Market Competition and Pricing Dynamics

Cost competitiveness against established global suppliers represents a fundamental economic challenge. Australian and Chilean operations benefit from decades of infrastructure development, optimised processes, and established customer relationships.

Quality standards and certification requirements add complexity to market entry. Battery manufacturers, magnet producers, and other end-users maintain strict quality specifications that new suppliers must demonstrate through extensive testing and qualification processes.

Long-term offtake agreement structuring requires balancing price stability with market competitiveness. Fixed-price contracts provide revenue certainty for project financing but may become uneconomical if market prices fall below contract levels.

How Should Investors Evaluate India's Critical Minerals Opportunity?

Investment assessment in India's critical minerals sector requires careful analysis of multiple risk and opportunity factors that distinguish this emerging market from established mining jurisdictions.

Risk Assessment Framework

Regulatory stability and policy predictability represent the primary investment consideration. Whilst the National Critical Minerals Mission provides policy framework, implementation depends on sustained political commitment across multiple government levels and electoral cycles.

Geological risk assessment must balance India's substantial mineral endowment against limited exploration data. Many deposits remain conceptual rather than proven through systematic drilling and metallurgical testing. Investors should distinguish between geological potential and bankable reserves when evaluating specific projects.

Infrastructure development requirements create additional risk considerations. Many critical mineral deposits are located in remote areas requiring substantial investment in roads, power supply, water access, and processing facilities. These infrastructure costs may not be reflected in early-stage project economics.

Environmental and social licensing represents an evolving risk factor. India's environmental regulations are becoming more stringent, whilst community expectations for benefit-sharing and environmental protection continue to increase.

Market Entry Strategies for International Players

Joint venture opportunities with Indian public sector undertakings offer potential risk mitigation and regulatory facilitation. Organisations like Coal India Limited, National Mineral Development Corporation, and Mineral Exploration Corporation Limited possess government relationships and domestic market knowledge that international players lack.

Technology partnership and licensing arrangements may provide lower-risk entry points than direct mining investment. Indian companies need access to advanced processing technologies, whilst international technology holders seek market access and production partnerships.

Supply chain integration possibilities exist for companies with downstream manufacturing operations in India. For instance, establishing a battery-grade lithium refinery to serve domestic demand whilst building export capabilities could optimise scale economies and market positioning.

Timeline Expectations and Milestone Tracking

Short-term achievements (2025-2027) should focus on stockpiling implementation and import source diversification. Success metrics include establishing strategic reserves, finalising international partnership agreements, and demonstrating permitting process improvements.

Medium-term development (2027-2030) involves scaling domestic production from pilot operations to commercially significant output. Key milestones include first production from auctioned mining blocks, completion of processing infrastructure, and achievement of quality certifications for domestic minerals.

Long-term objectives (2030+) target processing capability development and potential export market development. Success indicators include achieving target import dependency reduction levels, establishing India as a regional processing hub, and developing technology export capabilities.

What Does Success Look Like for India's Critical Minerals Strategy?

Defining success requires both quantitative metrics and qualitative strategic outcomes that extend beyond simple import substitution targets.

Quantitative Success Metrics

Import dependency reduction targets vary by mineral category based on domestic resource potential and processing complexity:

Lithium: Reduction from 100% import dependency to 60-70% by 2030, 40-50% by 2035

Rare Earth Elements: Reduction from 80% import dependency to 50-60% by 2030, 30-40% by 2035

Graphite: Reduction from high import dependency to 30-40% by 2030 through domestic processing

Cobalt: Maintain diversified import sources whilst developing recycling capabilities to meet 20-30% of demand by 2035

Domestic production capacity milestones include:

25,000-35,000 tonnes annual lithium carbonate equivalent production by 2030

15,000-20,000 tonnes annual rare earth oxide production by 2030

50,000-75,000 tonnes annual battery-grade graphite production by 2030

Strategic stockpile adequacy should maintain 60-90 day supply buffers for all critical materials, with option to expand during geopolitical tensions or supply disruptions.

Qualitative Strategic Outcomes

Enhanced energy security extends beyond simple supply availability to include price stability, quality assurance, and supply chain resilience during global disruptions. Success involves maintaining reliable access to critical materials regardless of international political tensions or trade disputes.

Strengthened geopolitical positioning in critical mineral markets could establish India as an alternative supplier for countries seeking to diversify away from Chinese supply chains. This positioning requires developing reputation for reliability, quality, and responsible mining practices.

Industrial competitiveness in clean energy technologies depends on secure, cost-effective access to critical materials for domestic manufacturing. Success metrics include growth in domestic battery manufacturing, permanent magnet production, and solar panel assembly using domestically-sourced materials.

Regional and Global Impact Scenarios

India's emergence as a significant critical minerals producer could contribute to global supply chain diversification and reduce concentration risks currently present in the market. This outcome benefits global energy transition goals whilst strengthening India's strategic positioning.

South-South cooperation opportunities may emerge through technology sharing, joint venture development, and expertise exchange with other developing nations possessing critical mineral resources. India's technical capabilities and market access could facilitate resource development in African and Latin American countries.

Technology and expertise export potential represents a long-term strategic outcome where India becomes a supplier of mining technology, processing equipment, and technical services to other emerging mineral producers. This transformation from resource importer to technology exporter would demonstrate comprehensive sector development success.

Frequently Asked Questions About India's Critical Minerals Strategy

Understanding the practical implementation and realistic timelines for India's critical minerals strategy requires addressing common questions and misconceptions about the initiative.

How quickly can India reduce its import dependency?

Realistic timeline analysis reveals that meaningful import dependency reduction requires 5-10 years minimum for most critical materials. Lithium extraction from Northeast deposits faces the longest development timeline due to infrastructure requirements and processing complexity.

Rare earth elements offer the most promising near-term opportunities, given existing reserves in Chhattisgarh and Odisha. However, developing thorium-safe processing capabilities may require 3-5 years of technology development and regulatory framework establishment.

Graphite presents intermediate complexity, with potential for significant domestic production within 5-7 years given existing deposits and relatively straightforward processing requirements. Battery-grade specifications may require additional purification infrastructure development.

International comparison suggests tempering expectations: Australia required 15-20 years to become a dominant lithium producer despite favourable geology and established mining infrastructure. Chile's lithium industry development spanned multiple decades before achieving current scale.

What role will recycling play in India's strategy?

Urban mining potential from electronic waste could supply 15-25% of India's rare earth requirements by 2030, given the country's growing electronic waste streams and expanding consumer electronics market.

Battery recycling capabilities could address 20-30% of lithium and cobalt demand by 2035 as first-generation electric vehicle batteries reach end-of-life. However, this requires developing collection networks, processing facilities, and quality standards for recycled materials.

Permanent magnet recovery from electronic waste, wind turbines, and industrial equipment represents another recycling opportunity. India processes substantial volumes of electronic waste, providing feedstock for rare earth element recovery operations.

Technology requirements for efficient material recovery include hydrometallurgical processing, solvent extraction capabilities, and purification systems. These technologies overlap with primary mining processing requirements, creating potential synergies in infrastructure development.

How will environmental concerns be balanced with extraction needs?

Sustainable mining practice implementation requires adopting international best practices for water management, tailings storage, and ecosystem restoration. India's regulatory framework is evolving to incorporate these standards into project approval processes.

Community benefit-sharing mechanisms must balance local development needs with extraction economics. Successful models from other jurisdictions include revenue sharing, local employment requirements, and infrastructure development commitments.

Environmental monitoring and restoration protocols represent ongoing operational requirements rather than one-time project costs. Long-term success depends on demonstrating responsible extraction practices that maintain social licence to operate.

India's critical minerals strategy represents one of the most comprehensive attempts by a major economy to achieve strategic autonomy in critical material supply chains. Success will require sustained commitment across multiple electoral cycles, substantial capital investment, and careful balance of domestic development with international partnerships.

The ultimate measure of success lies not in achieving complete self-sufficiency, but in building resilient supply chains that can withstand global disruptions whilst supporting India's clean energy transition and manufacturing competitiveness goals. This outcome requires coordination across government, private sector, and international partners working toward shared objectives of energy security and sustainable development.

Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here. By , Grist The years leading up to 2025 were marked by a rare optimism that the United States would finally do something about climate change. Former president Joe Biden called the crisis an “enormous opportunity,” and during his term, Congress passed the biggest climate law in the country’s history. It felt like the U.S. was on the cusp of a greener future — until that momentum came to a sudden halt.

There’s a word for this kind of reactionary response: greenlash, a social and political backlash against efforts to rein in emissions. In Donald Trump’s second term, climate change became a politically radioactive word: Phrases including “clean energy,” “climate science” and “pollution” began disappearing from government websites.

And people around the country took the cue. Corporations got quiet about their climate plans. Democratic politicians steered clear of phrases like “planetary emergency.” Media coverage of the climate crisis thinned. That all trickled down to everyday Americans, who say they’re hearing less than they used to about climate change on social media and from the people they know.

While greenlash might sound like a very American phenomenon, it actually took off in Europe. The EU was an early adopter of comprehensive climate policies, and also saw the first big wave of greenlash. That opposition was mainly driven by specific economic burdens — Germany’s plan to switch to energy-efficient heat pumps caused an uproar as homeowners worried about the costs, for example. In the United States, the greenlash gathered more fuel from Trump-style populism and the culture wars.

With a tumultuous 2025 coming to an end, dictionary editors have been digging through the lexicon for words that capture its spirit. Their picks — “AI slop,” “rage bait” and the essentially meaningless phrase “6-7” — point to a world that’s very online, and not doing much better for it. For us at Grist, greenlash stood out as the word of the year, marking a moment when climate change was yanked off the political priority list.

The mood might have shifted, but people in the U.S. are about as concerned about climate change as they’ve ever been, with about two-thirds saying they’re worried. The consequences of a warming planet were on full display this year, from the horrific fires that burned through Los Angeles neighborhoods in January to the rains that drenched Texas in July, causing the deadliest flash flooding in the country in half a century. It was also a turbulent time for the politics of climate change, a trend reflected in these words and phrases that captured the zeitgeist.

Carbon pawprint

A cheeky way to capture your pet’s contribution to climate change, based on the concept of a carbon footprint.

A host of articles this year highlighted how cats and dogs have an outsized carbon pawprint — and, wow, pet owners got worked up about it. The chief culprit is the meat-heavy diets they feed their pets, with beef in particular emitting a lot of methane, a powerful, planet-warming gas. The conversation really kicked into gear this summer with a headline from The Associated Press: “People often miscalculate climate choices, a study says. One surprise is owning a dog.”

The dog ownership question was only a tiny part of that study, which investigated how people rank the climate impact of various personal actions, like going vegan or using public transit. But the headline’s focus blew up on Reddit, where people complained that focusing on individual responsibility instead of big, systemic changes missed the point. “Climate change is actually your fault because you have a dog,” one user wrote sarcastically.

Cheap energy

A Democratic messaging slogan linking clean energy with lower costs for consumers.

Hoping to reach Americans more concerned about rising electricity bills than the upward march of global temperatures, Democrats have been talking more and more about how clean energy is cheap energy. After getting trounced in the 2024 election, many Democratic politicians turned to polling to see what had gone wrong. One theory was that they spent too much time talking about social issues like climate change and LGBTQ+ rights, putting them out of step with voters who cared more about affordability and health care. As one new think tank, the Searchlight Institute, summed it up: “Don’t say climate change.”

Climate champions in Congress aren’t avoiding the topic entirely, but selling climate-friendly policies as a strategy to lower the cost of living instead. In September, for instance, two Democratic representatives, Sean Casten and Mike Levin, introduced the “Cheap Energy Agenda.” There’s some evidence the pivot might be working, after Democrats notched wins in November’s off-year election in races where energy costs played an important role.

Critical minerals

Raw materials that are crucial for modern technology, but in limited supply.

It was hard to avoid the phrase critical minerals in 2025, when it moved from policy jargon to the headlines. These metals — including lithium, cobalt, nickel and so-called “rare earths” — are essential for building solar panels and the batteries that power electric vehicles and e-bikes.

The Trump administration has been aggressively chasing these metals as part of its national security strategy, hoping to secure the vital ingredients for making everything from smartphones to high-tech military technologies. Trump signed executive orders calling for more mining of critical minerals and fast-tracked permits for new projects, while also setting his sights on procuring more supply abroad by negotiating deals in Ukraine, central Africa and across Asia.

Stocks for some rare-earth mining companies have more than tripled this year as critical minerals got hyped up. Some experts think that the future of geopolitics will be more defined by these critical metals than by oil.

Energy dominance

A slogan-turned-policy-goal emphasizing fossil fuel production and American power.

When Trump signed an executive order on Inauguration Day aimed at “unleashing energy dominance,” the phrase left experts scratching their heads. It soon became clear it had everything to do with maximizing the production of oil, gas and coal in order to gain leverage over other countries.

It certainly had nothing to do with dominating the market for renewable energy. Experts told Grist that the phrase seems to be more about vibes than specific policy goals. It taps into a nostalgia for what fossil fuels once promised — optimism, growth and a certain ideal of masculine work. This kind of chest-beating reaction to industrial decline and climate change even has a name: “petro-masculinity.”

Green New Scam

A Trumpism that counters climate policy by rebranding the “Green New Deal” as a conspiracy.

The Green New Scam has become the Trump administration’s defining line on efforts to take on climate change. Trump came up with the catchphrase during a rally in New Hampshire in 2023, while riffing on ways to attack Biden’s climate policies. When he landed on “Green New Scam,” the crowd roared with approval, and he sensed he was onto something — even though Congress had never actually passed a Green New Deal.

Renee Hobbs, who wrote a book on modern propaganda, told Grist that Trump’s repetition of Green New Scam fits into a classic strategy: “You repeat the phrases that you want to stick, and you downplay, ignore, minimize or censor the concepts that don’t meet your agenda.”

Rain anxiety

A growing sense of dread triggered by rainfall.

For many people, the sound of raindrops isn’t comforting at all, but terrifying. If you’ve survived a flood, it can bring up traumatic memories, leading to what’s called rain anxiety. “Anyone else getting mildly stressed when it rains a lot?” reads a typical Reddit post on the matter. Floods struck many parts of the U.S. this year — not only Texas, but also New Mexico, Illinois, North Carolina, New York and Washington state.

By mid-year, the National Weather Service had issued almost 4,000 flash-floods alerts, the most for that time period since 1986. About 20% to 30% of people who live through flooding develop depression or post-traumatic stress disorder in the months afterward, according to a report from the U.N.’s international panel of climate scientists. There’s a clear connection to climate change: A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, making the idiom “when it rains, it pours” more of a reality than ever before.

Swasticar

A new, derogatory name for Tesla vehicles, blending “swastika” with “car.”

Tesla used to be the undisputed leader of the electric vehicle market, but that changed in 2025. After Elon Musk, the company’s CEO, gave two stiff-armed gestures at Trump’s inauguration in January, one question consumed the internet: Was that a Nazi salute? Activists soon started pressuring people to stop buying Teslas and sell their swasticars — a term that captured the company’s sudden transformation from a green status symbol into something associated with far-right extremism.

It didn’t help the company’s reputation when Musk started axing jobs and funding across federal agencies as co-lead of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, aka DOGE. Tesla sales tumbled over the course of the year — in the United States and abroad — even as the company started rolling out cheaper models. Tesla also faced growing competition from the Chinese EV company BYD and the loss of U.S. electric vehicle tax credits at the end of September after Congress rolled them back.

Dec 30 (Reuters) – Tesla deliveries were expected to fall in the fourth quarter, as the loss of U.S. tax credits and rising global competition sapped demand even as the company rolled out cheaper versions of its best-selling ‍electric vehicles.

The decline would follow plummeting sales in the first two quarters of the year when CEO Elon Musk faced a backlash for his political rhetoric. Third-quarter sales got a boost as buyers rushed to lock in tax credits before they expired in September. Still, Tesla is likely to report its second straight drop in annual deliveries, with this year’s decline steeper.

In October, Tesla launched stripped-down versions of the Model Y SUV ‌and Model 3 compact sedan called Standard. It will face competition ‌from affordable EVs made by Chevrolet and Ford, which are expected to hit the market over the next two years.

Analysts expect Tesla’s sales to recover next year, as the Standard versions, priced about $5,000 below previous base models, help the company defend volumes in Europe and Asia, where Chinese EVs are gaining ground.

The ​company is expected to report fourth-quarter and annual production and delivery numbers on Friday.

Investor enthusiasm in Tesla largely rests on Musk’s pivot to expanding robotaxis, producing humanoid ‍robots, and improving self-driving technology in its cars. Still, EV ​sales generate much of its current revenue.

Tesla is expected to deliver 432,810 ​vehicles in the December quarter, down about 13% from a year earlier, according to analysts polled by ‍Visible Alpha (VA). Another consensus of 20 analysts compiled by Tesla and released on Monday shows that a sharper drop of 15% to 422,850 vehicles is expected.

Tesla’s full-year deliveries were expected to be 1.65 million vehicles this year, down 7.8% from a year earlier, marking the second consecutive annual decline, according to Visible Alpha’s poll.

The fall will be driven largely by sales in North ‍America and Europe, Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu said in a note.

MUSK MAY BE MORE FOCUSED IN 2026

The slowdown in sales has not dampened a rise in the company’s share price. Tesla shares rose ‍over 14% this year, boosting ‍Musk’s wealth. Facing criticism for running a cost-cutting arm of President Donald ​Trump’s administration, Musk has indicated he will focus on his businesses.

A ​recent court ⁠ruling cleared the way for Musk to reclaim a Tesla pay ‌package that had been voided by a Delaware court. Shareholders in November also approved a new compensation package that could be worth roughly $878 billion over the next 10 years for the world’s richest person.

Delivering 20 million vehicles in total is a key goal for that pay along with other milestones on robotaxi expansion, robot sales and valuation.

The Saudi PIF has too much invested to let the company collapse entirely, and Lucid’s technology is too valuable to disappear even if the car business stumbles.","I’ve been tracking Lucid’s financial situation all year, and a Motley Fool analysis this week crystallized what prospective buyers need to understand: the company that makes arguably the best-engineered electric vehicles on the road has roughly 18 months of confirmed cash runway. For investors, that’s a risk/reward calculation. For someone about to spend $79,900 on a Gravity Touring, it’s something more nuanced than Wall Street headlines suggest.

Here’s what you need to know:

What: Lucid’s total liquidity stands at $5.5 billion, projected to last until first half of 2027

The math: The company burns nearly $1 billion per quarter and has never turned a profit

The backstop: Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund owns 55-60% of the company and keeps expanding credit facilities

Why it matters: Your Lucid warranty is 4 years/50,000 miles. The confirmed runway is 18 months. But “confirmed” isn’t the whole story.

The Motley Fool analysis frames this as an investment question, but the real story for buyers is more complicated than either the doom scenarios or the bull cases suggest.

The Financial Reality: Worse Than It Looks, Better Than You’d Think

Lucid’s headline numbers are genuinely alarming. The company posted a net loss of $978.4 million in Q3 2025 alone. The accumulated deficit has ballooned to nearly $13 billion. GAAP gross margin was approximately negative 99% last quarter, meaning Lucid loses money on virtually every vehicle it sells.

The Motley Fool piece puts it bluntly: “This money-losing business is basically telling investors that it has a year to a year-and-a-half of money left.”

But here’s what that analysis underplays: Lucid isn’t backed by venture capitalists who might cut their losses. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund views Lucid as a strategic pillar of Vision 2030, the kingdom’s plan to diversify beyond oil. The PIF has repeatedly expanded credit facilities even as the stock hit all-time lows. They recently increased an undrawn credit line from $750 million to nearly $2 billion.

Sovereign wealth funds don’t behave like VCs. They think in decades, not quarters. The PIF has the resources to extend Lucid’s runway indefinitely if they choose to. The question isn’t whether Saudi Arabia can keep Lucid alive. It’s whether they will, and under what terms.

The Quality Problem That Complicates The Picture

If Lucid’s vehicles were bulletproof, the financial situation would be easier to dismiss. But that’s not the reality we’ve documented this year.

Earlier this month, we covered Jason Fenske’s ownership experience. The Engineering Explained host, a mechanical engineer with 4 million YouTube subscribers, documented 25+ failures in just 3,000 miles with his 2025 Lucid Air Touring. His verdict: “This car by an enormous margin is the most frustrating vehicle I have ever owned.”

What made Fenske’s critique so damaging was that it came from a true believer. He bought the car specifically because he considers the Air “one of the best engineered vehicles the world has ever seen.” The engineering is brilliant. The execution is beta-level software and inconsistent hardware quality control.

Add to this our coverage of Lucid’s lease-end billing controversy, where customers reported excessive wear-and-tear charges reaching thousands of dollars for minor cosmetic damage. One customer received a $7,600 bill including a nearly $4,900 taillight replacement. The backlash forced Lucid to overhaul its lease-end policies.

These quality and service issues matter because they determine how much you’ll actually need Lucid’s support infrastructure. A company with financial constraints and quality problems is a different risk profile than one with just financial constraints.

The Post-Subsidy Perfect Storm

The Motley Fool analysis explicitly connects Lucid’s struggles to something we’ve been covering all year: “EV sales have been weak since government subsidies were halted.”

The September 30 expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act fundamentally changed the economics of luxury EV purchases. October EV sales collapsed 24% in a single month. Lucid’s Gravity Touring launched at $79,900 just weeks after that credit disappeared.

For context, that same $79,900 Gravity would have effectively cost $72,400 with the tax credit intact. The credit expiration added roughly $100 per month to a typical 72-month loan payment. That’s meaningful for a vehicle already positioned at the premium end of the market.

Lucid has slashed its 2025 production forecast to approximately 18,000 vehicles, down from the 20,000 it targeted at the start of the year. That’s boutique-level volume, but Lucid’s cost structure isn’t built for boutique economics. Ferrari makes roughly 13,000 cars annually and prints money. The difference is Ferrari doesn’t lose $978 million per quarter. Lucid’s problem isn’t the volume. It’s the margin.

The Acquisition Safety Valve

Here’s something the doom scenarios miss: even if Lucid fails as a standalone company, owners probably aren’t abandoned.

Lucid’s powertrain technology is widely considered the most efficient in the industry. The Air’s 500+ mile range from a sedan-sized battery pack isn’t marketing fluff. It’s genuine engineering achievement that legacy automakers haven’t matched. That technology has value regardless of whether Lucid survives as a car company.

The Nvidia partnership for Level 4 autonomy and the Uber deal for 20,000 Gravity SUVs signal that Lucid is already positioning itself as more than just a vehicle manufacturer. If the car business struggles, Lucid’s intellectual property makes them a prime acquisition target for a Ford, Volkswagen, or tech giant looking to leapfrog their EV capabilities.

In an acquisition scenario, the acquirer typically assumes warranty and service obligations to protect brand reputation. It’s not guaranteed, but it’s more likely than the “orphaned vehicle” nightmare.

What Happens In Each Scenario

Scenario 1: PIF keeps extending the runway

Most likely outcome. Saudi Arabia has too much invested to walk away. Owners see no disruption, though the company may look very different in 5 years. The midsize vehicle launching late 2026 is the real test of whether Lucid can achieve sustainable economics.

Scenario 2: Strategic acquisition

A legacy automaker or tech company buys Lucid for the technology. Warranty and service obligations transfer to an acquirer with deeper pockets and established infrastructure. Owners might actually benefit from access to a larger service network.

Scenario 3: Pivot to technology licensing

Lucid scales back direct vehicle production and focuses on licensing powertrain technology to other manufacturers. Existing owners see continued support but slower software development and eventually frozen features.

Scenario 4: Liquidation (least likely)

The PIF walks away, no buyer emerges, Lucid winds down operations. Warranty coverage becomes meaningless, parts sourcing becomes a nightmare, software updates stop. Your $80,000 vehicle loses 30-50% of its value overnight.

The first two scenarios are far more probable than the last two. But “probably fine” is different from “definitely fine,” and the stakes are high enough to warrant clear-eyed assessment.

EVXL’s Take

Here’s what I expect: Lucid survives, but not necessarily as a pure-play automaker. The Saudi PIF has too much invested to let the company collapse entirely, and Lucid’s technology is too valuable to disappear even if the car business stumbles.

The real question for buyers isn’t “will Lucid exist in 5 years?” It probably will. The question is “will Lucid look like the company I’m buying from today?”

The irony remains painful: Lucid builds genuinely exceptional vehicles. U.S. News just named them the Best Luxury Electric Vehicle Brand, beating Tesla, Porsche, BMW, and Rivian. The Gravity’s space-to-footprint ratio is engineering brilliance. The Air’s efficiency is unmatched.

But engineering excellence doesn’t guarantee business success when you’re losing money on every car, the tax credits that made luxury EVs affordable just evaporated, and your software still feels beta-quality to owners like Jason Fenske.

If you’re cross-shopping a Rivian R1S, BMW iX, or Mercedes EQS SUV, the financial stability of those companies is a legitimate factor in your decision. But so is the unique Saudi backing that makes Lucid different from every other EV startup. This isn’t Fisker or Lordstown. The safety net is real.

Should you buy a Lucid? The technology says yes. The financials say proceed with awareness. The Saudi backing says the doom scenarios are probably overblown. If you’re comfortable with uncertainty about what Lucid becomes in 3-5 years, it offers a driving experience that justifies the price. If you need certainty that your manufacturer will look exactly the same when your loan is paid off, the alternatives are lower-risk choices.

JD Dillon: In 2025, Tigo Energy made significant progress in improving the installer experience and strengthening overall system quality.

One major milestone was surpassing 1,500 system engagements through the Green Glove programme, which continues to deliver value by supporting installers at every stage from design and deployment to safety validation and long-term performance. While the programme has historically been driven by commercial and industrial (C&I) projects, we began expanding Green Glove to the residential sector, where installer demand for proactive quality assurance is rapidly growing.

Internationally, Tigo also saw strong momentum in Europe, including expanded solar-plus-storage offerings in the Czech Republic, new residential solutions approved for use in Slovakia and rapid growth in markets like the UK. We also continued strengthening our open-ecosystem partnerships with companies such as Haier, Sonnen and EG4, ensuring installers and homeowners have flexible, interoperable options.

Finally, we laid important groundwork for the coming surge in US repowering. Aging systems and orphaned customers represent a real industry challenge. To address this, we focused on innovation that directly reduces installer friction. With that, we launched an Inverter Power Output Control (IPOC) feature that simplifies commissioning by allowing installers to set an inverter’s maximum AC output in software, eliminating the need to stock multiple models and reducing on-site uncertainty.

What challenges did you face this year, and how did you overcome them?

The solar industry continues to grapple with misconceptions around equipment reliability. This year reinforced the importance of collective responsibility to solar’s reputation. By doubling down on quality in design, installation, equipment, and service, we can help reduce negative project outcomes and strengthen customer trust.

All said, 2026 will require continuous improvement across the value chain is essential. Innovation is not optional; it’s how we make solar more predictable, more resilient, and more unified as the sector matures.

How do you think the growth of ‘mid-sized’ installers will change the US residential solar space?

Mid-sized regional installers, which we define as companies installing in fewer than three states or five cities (give or take), are positioned to play an increasingly important role in US residential solar. These companies have operational scale without the complexity of national players.

Larger entities often face challenges tied to things like overhead and workflow standardisation, while smaller companies may struggle with resource limitations or leave the industry altogether. Mid-sized installers, by contrast, focus on long-term relationships with homeowners and business owners, and they typically do not outsource their portfolios to operations and maintenance (O&M) providers. They have enough scale to be efficient but remain nimble, attentive and deeply rooted in their communities.

As quality and service become non-negotiable in a maturing market, mid-sized installers will remain central to the industry’s growth well beyond 2026.

Do you think 2026 will see increased attention towards repowering for the residential sector?

While I’m not well-versed in the end-of-life care for utility-scale repowering projects, I can say that we are deeply engaged in residential and C&I repowering. Generally speaking, the focus here should be on simplifying this process through better commissioning tools, innovative features like Inverter Power Output Control (IPOC), and partnerships that help installers confidently revive aging systems.

What would be the single most significant thing that could happen in 2026 that would advance either your own organisation or the wider market, or both?

2026 will separate the wheat from the chaff in important ways. Most notably through durability and quality.

For durability, solar companies—nearly the entire value chain in the US—will have to adapt to not having as many government incentives acting as artificial business accelerants. The companies that are good at minimising soft costs, driving efficiency and delivering consistent customer value are more likely to become the winners.

For quality, if you believe in the ‘Crossing the Chasm’ framework, an increasingly large number of US residential solar markets are approaching the tipping point. This follows the lead of other countries like Australia, where nearly 40% of dwellings are equipped with rooftop solar. Elsewhere, like the Netherlands, a similar figure shows that nearly one in three homes have solar. That said, as mainstream adoption takes hold, quality and service become non-negotiable, and solving for those business priorities is not the same as simply installing the cheapest possible solar panels and inverters.

Are you generally optimistic about what 2026 will bring?

Overall, yes. The industry is shifting toward a culture of continuous improvement that spans far beyond hardware quality. Software, service, commissioning processes and installer tools are all becoming central to competitive differentiation. This transition toward a more integrated, data-driven ecosystem is healthy for the market and ultimately better for customers.

We’re also encouraged by broader economic trends. As solar becomes more mainstream, its benefits extend further in supporting local job creation, stimulating regional economies and providing affordable clean energy to more communities. We also see solar increasingly bridging ideological divides as a practical, cost-effective energy solution.

In 2026, we anticipate a more mature and collaborative sector where quality, service and operational excellence define the leaders.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tigo-energy.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 07:59:02.654291

The tax credits have been sold at a ratio of US$0.91 per dollar of PTC generated, which puts the sale in line with other tax credit deals that have been signed this year in the US solar sector.
T1, for its part, has invested “significant capital” into debt repayments to Trina Solar, bringing the percentage of the company’s debt held by Trina Solar to within the FEOC compliance threshold, according to T1.
Historically, T1 also licensed patents and intellectual property from Trina Solar, which could compromise FEOC compliance.
However, T1 noted that Trina Solar has since sold this intellectual property to India-headquartered Evervolt, from which T1 is now licensing the intellectual property, which would make T1’s work FEOC-compliant.","The completion of the deal is an important milestone for T1, which pivoted to the solar manufacturing space from the battery sector in 2024 through the acquisition of a module manufacturing facility in Texas from Trina Solar. T1 sold 725MW of modules in the third quarter of this year, and expects to begin commercial operation at a tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cell manufacturing facility next year as it looks to build a domestic solar supply chain in the US.

“Validating our ability to monetise these credits is an important step for T1 as we continue to invest in advanced American manufacturing and grow our domestic production capacity at G1_Dallas, which is fully ramped, and at G2_Austin, our US solar cell fab that is now under construction,” said T1 chief financial officer Evan Calio.

The tax credits have been sold at a ratio of US$0.91 per dollar of PTC generated, which puts the sale in line with other tax credit deals that have been signed this year in the US solar sector. In June, SEG Solar and First Solar both completed deals at a ratio of US$0.94 per PTC dollar, the latter deal helping to push First Solar’s total tax credits sold over US$2 billion.

T1 Energy advances ‘FEOC-compliant’ supply chain

Yesterday, T1 also announced that it had completed deals with Trina Solar “and other parties” to ensure its compliance with the US’ foreign entity of concern (FEOC) regulation, which prohibits companies from benefitting from tax credits if they use components from companies based in or owned by countries deemed to be a threat to US security.

While this technically includes China, Iran, Russia and North Korea, the former’s dominance of the global solar manufacturing industry means that US solar companies have had to ensure their products are not made with components made in China in order to secure tax credit support. T1, for its part, has invested “significant capital” into debt repayments to Trina Solar, bringing the percentage of the company’s debt held by Trina Solar to within the FEOC compliance threshold, according to T1.

Historically, T1 also licensed patents and intellectual property from Trina Solar, which could compromise FEOC compliance. However, T1 noted that Trina Solar has since sold this intellectual property to India-headquartered Evervolt, from which T1 is now licensing the intellectual property, which would make T1’s work FEOC-compliant.

T1 also argued that it has purchased solar cells to be used in module production in 2026 from a “non-FEOC” manufacturer, but did not name this company; T1 also emphasised that much of its 2026 manufacturing work will use components and materials made in the US, either from T1’s own facilities or from fellow US companies Nextpower and Corning.

“Looking to 2026 and beyond, we expect to continue executing our strategy to manufacture FEOC-compliant, high-domestic content, high efficiency and technologically advanced solar energy products for our customers,” said T1 chairman and CEO Dan Barcelo.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freyr-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 06:57:38.111313

Tesla’s decision to publish delivery estimates signals management expects weaker sales than many investors had anticipated.

The company is on pace for a second straight annual decline in vehicle deliveries despite late-year demand surges tied to expiring tax credits.

Tesla stock remains up for the year, though it continues to lag the broader market.

Tesla has published a series of analyst sales estimates on its website, an uncommon move that suggests fourth-quarter vehicle deliveries may fall short of broader market expectations.

The company posted figures on its website showing that analysts on average expect Tesla to deliver 422,850 vehicles in the fourth quarter, a 15% decline from a year earlier. That compares with a Bloomberg-compiled average of 440,907 vehicles, which represents an 11% drop.

Tesla’s investor relations team has long compiled delivery estimates and shared them selectively with analysts and investors, but the company has not previously published the figures publicly. Gary Black, co-founder of Future Fund Advisors, described the move as highly unusual, suggesting it was intended to distribute Tesla’s internal consensus as widely as possible. He said deliveries are likely to land near 420,000 vehicles.

The disclosure comes as Tesla is on track for a second consecutive annual decline in vehicle sales. The company’s internal estimates indicate about 1.6 million deliveries for the year, down more than 8% from a year earlier. Tesla’s delivery projections for the next three years are also below averages compiled by Bloomberg.

Additionally, Tesla shares fell as much as 1.3% on Tuesday after the estimates were published, then recovered to erase the decline.

The sales slowdown earlier in the year followed Tesla’s decision to retool production lines at each of its assembly plants for the redesigned Model Y, the company’s best-selling vehicle. That period also coincided with CEO Elon Musk’s polarizing role in the Trump administration.

Deliveries rebounded to a record in the third quarter as U.S. consumers rushed to buy electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of $7,500 federal tax credits at the end of September. Tesla later sought to offset the loss of those incentives by introducing lower-priced versions of the Model Y sport utility vehicle and Model 3 sedan, each priced under $40,000.

Despite the sales slump, Tesla stock remains higher for the year. Shares were up 14% through Monday’s close, trailing the 17% gain in the S&P 500 index.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/shutterstock_2565190797-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 06:57:33.439885

Slate Auto has assembled a team of EV engineers from Tesla, Rivian and elsewhere to develop America's least-expensive EV truck. In the warehouse space near construction supply shops and a Western-themed bar, designers have built clay models and prototypes of a customizable EV truck that could cost half as much as the competition.

The company, which has raised more than $700 million from Amazon's Jeff Bezos and others, says it will have a truck on the market next year for roughly $25,000.

How does it plan to keep its sticker price so low?

Buyers will start with a blank slate — a basic truck without power windows or even paint — and can then customize it however they like.

They can pay extra for power windows, speakers, colored wrap or paint. A $5,000 kit even converts the truck into an SUV.

Squeezing out as much cost as possible while making it as easy as Legos to snap on different options has required complex engineering, which is why the company decided to set up its design studio in Southern California.

The region is full of experts.

Although Slate's headquarters is in Troy, Mich., and its vehicles will be manufactured in Indiana, much of how they will look and be assembled came together in the Los Angeles area, said Jeremy Snyder, Slate's chief commercial officer.

""The design presence on the West Coast, specifically in Los Angeles, has been a huge part of the automotive industry for a very long time,"" he said. ""Having that pool of talent that resides here was super important.""

If the idea clicks with enough consumers, company executives are hopeful that their unique business model will bolster widespread EV adoption.

Skeptics say it has yet to be proved that American consumers really want a vehicle broken down to the basics, but thousands of potential EV owners already have shown interest.

More than 150,000 potential buyers put down $50 deposits to reserve their place in line to buy the truck once it is on the market.

A large slice of that demand is coming from Los Angeles, Snyder said.

""Los Angeles has played such a critical role in the zero-emissions auto industry,"" he said. ""I think that it is going to play a very important role in the roll-out of Slate vehicles.""

The company's first deliveries are expected in late 2026.

Slate is entering the EV market at a difficult moment, as demand for green cars has cooled under the Trump administration. The president ended many tax breaks and regulations that were created to nudge more consumers and companies into EVs.

The EV company Rivian laid off more than 600 workers in October, and Tesla sales have slid this year.

Tesla has shown how tough it is to build a business around an affordable EV by putting its own affordable vehicle plans on the back burner.

These days, Elon Musk seems more focused on developing humanoid robots for the masses than on an affordable EV.

Slate thinks that for a radically reduced price, there will be demand. It is imagining that there are customers who don't need four doors, the size or the power of a standard truck or the autonomous driving tech of a Tesla.

Slate's big bet is that a radically reduced sticker price and a new kind of business model can rekindle excitement about the industry. The company is hoping that customers will be thrilled to save the money and then splurge only on the features they want.

""We're going to make the truck, and then after that, you make it yours,"" said Slate's head of communications, Jeff Jablansky.

Slate trucks have a steel frame and external plastic panels that can be wrapped in any color. If customers want to paint their vehicle, they can do it themselves or take it to a partner shop.

The standard version will have an electric range of 150 miles. That can be increased to 240 miles by paying more for a bigger battery.

And those are some of the most obvious options.

Slate's online customization tool gives customers the freedom to design their EV however they want. Jablansky said potential customers have created more than 10 million different configurations of a Slate truck online.

Slate hopes that if it can make EVs more affordable to buy, a new group of consumers will get to experience that EVs also often cost less to own and maintain.

""The entire company was built around this idea of the affordable vehicle,"" Snyder said. ""We scrutinize every accessory in the same way that we scrutinize the vehicle to keep prices as low as possible.""

Although only about 25 of Slate's 500 employees work out of the Long Beach studio, it has a disproportionate effect on the company's product.

To trailblaze and succeed in the harsh EV market, the company decided it needed a presence in California, as well as near the traditional heart of car building in and around Detroit.

""We knew we needed to have a presence in both places to really understand what people wanted,"" Jablansky said. ""Some companies say they're a California company, some say they're a Detroit company. We need to be an American company.""

I’ve spoken to energy workers in Louisiana.
One message was clear: American energy workers are hurting from the slow permitting processes.
This was a parting gift to left-wing environmentalists, not Louisiana workers and families.
President Trump also signed an Executive Order in April to restore competitiveness to the American seafood industry and strengthen U.S. fishing.","Before the sun even rises, people are hard at work every day in South Louisiana—from the energy worker in Houma checking equipment and reviewing safety logs to the shrimper pushing off from the docks. They keep our lights on, our restaurants full, and our economy strong. My job is to keep that rhythm alive by supporting Louisiana fishermen and offshore energy workers—making life better for the men and women who rise before dawn to keep our state prosperous. That is my goal, and that is President Trump’s goal.

In President Trump’s Working Families Tax Cuts bill, we expanded offshore lease sales for the next 15 years. Through GOMESA—a law which shares federal oil and gas revenues from the Gulf of America with Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas, as well as Louisiana—I worked to make sure our state got more than our fair share. Because of that work and President Trump’s partnership, Louisiana will now receive an extra $46 million per year for coastal restoration. You can’t fish or produce energy without a healthy coast—something families from Lafourche to Vermilion Parish understand firsthand. I’ve spoken to energy workers in Louisiana. In May, President Trump invited me to join him at the White House as he discussed the incredible investments pouring into America that will benefit Louisiana, energy independence, and the families and workers who power this country.

This year, I also hosted an energy summit in New Orleans to talk about the future of energy in our state. One message was clear: American energy workers are hurting from the slow permitting processes. So, I introduced the REPAIR Act to make sure energy, manufacturing, and infrastructure projects aren’t held up by frivolous lawsuits after permits are already approved. This bill makes the review process faster, sets up a way for developers and agencies to work out issues directly, and helps projects move forward quickly. Otherwise, we’re wasting taxpayer dollars and hurting workers still recovering from President Biden’s war on American energy.

Just before he left office, President Biden delivered one final blow by banning new domestic offshore oil and gas exploration, threatening thousands of jobs. This was a parting gift to left-wing environmentalists, not Louisiana workers and families.

Under President Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, the difference is night and day. On day one, President Trump and Republicans promised to unleash

American energy. We delivered. For the first time in years, we held a massive offshore lease sale in New Orleans. Not to mention, the Trump Administration’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management already announced a second one. This is a direct result of my work with President Trump on his Working Families Tax Cuts bill. It will unlock 80 million acres in the Gulf, lower energy costs, and create good-paying jobs that support households throughout Lafayette and the greater Acadiana region.

President Trump also signed an Executive Order in April to restore competitiveness to the American seafood industry and strengthen U.S. fishing. People come from all over to try Louisiana gumbo, jambalaya, and shrimp and grits. That’s because our shrimpers and catfish farmers meet high standards. I introduced legislation to protect Louisiana’s shrimpers and fishermen against India’s dumping of cheap shrimp and produce into U.S. markets. I’ve discussed these concerns with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and worked for years to level the playing field for Louisiana seafood jobs. That work includes negotiating hundreds of millions for the Morganza to the Gulf levee protection project.

Louisianans know natural disasters all too well. Our coastal communities have taken a beating. We have the will to rebuild, but rebuilding takes resources. Through my work on the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, I delivered $11 billion of federal funding back to our state—$3.5 billion for coastal and mitigation projects. Tens of millions are going to South Louisiana to fix crumbling roads and broken bridges—think the Robinson Canal Bridge, Ducros Road, and Bayou Blue sidewalks.

The Bayou’s strong workforce is doing an incredible job. I’ve met with many of them—folks from SLEMCO—who get the lights back on quickly after the power goes out. Hard work like theirs gives families another reason to come to Louisiana and stay. As you are doing everything you can to make our state better—and you are succeeding—I am working every day to make life in Louisiana better. You should have money left over after the bills are paid, safe roads to drive on, and confidence your job is supported.

Louisiana is a great success story, and you are at the heart of it. Let’s keep the Gulf open, the jobs coming, and our communities protected for generations to come.","https://www.houmatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/09/NPPS/87685419007-bill-cassidy.jpeg?crop=198,112,x0,y70&width=198&height=112&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-31 06:57:42.255457

And so for me, somebody who wants to have solar panels and wants to use solar power, it’s just not cost-effective.
We’ve never really seen anything like it.Al Letson:Do you think we’ll be able to bounce back?","Bill McKibben:For a very long time, all my life, we’ve called this stuff alternative energy, and it’s sort of been there on the fringe like maybe it’s not real big boy energy the way that oil and gas is. I think we’ve tended to think of it as the Whole Foods of energy. It’s like nice, but it’s pricey. It’s the Costco of energy now.Al Letson:Coming up on More To The Story, environmentalist, Bill McKibben on why the answer to all our energy problems is literally right above us. Don’t go anywhere.This is More To The Story. I’m Al Letson. Environmentalist Bill McKibben isn’t known for a sunny outlook on climate change, but Bill seems to have turned a corner with his new book, Here Comes The Sun: A Last Chance For the Climate and a Fresh Chance for Civilization. It’s an optimistic look at a renewable energy solution staring us right in the face, a solution that countries like China and Australia are making both affordable and accessible. In contrast, the Trump administration is rolling back efforts to make sustainable energy affordable while doubling down on the use of fossil fuels. It’s an effort that Bill says is leaving the United States in the Dark Ages.Bill, how are you this morning?Bill McKibben:I’m actually pretty darn good, which one feels bad about saying in the midst of planetary ecological trauma and the collapse of our democracy, but it’s a beautiful day in the mountains of Vermont and in the midst of all that bad stuff, I’ve got one piece of big good news, which it’s actually kind of fun to share.Al Letson:Yeah, I think in the midst of all the stress and pressure and sadness about the way the world is heading at this moment, I think having joy is a revolutionary act and it’s good. I think when you come outside and the sun is shining and it feels good outside, I don’t know. I don’t think we should be ashamed of it. I think we should bask it and hold onto it as long as possible because good Lord, who knows what’s next?Bill McKibben:Amen. One of the results of having spent my whole life working on climate change is I never take good weather for granted. If there’s a snowstorm, I make the most out of every flake. If there’s a beautiful cool fall-like morning like there was today, nobody’s out in it quicker than me. So I take your point 100%.Al Letson:How long have you been working in the field of environmental justice and thinking about the environment?Bill McKibben:Al, when I was 27, I wrote a book called The End of Nature, so this would’ve been 1989 because I’m an old person. So, wrote a book called The End of Nature that was the first book about what we now call the climate crisis, what we then call the greenhouse effect. And that book, well, that book did well, it came out in 24 languages and things, but more to the point, it just made me realize that this was not only the most important question in the world, what was going to happen to the Earth’s climate, but the most interesting, that it required some understanding of science, but also more importantly of economics, of politics, of sociology, of psychology, of theology, of pretty much everything you could imagine. And so for 38 years now, I guess, it’s been my work and at some level, I wish I’d been able to spend my life on something not quite so bleak. On the other hand, I have to confess, I haven’t been bored in any point in there.Al Letson:Yeah. How would you describe the environmental causes in America since you’ve been watching it for so long? It seems to me that there’s a lot of one step forward, three steps back, one step forward, three steps back.Bill McKibben:I’d say it’s been more like one step forward, three quarters of a step back over and over again. And that’s a big problem because it’s not only that we have to move, it’s that we have to move fast. Climate change is really probably the first great question we’ve ever come up against that has time limit. As long as I’ve been alive and as long as you’ve been alive, our country’s been arguing over should we have national healthcare? I think we should. I think it’s a sin that we don’t, people are going to die and go bankrupt every year that we don’t join all the other countries of the world in offering it, but it’s not going to make it harder to do it when we eventually elect Bernie and set our minds to it than if we hadn’t delayed all this time.Climate change isn’t like that. Once you melt the Arctic, nobody has a plan for how you freeze it back up again. So we’re under some very serious time pressure, which is why it’s incredibly sad to watch our country pretty much alone among the world in reverse right now on the most important questions.Al Letson:Yeah. Is that forward movement and regression tied to our politics, i.e., is it tied to a specific party? If the Democrats are in office, we move forward, if Republicans come in office, we move backwards?Bill McKibben:Yeah, in the largest terms. The fossil fuel industry, more or less purchased the Republican Party 30, 35 years ago. Their biggest contributors have been the Koch brothers who are also the biggest oil and gas barons in America. And so it’s just been become party doctrine to pretend that physics and chemistry don’t really exist and we don’t have to worry about them. Democrats have been better, and in the case of Joe Biden actually, considerably better. His Inflation Reduction Act was the one serious attempt that America’s ever made to deal with the climate crisis, and it was far from perfect, and there were plenty of Democrats like Joe Manchin that got in the way and so on and so forth. But all in all, it was a good faith effort driven by extraordinary activism around the Green New Deal. And it’s a shame to see it now thrown into reverse in the Trump administration, especially because the rest of the world is at different paces, some of them very fast, starting to do the right thing here.Al Letson:So given all of that where we are and kind of stepping back away from the progress we had made forward, you just wrote a new book that is pretty optimistic, which is a little bit different for you because you’ve been described as dark realism. Tell me why are you feeling optimistic in this moment?Bill McKibben:About 36 months ago, the planet began an incredible surge of installation of renewable energy, solar panels, wind turbines, and the batteries to store that power when the sun goes down or the wind drops. That surge is not just the fastest energy transition play on the planet now. It’s the fastest energy transition in history and by a lot, and the numbers are frankly kind of astonishing. I mean, the last month we have good data for is May. In China, in May, they were putting up three gigawatts of solar panels a day. Now, a gigawatt is the rough equivalent of a big coal-fired power plant. So they were building the equivalent of one of those worth of solar panels every eight hours across China. Those kind of numbers are world-changing if we play it out for a few more years, and if everybody joins in. And you can see the same thing happening in parts of this country.California has not done everything right, but it’s done more right than most places, and California has hit some kind of tipping point in the last 11 or 12 months. Now, most days, California generates more than a hundred percent of the electricity it uses from clean energy, which means that at night, when the sun goes down, the biggest source of supply on their grid is batteries that didn’t exist three years ago. And the bottom line is a 40% fall in fossil fuel use for electricity in the fourth-largest economy in the world is the kind of number that, adopted worldwide, begins to shave tenths of a degree off how hot the planet eventually gets. And we know that every 10th of a degree Celsius, that the temperature rises, moves another a hundred million of our brothers and sisters out of a safe climate zone and into a dangerous one. We’re not talking salvation here, we’re not talking stopping global warming, but we are talking the first thing that’s happened in the 40 years that we’ve known about climate change, that scales to at least begin taking a serious bite out of the trouble we’re in.Al Letson:Yeah, so I own a home in Jacksonville, Florida.Bill McKibben:In the Sunshine State.Al Letson:In the Sunshine State. I was planning on getting solar panels for the house, but then I was told A, one, it would be really expensive, and then B, it wouldn’t save me that much on my bill because of the way some local ordinances are configured. And so for me, somebody who wants to have solar panels and wants to use solar power, it’s just not cost-effective. So how do we get past that?Bill McKibben:Well, there’s a lot of ways. One of the ways was what Biden was doing in the IRA, which was to offer serious tax credits. And those, despite the Republican defeat of them, remain in effect through the end of this year through New Year’s Eve. So if people move quickly, they can still get those. Probably more important in the long run, and this was the subject of a long piece I wrote for Mother Jones this summer, we need serious reform in the way that we permit and license these things.Putting solar panels on your roof in Florida is roughly three times more expensive than it is to put solar panels on your roof in say, Australia, to pick someplace with a similar climate, or Europe, someplace with a more difficult climate, costs three times as much here. A little bit of that’s because of tariffs on panels. Mostly it’s because every municipality in America, they send out their own team of inspectors, permits, on and on and on. It’s a bureaucratic mess, and that’s what drives the price up so dramatically.There’s actually an easy way to do it. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory developed a piece of software called the Solar App Plus that allows contractors to just plug in the name of the type of equipment they’re going to put on the roof and the address that they’re doing it, and the computer quickly checks to see if it’s all compatible, and if it is, they get an instantaneous permit and get to work right away. And then, for apartment dwellers, because there’s almost as many apartment dwellers as homeowners in this country, who don’t have access to their own roof usually, we need another set of easy technology. We’re calling this balcony solar.And across Europe over the last three years, three and a half, 4 million apartment dwellers have gone to whatever you call Best Buy in Frankfurt or Brussels and come home for a few hundred euros with solar panel design just to be hung from the railing of a apartment balcony and then plugged directly into the wall. No electrician needed nothing. That’s illegal every place in this country except that progressive bastion in the state of Utah where the state legislature unanimously passed enabling legislation earlier this year because some Libertarian Republican state senator who I’ve talked to, an interesting guy, he said, “Well, if people in Stuttgart can have it, why not people in Provo?” And no one had a good reason, so now there’s on YouTube lots of videos of Happy Utahns putting up their balcony solar arrays.Al Letson:So let me just to clarify that because I never heard of this before. In overseas, in different countries, they can go to, I don’t know, an Ikea and grab a solar panel, come home and plug it in the wall to power their apartment?Bill McKibben:It often powers 25% of the power that they’re using in their apartment. It’s a real amazing thing and it’s for a few hundred euros. And among other things, it really introduces people to the joy of all this. There was a big story in The Guardian a few months ago following all sorts of people who’d done this and almost to a person, they’d all become fascinated by the app on their phone showing how much power they were generating at any given moment.Solar power is kind of a miracle. It exists in so many different sizes, from your balcony to big solar farms, all of which we need. But the thing that’s a miracle about it is precisely that it’s available to all of us. I mean, no one’s going to build a coal-fired power plant on their balcony. This is something that everybody can do, and it’s something that once you’ve got the panel, no one can control. We’re talking about energy that can’t be hoarded, that can’t be held in reserve, and that essentially the sun delivers for free every day when it rises above the horizon. So that is an extraordinary boon to especially poor people around the world and an extraordinary threat to the fossil fuel industry, which is why you’re seeing the crazy pushback that marks the Trump administration.Al Letson:Coming up, Bill says, the United States is woefully behind the rest of the world when it comes to solar power and renewable energy.Bill McKibben:That we’ve now gifted the future to China is just crazy no matter what your politics are.Al Letson:But before we get to that, we here at Reveal want to reach as many ears as possible and you, my friend, can help us do that.

Okay, don’t go anywhere. More coming up with Bill McKibben.This is More To The Story. I’m Al Letson. Environmentalist and author Bill McKibben is here to tell us why the sun is an obvious solution to our energy problems if only American politicians, including our president, we get on board.So with the Trump administration and this bill that they passed, The Big Beautiful Bill, that impacts tax credits for renewable projects like solar, how is that going to affect the solar power industry in the United States?Bill McKibben:It’s going to decimate it. There are already companies laying people off and going out of business because that tax credit was important and it’s, since we can’t do anything in Washington at the moment, why we need state and local governments to step up big to change the rules here and try to keep this momentum going in the States. The United States accounts for about 11% of emissions in the world. The other 89%, things are going much better than they are here, not just in China, but in all the places that China touches.In some ways, the most powerful story for me in the book was what happened in Pakistan last year. Now, Pakistan’s been hit harder by climate change than any country on earth. Its cities now routinely report temperatures of 125, 126 degrees. The two worst floods that really we’ve ever recorded on the planet happened in Pakistan over the last 15 years. Right now there’s big major, not quite as bad, but really serious flood across the Punjab. Pakistan also has an expensive and unreliable electric system. So about 18 months ago, people began importing in very large numbers, cheap Chinese solar panels from across their shared border. And within six months, eight months, Pakistanis, without government help, just basically using directions you can get on TikTok, had installed enough solar panels to equal half of the existing national electric grid in Pakistan. It’s the most amazing sort of citizen engineering project in history and of incredible value to people.Farmers in Pakistan, I don’t know if you’ve traveled in rural Asia, but the soundtrack of at part of the world is the hum of diesel pumps, often the cough of diesel generators because you need to bring up this irrigation water from quite a great depth to wells that came with the green revolution. Often for farmers, that diesel is the biggest single input cost that they have. So farmers were very early adopters here. Many of them lacked the money to build the steel supports that we’re used to seeing to hold your solar panels up. They just laid them on the ground and pointed them at the sun. Pakistanis last year used 35% less diesel than they did the year before. Now the same thing is happening in the last six months across large parts of Africa. Pretty much any place where there’s really deep established trade relations with China, and it’s not just solar panels.What the Chinese are also doing is building out the suite of appliances that make use of all that clean, cheap electricity. The most obvious example being electric vehicles and electric bikes. More than half the cars sold in China last month came with a plug dangling out the back, and now those are the top-selling cars in one developing nation after another around the world because they’re cheap and they’re good cars and because if you’re in Ethiopia or Djibouti or wherever you are, you have way more access to sunshine than you do to the incredibly long supply chain that you need to support a gasoline station.Al Letson:But my understanding, and my understanding is definitely dated, which is why I’m glad I’m talking to you, but for a very long time, my understanding of solar power was that it wasn’t that efficient, that you wouldn’t be able to get enough power to really do much of anything versus fossil fuels. Is it true that the Chinese have really invested in the technology and really pushed it forward?Bill McKibben:Yeah, I mean Chinese are now, you’ve heard of petro states, the Chinese are the first electro state in the world. This stuff works great and it works great here. I mean, I was telling you about what’s going on in California. In some ways, an even more remarkable story, given the politics, is that Texas is now installing clean energy faster than California because it’s the cheapest and it’s the fastest thing to put up. If you’re having to build data centers, and God knows, I’m not convinced we have to build as many data centers as we’re building, but if you do, the only thing that builds fast enough to get them up is solar or wind. You can put up a big solar farm in a matter of a few months as fast as you can build the dumb data center.Your question’s really important because for a very long time, all my life, we’ve called this stuff alternative energy, and it’s sort of been there on the fringe like maybe it’s not real big boy energy the way that oil and gas is. I think we’ve tended to think of it as the Whole Foods of energy. It’s like nice, but it’s pricey. It’s the Costco of energy now. It’s cheap, it’s available in bulk, it’s on the shelf ready to go. 95% of new electric generation around the world and around the country last year came from clean energy, and that’s precisely why the fossil fuel industry freaked out. You remember a year ago, Donald Trump told oil executives, “If you give me a billion dollars, you can have anything you want.” They gave him about half a billion between donations and advertising and lobbying. That was enough because he’s doing things even they couldn’t have imagined. I mean, he’s shut down two almost complete big wind farms off the Atlantic seaboard. I mean, it’s craziness. We’ve never really seen anything like it.Al Letson:Do you think we’ll be able to bounce back? As we’re watching all of these forward movements that have happened before Trump came back into office, it feels like he is burning it all down and not just burning it down, but salting the earth. Nothing’s going to grow there again.Bill McKibben:Yeah, I completely hear you. Yeah. This one possibility. Look, 10 years from now, if we stay on the course that Trump has us on, any tourist who can actually get a visa to come to America, it’ll be like a Colonial Williamsburg of internal combustion. People will come to gawk at how people used to live back in the olden days. I don’t think that that’s what’s going to happen. I think that at some point, reality is going to catch up with this, and everyone’s going to start figuring out we’re paying way more for energy than else in the world, and that means our economy is always on the back foot. That means that our consumers are always strapped. I mean, electricity prices are up 10% this year so far around this country because he keeps saying, “We’re not going to build the cheapest, fastest way to make more electricity.”I don’t see how that can last. But then I don’t see how any of this, none of it… I mean, I confess, I feel out of my depth now, the hatred of immigrants, the racial hatred, the insane economic policy around tariffs, none of it makes any real sense to me politically or morally. So I could be wrong, but I hope that America, which after all was where the solar cell was invented and where the first solar cell came out of Edison, New Jersey in 1954, the first commercial wind turbine in the world went up on a Vermont mountain about 30 miles south of where I’m talking from you speaking in the 1940s. That we’ve now gifted the future to China is just crazy no matter what your politics are.Al Letson:The idea that we are ceding ground to China is not just about solar energy, but in all sorts of ways. The move of the Trump administration to be sort of isolationists is actually hurting us way more than being open and growing and advancing.Bill McKibben:Yep, I couldn’t agree more. Look, I’ve been to China a bunch of times. I’m glad that I’m not a Chinese citizen because doing the work I do, I would’ve been in jail long ago, and I’m aware of that and understand the imperfections and deep flaws in that country. But I also understand that they have a deep connection to reason. They’ve elected engineers, or not elected, appointed engineers to run their country now for decades while we’ve been electing lawyers to run ours. And as a result, they’re not surprisingly better at building stuff. And so they have. And I think now, they’re using that to build a kind of moral legitimacy in the world. If the biggest problem the world faces turns out to be climate change, and I have no doubt that it is, then China’s going to be the global leader in this fight because we’ve just walked away from it.Al Letson:Yes. The question that comes to mind when you say that is, it’s clear to me that what some climate change skeptics and renewable energy skeptics have been able to do is to wrap things like solar power and wind energy into the culture war. So now that it’s a part of the culture war, people just stand against it because, well, they’re on the wrong team. Instead of looking at the economic reality that their bills could go down significantly if they dived in.Bill McKibben:It’s super true, but it’s also true that solar power is remarkably popular across partisan lines. The polling we have shows that yeah, the Republican voters are less enamored of it now because Trump’s been going so hard after it, but still like it by large margins and want more government support for it. I think the reason is that there are several ways to think about this. I’m concerned about climate change. I’m a progressive. I like the idea that we’re networking the groovy power of the sun to save our planet, but I’ve lived my whole life in rural America, much of it in red state, rural America. I have lots of neighbors who are very conservative. There’s lots of Trump flags on my road, and some of them fly in front of homes with solar panels on them because if you’re completely convinced that your home is your castle and that you’re going to defend with your AR-15, it’s a better castle if it has its own independent power supply up on the roof, and people have really figured that out.So this can cut both ways, and I hope that it will. That’s that story from Utah about the balcony solar. That’s the one place where people have said, “Well, there’s no reason not to do this. Let’s do it.”Al Letson:Yeah. So you’ve been doing this work for a really long time. I’m curious, when you started doing this work, could you have ever imagined the place that we are in right now as a country?Bill McKibben:No. Remember I was 27 when I wrote this first book, so my theory of change was people will read my book and then they will change. Turns out that that’s not exactly how it works. It took me a while to figure out. Really the story of my life is first 10 years after that, I just kept writing more books and giving talks and things because I thought being a journalist that we were having an argument and that if we won the argument, then our leaders would do the right thing because why wouldn’t they? Took me too long, at least a decade, to figure out that we had won the argument, but that we were losing the fight because the fight wasn’t about data and reason and evidence. The fight was about what fights are always about, money and power. And the fossil fuel industry had enough money and power to lose the argument, but keep their business model rolling merrily along.So that’s when I started just concluding that we needed to organize because if you don’t have billions of dollars, the only way to build power is to build movements. I started with seven college students, a thing called 350.org that became the first big global grassroots climate movement campaign. We’ve organized 20,000 demonstrations in every country on earth except North Korea. And in recent years, I’ve organized for old people like me, what we call Third Act, which now has about 100,000 Americans that work on climate and democracy and racial justice. And so this is a big sprawling fight, we don’t know how it’s going to come out. The reason I wrote this book, Here Comes the Sun, was just to give people a sense that all is not lost, that we do have some tools now that we can put to use.Al Letson:Bill McKibben is the author of Here Comes The Sun: A Last Chance For the Climate and a Fresh Chance for Civilization. Bill, thanks so much for talking to me today.Bill McKibben:Well, Al, many thanks to you and many thanks for really thoughtful questions.",https://i0.wp.com/revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251015_Bill-McKibben_2000px-scaled.png?fit=2560%2C1439&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-31 07:59:07.394849

The monthly refresh provides a complete update of the bank’s top recommendations across growth, income, value, and short investment strategies.

Cheniere Energy is among JPMorgan’s top energy picks. The liquefied natural gas exporter has established itself as a major player in the U.S. energy export market, operating LNG terminals in Louisiana and Texas that position it well for rising global demand for natural gas.

Cheniere Energy reported third-quarter 2025 earnings per share that beat analyst forecasts, although revenue came in below expectations. The company also received a credit rating upgrade to BBB+ from S&P Global Ratings, reflecting solid operational performance.

Entergy is also featured on JPMorgan’s list of preferred energy stocks. The utility serves roughly 3 million customers across Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Its regulated utility model provides stability and predictable returns, characteristics that appeal to income-focused investors.

Recently, Entergy completed a $1.3 billion offering of junior subordinated debentures. The Public Utility Commission of Texas also approved the company’s Cypress to Legend 500-kV transmission line project.

EQT Corp. is another JPMorgan energy pick. One of the largest natural gas producers in the United States, EQT has significant operations in the Appalachian Basin and a large resource base that underpins its production profile.

In a separate development, EQT’s President and CEO, Toby Z. Rice, made a personal strategic investment in Orbital Biocarbon, a company focused on sewage-sludge disposal facilities.

GE Vernova, the energy business spun off from General Electric, also features among JPMorgan’s favored energy names. The company is focused on electrification and renewable technologies, including wind turbines, grid solutions, and power conversion equipment.

GE Vernova recently received credit rating upgrades from both Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings to BBB+ and BBB, respectively, with the agencies pointing to improved profitability and execution.

Targa Resources Corp. is included for its midstream energy exposure. The company specializes in the gathering, processing, and transportation of natural gas and natural gas liquids, with infrastructure spanning key U.S. energy basins.

Targa announced a definitive agreement to acquire Stakeholder Midstream for $1.25 billion in cash, expanding its footprint in the Permian Basin.

Vistra is another JPMorgan energy pick. The integrated power generation and retail electricity company operates across 20 states with a mix of conventional and renewable assets.

Vistra was recently upgraded to investment grade by S&P Global Ratings, which raised its issuer credit rating to BBB-. The company also cleared about 10,566 megawatts in the PJM Interconnection capacity auction for the 2027/2028 planning year.

JPMorgan’s Analyst Focus List represents a monthly refresh of their highest conviction ideas, replacing previous recommendations.

Investors should note that these selections reflect the current views of JPMorgan’s equity research team rather than a model portfolio, the bank said.

Wins for Adaptation Meanwhile, climate change adaptation is also attracting more funding.
As climate change brews more extreme weather events, catastrophe bonds are also emerging as a new tool to fund disaster preparedness.","Planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions kept rising in 2025 and country pledges to cut them are nowhere near where they need to be to avoid catastrophic climate change, but there were silver linings too.

The world is decarbonizing faster than was expected 10 years ago and investment into the clean energy transition, including everything from wind and solar to batteries and grids, is expected to have reached a new record of $2.2 trillion globally in 2025, according to research by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a London non-profit.

“Is this enough to keep us safe? No it clearly isn’t,” said Gareth Redmond-King, international lead at the ECIU. “Is it remarkable progress compared to where we were headed? Clearly it is.”

This was also the year when renewable power capacity reached new highs, batteries became cheaper than ever and an unprecedented level of protection for the high seas became a reality. Artificial intelligence made climate research faster and more efficient, and weather forecasting more precise. And even as the ravages of climate change became more apparent, economies and people were able to access a growing number of instruments to shield themselves.

Here’s a look at these and other investments, innovations and policy changes that went right for climate in 2025:

Clean Energy Boom

Global investment in clean tech far outpaced what went into polluting industries. For every $1 funding fossil fuel projects, $2 went into clean power, according to the ECIU. For China, the EU, the US and India, the four largest polluters, it was $2.60.

Funds flowing into renewable power set another record in the first half of this year and were up 10% compared to the same period in 2024, to $386 billion, according to the latest available research by BloombergNEF.

Solar and wind grew fast enough to meet all new electricity demand globally in the first three quarters of 2025, according to UK-based energy think tank Ember. That means renewable capacity is set to hit a new record globally this year, with Ember forecasting an 11% increase from 2024.

Over the past three years, renewable capacity grew by nearly 30% on average. That puts the world within reach of the goal set at COP 28 in Dubai in 2023 to triple clean power by 2030.

China is leading the charge, with the world’s largest polluter expected to have delivered 66% of new solar capacity, and 69% of new wind globally this year, according to Ember. Renewables also advanced in parts of Asia, Europe and South America.

AI’s Climate Benefit

The explosive power demand from artificial intelligence is also turning the tide on green technology investment, which had soured in recent years. For the first three quarters of this year, global clean tech investment, which was dominated by funding in next-generation nuclear reactors, renewables and other solutions that help power data centers, has already surpassed all of 2024. That marks the sector’s first annual increase since the 2022 peak.

And despite President Donald Trump’s rollback of climate policies, the S&P’s main gauge tracking clean energy is up about 50% this year, outperforming most other stock indexes and even gold. That same enthusiasm has also helped channel more capital into developing and upgrading the power grid, a backbone of the global energy transition.

The rise of artificial intelligence is also playing a role in enabling new climate solutions and expediting scientific research.

Waymo’s self-driving electric vehicles use AI to optimize route planning and minimize idling, reducing their carbon footprint. Bridge inspectors, meanwhile, deploy AI-enabled scanning systems to help safeguard critical infrastructure against extreme heat. AI is also helping scientists identify and count endangered species, and weather forecasters be more precise.

Cheaper Batteries

Battery prices, long a sticking point in the electrification of a range of products, continue to decline.

Prices per kilowatt-hour of battery capacity fell by 8% to a record $108 this year and they’re expected to decline a further 3% next year, according to BloombergNEF. The decrease is a result of better manufacturing, cheaper chemical recipes and a glut of production, factors that have outweighed higher prices for the metals that go into batteries.

The swooning prices improve the economics on a range of products from lawn mowers to commercial drones. Carmakers, in particular, will be able to spur EV adoption with longer range, lower cost vehicles.

The largest unlock will arguably be in utility-scale storage systems that bottle up energy from solar and wind farms and trickle it out during peaks in electricity demand.

The US Energy Information Administration estimates 18.2 gigawatts of storage capacity will have come online in 2025, which represents a 77% increase over the prior year and nearly one-third of the country’s new power. These facilities are now one of the cheapest options for utilities looking to build a power plant; soon, they’ll be cheaper still.

International Progress

In the year when Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement and railed against clean tech, the global community scored some big wins.

Three years after being adopted, the so-called High Seas Treaty finally got the needed number of ratifications to come into force in January 2026. It will allow for the protection of the 60% of seas that don’t fall within any country’s jurisdiction, regulating what can and can’t be done in international waters for the first time ever.

It sets the framework for establishing marine protected areas and requires that environmental impact assessments be conducted for activities that could have a harmful or an unknown impact on the high seas. This comes at a time when there’s growing interest in using the ocean to absorb and store carbon dioxide and to mine the rare minerals sitting on its bed.

The International Court of Justice, meanwhile, issued a first-of-its-kind ruling in favor of climate action, which promises to transform the way that NGOs and campaigners hold governments to account. In July, the court determined that countries risk being in violation of international law if they don’t work towards keeping global warming to the 1.5C threshold agreed at the Paris climate conference in 2015. It’s an advisory opinion, but representatives for Vanuatu, the country that brought the case, said it could be used to put pressure on governments to do more on climate change.

Climate Policy

While the US rolled back its environmental policy, others pressed ahead. Australia, Denmark and the UK announced more ambitious emissions goals. While China was more timid in its goals, a majority of experts expect it to beat its target to cut emissions by 7 to 10% from peak levels by 2035, given the speed at which it’s expanding its clean energy capacity.

Global capitals historically dominated by cars have started to push back, seeking to encourage their residents to walk and cycle instead. Cities in Europe are further down this path, but in January, New York City introduced measures designed to dissuade drivers from entering certain parts of the city. By April it was already apparent that the change was reducing congestion and cutting journey times. More recently, researchers have found a 22% drop in harmful particulate pollution in the area where charges are enforced.

Overall, climate policy shows signs of becoming firmly embedded in national governmental policies, the ECIU found in its research. The Trump administration’s rollbacks on key climate and environmental regulations mean the share of the global economy covered by net zero targets fell to a little bit over 80%, down from more than 90% in 2024, but state-level targets and policies are holding the line and preventing that number from falling further.

Wins for Adaptation

Meanwhile, climate change adaptation is also attracting more funding. Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates’s foundation announced in November that it will commit $1.4 billion over four years to expand access to innovations that help farmers in Africa and Asia become more resilient. This year’s UN annual climate summit also concluded with a new agreement to triple adaptation finance to $120 billion per year by 2035.

Hurricane Melissa — a tragedy that killed dozens of people in Jamaica and wiped out roughly 40% of the country’s annual economic output — also served as a dark example of how catastrophe bonds can help transfer part of climate risks to capital markets. The deadly storm triggered a full payout of Jamaica’s $150 million cat bond, easing doubts about whether such instruments work.

As climate change brews more extreme weather events, catastrophe bonds are also emerging as a new tool to fund disaster preparedness. These financial instruments, designed to pay out a specific amount if damage from climate-fueled natural disasters is severe, have traditionally been used to cover losses. But this year, hurricane-prone North Carolina has expanded the use case by issuing a new cat bond that incentivizes adaptation.

If no major losses occur, $2 million returns to the North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association, the bond issuer, which then uses the money to help install wind-resistant “super roofs.” As more homeowners add these roofs, the annual pricing on the bond resets to factor in the changing exposure.

The new bond drew $600 million in investor interest, almost doubling its initial offering. NCIUA, which serves as the state-sponsored insurer in North Carolina, also expects the new resilient roofs to help lower insurance claims and cut back on reinsurance cost.

Efforts to rescue people affected by the earthquake were hindered because flash floods had affected the Nangarhar province of Afghanistan, which borders Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.
Flash floods in Texas killed more than 100 people in July 2025.
So, were the 2025 floods worse than in previous years?
The result was a surge in flash floods – where overwhelming water meets inflexible design – turning sudden downpours into city-wide disasters,” Bhattarai said.","Devastating floods ravaged multiple regions of the world in 2025, from Southeast Asia to North America and the Middle East.

We asked climate experts what is causing the devastation and what governments should be doing to prevent the situation from becoming even worse in the coming year.

Which places were worst hit by floods in 2025?

“Throughout 2025, a series of major floods occurred worldwide, making flooding the year’s foremost climate hazard,” Pawan Bhattarai, assistant professor at the civil engineering department of Nepal’s Kathmandu-based Tribhuvan University, told Al Jazeera.

Here is a recap of some of the major floods that took place.

Gaza

Heavy downpours and freezing temperatures continue to ravage Gaza, where nearly 2 million people have been displaced during two years of Israeli bombardment that has destroyed much of the Strip.

Many people in Gaza are living in tents amidst rubble from destroyed homes and are largely unprotected from the strong winds and rain.

On Saturday, a polar low-pressure weather system carried particularly heavy rain and strong winds to the Gaza Strip. According to meteorologist Laith al-Allami, this is the third such system to affect the territory in the past few weeks, with a fourth which hit on Monday, Anadolu Agency reported.

One of the previous two was Storm Byron, which brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to Gaza as well as parts of Israel and the wider eastern Mediterranean region earlier this month.

Israel was placed on high alert for that storm – halting military leave, reinforcing emergency teams and safeguarding power supplies. But the UN said 55,000 Palestinian households in Israel lacking basic services and government support were left exposed.

At least 14 Palestinians in Gaza were killed in the storm, and several were injured. Among the victims was a newborn baby in al-Mawasi, who succumbed to freezing temperatures.

Morocco

Earlier this month, Morocco launched a nationwide emergency relief operation to support people affected by severe flooding as the country battled freezing conditions, torrential rains and snowstorms.

Flash floods killed at least 37 people and damaged about 70 homes and shops in the town of Safi, 300km (186 miles) south of the capital, Rabat.

Prosecutors are investigating whether shortcomings in infrastructure, such as poor drainage, played a role in the disaster.

Indonesia

Floods hit Indonesia in December, killing at least 961 people in Aceh, North Sumatra and West Sumatra. More than 20 villages across the ‍three provinces were completely swept away by the floods.

Homes, rice fields, dams and bridges were destroyed, leaving many areas inaccessible.

Illegal logging – often linked to the global demand for palm oil – along with forest loss due to mining, plantations and fires, both exacerbated the disaster in Sumatra.

Flooding was also reported in neighbouring Malaysia around the same time.

Thailand

At least 276 people have been killed in flooding in Thailand in December. The floods badly affected eight provinces in the central plains, four in the south and two in the north, according to the Thai Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation.

Sri Lanka

In late November, floods and landslides killed at least 56 people as Cyclone Ditwah, a deadly tropical storm, swept across Sri Lanka.

The heavy downpour which accompanied the storm destroyed four houses and damaged more than 600. It also caused trees and mud to fall and block multiple roads and railway lines.

Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who took office in September 2024, inherited painful austerity measures imposed by his predecessor, Ranil Wickremesinghe, as part of a bailout loan package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), hampering rescue efforts.

“The storm poses a significant challenge to the government that is just beginning to address the social and economic concerns of the people,” Ahilan Kadirgamar, a senior lecturer at the department of sociology, University of Jaffna in Sri Lanka, told Al Jazeera in November.

Nepal

In October, severe floods and landslides hit parts of Nepal and India’s eastern Himalayan city of Darjeeling, killing at least 50 people.

This year’s rainfall was not record-breaking – overall, there was actually slightly less rain than in 2024, when the Kathmandu Valley saw its heaviest downpour since 2002. In the capital Kathmandu, some districts received just more than 145 mm of rain this year, compared with about 240 mm in late September 2024.

Damage was severe, however, because of “ultra-localised”, heavy rains.

The floods came one month after Nepal’s “Gen Z” protests in Kathmandu and other cities against corruption and nepotism. The protests prompted the deployment of the military and, ultimately, the resignation of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and his replacement by former Chief Justice Sushila Karki, 73, as interim PM.

While experts praised Karki for her interim government’s prompt early weather warnings before the flooding, widespread damage to critical infrastructure during the protests hindered rebuilding and relief operations.

“To prevent future disasters, a major shift in policy and practice is urgently needed. This must prioritise comprehensive watershed management, focusing on stabilising slopes and managing water run-off, which has been a persistently neglected area in our current approach to disaster risk reduction,” Bhattarai, the engineering professor, told Al Jazeera at the time.

Mexico

In October, floods hit Mexico, killing at least 66 people. Tropical storms caused flooding in five states in the country: Veracruz, Puebla, Hidalgo, Queretaro and San Luis Potosi.

More than 16,000 homes around the country were damaged.

Pakistan

Between June and August, several regions of Pakistan experienced flooding triggered by torrential rains. More than 700 people were killed around the country.

Floods devastated the Buner district in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and the southern city of Karachi also suffered major flooding caused by high-intensity rains over a short period of time.

Rainfall continued in Pakistan and neighbouring countries until late August, and floods prompted the evacuation of 500,000 people in the Punjab province.

On August 31, a magnitude-6 earthquake hit Afghanistan near its border with Pakistan, killing more than 1,400 people, according to the government. Efforts to rescue people affected by the earthquake were hindered because flash floods had affected the Nangarhar province of Afghanistan, which borders Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

United States

As of last week, more than 40 million Americans had been placed under winter storm warnings or weather advisories. Another 30 million have been alerted to flood or storm advisories in California, where a so-called “atmospheric river” has brought a deluge of rain.

An atmospheric river is a long, narrow band of air in the atmosphere that carries large amounts of water vapour.

Last week, thousands of flights in the US were cancelled because of winter storm Devin, which caused blizzards in the Midwest and northeast and heavy snow forecasts across parts of both regions.

Earlier in the year, several US states, including Texas, West Virginia, New Mexico and New Jersey, were hit by flash floods – sudden and rapid flooding of low-lying areas – in July.

These floods were mostly caused by heavy rainfall over a short period of time.

Flash floods in Texas killed more than 100 people in July 2025. Within two hours of flooding, the Guadalupe River breached its banks, with waters rising higher than two-storey buildings to about 9 metres (30ft).

Twenty-five girls and two counsellors were killed, and other people went missing when the floods hit the riverside Camp Mystic, a private Christian summer camp for girls.

The river has previously experienced major floods in 1936, 1952, 1972, 1973, 1978, 1987, 1991 and 1997, according to a guide prepared by the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority, a Texas state agency dedicated to conserving the water resources of the river basin.

The 1987 deluge was particularly disastrous and also hit a summer camp, killing 10 teenagers at the Pot O’ Gold Christian Camp near Comfort, Texas, according to local media. But the National Weather Service (NWS) said in July this year, the Guadalupe River rose beyond 1987 levels.

So, were the 2025 floods worse than in previous years?

In some places, yes.

In the US, for example, flooding does appear to have worsened steadily for the past few years. The period between January and September 2025 saw the highest number of flood and flash flood events and the highest number of associated human casualties in five years, Nasir Gharaibeh, a civil and environmental engineering professor at Texas A&M University, told Al Jazeera.

From January to September, there were 7,074 floods in the US, which caused 242 deaths, according to the Storm Events Database, which is managed by the US National Weather Service (NWS) of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

For the same period last year, there were 6,551 floods, which resulted in 151 deaths. In 2023, there were 5,783 floods, which caused 93 deaths for the same period. In 2022, 4,548 floods caused 102 deaths.

However, experts said that in other regions in the world, 2025 was not much worse than previous years.

“There have been equally dramatic years in South Asia and East Asia,” Daanish Mustafa, a professor in critical geography at King’s College, London, told Al Jazeera.

“Nowhere did I hear that any flood flow record was broken. It’s just that flood plains were more urbanised, rivers more regulated, where the regulatory infrastructure failed, as in Sri Lanka and India,” said Mustafa.

Why were floods so severe in 2025?

Flooding was worsened by a variety of factors in 2025, experts told us throughout the year. “Flooding is a complex hazard. It occurs because of interactions between many variables related to weather, infrastructure, land cover and topography and other factors,” Gharaibeh said.

Climate change is a major factor in causing weather events, researchers say. “The specific triggers varied from city to city in 2025, yet a single, universal force magnified them all: Climate change, which supercharges rainfall extremes,” said Bhattarai.

Climate change is causing monsoon rains to intensify, for example, resulting in more frequent extreme precipitation events. This is because rising temperatures cause the atmosphere to hold more moisture, leading to heavier downpours during storms.

In northern Pakistan, these higher temperatures are also accelerating glacial melting, which increases the likelihood of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs).

Furthermore, Abdullah Ansari, a research professor at the Earthquake Monitoring Center at Sultan Qaboos University in Muscat, Oman, told Al Jazeera, “research has shown that seasonal rains and weather conditions can intensify earthquake-induced vulnerabilities by triggering landslides, damaging access routes and disrupting communication lines.”

“The year was further distinguished by unusual patterns, including late-season monsoon floods, rare cyclonic activity, and extreme rainfall in regions not traditionally prone to flooding,” Bhattarai said.

But climate change is not the full story.

“This global driver met a local vulnerability: Urban landscapes fundamentally unequipped for the new reality. The result was a surge in flash floods – where overwhelming water meets inflexible design – turning sudden downpours into city-wide disasters,” Bhattarai said.

“While climate change plays a critical role in intensifying flooding events in Pakistan, other factors such as urbanisation, deforestation, inadequate infrastructure, and poor river management also contribute significantly,” Ayyoob Sharifi, a professor and urban scientist at Hiroshima University in Japan, told Al Jazeera in August.

Additionally, a lack of adequate drainage systems and early warning systems can exacerbate the effects of flooding.

A rise in the number of flash floods has also caused greater damage.

“In the US, we are seeing a higher number of flood-related casualties, in part due to an increase in rainfall-induced flash flooding,” Gharaibeh told Al Jazeera.

“Flash floods often occur with little warning, and the flood water flows with high velocities and destructive force, making them among the most dangerous natural hazards,” he added, explaining that the level of danger is measured by the ratio of deaths to people affected.

Overall, Bhattarai described the catastrophic flooding of 2025 as “a collision of intense meteorological events and long-term human decisions”.

“On the weather side, the primary drivers have been cloudbursts and stalled rain systems. These phenomena deliver short-duration, high-intensity rainfall, resulting in record daily rainfall totals that overwhelm drainage systems in a matter of hours.”

But human development has dramatically amplified the damage caused by floods, he said.

“Decades of river encroachment and floodplains converted into urban land have eliminated nature’s safety buffers. Rivers, now constricted and unable to spread out, surge with greater force and speed into populated areas that were once natural absorption zones.

“Essentially, we have built cities in the path of the water and then removed all its escape routes, turning heavy rain into disastrous floods.”

How can we improve flood responses in future?

Experts say governments will have to adapt to new weather patterns, which are resulting in more frequent and intense rainfall and flooding – and will have to change their approach to surviving floods.

Mustafa said: “Societies are continuing on their path of trying to fight floods, regulate rivers and build obstructive infrastructure in flood plains. All of these efforts have always failed and caused destruction and always will. But I fear the societies will continue apace.

“Don’t try to fight floods; learn to live with them. Don’t try to control and restrict river flows, give rivers room to flow,” he advised.

“Societies can and have engineered away high-frequency, low-intensity events. But in the process, they’ve made low-frequency, high-intensity events much worse. And this is particularly destructive in the climate change present, where all of your historical patterns, which are the basis of infrastructural design, are meaningless.”

Mustafa explained that infrastructure such as dams, levees and barrages are built to handle floods of a certain size and frequency.

He explained that these are built for 100-, 500- or 1,000-year events, meaning events with 1 percent, 0.5 percent or 0.1 percent chance of recurrence in any given year, respectively. He added that most infrastructure is designed for 100-year events.

Engineers use records of natural disasters to build this infrastructure.

“Assumption is that historical trends will continue into the future. With climate change, that assumption doesn’t hold,” Mustafa said.

Bhattarai said the 2025 floods underscored the need for faster, community-focused responses with clear local warnings, stronger coordination, urban-specific plans, protection of vulnerable groups and safer rebuilding that reduces future flood risks.

Gharaibeh said appropriate solutions will vary, depending on which part of the world is experiencing the flooding.

“Some parts of the world should start investing in their flood control infrastructure, including roadway systems, where roads are used as ‘drainage channels’. Other parts of the world should invest in building better warning systems.”

Gharaibeh explained that since funding is usually limited, controlling floods requires prioritisation of investment.

“Countries like the United States and Japan, for example, have built – and continue to build – robust flood control infrastructure because they have a long history of flooding issues.”

Even so, recent flash flood events, such as the flood that affected Texas in 2025, indicate that countries like the US should invest more in building better warning systems.

“On the other hand, Middle Eastern countries, for example, appear to lack the necessary infrastructure to control flooding. These countries should start investing in their flood control infrastructure.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25335400418516-1767005775.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-12-31 07:59:11.513751

The state's move away from coal power and the use of cleaner vehicles are major factors in the improvement.

Despite air quality gains, some groups express concern over environmental agency budget and staffing cuts.

In a year when federal ""forever chemical"" regulations took a step backward and protections for isolated and semi-dry wetlands were watered down by Republicans in both Washington and Raleigh, finding positive North Carolina environmental news in 2025 might not seem easy.

But in December the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality said there's one reason Tar Heel residents should breathe a little easier.

State regulators announced that air quality in North Carolina is now the cleanest it's been in decades, continuing a decades-long trend of improving conditions.

“Even as our population and economy continue to grow, North Carolina’s air quality keeps getting better and better,” said DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson. “By controlling air pollution, we are giving every North Carolinian a cleaner, healthier future.”

According to the latest update to the state's ""Air Quality in North Carolina"" report, statewide emissions of carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide, in particular, reached all-time lows in 2022, the latest year for which data are available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The report states that between 1990 and 2022, emissions fell 95% for sulfur dioxide, 74% for carbon monoxide, 48% for fine particles, and 67% for volatile organic compounds.

Overall, from 2005 to 2020, North Carolina reduced its gross and net greenhouse gas emissions by 28% and 38%, respectively. During this same period, the state’s population and real gross economic output grew by 20% and 23%, respectively, according to the air report.

Poor air quality is a major cause of asthma and can also exacerbate a host of other health problems, including contributing to heart and lung conditions.

Officials credit North Carolina's move away from coal-fired power plants as a major contributor to the air quality improvements, as well as ""cleaner"" vehicles and trucks hitting the state's roads.

But some groups say the overall trend for North Carolina when it comes to protecting and enhancing the environment isn't heading in the right direction.

According to the Environmental Integrity Project, from 2010 to 2024, N.C. environmental regulators suffered the largest staffing cuts, by percentage, of any state environmental agency in the U.S., losing nearly a third of its staff, or 386 jobs. State lawmakers and governors slashed the agency’s annual budget by 32%, shrinking the department's budget from $159 million to $108 million, when adjusted for inflation.

In its report, the group especially focused on poultry and hog factory farms in Eastern North Carolina and the sheer amount of waste these operations create.

Drew Ball with the Natural Resources Defense Council said he’s especially worried about the state’s low-lying communities like Wilmington and Fayetteville because everything flows downstream.

“We need to think a lot harder about keeping track of potential pollution and what it could mean for downstream communities,” he said.

One message was clear: American energy workers are hurting from the slow permitting processes.
This was a parting gift to left-wing environmentalists, not Louisiana workers and families.
President Trump also signed an Executive Order in April to restore competitiveness to the American seafood industry and strengthen U.S. fishing.","Before the sun even rises, people are hard at work every day in South Louisiana—from the energy worker in Houma checking equipment and reviewing safety logs to the shrimper pushing off from the docks. They keep our lights on, our restaurants full, and our economy strong. My job is to keep that rhythm alive by supporting Louisiana fishermen and offshore energy workers—making life better for the men and women who rise before dawn to keep our state prosperous. That is my goal, and that is President Trump’s goal.

In President Trump’s Working Families Tax Cuts bill, we expanded offshore lease sales for the next 15 years. Through GOMESA—a law which shares federal oil and gas revenues from the Gulf of America with Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas, as well as Louisiana—I worked to make sure our state got more than our fair share. Because of that work and President Trump’s partnership, Louisiana will now receive an extra $46 million per year for coastal restoration. You can’t fish or produce energy without a healthy coast—something families from Lafourche to Vermilion Parish understand firsthand. I’ve spoken to energy workers in Louisiana. In May, President Trump invited me to join him at the White House as he discussed the incredible investments pouring into America that will benefit Louisiana, energy independence, and the families and workers who power this country.

This year, I also hosted an energy summit in New Orleans to talk about the future of energy in our state. One message was clear: American energy workers are hurting from the slow permitting processes. So, I introduced the REPAIR Act to make sure energy, manufacturing, and infrastructure projects aren’t held up by frivolous lawsuits after permits are already approved. This bill makes the review process faster, sets up a way for developers and agencies to work out issues directly, and helps projects move forward quickly. Otherwise, we’re wasting taxpayer dollars and hurting workers still recovering from President Biden’s war on American energy.

Just before he left office, President Biden delivered one final blow by banning new domestic offshore oil and gas exploration, threatening thousands of jobs. This was a parting gift to left-wing environmentalists, not Louisiana workers and families.

Under President Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, the difference is night and day. On day one, President Trump and Republicans promised to unleash

American energy. We delivered. For the first time in years, we held a massive offshore lease sale in New Orleans. Not to mention, the Trump Administration’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management already announced a second one. This is a direct result of my work with President Trump on his Working Families Tax Cuts bill. It will unlock 80 million acres in the Gulf, lower energy costs, and create good-paying jobs that support households throughout Lafayette and the greater Acadiana region.

President Trump also signed an Executive Order in April to restore competitiveness to the American seafood industry and strengthen U.S. fishing. People come from all over to try Louisiana gumbo, jambalaya, and shrimp and grits. That’s because our shrimpers and catfish farmers meet high standards. I introduced legislation to protect Louisiana’s shrimpers and fishermen against India’s dumping of cheap shrimp and produce into U.S. markets. I’ve discussed these concerns with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and worked for years to level the playing field for Louisiana seafood jobs. That work includes negotiating hundreds of millions for the Morganza to the Gulf levee protection project.

Louisianans know natural disasters all too well. Our coastal communities have taken a beating. We have the will to rebuild, but rebuilding takes resources. Through my work on the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, I delivered $11 billion of federal funding back to our state—$3.5 billion for coastal and mitigation projects. Tens of millions are going to South Louisiana to fix crumbling roads and broken bridges—think the Robinson Canal Bridge, Ducros Road, and Bayou Blue sidewalks.

The Bayou’s strong workforce is doing an incredible job. I’ve met with many of them—folks from SLEMCO—who get the lights back on quickly after the power goes out. Hard work like theirs gives families another reason to come to Louisiana and stay. As you are doing everything you can to make our state better—and you are succeeding—I am working every day to make life in Louisiana better. You should have money left over after the bills are paid, safe roads to drive on, and confidence your job is supported.

Louisiana is a great success story, and you are at the heart of it. Let’s keep the Gulf open, the jobs coming, and our communities protected for generations to come.","https://www.shreveporttimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/09/NPPS/87685419007-bill-cassidy.jpeg?crop=198,112,x0,y70&width=198&height=112&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-31 11:00:05.617384

By Conducting Ions: Solid-state lithium-ion batteries, solid-state sodium-ion batteries, etc.","SMM December 31:

Key Points: China's first national standard for automotive solid-state batteries, ""Electric Vehicles—Solid-State Battery—Part 1: Terminology and Classification,"" was released for public comment on December 30, 2025. The standard clearly categorizes batteries into three types: liquid, hybrid liquid-solid, and solid-state, eliminating the term ""semi-solid-state."" It sets a mass loss rate of ≤0.5% as the core criterion for defining solid-state batteries. This move aims to unify industry standards, end conceptual confusion, and marks a step toward standardized industrial development.

On December 30, 2025, the National Automotive Standardization Technical Committee solicited public comments on ""Electric Vehicles—Solid-State Battery—Part 1: Terminology and Classification."" As China's first national standard for automotive solid-state batteries, this initiative is regarded as a key milestone in transitioning this cutting-edge technology from the laboratory to industrial collaboration. It aims to resolve market conceptual ambiguities and lay the foundation for standardized industry development. The concurrent ""Technical Specification for Solid Electrolytes Used in Electric Vehicle Solid-State Batteries"" is currently in the drafting stage.

I. Core of the Standard: Unified Classification and Stringent Technical Thresholds

The draft focuses on establishing a unified technical terminology system and setting clear quantitative criteria for defining ""solid-state batteries.""

Clear Three-Type Classification, Eliminating ""Semi-Solid-State"": Based on the method of ion transport within the cell, the standard categorizes batteries into liquid batteries, hybrid liquid-solid batteries, and solid-state batteries. This means the previously commonly used term ""semi-solid-state battery"" is not included in the national standard system, and related products will be classified as ""hybrid liquid-solid batteries.""

Establishment of Key Criterion: The standard sets a strict core quantitative indicator for defining ""solid-state batteries""—the mass loss rate. It stipulates that the mass loss rate (mass loss of electrolytes and other components under specific test conditions) for solid-state batteries should not exceed 0.5%. This threshold is stricter than the group standard ""All-Solid-State Battery Determination Method"" released in May 2025 (mass loss rate <1%). The basis for this requirement is consideration of potential minor decomposition of solid electrolyte materials, and industry validation tests show that compliant products have mass loss rates below 0.5%.

Multi-Dimensional Classification System: The standard further classifies solid-state batteries along three dimensions:

By Electrolyte Type: Sulphide-, oxide-, polymer-, halide-, and composite electrolyte-based solid-state batteries.

By Conducting Ions: Solid-state lithium-ion batteries, solid-state sodium-ion batteries, etc.

By Application Field: High-energy type, high-power type, etc.

II. Standard System Planning: Building a Comprehensive Industrial Framework

The ""Terminology and Classification"" draft is only the first step in a series of national standards. According to the plan, the ""Electric Vehicles—Solid-State Battery"" series is divided into four parts:

Part 1: Terminology and Classification (current draft)

Part 2: Performance Specifications

Part 3: Safety Specifications

Part 4: Life Specifications

Additionally, the supporting ""Technical Specification for Solid Electrolytes Used in Electric Vehicle Solid-State Batteries"" has entered the drafting stage, indicating that standardization efforts are extending to core materials.

The introduction of standards means the industry now has relatively unified and standardized guidelines for enterprises and practitioners to follow, aiming to end conceptual confusion, unify technical standards, facilitate industry chain collaboration, and seize international rule-making influence.",https://imgqn.smm.cn/news/cmpfN20220406172203.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 10:58:41.426110

The end of 2025 may also signal the end of the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations.","This year was a big one for Canary Media. Our merger with the Energy News Network brought new reporters into the mix, expanding our focus on state and local clean energy policy and progress.

We sure needed the extra manpower to cover everything that 2025 brought. President Donald Trump shook up the clean energy landscape as soon as he entered the White House, taking particular aim at offshore wind and EVs. Worries about rising power demand from data centers reached a fever pitch. And startups boasted major breakthroughs in cleaning up manufacturing, decarbonizing home heating, and bringing battery storage to the masses.

That’s just a handful of the many, many topics Canary Media reporters covered this year through more than 600 stories. Here are 11 that you can’t miss, in chronological order.

Jeff St. John started 2025 with a deep dive into what became one of the year’s hottest energy topics: data centers. In this first installment of a four-part series, Jeff explored the growing concern over AI data centers’ capacity to drive power demand to new heights, and how utilities may use that rising demand to justify new fossil fuel construction. But with effective regulation and demand management, it doesn’t have to be that way.

Julian Spector turned his visit to Quaise Energy’s Texas testing grounds into a feast for the senses. Whirring contraptions, hand-warming heat, and the smell of toasted marshmallows: Those are just a few of the ways Julian described the experience of watching the startup blast through rock with an electromagnetic beam. It’s all in hopes of accessing deeper, hotter levels of the Earth for geothermal power generation.

Mayor Mondale Robinson has big clean energy dreams for his small rural town of Enfield, North Carolina, and shared them with Elizabeth Ouzts back in March. Residents of the largely Black, devastatingly poor town face massive winter energy bills, and Robinson envisions tackling them through a solar-plus-storage array that could help stabilize power costs — and a resilience hub that could teach residents about energy savings and keep them safe during emergencies.

In May, Canary Media joined fellow nonprofit newsrooms to report a series of stories on the growing clean energy workforce in rural America. That project took Kari Lydersen to Decatur, Illinois, which has been losing factory jobs for years. But a community college program is training a new generation of solar panel installers to change that dynamic, including Shawn Honorable, who’s planning to start a solar-powered hot dog stand called Buns on the Run.

Since the late 1800s, America’s network of hydroelectric dams has provided a steady, clean source of electricity. But their age is catching up with them, Alexander C. Kaufman reported in this deep dive. Nearly 450 dams across the country will need to be relicensed in the next decade, but many must make significant, costly upgrades to keep operating — and may opt to shut down instead.

The end of 2025 may also signal the end of the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations. Created under the Biden administration, the office was meant to be a federally backed launchpad for ambitious but unproven clean technologies. In a thoughtful obituary for OCED, Maria Gallucci recounts the office’s biggest wins, and how that all started crumbling on Day 1 of the Trump administration.

Cheez Whiz, notepaper, and beer all have one thing in common: They’re made with the help of gas-burning boilers. But if it’s up to AtmosZero, that’ll soon change. Alison F. Takemura took us on a tour of the Colorado factory where AtmosZero will soon start building steam-producing heat pumps, in hopes of decarbonizing all sorts of polluting processes.

Marissa Gillett didn’t make a lot of friends during her time leading Connecticut’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority. While consumer advocates heralded her assertive oversight, investor-owned utility regulators accused her of inappropriate, and even unlawful, bias. In an interview with Sarah Shemkus after she stepped down from PURA, Gillett didn’t back down from her ​“sustained, rigorous” approach, and called on other regulators to do the same.

Ohio has become a hot spot for anti-clean-energy rules, with more than three dozen counties outlawing utility-scale solar development in at least one of their townships. Richland County is among them, but in the new year, residents may reverse the ban. Kathiann M. Kowalski reports on how a group of local advocates secured a referendum on the decision made by just three county commissioners — and how they could inspire other Ohioans to do the same.

This fall, Dan McCarthy took us on a trip to Greece. Far from Athens and the iconic whitewashed buildings of the Cyclades islands is Western Macedonia, which remains the country’s energy-producing hub even as its coal plants and mines shutter. Solar farms have rapidly taken the fossil fuel’s place, but residents are frustrated that the region’s economy hasn’t kept up.

Our list closes with a story Clare Fieseler started following three years ago, at a time when Republican lawmakers didn’t have much to say about offshore wind. Since then, the industry has become a prime target for the Trump administration, and David Stevenson is a big reason why. Stevenson is a 75-year-old grandfather from Delaware who believes in climate change — but not in offshore wind’s ability to fight it. Through numerous conversations with Stevenson, Clare shares the winding tale of how his activism brought the fight against offshore to the highest levels of government.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/top-canary-articles-2025.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=dd58a4f62f67134904ea28bf9b04f7f8,N,,2025-12-31 04:12:34.985657

Although both companies will release annual sales figures soon, based on the latest reports, BYD has taken the lead and set a significant lead that makes it seem virtually impossible for Tesla to close the gap.

By the end of November, the Shenzhen-based company—which also makes plug-in hybrid vehicles—had sold more than two million fully electric vehicles, becoming the first company to surpass that figure. Tesla, on the other hand, sold slightly more than 1.2 million electric vehicles by the end of September.

The American manufacturer benefited in the third quarter from a surge related to the expiration of tax credits in the US, which prompted many buyers to rush to make purchases. Global shipments were up 7 percent year-over-year.

Although experts expect an increase in sales for Tesla in the fourth quarter, analysts are forecasting about 1.65 million for the full year of 2025. That would be a drop of about 8 percent compared to last year’s result. Sales were below expectations in North America (-33%), Europe (-34%), and, to a lesser extent, China (-10%). This is also a significantly lower annual forecast than BYD’s sales as of the end of November.

Tesla’s sales have been hit by an unexpected slowdown in the transition to electric vehicles, increased competition and the relationship between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Donald Trump during the presidential campaign. It tarnished the brand’s image and sparked protests and calls for a boycott. Sales have fallen sharply and continue to fall, especially in Europe.

The funding losses follow a shift in federal priorities in 2025 that froze or terminated dozens of grants tied to solar, energy efficiency, and climate equity programs. At the same time, federal and private capital has continued to flow into select sectors such as nuclear power and grid infrastructure, creating a clear divide between canceled and still-active investments.

Canceled vs. Active Clean-Energy Projects in Michigan

Canceled / Frozen Projects

Active / Moving Forward Projects

What the Split Reveals About Michigan’s Energy Strategy

The table highlights a key shift: projects branded explicitly around climate policy and equity were the most vulnerable, while investments tied to reliability, national security, and industrial capacity have largely survived.

Solar and efficiency programs — particularly those dependent on Environmental Protection Agency grants — suffered the deepest cuts. Michigan’s planned $156 million Solar for All rollout, which would have expanded rooftop and community solar in underserved areas, was halted alongside tribal solar programs and workforce initiatives that had already begun hiring and project planning.

At the manufacturing level, the loss of federal support derailed projects meant to rebuild domestic supply chains for energy-efficient construction and power transmission — including the Detroit-based LuxWall plant and TS Conductor’s high-capacity transmission line factory.

Nuclear and Grid Infrastructure Emerge as Winners

By contrast, nuclear energy has emerged as one of the clearest winners in Michigan’s evolving energy mix.

Federal backing for the Palisades nuclear facility — including a $1.5 billion loan to restart the plant and an additional $400 million commitment tied to new reactor development — underscores a broader national pivot toward always-on, carbon-free power capable of supporting industrial growth, electrification, and data-center demand.

Grid infrastructure projects have also remained active, driven less by climate policy and more by necessity. Rising electricity demand from AI data centers, EV charging, and advanced manufacturing has kept utilities focused on transmission upgrades, even as grant-funded manufacturing components were cut.

Policy Risk Now a Central Factor

The diverging outcomes underscore a new reality for Michigan businesses: federal policy risk is now a decisive factor in project viability.

Projects tied directly to climate equity and renewable deployment proved most exposed to abrupt funding reversals. Meanwhile, investments framed around grid reliability, energy security, and industrial competitiveness retained support.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has joined multistate legal challenges arguing that the grant terminations violate congressional authority. Even so, developers say the uncertainty alone has already altered investment decisions and slowed new announcements.

The Bigger Economic Impact

Michigan entered 2025 with one of the nation’s most ambitious clean-energy pipelines. The loss of $540 million in grants — and roughly $3 billion in related private investment — does not erase that progress, but it reshapes the trajectory.

Workforce pipelines tied to solar and efficiency are now under strain. Communities that planned around grant-funded projects face gaps. Manufacturers are reassessing whether Michigan remains the best location for climate-linked investments.

At the same time, nuclear energy, grid infrastructure, and select industrial projects are becoming the new anchors of Michigan’s energy economy — more politically durable, but narrower in scope.

Michigan’s Clean-Energy Crossroads

Michigan’s challenge heading into 2026 is no longer whether clean energy matters, but which kinds of clean energy can survive shifting federal priorities.

The state now faces a strategic decision: how to rebuild momentum in solar, efficiency, and workforce development while recognizing that future growth may depend more heavily on energy reliability, grid strength, and industrial resilience than on climate branding alone.",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Canceled-vs-active-clean-energy-projects-in-Michigan.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 15:00:03.594844

Our goal is straightforward: ensure that clean water and common sense go hand-in-hand.","For a decade now, farmers and ranchers have been calling for a clear “Waters of the United States” rule that respects our careful stewardship. For many of us, the definition of WOTUS isn’t a distant policy discussion — it’s personal.

The WOTUS rule determines how we manage our land, how we plan conservation work and how we keep our farms running without getting tangled in unclear regulations.

Clean water is essential for every farmer and rancher; we depend on it every day. That’s why we’re encouraged to see the new proposed rule from the Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers.

The proposal protects critical water resources while recognizing the work farmers do to care for the land. It is clear that the agencies are responding to concerns raised by farmers and bringing much-needed clarity to the rule.

Why It Matters

Farmers understand the importance of clean water. Our farms and our families depend on it. We rely on it for our crops, our livestock and our daily lives.

We spend countless hours putting conservation practices in place to protect our water sources and to improve the land we care for.

Clean water is part of every decision we make on the farm, from how we manage our soil to how we rotate our livestock on pastures and protect our streams.

But protecting water starts with clear and workable rules. When definitions stretch too far, ordinary farm activities can fall under burdensome and costly federal oversight.

That can turn routine work into a regulatory guessing game, slowing progress instead of supporting it. A practical WOTUS rule must balance environmental protection with the realities of farming.

Continued Leadership

The latest proposal shows movement toward the clarity farmers have been calling for. It reflects some of the concerns raised over the years and responds to the Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett v. EPA that federal agencies must rein in their regulatory overreach.

Farm Bureau has long called for consistent and fair guidelines surrounding the Clean Water Act. We are reviewing every detail of the new proposal and crafting comments that reflect the real-world challenges farmers and ranchers are facing. Our goal is straightforward: ensure that clean water and common sense go hand-in-hand.

We will continue to share farmers’ stories and remind policymakers that regulatory certainty is essential for long-term stewardship.

When the rules are clear and fair, farmers can keep doing what we do best — caring for the land and producing the food, fiber and renewable fuel American families depend on.",https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/7Hw8v1AKO1X9cSRkXukbSHXHZRM=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/OGI6ARPEYZBTJDX2WWBCYELCMI.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 10:00:13.935059

Between Supreme Court rewrites of familiar statutes, a moving target for PFAS obligations, extended methane deadlines, and Indiana’s new stormwater and water-pipeline rules, our regulated community spent 2025 chasing certainty.

What follows is a quick tour of this year’s highlights, and why planning, permitting, and litigation strategies all had to flex.

Clean Water Act

In March, the Supreme Court held that not all “limitations” under the CWA’s effluent-limitations provision must qualify as “effluent” limitations. City & Cnty. of San Francisco, California v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 604 U.S. 334, 344-346 (2025).

In plain English, our Supreme Court said an agency can’t write a permit that says “thou shalt never contribute to a water quality standard exceedance” and then blame the permittee for everything even upstream, not just what they discharge. This change could be helpful to look at what a permittee can control rather than the ambient condition of shared waters prior to discharge.

Clean Air Act

On June 18, the Court, in a consolidated case, issued two venue rulings that shape how and where EPA actions are litigated. First, for EPA v. Calumet Shreveport Refining, the Court confirmed that certain EPA actions, even if locally applicable, belong in the D.C. Circuit when EPA properly finds and publishes that the action is based on a determination of “nationwide scope or effect.”

The Court put forth a two-step inquiry for determining venue. Envtl. Prot. Agency v. Calumet Shreveport Ref., L.L.C., 605 U.S. 609, 615 (2025). Second, in Oklahoma et al. v. EPA, the Court held that individual State Implementation Plan disapprovals are locally or regionally applicable actions reviewable in regional circuits, even if bundled in an omnibus Federal Register notice. Id., at 620. So, venue fights are now a threshold strategy call, not an afterthought, since some program decisions could be litigated in more than one venue with different odds of success.

National Environmental Protection Act

In May, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed the D.C. Circuit’s demand for expansive “upstream” and “downstream” analysis in the Uinta Basin Railway case. Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County held that NEPA doesn’t force agencies to chase the effects of separate projects, especially those outside their jurisdiction. 605 U.S. 168, 189-191 (2025). It also says that the potential for projects only related in time or use, related through a but-for causal relationship, or that are potentially foreseeable just isn’t enough to demand more analysis.

But the ultimate question here was not whether the Environmental Impact Statement in and of itself was inadequate, but whether appellate review of the reviewing board’s final decision was reasonable. So, while 2024 saw the overturning of Chevron deference, the Court here emphasized the high level of deference due to the NEPA-reviewing agency in judicial review.

Keep in mind that NEPA imposes no substantive constraints on a decision to build, fund, or approve a proposed project. An EIS “is only one input into an agency’s decision and does not itself require any particular substantive outcome,” such that “the adequacy of an EIS is relevant only to the question of whether an agency’s final decision … was reasonably explained.” Id., at 179-80.

PFAS

If PFAS felt like regulatory jazz this year, that’s because EPA has played variations on a theme of delay. The final national primary drinking water regulation (NPDWR) for six PFAS Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) took effect in June 2024, including for PFOA and PFOS. PFAS NPDWR, 89 FR 32,532-01 (Apr. 26, 2024).

But in May 2025, EPA said it would maintain those two but extend compliance deadlines and reconsider determinations for PFHxS, PFNA, and HFPO-DA (GenX), including the Hazard Index approach. Operators (and bond counsel) now are trying to time capital programs to evolving deadlines and constituents. Press Release, U.S. EPA, EPA Announces It Will Keep MCLs for PFOA, PFOS (May 14, 2025)

In May, EPA issued an interim final rule delaying the reporting window for Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) § 8(a)(7) one-time reporting and signaled it might reopen aspects of the 2023 rule. Then in November, EPA proposed certain exemptions along with timeline adjustments.

Many companies that built data systems for a “no-exemptions” world now must decide whether to keep collecting under a broad standard or to pivot to narrower proposed categories, with an eye to future changes and potential litigation. PFAS Data Reporting and Recordkeeping Under (DRRU) the TSCA; Change to Submission Period, 90 FR 20236-01, 90 Fed. Reg. 20,236 (May 13, 2025). PFAS DRRU TSCA; Revision to Regulation, 90 FR 50923-01 (Nov. 13, 2025). The net effect is that TSCA plans that were locked-in for Q1 became revise-as-you-go by Q4.

Oil and gas

For owners/operators under EPA’s New Source Performance Standards 40 C.F.R. pt. 60, subpart OOOOc for new crude oil and natural gas facilities since Dec. 2022, and Emissions Guidelines for existing facilities under subpart OOOOc, EPA first issued an interim final rule in July 2025 extending both the multiple compliance deadlines and the state-plan submittal deadline and also delaying the Super-Emitter Program.

In December, EPA finalized the extension and set certain monitoring/reporting dates.

Indiana stormwater preemption

Indiana’s new HEA 1037 (Pub. L. 150) says local units may not adopt stormwater laws, rules, ordinances or regulations more stringent than IDEM’s Construction Stormwater General Permit (CSGP), that any such provision is void, and a unit must discharge its duties under the state program.

The May 1 law adding Ind. Code §36-1-3-14 also authorizes warnings and stop-work orders for potential and ongoing violations. Love it or not, designs and enforcement now meet a single statewide baseline instead of having local rule. (Ind. Gen. Assemb., 2025 Reg. Sess., H.B. 1037 (Public Law 150). Make sure you check bid specs and local manuals for anything exceeding a CSGP, including financial assurances, post-construction drainage reports, dust/sediment controls, etc.

Indiana water pipelines

This new law matters for utilities, large economic development and communities wary of interbasin water transfers, such as for the Lebanon LEAP development. The idea here is to make big water moves happen only with statewide eyes on reliability, hydrology and rate impacts.

Indiana’s SEA 4 (Pub. L. 99), effective July 1, 2025, does three big things: defines “long-haul water pipelines” and requires that a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity be issued by the IURC before construction; triggers transfer permits for qualifying interbasin transfers through the Indiana DNR, evaluating hydrologic sustainability and the “public interest;” and adds notice and recovery mechanisms (with some cost recovery) and clarifies agency roles.

The through-line for 2025 is simple: trying to manage uncertainty. For 2026, calendar your deadlines and extensions (and extensions to the extensions), write permits the statute actually authorizes (hopefully), litigate where it counts and when in doubt, add one more footnote.•

Some are struggling to replace lost jobs with new ones. Other folks are gainfully employed but see their real incomes being eroded by the rising costs of housing, health care, transportation, and other necessities.

Washington certainly needs to get its act together. State and local policymakers can also do more to provide the high-quality education and infrastructure needed to compete for tomorrow’s industries. But the primary drivers of a healthy economy are private, not public. And right now, too many of them are constrained, diverted, or blocked by unwise regulation.

These economic frictions — let’s call them choke points — keep existing businesses from growing and hiring, keep new businesses from starting, and keep producers and consumers from realizing the full benefits of competitive markets.

Rigid zoning and permitting delays, for example, continue to deter homebuilders from supplying enough housing stock to meet demand. Occupational licensing makes it unnecessarily expensive and time-consuming for North Carolinians to change careers or launch new enterprises. And outdated state laws limit competition among hospitals and health providers. As a result, North Carolina’s health care costs exceed those of many of our peers.

A recent report by The Charlotte Ledger spotlighted another painful choke point: car and truck prices. For decades, North Carolina law forbade automobile manufacturers from selling their products directly to their customers. Dealers insisted the result wasn’t a system rigged in their favor, since they compete intensely among themselves to sell vehicles and services to consumers.

If this were true, however, there’d be no need for such a law! If independent retailers deliver real value to motorists — a proposition that doesn’t strike me as implausible, actually — they can surely prove their worth in a fully competitive market in which consumers can choose how and from whom to purchase vehicles and services.

In 2019, the General Assembly loosened the automobile choke point, however slightly, by allowing Tesla to open five dealerships in North Carolina. Now that other new companies are entering the hybrid and electric-vehicle space, however, the Tesla exception no longer makes sense (and is vulnerable to legal challenge). Many states — including the likes of Virginia, Tennessee, and Florida — already allow all EV comers to sell directly.

North Carolina ought to join them. Indeed, I’d like to see our state eliminate the choke point entirely by repealing our dealer-franchising laws and allowing manufacturers of all vehicle classes to strike whatever distribution deals they wish. A radical suggestion? Not really. A 2022 poll found that 83% of North Carolinians favored “allowing North Carolina drivers to purchase a vehicle straight from the manufacturer, and to receive routine service and repairs on a vehicle from the manufacturer, without having to go through a dealership.”

A 2024 report for the US Department of Justice projected that eliminating artificial restrictions on car sales wouldn’t just put downward pressure on prices. “Perhaps the most obvious benefit,” wrote Gerald Bodisch, an economist in DOJ’s Antitrust Division, “would be greater customer satisfaction, as auto producers better match production with consumer preferences ranging from basic attributes on standard models to meeting individual specifications for customized cars.”

As for dealer concerns about potential mistreatment, Bodisch concluded that “competition among auto manufacturers gives each manufacturer the incentive to refrain from opportunistic behavior and to work with its dealers to resolve any free-rider problems.”

“Consumers are used to the idea that they get to decide,” argued University of Michigan law professor Dan Crane. “That they get to figure out, ‘Do I prefer to bargain with a dealer on a lot or do I get to buy it directly from the manufacturer?’”

Whether in real estate, labor markets, health care, or consumer products, regulatory power ought to be used to promote transparency, combat fraud, and protect public health and safety. To go beyond these legitimate ends is to regulate too tightly. Time to loosen.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC_1737-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 01:57:35.581643

Analysis Shows Clean Energy Investments Dropped from $4.7 Billion Peak to Stagnation Under Trump Administration, Threatening Over 61,000 Good-Paying Jobs

View a recording of the release webinar here.

APPALACHIA — A new report released this month by ReImagine Appalachia reveals that 67% of the region’s 92,282 projected clean energy jobs — over 61,000 jobs — are now at risk following dramatic policy shifts under the Trump administration. “Tracking the Appalachian Impacts: What’s on the Line as Federal Funding Flatlines” documents how clean energy investments across Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky have flatlined after historic growth, threatening transformative economic opportunities in Appalachian communities.

The comprehensive analysis tracks quarterly data from 2018 through Q3 2025, examining both federal and private investments across three major categories: energy and industry deployment, clean energy manufacturing, and retail purchases of greenhouse gas-reducing technologies. The report shows that investments, which had tripled from 2021 to 2024, peaking at $4.7 billion in Q3 2024, have now stagnated, with energy and industry expenditures plummeting from $1.27 billion in Q3 2024 to just $445 million by Q3 2025.

The report also covers how Trump administration led changes to funding have impacted local projects, including the industrial efficiency projects at the Cleveland-Cliffs Corporation in Middletown, OH, workforce development programming led by Landforce in Pittsburgh, PA, long term delays to a coal to solar project in Nicholas County, WV, and impacts to the development of a battery manufacturing facility led by Sparkz Inc. in cooperation with the United Mine Workers of America in Taylor County, WV.

“The Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act brought unprecedented investment and job creation to communities across our region,” said Diana Polson, report co-author. “We documented $9.85 billion in energy and industry investments, $18.8 billion in clean energy manufacturing, and $22.3 billion in retail purchases of clean technologies since 2022. These were transforming our communities, creating good-paying jobs that don’t require college degrees. Now we’re watching those opportunities slip away as federal funding flatlines.”

Rike Rothenstein, report co-author, added: “The data tells a stark story. Clean energy manufacturing grew from nearly nothing in 2018 to substantial investments by 2023, with 72% going to battery manufacturing and 19% to zero-emissions vehicles. But the momentum has stopped. Federal clean energy investments waned dramatically as President Trump took office for his second term, and the proposed One Big Beautiful Bill Act threatens to dismantle remaining programs entirely. From a canceled furnace upgrade at Cleveland-Cliffs’ steel plant in Middletown, Ohio, to a stalled solar project on former mine land in Nicholas County, WV, our case studies show how these cuts impact our communities.”

“What’s particularly devastating is that the majority of threatened jobs are in construction and manufacturing, exactly the kind of blue-collar work our communities need,” said Dana Kuhnline, report co-author. “These investments were targeting places like Appalachia that have been left behind. The chaotic efforts to dismantle them will have particularly devastating impacts here, raising residential energy prices, sabotaging job creation, and ceding America’s leadership in clean energy to foreign competitors.”

Key findings from the report include:

Clean energy investments dropped from a peak of $4.7 billion in Q3 2024 to $3.8 billion in Q1 2025, with continued flatlining through Q3 2025

Energy and industry expenditures plummeted 65% from their peak, from $1.27 billion to $445 million

67% of projected clean energy jobs in the region (over 61,000 jobs) are now at risk

Federal funding decreased significantly as the Trump administration took office, reversing gains from historic climate legislation

National data from the Federal Reserve corroborates regional trends, showing private construction spending in manufacturing plateaued at $240 billion in mid-2024 after tripling from 2021

The analysis predicts that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) will raise residential energy prices, sabotage job creation, and cede America’s leadership in clean energy and manufacturing to foreign competitors, with Appalachian communities bearing the brunt of these impacts.

“In less than a year, we have seen the historic growth of the clean energy and manufacturing sectors drop to a flat line,” the report concludes. “Our region was set to create 92,282 jobs because of clean energy investments. Now those opportunities are vanishing before our eyes.”",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Appalachian-clean-energy-projects-canceled-Trump.png,N,,2025-12-31 00:57:24.657646

LITTLETON, Colorado, Dec 30 (Reuters) - For supporters of the energy transition, 2025 had plenty to complain about: the scrapping ‌of ​U.S. clean energy policies, wind droughts in Europe, corporate retreats from wind ‌power generation and a resurgence in coal-fired power output.

Yet there were also developments to celebrate, including record deployment of battery storage systems, historic power generation shares ​from solar farms in dozens of countries, and continued growth in electric vehicle sales in key car markets.

Below are eight charts that capture some of the key milestones and developments impacting global energy transition progress in 2025, as well as key data points ‍to track heading into 2026 and beyond.

CHINA'S GROWING CLEAN CLOUT

China remains ​at the forefront of clean energy generation, and deploys more nuclear, solar, wind and bioenergy power than any other nation.

Clean electricity production is on track to record its seventh consecutive year of strong growth. Over the first 11 months of 2025, ​total clean power output rose ⁠15.4% from a year earlier, Ember data shows.

Clean power sources will generate more than 40% of China's utility-supplied electricity for the first time in 2025, while fossil fuels' share will drop to a record low.

Fossil fuels remain the primary pillar of China's power system, but since 2019 clean power output has grown more than four times faster than fossil-fuel generation.

With Beijing set to keep expanding its solar, wind, nuclear and battery power capacity over the coming decade or so, clean power's share in China's generation mix is likely to keep climbing.

China is also making its mark overseas via record clean-technology exports, which climbed to more than $180 billion over the first 10 ‌months of 2025, according to customs data compiled by Ember.

Battery storage systems have emerged as China's most lucrative clean-tech export, with nearly $66 billion in sales, followed by around $54 billion in EV exports.

Exports of grid ​equipment ‌and heating and cooling units have also hit ‍record highs in 2025, cementing China's role as the ⁠dominant supplier of hardware for the world's electrification push.

U.S. SETBACK

In contrast to China's momentum, U.S. clean energy progress hit reverse in 2025 after federal support for renewables was scrapped under the second administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.

Steep cuts to tax credits for power developers are expected to slash clean energy investments in coming years and leave the U.S. power system heavily dependent on fossil fuels.

Natural gas remains the main source for U.S. electricity, but in 2025, coal-fired plants delivered the biggest jump in output, driven largely by a spike in gas prices that squeezed utility margins.

Coal-fired electricity output from January to November increased 13% from a year earlier, its highest in three years, according to Ember.

Because coal plants emit far more carbon dioxide than gas plants - over 900,000 metric tons of CO2 per terawatt hour versus about 550,000 tons for gas - U.S. power-sector emissions also climbed in 2025.

Total emissions from coal and gas plants reached 1.526 billion metric tons of CO2 from January to November, up 3% ​from the same period in 2024 and the highest since 2021, Ember data shows.

Given that U.S. natural gas prices look set to finish 2025 at roughly 50% above their 2024 average, utilities are likely to lean further on cheaper coal to meet winter demand.

That means even higher power-sector pollution heading into 2026 and beyond.

BATTERY BOOM AND STEALTHY PROGRESS

Even as U.S. utilities burned more coal in 2025, they also rolled out record battery storage capacity to capture surplus solar and wind power for later use.

Total U.S. installed battery storage capacity surpassed 39 gigawatts in 2025, a 43% increase from 2024, according to energy data portal Cleanview.

That surge is reshaping power flows in key electricity networks. Both California and Texas have added enough battery capacity to materially alter their power grid's generation mix during peak demand.

The California Independent System Operator (CAISO), the state's main grid and the country's largest battery adopter, uses batteries to supply around 15% to 18% of electricity during the evening peak demand, according to Grid Status data, reducing the need for gas and other power sources.

In the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), a more recent adopter of battery systems, around 3% of electricity during peak demand was supplied from battery storage systems - a modest share but up from near zero just a year ago.

Solar power systems have also made their mark again in 2025, generating record shares of utility electricity supplies in several countries.

China and the ​U.S. typically dominate discussions about solar capacity, but solar's widespread penetration in recent years now means that developed and emerging economies alike deploy the technology at scale.

At times in 2025, countries such as Bulgaria, Pakistan, Hungary and Poland sourced around 20% or more of their electricity from solar farms, cutting both costs and emissions.

In 2026, solar's generation share will likely set new records in even more countries, helping to keep global energy transition momentum alive even if some major economies, such as the U.S., step back.

The Richmond-based utility’s Dec. 23 lawsuit seeks to block the order for its $11.2 billion Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project.
Dominion estimated CVOW would begin generating electricity in early 2026, with enough energy to power approximately 660,000 residences.
Asked for comment on the ruling, Dominion spokesperson Jeremy Slayton said CVOW is essential to meeting customers’ needs.
Dominion Energy provides electricity to 3.6 million homes and businesses in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, and natural gas service to 500,000 customers in South Carolina, according to its website.","A hearing on Dominion Energy’s request to block the Trump administration’s stop-work order on all offshore wind projects will be held in mid-January, a federal judge ruled.

The administration announced on Dec. 22 it was pausing leases and halting work on five major offshore wind projects under construction along the east coast, citing national security concerns identified by the Pentagon. These include complaints that the movement of massive turbine blades and the highly reflective towers that support them can interfere with radar used to locate security threats.

The Richmond-based utility’s Dec. 23 lawsuit seeks to block the order for its $11.2 billion Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project. It’s the largest of the five affected projects, all of which were expected to enter commercial operation over the next two years.

Dominion estimated CVOW would begin generating electricity in early 2026, with enough energy to power approximately 660,000 residences. In its lawsuit filed, the utility described the administration’s stop-work order as “arbitrary and capricious.”

The utility has already received all federal, state and local approvals necessary for the construction and operation of CVOW, spending approximately $8.9 billion to date, according to the lawsuit. Customers are contributing to these costs.

The lawsuit claims the pause is causing “serious, irreparable harm” to the utility and its customers.

“Our nation is governed by laws, and a stable legal and regulatory environment is essential to allow regulated public utilities … to invest and support our nation’s energy needs and associated jobs,” Dominion argued. “Sudden and baseless withdrawal of regulatory approvals by government officials cannot be reconciled with the predictability needed to support the exceptionally large capital investments required for large-scale energy development projects like CVOW critical to domestic energy security.”

U.S. District Court Judge Jamar Walker was earlier scheduled to hear the case Dec. 29, but granted the administration’s request to delay the hearing until January.

The judge ordered U.S. Department of Justice lawyers to get “classified information” regarding the stop-work order to him by Jan. 9. The hearing will now take place on Jan. 16.

Asked for comment on the ruling, Dominion spokesperson Jeremy Slayton said CVOW is essential to meeting customers’ needs.

“Delaying the project will lead to increased costs for customers and threaten long-term grid reliability,” Slayton said. “Given the project’s critical importance, we have a responsibility to pursue every available avenue to deliver the project as quickly and at the lowest cost possible on behalf of our customers and the stability of the overall grid.”

The White House did not immediately respond to NC Newsline’s request for comment.

The Western Dilemma Western brands face an existential question: are you in the car‑selling business, or the margin‑maximizing business?","When news broke that Ford was discontinuing the F-150 Lightning due to uninspiring sales margins, I can’t remember the number of times I heard people say something to the effect that the Lightning wouldn’t have died if it were “more affordable.” Define “affordable” according to America.

Is it really about money?

How come the Nissan Versa and Chevrolet Traverse aren’t bestsellers, then? I started to believe the truth is America wants the best at the cost of the least. Am I correct?

Picture this: the next hot EV on social media has 0‑60 in the mid‑3s, a range north of 300 miles, and a minimalist interior. Critics call it “car‑of‑the‑year material.” But walk into a dealership and the price tag makes your eye twitch — $65,000, $70,000, even six figures once options and destination are added. Suddenly, that dream spec sheet reads like a rich person’s menu. And just like that, people don’t want it. Or at least claim they don’t.

The verdict: they actually do want the car, just not at that price. Snobbery or math? It can go either way and still hit home run.

Cars America Want vs. Cars They Can Afford

In market after market, EVs from traditional Western automakers are still priced well above what most consumers are willing (or able) to pay. According to the International Energy Agency’s 2025 Global EV Outlook, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in the U.S. are roughly 30% more expensive than equivalent internal combustion cars, and in Germany, the premium sits around 20% or more.

That’s a real number for a real problem: surveys consistently strike through ideology as a major reason auto shoppers hold off on EVs. It’s price. Always price. McKinsey’s consumer mobility survey noted that cost remains the top barrier to adoption, even as range anxiety and charging availability ebb.

So, people don’t hate EVs — they hate expensive EVs.

Enter China: Affordable EVs That Actually Sell

China’s automotive industry flipped the script in Detroit’s face. There, BEVs aren’t a budget premium. In many segments, they’re cheaper than gasoline cars. Let that sink in. And don’t just take our words for it: the IEA reports that close to two‑thirds of battery electric cars sold in China in 2024 were priced below their conventional equivalents, with a median paid price of around $24,000, translating to about $700 less than a typical combustion car.

There’s a market where electrification is an upscale choice, and then there’s one like China where it’s a value proposition.

Chinese consumers responded accordingly. In the first quarter of 2025, EVs accounted for over 40% of total automotive sales in China, including nearly 28% just from pure battery EVs.

And China isn’t just selling domestically. Across emerging markets like Thailand, Mexico, and Brazil, Chinese EVs are often the lowest‑priced option on the lot, helping electric vehicle uptake there grow faster than in many Western countries.

How does China do this? Here’s a few pebbles worth picking:

Vertical integration and battery cost leadership. Chinese firms like CATL supply around 40% of the world’s EV batteries, downstream to both Chinese brands and some Western ones.

Economies of scale and fierce domestic competition, which push prices relentlessly down.

Light EV segments thrive. Smaller city EVs (like the former Wuling Mini and BYD’s Dolphin) are priced under $16,000 in China, illustrating just how far budget EVs can go.

In Europe and the U.S., the picture looks dramatically different: very few EVs retail below $30,000; most sit firmly in the $40k–$60k bracket or higher, squeezed between battery costs, regulatory demands, dealer networks, and old‑school development budgets.

The Western Dilemma

Western brands face an existential question: are you in the car‑selling business, or the margin‑maximizing business? Until recently, the answer was both. Premium pricing boosted profitability, bolstered by a luxury brand halo and expensive SUVs. But what if that strategy is now limiting real market share?

That’s exactly what’s starting to happen. Chinese brands like BYD, Leapmotor, and others are rapidly expanding global reach, even planning factories in Spain and partnerships with legacy players like Stellantis — exactly because they get price‑value for customers.

Fact: people ‘love’ cars they can afford, with performance and features that match or beat expectations. If Western automakers want to win big, the narrative needs to shift:

Join us in shaping the future of Caribbean energy.","U.S. LNG exports have surged through 2025, with Latin America and the Caribbean emerging as major beneficiaries. Annual export data show shipments to the region climbed roughly 40% in 2024, led by Brazil at more than 110 billion cubic feet, while the Dominican Republic ranked among the top island importers. That momentum has carried into 2025, as utilities, power producers and governments increasingly rely on U.S. gas to stabilize grids, replace expensive fuel oil and support renewable integration. For Caribbean and Latin American markets – many grappling with high power costs and aging infrastructure – this flexible U.S. supply is reshaping investment timelines and opening new project opportunities.

At the same time, the U.S. surpassed the 10-million-ton mark in monthly LNG exports in late 2025 – a milestone reshaping energy planning across the Atlantic Basin. Much of the incremental supply is flowing into Caribbean and South American import terminals, where new regasification facilities, floating storage units, and gas-to-power plants are moving from proposal to bankable project pipelines. This shift is accelerating decision-making among utilities and independent power producers and highlighting where private capital can deploy effectively.

Concrete investment activity is confirming the trend. New Fortress Energy – a U.S.-based integrated LNG infrastructure developer – has executed a three-year charter agreement for the Energos Freeze floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) in the Dominican Republic, scheduled to begin operations in September 2025. This FSRU will provide crucial regasification services to support power generation and industrial demand, demonstrating the near-term utility of floating solutions where onshore facilities are limited.

Meanwhile, in Puerto Rico, New Fortress has reached a landmark long-term gas supply agreement with government authorities that would deliver up to 75 trillion BTU annually of LNG for seven years under contract terms currently under review by regulators. That volume can supply multiple power plants and accelerate plans to reduce dependency on heavier fuels, providing cleaner, more affordable energy for the island’s grid.

These developments demonstrate how import infrastructure – whether floating, modular or land-based – is unlocking private capital interest by creating anchor demand for gas volumes that otherwise would not materialize. For investors and developers, knowing where capacity is being contracted and where offtake certainty is improving is critical to underwriting projects.

Future infrastructure opportunities stretch beyond regasification capacity alone. As U.S. LNG exports sustain elevated levels, there is room for new storage hubs, pipeline extensions and gas-to-power facilities that can capitalize on contracted supply. Global LNG trade patterns suggest that diversified sources of supply provide resilience in volatile markets, and recent export growth trends point to sustained demand in the Western Hemisphere. For example, in February 2025 U.S. LNG deliveries to the region more than doubled compared with the previous month and included cargoes to Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Panama and Colombia, illustrating dynamic short-term flows that can be optimized by flexible infrastructure deployment.

This context will be a key thread at CEW 2026, where sessions focused on gas monetization, LNG hubs and midstream investment provide a forum for U.S. capital – including sponsors, infrastructure funds and energy transition investors – to engage directly with regional governments and Caribbean enterprises. Government delegations from across the Caribbean, alongside U.S. project financiers and LNG developers, will examine where partnerships can move most quickly from MoUs to final investment decisions. CEW’s agenda is designed to help stakeholders assess project bankability, understand regulatory environments and identify risk mitigation mechanisms that can catalyze funding for gas infrastructure.

With LNG export volumes rising, import capacity expanding and long-term offtake deals taking shape, the Caribbean and its neighbors are entering a new phase of energy infrastructure development. Aligning capital, policy and project pipelines at forums like CEW will be critical to turning these trends into investible opportunities that deliver both economic growth and energy security across the region.

Due to the area’s geography and climate, lithium extraction in the Salar de Atacama is relatively inexpensive compared to a lot of other places.
Water is limited in the Atacama Desert, and lithium extraction requires a great deal of water.","The Salar de Atacama, a vast desert lake in northern Chile, glitters with a white surface crust of salt under the Earth’s greatest glare of sunlight. Beneath it is lithium, “white gold.” With approximately 7.5 million metric tons of lithium hidden below its flats, it offers an opportunity to fuel an expanding electric age.

Lithium plays a key role in the clean energy future while straining scarce water resources

Desert lakes such as the Salar de Atacama don’t just represent barren salt flats. The brine trapped below the desert surface serves as a reservoir for concentrated lithium. Mining companies pump it from below the surface, evaporate it into ponds, and are left with lithium. Because of its extremely low precipitation and high evaporation, this is an effective and economical way to extract lithium.

However, this extraction comes at a price. Extracting lithium-rich brine requires vast amounts of water in one of the driest places on the planet, putting pressure on local ecosystems and Indigenous communities who depend on those scarce resources. Making the lithium industry sustainable and just remains an urgent challenge for Chile and the world.

Recent studies indicate that Chile’s salt flats contain approximately 28.3 million tons of lithium, with 7.5 million tons located in the Salar de Atacama. This vast resource has the potential to provide a large share of the lithium required for future electric vehicles, power wall batteries, and grid batteries, making the desert lake a key player in the global clean-energy transition.

Why this lithium buried deep in America’s heart matters for the electric era

Lithium is at the heart of battery technology used in electric vehicles, renewable energy storage, and portable electronics. As the world speeds towards decarbonization, global demand for lithium is soaring. Chile’s vast lithium reserves under the Atacama Desert lake place it in an important position in this transition.

Due to the area’s geography and climate, lithium extraction in the Salar de Atacama is relatively inexpensive compared to a lot of other places. The cost advantage has contributed to Chile being one of the main players globally in the lithium market, as this lithium-rich state could power the world for centuries.

Navigating the tensions between nature and human needs

However, this “white gold” isn’t free. Water is limited in the Atacama Desert, and lithium extraction requires a great deal of water. Pumping brine for extraction is competing for the limited groundwater in the area that local people rely on. This is raising significant concerns: wetlands and springs are stressed, and ecosystems, including their wildlife, such as flamingos, are at risk.

This dispute isn’t only environmental but also social. Indigenous people and small towns in the Atacama are worried that mining will drain the water that they depend on and damage their ancestral lands. Opponents argue that with the rush for lithium to feed the global green market, local communities will pay the price.

How using the sun to produce lithium can save energy, yet requires long-term planning

In addition, the mining companies claim that lithium from these desert lakes is comparatively ‘green’ to produce due to the fact that it relies on solar evaporation (thanks to the Atacama’s intense sun), which takes advantage of low energy demand as compared to more industrial mining efforts. Delivering on reduced environmental risks will require considered long-lead-time response planning.",https://www.eldiario24.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/1001451430-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 20:58:28.502999

The wireless charging lane will cover a 3/4-mile stretch in part of the first section.
Why Florida Is Experimenting With Dynamic Charging According to the U.S. Department of Energy, Florida is one of the fastest-growing EV markets in the country based on total vehicle registrations, second only behind California.
Technical and Policy Hurdles Facing Dynamic Charging Yet despite the momentum, there are formidable barriers.
If trucks are in the mix, freight operators will weigh whether dynamic charging shrinks battery requirements, boosts payload or enhances route economics.","Florida is advancing a highway segment that would let electric vehicles charge as they drive, the first such system to emerge in the U.S. and one that could upend transportation if officials are able to track its success. The Central Florida Expressway Authority will get started on the work in 2026 to construct the 3/4-mile inductive charging lane within State Road 516, and open the route up to motorists by 2029.

How the Wireless EV Charging Highway Works

Coils under the road will generate a magnetic field. Vehicles outfitted with receiver coils would then pick up that energy and transform it into electricity while driving, a process called dynamic wireless power transfer. Instead of charging that takes place at the curb or on a pad, power is transferred constantly over a section of pavement to avoid having to sit at chargers and potentially meaning smaller onboard batteries down the road.

It is no longer theoretical. Earlier this month Purdue University and the Indiana Department of Transportation tested a system that transferred 190 kilowatts to a semi-truck at 65 mph, power levels that would suffice for even heavy-duty tasks and are well more than what it would take to charge a typical passenger car traveling the highway. The architecture, Purdue researchers declare, is scalable between Class 8 trucks and compact EVs — given vehicles are outfitted with appropriate receivers.

Scope and Timeline in the Central Florida Region

The Florida test operates on the 4.4-mi (7-km) SR 516 Lake/Orange Expressway, which CFX is currently constructing in three sections. The wireless charging lane will cover a 3/4-mile stretch in part of the first section. The road will open to all vehicles after testing is complete, but initially only instrumented “specially equipped” cars will receive power as CFX and its technology suppliers prove out the system’s ability to perform safely and interoperably.

It’s not clear yet whether the pilot would favor trucks or passenger vehicles. Because trucks drive predictable routes and can provide clear total-cost-of-ownership data, many real-world tests have begun with commercial fleets. In France, a live section of highway is wirelessly charging trucks in partnership with Electreon, and Michigan’s Department of Transportation installed a quarter-mile test roadway open to the public in Detroit with the same company.

Why Florida Is Experimenting With Dynamic Charging

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, Florida is one of the fastest-growing EV markets in the country based on total vehicle registrations, second only behind California. But the rush to adopt is meeting some old obstacles: range anxiety on highways, peak-time traffic at fast chargers and grid limitations at popular locations. A highway that overcomes the bottleneck is one where charge is delivered as you drive, directly addressing these bottlenecks by smoothing out energy consumption and by reducing wear on stationary infrastructure.

Dynamic charging also happens to complement future autonomy. Vehicles that can drive themselves to a charge zone don’t need a driver to plug them in, and fleets — whether robotaxis or delivery vans or buses — could benefit from more time on the road. It is no accident that the auto and mobility sectors are looking at wireless charging more extensively; Tesla, for example, has openly discussed potential wireless pathways to power robotaxis in the future—demonstrating the operational benefits of cable-free energy transfer.

Technical and Policy Hurdles Facing Dynamic Charging

Yet despite the momentum, there are formidable barriers. Working coils into pavements requires a new construction technique, waterproofing challenges and planning for periodic repaving. The extreme heat and rain of Florida have added additional guidelines for durability. Utility operators will have to plan grid upgrades and smart controls to handle high draws, especially if more than one vehicle parks in the charging lane at once.

Cost is another swing factor. Industry estimates put the cost of dynamic charging infrastructure in the low millions of dollars per lane-mile, depending on power level and site condition. Policymakers will want to see clear metrics: cost per delivered kilowatt-hour, efficiency over time, maintenance requirements and pavement performance. From the standards perspective, SAE’s J2954 has provided a stepping stone toward light-duty wireless charging, and its cousin, J2954/2, aims to standardize a dynamic system—interoperability in this context is important to minimize vendor lock-in.

Finally, the project would have to reinforce—rather than replace—stationary fast charging. National-level programs like Australia’s National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure project concentrate on DC fast-charging stations on highways. If successful, Florida’s dynamic pilot would layer a new capability on top of that network, clipping peak loads and stretching usable range without compelling more frequent stops.

What Success Will Look Like for Florida’s Pilot

CFX and its partners will be examining whether vehicles do not drop their charge while cruising at highway speeds, whether energy transfer is optimal even during extreme rain events or high temperatures, and how pavement holds up to wear and tear without emitting dangerous substances through repairs that could cost more than standard asphalt.

If trucks are in the mix, freight operators will weigh whether dynamic charging shrinks battery requirements, boosts payload or enhances route economics.

If Florida’s 3/4-mile stretch proves out the model — and is made part of projects in Indiana, Michigan and Europe — it could open the door for longer segments on freight corridors and strategically targeted urban arterials. Now that the state has reliable data on performance, safety and cost, it could help to propel dynamic charging from pilot to playbook, transforming a short stretch of SR 516 into a map for next-generation EV infrastructure.",https://www.findarticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/featured_edited_1767135845-1024x585.png,N,,2025-12-30 20:58:47.425358

Critics say the cuts disproportionately benefit the wealthy and reduce needed state revenue to keep up with growth, while proponents believe the reduction attracts businesses and keeps the state competitive.

The reduction is part of a multi-year plan, approved by state legislators in 2021, with the tax rate gradually lowering each year through 2027. The rate was at 5.25% in 2021 before falling to 4.99% in 2022. It has continued on a steady decline to reach the new floor of 3.99% by Jan. 1, 2026, with the goal to eventually reach 2.49%.

For a single filer in Wilmington earning $50,000 annually, the new rate results in a savings of approximately $97 per year, or about $2 more per weekly paycheck. For higher-income earners who bring in about $200,000 per year, the rate change translates to about $1,000 saved annually.

Former Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) and other Republican legislators backed the plan to reduce tax rates in order to make North Carolina more competitive for businesses and workers, with residents keeping more of their income.

However, the timing of the latest cut has become a point of contention as the state continues to operate on a budget frozen at 2023 spending levels. The Office of State Budget and Management projects slower revenue growth tied in part to the rate cut, with overall collections reduced by roughly $823 million.

In their forecast, state economists cautioned, while revenue collection remains strong in the short term, “growth is expected to slow significantly,” noting the scheduled tax reductions put pressure on the state’s general fund. Although the state maintains healthy reserves, OSBM projects declining growth will limit the legislature’s ability to fund future state employee pay increases or expand services.

Still, the income tax rate has become a stumbling block in the latest budget negotiations, as House and Senate leaders remain divided on whether to pause future cuts.

As reported by WUNC, House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) has led a push to redirect a portion of the revenue intended for future tax cuts toward compensation, including a proposed 5% raise for state employees and teachers to address staffing shortages. By contrast, Sen. Berger maintained throughout the 2025 legislative session that honoring the scheduled tax reductions is a non-negotiable commitment to North Carolina’s business community.

Brian Balfour, vice president of research at the John Locke Foundation — a Raleigh-based think tank advocating for free markets and limited government — is in support of maintaining the tax rate cuts. He contends it will help maintain North Carolina’s stable tax environment, a factor cited by CNBC when ranking the state #1 for business for two consecutive years.

More so, Balfour said the state cannot afford to “stand still” while some regional neighbors move to eliminate taxes entirely.

“We have a somewhat unique situation regionally, with Florida and Tennessee having no state personal income tax,” Balfour told Port City Daily. “Georgia legislators this year began discussing a pathway to eliminating their personal income tax.”

By reaching the 3.99% threshold, Balfour believes North Carolina gains a competitive edge over South Carolina, which utilizes progressive tax brackets. Simply put, progressive systems tax higher levels of income at higher rates. In contrast, North Carolina’s flat tax treats every dollar the same, regardless of total income.

For example, a South Carolina resident earning $200,000 annually would pay a rate of 6.5% on a portion of their income, resulting in a tax bill of about $11,000. In North Carolina, the same earner would pay the flat rate on all of their income, resulting in about $8,000.

Essentially, with a 3.99% rate applying equally to all earners, a high-earning professional moving from South to North Carolina could see thousands of dollars in immediate annual savings in their income taxes.

To Balfour’s point, North Carolina may beat out South Carolina for a skilled worker, but for a professional weighing a job offer in Wilmington against one in Nashville, the lack of an income tax acts as a built-in signing bonus.

“If we don’t continue to push forward, we may end up getting passed by other states,” Balfour said, referring to corporations and businesses going elsewhere.

He also pointed to the long-term human impact of the tax reduction, noting in the decade following the 2013 tax cuts — which lowered income tax rates and shifted the state to a flat tax system — North Carolina reduced its poverty rate from 17.9% in 2013 to 12.8% in 2023; it was the fifth fastest rate drop in the nation behind Arizona, who uses progressive income taxes like South Carolina. From Balfour’s perspective, tax relief ultimately provides fuel for job creation and leads to increased consumer spending.

Alexandra Sirota, executive director of the North Carolina Budget & Tax Center, argues the flat rate disproportionately benefits the state’s highest earners while reducing North Carolina’s capacity to fund essential services.

Her analysis highlights the tax cuts enacted since 2018 have been enormous for the state’s highest earners, with the top 1% of North Carolinians — those with average annual incomes approaching $2 million — paying $4.9 billion less in combined state and federal taxes in 2026 than they would have under previous policies. Roughly $2 billion of projected tax savings for the top 1% comes from state tax cuts alone.

To visualize the scale, Sirota points out $4.9 billion is enough to fund the state’s entire annual contribution to the UNC System — which increased in-state tuition this fall — and is nearly enough to fund the state’s share of the Medicaid program, which costs about $5.5 billion annually. While the state expanded Medicaid in 2023 to cover hundreds of thousands of additional residents, Sirota explained the ongoing tax cuts reduce the state’s capacity to sustain its required share of the program as federal support scales back.

“The federal government is stepping away from their historic commitments to programs that help people get the care they need, leaving states scrambling to fill the gaps,” she noted. “For North Carolina, this means rising costs at the same time that state tax cuts slash our public revenue.”

A central argument against the timing of the cuts focuses on the “revenue triggers” — revenue benchmarks that activate the tax cuts. Under state law, tax rates only drop if the state hits specific targets. For the 2026 cut to take effect, annual revenue had to exceed $31.3 billion; it did and is projected to hit $34 billion.

In 2027, it has to reach $32.35 billion for the next cut to go into effect.

Sirota suggests the targets are flawed because they do not account for inflation. As the price of goods and services rose over the last few years due to inflation, the state’s sales tax collections increased accordingly and thus tax rate reductions were activated. The state is collecting well over its tax targets, bringing in roughly $33.5 billion in 2024 and projected to hit $34 billion in 2025.

The National Consumer Price Index — which measures costs of goods and services — has decreased from a peak of 9.2% in 2022 to 2.7% today. Inflation for the southern region of the country, including North Carolina, remains about 2.2%.

According to Sirota, the actual purchasing power of those dollars declined, meaning the revenue collected buys less than it would have in previous years and does less to support state funded services.

“Instead of funding child care, public education, and support for working families that will set future generations up for success, policymakers are focused on giving tax breaks to the wealthy and profitable corporations,” Sirota noted in her analysis.

As the new year begins, state legislators will look to have a completed budget by the June 30, 2026 deadline, with tax policy likely at the center of the debate.

New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal, the first offshore wind port in the country, and the heavy-lift deepwater port New London State Pier are signs that offshore wind is becoming a key driver of industrial development.
More recently, building trades unions on the East Coast participated in a national “Yes to Wind” week of action.
Trump’s attacks on offshore wind and other unionized clean energy projects have opened up political cleavages that building trades unions could creatively leverage beyond statements of opposition and press conferences.
We should listen to the building trades: offshore wind is both a critical energy source and job creator for the future.","Donald Trump’s obsessive hatred of wind energy has reared its ugly head again. On Monday, December 22, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced that all construction on offshore wind projects would be halted due to “national security concerns.” This will affect five offshore wind projects on the East Coast, some of which are already mostly completed. In an X post, Burgum called these projects “expensive, unreliable, heavily subsidized offshore wind farms.”

The move rests on supposed classified claims from the Department of War that these projects interfere with radar systems, but no solid evidence has been presented publicly. Just three days before this announcement, the Army Corps of Engineers had approved continued construction on Vineyard Wind, one of the projects that will now be paused. A few months ago, the Trump administration’s attempt to derail the Revolution Wind project in the name of national security was defeated in the courts. A coalition of anti-offshore-wind groups has been coordinating this offensive and supplying the administration with a slew of draft executive orders to use.

While Trump has gone on the attack, building trades unions have been rallying behind offshore wind development and have already experienced substantial job growth from it. This latest salvo has added to growing tensions between the administration and construction unions.

A statement from North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) said this move “kills thousands of good-paying jobs on projects that were legally permitted, fully vetted, fully funded, and already underway. These aren’t hypothetical jobs. They are real paychecks and billions in investment.”

The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) also spoke out and called the order “a direct attack on American workers. . . . Offshore wind projects represent thousands of good, union jobs for IBEW members who have spent years training to build and maintain this infrastructure.”

The Laborers’ International Union of North America (LIUNA) highlighted the disruptive nature of these stop-work orders, saying, “LIUNA members plan their life around this work. Pulling the plug now — during the holidays and after years of negotiations and extensive reviews — is reckless and unfair to the men and women who build this country.” They demanded that the administration “let us work — and stop playing politics with our jobs.”

The Potential of Offshore Wind

All five of the paused projects are on the East Coast, an ideal location for offshore wind development. The North Atlantic Coast in particular has the best conditions for the industry in the entire country. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that there is capacity to build 264 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind that could produce up to 27 percent of the United States’ annual electricity consumption by 2030.

This is why the building trades in New England have been especially proactive and supportive of the industry. Back in October 2023, these unions pushed a unique multistate procurement agreement for offshore wind that was signed by Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. This procurement was meant to help coordinate its development across the region and reduce costs in implementation. Unions worked with the Climate Jobs National Resource Center to craft a vision for building out the entire domestic supply chain including components, specialized ships, and transmission networks.

In October, Rhode Island AFL-CIO president Patrick Crowley announced that building trades unions in Rhode Island and Massachusetts signed a labor peace agreement with SouthCoast Wind to ensure union work on a massive 2.4 GW offshore wind project they have planned.

States throughout southern New England have already begun making substantial investments in port infrastructure directly tied to offshore wind development. New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal, the first offshore wind port in the country, and the heavy-lift deepwater port New London State Pier are signs that offshore wind is becoming a key driver of industrial development. Rhode Island’s Block Island Wind Farm has increased the demand for skilled workers at the Port of Providence and Quonset. This represents some of the few real examples of successful reindustrialization in the last decade.

More recently, building trades unions on the East Coast participated in a national “Yes to Wind” week of action. In Baltimore, IBEW Local 24 hosted a press conference at their union hall. The local’s political director, Rico Albacarys, says, “Offshore wind is a big deal for us locally.” Earlier this year, the local had the largest class for its training facility on record, and they see offshore wind as a prime growth sector for the future. Energy developer US Wind had plans to build a huge offshore wind hub off Maryland’s Eastern Shore that could power about 700,000 homes.

United Steelworkers union (USW) members would also get work retrofitting the Bethlehem Steel plant, once the largest steel production facility in the world. Jim Strong, a USW “offshore wind sector assistant,” spoke of the symbolic meaning of having workers back at the plant: “We had history and now we have a future with the return of steel workers here. So, this is a big deal for our union.”

But in August, the Trump administration pulled the $47 million federal grant for the US Wind project and is trying to revoke the federal permits. Now it lies in limbo as the dispute works its way through the courts.

In Maine, Iron Workers Local 7 member Chad Ward stressed the potential for local job creation:

A job in the offshore wind industry in Maine would mean I could see my kids grow up, and my kids could have the option of going into an industry that keeps them employed in Maine while also helping to do something good for the environment.

Trump’s attacks on offshore wind and other unionized clean energy projects have opened up political cleavages that building trades unions could creatively leverage beyond statements of opposition and press conferences. The administration would likely have a difficult time dealing with rowdy demonstrations from sympathetic construction workers and media appearances that give them an opportunity to present a compelling case for why these projects must stay. This is a time to emphasize the contradiction between the president’s pro-blue-collar rhetoric and his policies.

With wind gusts reaching 165 mph and more than 20 inches of rain falling in just three hours, the storm — equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane — was the strongest to hit Guam since 2002.

The impact was severe: uprooted trees, waist-deep flooding and widespread power outages that crippled both civilian infrastructure and critical U.S. military installations, including Naval Base Guam, Andersen Air Force Base and Marine Corps Base Camp Blaz.

We deployed an advanced echelon (ADVON) to Agana Heights to lead the installation and maintenance of more than 100 generators, ensuring power continuity for essential facilities. At the same time, Naval Facilities Engineering Systems Command (NAVFAC) Pacific engaged our power and energy and mission critical teams to rapidly develop long-term strategies to harden the island’s power systems against future extreme weather events.

Together, our teams carried out critical short-term emergency power response and long-term power system hardening planning in Guam, keeping the island’s communities safe and resilient today and prepared for tomorrow.

Rapid response in the wake of typhoon Mawar

In the face of the extreme weather impacts, we mobilized rapidly to provide short-term emergency power solutions. Under the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Advanced Contract Initiative for Temporary Emergency Power, we deployed a team that ultimately grew to 109 personnel, starting with six specialists who arrived 36 to 48 hours before landfall. Despite extreme heat, humidity and logistical challenges, including equipment delays and rugged terrain, the team installed 109 generators across the island, completing 69 replacements and scaling operations from three installations per day to ten.

These generators powered hospitals, water pumping stations, shelters, fire stations, warehouses and even postal facilities, restoring essential services to communities and military operations. Generators had to be manually rolled for over a mile through difficult terrain. Yet through disciplined Standard Operating Procedures and adaptive problem-solving, we maintained accountability for personnel and equipment throughout the deployment, completing 90 tasks for generator repairs and replenishments.

While recovery efforts from Mawar were still underway, our power and energy and mission critical groups, with teammates nearby in Hawaii and spread across continental US, were called upon to “harden” the island’s military water, wastewater, waterfront, power and vertical infrastructure against the next major natural disaster. Amidst evolving project deliverables while uncovering the extent of requirements and future needs, we provided trusted advisor services and conducted an island-wide electrical system analysis, rapid planning, stakeholder coordination, project scoping and siting, conceptual design and cost estimating a quick turnaround to secure congressional recovery funding as soon as possible following the crisis.

Our team had only two weeks to organize and mobilize our multidisciplinary response team — including electrical, civil, mechanical and instrumentation and controls (I&C) engineers; air quality experts; site safety and health leads; project coordinators — and several of our subcontractors.

Given the tight time frame and broad scope, our team on Guam developed work plans and budgets on the fly while coordinating travel logistics — working 16+ hour days alongside colleagues in the continental U.S. who provided round-the-clock support, including environmental specialists assisting with GIS and permitting, and coordination teams managing rapidly evolving budget data.",https://www.wsp.com/-/media/project/us/image/from-crisis-response-to-resilient-infrastructure-integrated-power-solutions-for-guam/lin-power-solutions-for-guam.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 10:13:14.647242

Draft Risk Evaluation Findings

EPA’s draft risk evaluation preliminarily shows that 1,3-butadiene presents an unreasonable risk of injury to human health for workers and the general population (including fenceline communities) from inhalation exposure. 1,3-Butadiene is associated with health effects such as reduced birthweight pregnancies, blood and immune system disease, and leukemia.

EPA preliminarily determined that 1,3-butadiene presents an unreasonable risk of injury to human health for workers and the general population (including fenceline communities). Workers may be exposed to 1,3-butadiene when making products or otherwise using 1,3-butadiene in the workplace. Activities like non-routine laboratory technician maintenance activities can also expose workers to 1,3-butadiene through inhalation, which significantly contributes to unreasonable risk. 1,3-Butadiene presents unreasonable risk to the general population, including fenceline communities, when 1,3-butadiene is released into the environment and people breathe it in.

The draft risk evaluation preliminarily shows that consumer uses do not significantly contribute to the unreasonable risk presented by 1,3-butadiene because reasonably available evidence suggests that 1,3-butadiene only exists at trace concentrations in consumer products and articles and is not expected to degrade and expose consumers. The draft risk evaluation also preliminarily shows that there is no unreasonable risk of injury to the environment.

Background on 1,3-Butadiene

1,3-Butadiene (CASRN 106-99-0) is a colorless gas with a mild odor similar to gasoline, and it is highly flammable. Information from the 2016 Chemical Data Reporting (CDR) for 1,3-butadiene indicates the reported production volume is between 1 and 5 billion lbs/year (manufacture and import).

Uses of 1,3-Butadiene

In the final scope, EPA identified conditions of use associated with the manufacturing (including importing); processing; distribution in commerce; industrial, commercial and consumer uses; and disposal of 1,3-butadiene, for example:

As an intermediate in the manufacturing of adhesive, synthetic rubber, organic fiber, plastic material and resin, paints and coatings, and other chemical product and preparation manufacturing;

As an intermediate in the manufacturing of petroleum, petrochemical, and solid rocket fuels;

In adhesives and sealants;

In fuels and related products;

As a laboratory chemical;

In automotive care products;

In lubricants and lubricant additives;

In paints and coatings; and

In plastic and rubber products (including rubber tires).

The above listed conditions of use are ways that a person or the environment could be potentially exposed to this chemical. However, when conducting a risk evaluation, EPA also considers the hazards (i.e. health effects or environmental impacts) that could occur from coming in contact with a chemical.

Activities and Opportunities for Public Comment

In December 2024, EPA released the draft risk evaluation for 1,3-butadiene public comment and peer review. In March 2025, EPA released a supplement to the risk evaluation describing a preliminary refinement of cancer risk estimates from exposure to 1,3-butadiene in air from releasing facilities. These refined facility specific risk estimates provide important updated estimates for incorporation into the risk evaluation.

The current comment period is set to close on March 5, 2025. EPA is extending the comment period for an additional 15 days. Comments can be submitted to docket EPA-HQ-OPPT-2024-0425 at regulations.gov until March 20, 2025. In order to give the peer reviewers on the Science Advisory Committee on Chemicals (SACC) time to review any additional comments received, EPA rescheduled the February 4, 2025, virtual preparatory meeting to March 25, 2025, and the February peer review virtual meeting to April 1-4, 2025. View the SACC website for more information on these meetings, including the registration links and information about how to provide oral comments during the meetings.

In August 2020, EPA published a final scope document outlining the hazards, exposures, conditions of use, and the potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations the agency expects to consider in its risk evaluation. The agency released the draft scope in April 2020 and took public comments on the draft document.

As EPA continues to move through the risk evaluation process there will be additional opportunities for public comment, including a public comment period on the draft risk evaluation. In addition to public comment periods, EPA will continue to engage with stakeholders as it refines the risk evaluation and stakeholders should reach out to EPA via the staff contact to engage with EPA.

With household budgets squeezed, credit scores could continue to face pressures in 2026.
Interest rates: The Federal Reserve Board just dropped its baseline interest rate to a range of 3.5-3.75%, which represents a quarter-point cut.","As the new year approaches, think about 2026 like one big game of chess.

In any chess match, you’re not just looking at where the pieces on the board are currently. You are trying to envision where they will be a few moves from now, to help you make better decisions.

The same goes for your finances. If you know what the chessboard is going to look like next year — whether we’re talking about inflation, or credit scores, or interest rates, or housing prices — then you can be more thoughtful about plotting your next move.

“By 2026, the U.S. economy is expected to look more stable and predictable,” says Constantine Tsantes, a planner with VLP Financial Advisors in Vienna, Va. “Overall growth is expected to be steady, not booming. For consumers, that means focusing on stronger credit, planning major borrowing carefully, and taking advantage of a more balanced financial environment.”

To be honest, macroeconomic data tends to make anyone’s eyes glaze over. But the reality is that the data impacts us all at a deeply personal level: what interest we’ll be getting on our savings, how much inflation will be driving up our costs, or whether the housing market is favoring buyers or sellers.

That in mind, Current shares insights about what the economic landscape may look like in 2026.

Inflation: This is a figure that’s top-of-mind for most consumers, since we encounter it frequently at the grocery store. Current inflation projections for 2026’s first quarter are 3.0%, according to the Survey of Professional Forecasters compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. That’s up significantly from the previous estimate of 2.6%, indicating that higher prices are proving pretty stubborn.

The good news is that inflation is expected to moderate by the end of 2026, down to 2.6%. One way to cope with this trend is to ensure that your cash savings are, at the very least, outpacing these inflation numbers. You’ll want to look for a savings account that offers a high-yield, such as 4% APY or above.

Credit scores: Recent data shows that FICO scores dropped to an average of 715 in 2025, down a couple of points from the previous year. That’s the second year in a row of declines, after many years of credit scores ticking up.

One reason for that is student loans, since payments are now being reported again to agencies after years of pandemic-related pauses. With household budgets squeezed, credit scores could continue to face pressures in 2026. In fact, the American consumer is looking pretty “fragile,” according to recent comments from JPMorgan Chase’s head of consumer banking, Marianne Lake.

That’s why it’s so important to bolster your credit record, which will make you more attractive to lenders and open up a universe of more favorable rates on loans. One option is to use a secured credit card, which protects you against falling into debt as you can only spend the amount of money in your account. You’ll want to look for one with low or no minimum deposit requirement and that reports to all three credit bureaus.

Home prices: The good news for buyers is that the housing market is moderating, after many years of big gains that made the American dream seem unaffordable to many. For 2026, Realtor.com is forecasting an average 2.2% increase in home prices; compare that to 2024 and its 4.5% price increase. Many metro areas are actually in outright decline, with more than half of U.S. homes losing value in the last year, according to real estate site Zillow.

Combine that with lower mortgage rates, and homeownership becomes more within reach. Next year’s expectations are for 6.3% average home loans, according to Realtor.com, down from 6.7% in 2024.

A buyer’s best weapons for affordability: A better credit score and a bigger down payment. “Preparing early, by improving credit and reducing debt, will matter more than perfectly timing the market,” says Tsantes.

Interest rates: The Federal Reserve Board just dropped its baseline interest rate to a range of 3.5-3.75%, which represents a quarter-point cut. This move typically trickles into many other areas of the economy, everything from interest being offered on savings accounts to rates being charged on car loans or mortgages.

Says Tsantes: “Even as rates decline, high-yield savings and short-term fixed income may remain attractive relative to the past decade.” Indeed, any healthy rates you can lock in now – whether high-yield accounts, or fixed-income returns, or even Certificates of Deposit – will have your future self feeling pretty good about 2026.",https://images.stacker.com/s/720/1280/images/stories/2025/12/23/current-whats-in-store-for-our-money-in-2026.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 20:58:51.128412

File this under A for Another Thing Trump Failed At. US President Donald Trump threw everything he had against the renewable energy movement in 2025, killing off new clean power jobs by the thousands, eviscerating billions in new investments, and needlessly raising electricity costs, to boot. Still, for all the pain Trump has foisted upon ordinary working Americans, he failed to stop wind and solar from dominating new capacity additions this year — and his remaining three years in office promise more of the same.

Renewable Energy Jobs Down …

Wait … whut? How can renewable energy dominate capacity additions over the next three years when thousands of households have lost their work in cleantech fields? After all, the numbers don’t lie. People are hurting all over the country as a result of Trump’s pullback on federal support for wind, solar, and EV-related projects. Surely that means Trump has won the war on renewables.

“Businesses canceled, closed, and scaled back nearly $1.6 billion worth of large-scale factories and clean energy projects in September, bringing the total cost of projects cancelled in the private-sector to over $24 billion in 2025 alone,” the business organization E2 noted in October.

The pullbacks resulted in a job loss of almost 21,000 by September, E2 estimated. The hurt was not confined to Trump’s political enemies, either. E2 calculated that Congressional districts under Republican representation lost 15,000 of those jobs, the consequence of losing $12.4 billion in investments as of September.

Hands down, the highlight of Trump’s war on renewables has been his gleefully malevolent attack on the domestic offshore wind industry, an effort that has upended energy planning across coastal states while costing thousands of construction, manufacturing, and services jobs all around the industry’s 40-state supply chain. Still, offshore wind was an easy target. The industry depends on federal offshore leases under Trump’s control. All he had to do was pull the leases, and, well, maybe it’s not so easy after all.

Earlier this month a federal judge affirmed Trump’s authority to stop issuing new offshore leases, but the same judge also revoked Trump’s ham-handed “suspension” of offshore leases already under permit. Last week, Trump clapped back by issuing an emergency order halting work on 5 offshore wind farms that are way beyond the permit phase and deep into construction. That move also wound up in court again after one of the developers, Dominion Energy, sued to resume work.

A hearing was scheduled for Monday, December 29, but the judge decided to reschedule to January 16 in order to review the classified Defense Department report that purportedly compelled the work to halt. Even if work eventually resumes on all five projects, the damage has been done. Construction delays cost money, and local ratepayers will be left holding the bag for increased costs.

… But Renewable Energy Prevails

Despite the widespread human pain and financial consequences of this year’s abrupt U-turn in federal energy policy, Trump failed to stop the forward momentum of the renewable energy revolution. After all, wind and solar — particularly solar — are now the most economical, accessible, and fastest ways to get more kilowatts into the grid (here’s a recent example). Trump lives in an intentionally fact-free world of his own making, but the sun will keep rising and the wind will keep blowing regardless of his intentions.

Again, the numbers don’t lie. Let’s take a look at the latest news from the SUN DAY Campaign, where Ken Bossong has spent years summarizing data from federal agencies and underscoring the renewable energy highlights (see our SUN DAY Campaign archive here).

SUN DAY’s latest analyses of data from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can be found in full online under the headline, “Solar Dominates for the 25th Consecutive Month Providing 98% of New U.S. Electrical Generating Capacity in September and >75% Year-to-Date,” (here’s one source), which pretty much sums up the situation.

“Solar has now been the largest source of new generating capacity added each month for 25 months straight: September 2023 – September 2025. During that period, total utility-scale solar capacity grew from 91.82 gigawatts (GW) to 158.43-GW. No other energy source added anything close to that amount of new capacity,” Bossong elaborated.

For all of Trump’s efforts to stamp every last wind turbine into the ground, the domestic wind industry came in second only to solar for new capacity additions. Wind accounted for 11.7 gigawatts during the two-year period, blowing past natural gas, which is the only other domestic energy resource readily available for increase at scale. Gas only registered 4.6 gigawatts during that period.

“Year-to-date (YTD), solar and wind have each added more new capacity than did natural gas,” Bossong emphasizes.

How It Started …

To be clear, the damage done this year will continue to ripple out into lost opportunities and higher electricity rates. Still, Bossong draws attention to the strong showing of renewable energy past 2025 and into 2028, with solar pulling far ahead of the pack.

“FERC reports that net ‘high probability’ net additions of solar between October 2025 and September 2028 total 90,614-MW [90.614 gigawatts] – an amount almost four times the forecast net ‘high probability’ additions for wind (23,093-MW), the second fastest growing resource,” Bossong notes.

In the same forecast period, other so-called clean(er) fuels are far behind. Natural gas racks up less than 7 gigawatts in added capacity, and nuclear registers a lowly 335 megawatts — a pretty poor showing considering that Trump has based his entire energy policy around the existence of a purported national emergency — you know, like the kind that demands an “immediate remedy.”

As for Trump’s pledge to keep the coal fires burning in power plants all over the country, he pledged to do the same thing during his first term in office. That was a colossal failure, one that will continue into his second term. FERC projects that coal will shrink — not expand, shrink — by just over 24 gigawatts by 2028. Oil, which has a much smaller starting footprint, is also poised to shrink another 1.6 gigawatts during that period.

“Taken together, the net new ‘high probability’ net utility-scale capacity additions by all renewable energy sources over the next three years – i.e., the Trump Administration’s remaining time in office – would total 114,239-MW,” Bossong summarizes. “On the other hand, the installed capacity of fossil fuels and nuclear power combined would shrink by 18,596-MW.”

How It Ended …

Against this backdrop, it’s helpful to recall that Trump’s energy “emergency” declaration hit the Federal Register on January 29, 2025, directing federal agencies to facilitate the production of “crude oil, natural gas, lease condensates, natural gas liquids, refined petroleum products, uranium, coal, biofuels, geothermal heat, the kinetic movement of flowing water, and critical minerals” as listed in Section 8 (here’s that link again).

So much for facilitating. Sharp-eyed readers will notice that at least three forms of renewable energy explicitly made the cut — biomass, geothermal, and hydropower — with marine energy also included as an unstated extension of “the kinetic movement of flowing water.” The idea that any of those three can provide an”immediate remedy” for a national energy emergency is laughable, particularly in the case of marine energy, which has barely gotten past the technology demonstration stage. If anyone gets the last laugh, it will be the geothermal industry, which is just beginning — emphasis on beginning — to capitalize on a next-generation R&D effort.

The global separator material platforms for EV and ESS OEMs market is valued at USD 6.2 billion in 2026 and is projected to reach USD 17 billion by 2036, growing at a CAGR of 10.60%. This market is shaped by the increasing reliance on high-performance separators in electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems (ESS). As manufacturers prioritize safety, energy density, and fast-charging capabilities, separator material solutions must align with these evolving needs, particularly in high-demand applications such as EV batteries.

Application concentration, particularly in EV batteries, represents 55% of the market, which anchors growth and defines its trajectory. However, the dependency on end-use sectors such as ESS and consumer electronics introduces both stability and risk, depending on fluctuations in these industries' demand cycles. EV adoption boosts market demand, but its concentration in a few key sectors necessitates careful risk management. Volume stability, driven by consistent automotive and energy storage growth, enhances long-term forecasts.

BY JEFF TITTEL

The Mikie Sherrill Transition is unique from having the Inauguration in Newark to having 500 plus people involved in the Transition. What also is unique it's the first transition without an Environmental Transition Committee. My concern the environment has not gotten the attention it deserves, and it needs to be a top priority for the incoming Sherrill Administration. Whatever happens nationally on the environment will happen New Jersey first. We face climate catastrophe, flooding, toxic chemicals, threats to clean air and clean water, and rampant overdevelopment.

We also face a bigger threat: the Trump War on the Environment. His administration rolled back more than 150 environmental rules and cut the EPA budget by 55%. New Jersey DEP gets 25% of its funding from the EPA, so these cuts could be devastating.The loss of EPA help and oversight especially on cleaning up toxics sites and protecting our beaches and water ways .

One of the first priorities must fixing the NJDEP itself. After eight years Gov Christie's roll backs followed Murphy Administration with its cuts and lack of caring about New Jersey’s environment. As a member of congress Mikie Sherrill has a good record on the environment. We are hopeful that the Sherrill Administration will step forward with a real plan and resources to move our environment forward. She will also needs to lead on the environment to deal with our many environmental issues and challenges.

NJDEP now has fewer staff than under Christie—about 400 fewer—and a 15% lower budget. Its backlog of park repairs has grown from $400 million to $720 million, and we are not investing enough in urban parks. They did these cuts while doubling the number of senior managers. The Murphy Administration eliminated the Division of Enforcement, and the Environmental Justice law has more holes than a screen door. We need to rebuild the NJDEP from the ground up.

Murphy appointed a DEP Commissioner who was previously a lawyer and lobbyist for corporate polluters and kept most of Christie’s rollbacks to environmental rules in place. Many Christie appointees remain on the Highlands and Pinelands Commissions. There is a lot to fix—including hiring a new DEP Commissioner with government experience and management skills. This person should not come from the business world. DEP is not a business; it needs to be managed and restored, not run like a corporation.

Mikie Sherrill as a candidate called for cutting red tape and streamlining permits. If we really want the department to be more effective and efficient, the answer is not “cutting red tape”—which is code for rolling back environmental protections. The answer is resources: enough staff to do the job, modern equipment to work efficiently, and a reformed management structure. We need to break down the silos within the agency and develop a holistic approach to natural resources, biodiversity, ecosystems, and permitting. Permitting should move more efficiently by requiring applicants to lessen environmental impacts, provide mitigation, and deliver real public benefit.

We must restore the independent Division of Enforcement and the independent Division of Science. We also need to streamline upper-level management and eliminate unnecessary managers.

The Environment was not big issues l during Sherrill's campaign now not during Transition. This is very troubling. It shows that the environment is not as high on Sherrill’s agenda as it should be . I blame the “Zoom-chair warriors” of the Big Green groups for not making this a bigger issue during the campaign and failing to extract a real environmental agenda during the endorsement process. For example, in 2001 I was able to get candidate McGreevey to commit to Clean Cars, the Highlands Act, and C1 stream protections. That is part of the reason it became a priority then. It does not seem to be happening this time.

But you cannot have affordability without an environmental agenda. The environment doesn’t care about politics—hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, forest fires, chemical spills, refinery explosions, toxic water, and overdevelopment will all force action. New Jersey is among the top states for FEMA payouts and property damage from flooding. We are number two in the nation for building in flood-prone areas. We have some of the worst air quality in the country. Only one of our stream systems meets the Clean Water Act’s highest standards. We are among the top states for temperature rise and number three for sea-level rise.

We need a coastal commission or coordinated planning to manage chronic flooding and adaptation, updated flood and coastal rules, and real decisions on where to retreat, where to elevate, and where to harden. We must end logging and attempts to privatize and industrialize public lands. We need to reform the Division of Fish and Wildlife to actually enhance our habitat ecosystems and wildlife. Most importantly we need to release hundreds of millions of dollars in open space funds to buy farmland and environmentally sensitive lands before they are lost to development.

We Need to have an aggressive legal strategy to fight EPA rollbacks. We can pass laws to restore environmental programs and standards .We should also pass legislation modeled on Oregon’s response to the Trump rollbacks:

Oregon Environmental Protection Act: Adopt Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act federal standards as of January 19, 2017, into state law—ensuring that baseline protections remain even if federal standards are weakened. The law also allows stricter state rules than federal standards.

New Jersey should adopt real climate rules and regulate greenhouse gases to actually reduce emissions. We need to update our rules to lessen climate impacts, and reform toxic cleanup laws to restore DEP oversight over the LSRP program (Licensed Site Remediation Professionals).

We must reduce toxic pollution and chemical use through existing laws. All water treatment facilities should be required to remove carcinogenic chemicals like PFAS—this was first proposed in 2007. We should update solid and hazardous waste rules to reduce pollution and increase recycling. Update Highlands and Pinelands rules to better protect ecosystems and address climate impacts. Appoint new commissioners who support their missions and properly fund them.

Make polluters pay for pollution and climate impacts. Fix the Environmental Justice rules so they actually reduce pollution and protect overburdened communities. Limit and stop overdevelopment of our last remaining forests and farmland, using a strategy that protects habitat, watersheds, and enforces a real state plan. We need to regulate warehouses and data center development.

Donald Trump’s policies are an existential threat to our environment. His actions would have devastating effects on New Jersey, because we are the state most vulnerable to climate disruption, flooding, and overdevelopment. We must stand up to Trump, but we must also modernize and fund our own environmental governance.

Affordability means clean air, clean water, open space, and cleaning up toxic sites. Our economy is dependent on a healthy environment our top 3 industries depend on it; Tourism, Food Processing and Pharmaceutical/ Petrochemical. Plus it's important for quality of life and public health. The Governor needs to lead on the environment and it must be a top priority for the Sherrill Administration. Our State Future is dependent on it .",https://www.insidernj.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bobsmith-1024x768.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 16:58:37.459835

In November 2024, five major U.S. newspapers published a total of 524 stories about climate change; in the same month this year, those papers ran just 362 climate change articles, according to researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder — a drop of almost a third.","Remember the climate crisis? The relentless, escalating threat to human health and safety that was once the main driver of clean energy policy?

You’d be forgiven if it’s all a bit hazy, given how swiftly the term was dropped from the energy-transition lexicon this year.

Starting on Inauguration Day, President Donald Trump not only eviscerated climate policy but completely upended the way Americans talk about energy. Though Trump seemed more concerned with taking down ideological rivals than helping constituents' bottom lines, his new lexicon got a boost from consumer concerns about soaring energy prices that had people casting around for quick fixes. Climate change was out. Talk of “energy dominance,” “energy abundance,” and “unleashing American energy” rushed in. The shift was like “6-7” taking over a fourth-grade classroom: inexorable and irresistible.

The new terminology made the scene on Trump’s first day back in the White House, when he signed an executive order with a grab bag of fossil-fuel giveaways under the title “Unleashing American Energy.” A few weeks later, he used another executive order to create the National Energy Dominance Council. Both orders touted the country’s “abundant” resources.

Clean energy advocates quickly began invoking similar terminology in an attempt to shoehorn solar power into the new narrative. The Solar Energy Industries Association even passed out stickers with the phrase “energy dominance” on Capitol Hill as part of its lobbying efforts.

Some media outlets followed suit in deemphasizing climate. In November 2024, five major U.S. newspapers published a total of 524 stories about climate change; in the same month this year, those papers ran just 362 climate change articles, according to researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder — a drop of almost a third. (Both numbers are way down from the October 2021 peak of 1,049 climate articles.)

A number of Democratic politicians embraced the vibe shift in their own ways. “All of the above” crept in among leaders — notably New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey — who wanted to signal they are open to the changing conversation, but not ready to give up on renewables entirely. In New Jersey and Virginia, Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger ran successful gubernatorial campaigns with hardly any mention of climate change; likewise, New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani spent little time on the topic.

Most notably, Democrats this year prioritized the issue of energy affordability, an increasingly urgent concern among voters — and one that Trump is belligerently dismissing.

Two liberal groups, Fossil Free Media and Data for Progress, put out a memo in November that endorses this affordability focus, suggesting it’s a way for Democrats to reconcile the new discourse with the old. The memo encourages them to promote the benefits of renewable energy as a cheap source of power in 2026. The headline: “Don’t run from climate — translate it.”

Though Republicans are failing to reckon with the issue of soaring energy costs, there’s still something seductive about their energy rhetoric. It suggests an economy teeming with possibility, held back only by those meanie Democrats with their snowflakey concerns about climate and their insufficient will to dominate. The language implies there are easy answers to at least some of our woes. Worried about soaring energy bills? Unleash the beautiful coal. Concerned about grid reliability? Exploit those abundant energy supplies. Never mind that fossil fuels are most definitely not the cheapest sources of electricity.

The vocab shift, particularly around “dominance,” also captures a vibe that has always appealed to Trump supporters: “That language does have this bravado and machismo that is important to his movement,” Cara Daggett, a professor of political science at Virginia Tech, told a reporter for Grist earlier this year.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/canary_media_articles_453/c7c32d130829547a7008e77c2250673c,N,,2025-12-30 19:12:31.164257

No region does more to fuel the U.S. economy than the Midwest, yet rural communities are so often shortchanged and unrecognized.

However, with the July 4 passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, Congress and President Trump established a market-based solution. It’s called “45Z” - a tax credit for American fuel production that could bring billions of dollars in private capital to farmers and the rural power grid.

When I say “the grid,” I of course mean more money for new Midwest power plants. But I also mean more money for the linemen - the unsung heroes of the American energy industry.

You might wonder how a tax credit for fuel would be related to linemen or power plants. Fuel production requires electricity. When fuel producers show that they are using clean American energy, such as nuclear, hydro, or solar, they earn a larger 45Z tax credit. The larger the 45Z credit for fuel producers, the more private capital flows into the Midwest grid.

President Trump and Congress created a framework that allows private markets to invest in rural grid infrastructure at a moment when more investment is sorely needed. The 45Z grid capital structure is based on two things: raw electrical power and energy data.

To make a 45Z filing, fuel producers document their production inputs, such as crops and electricity. For electricity, fuel producers enter into special contracts with American power plants. These contracts, called energy attribute certificates, or EACs, contain granular energy data to support a 45Z claim. This data is tracked on a public ledger, similar to how transactions are tracked on blockchain systems.

Because Midwest power plants can generate additional revenue by selling data-backed electricity contracts, and fuel producers want to buy those contracts to increase their tax credit value, these arrangements could result in billions of dollars in new private investment flowing into the rural power grid.",https://www.watfordcitynd.com/image/cache/favicon.png,N,,2025-12-30 16:14:13.902741

This year’s fundraising efforts banked the highest dollar amount Drax has raised through its event.

The funds were raised during Drax’s annual golf tournament where more than 30 teams teed off at Frenchman’s Bend Golf Course in Monroe. The 18-hole tournament featured several charity holes where golfers donated funds to try their luck at a myriad of challenges, including one-legged teeing off and a frisbee toss for a shorter swing to the greens.

“We are very proud of the impact The Center is having across all of our service areas and grateful for the partnerships and generosity of our community support – without whom we would not be able to do this work,” said Board President, Dr. Margot Bell Eason.

The Center for Children and Families offers hope to those who need it most through advocacy, counseling, education, and prevention services. The center began in 1999 as a small CASA program in Monroe, LA. They have since grown into a nationally recognized and respected agency that serves 48 parishes in Norther and South-Central Louisiana, and seven counties in Central Mississippi. The Center has committed more than 59,000 hours of direct service and helped more than 5300 through six programs: Brokers of Hope, CASA, The Children’s Advocacy Center of Northeast Louisiana (CAC), Counseling Services, Medication Management, and Family Support & Youth Transition (FSYT).

“Our golf tournament is a highlight of every year because it’s an opportunity to bring vendors and colleagues together to enjoy themselves while giving back to the community,” said Clay Butler, Drax IT Operations Manager and golf tournament facilitator. “Every year we try to beat the money we raised the year before. When you’re helping local kids, it’s easy to go above and beyond.”

Drax is committed to supporting local communities through the Drax Community Fund and the Drax Foundation, including efforts that provide education and skills focused on improving green spaces, sustainable forestry management and helping the underserved population in Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas and Alabama.

“When industry invests in local advocacy organizations, it’s not just supporting a cause, it’s strengthening the community’s voice,” said Matt White, Executive Vice President of North America Pellet Operations for Drax. “Supporting the Center for Children and Families is one more way our team in Monroe gets to pour back into the community we call home.”

He wants them to testify at a hearing about automobile affordability in the States on January 14. There are a couple of issues with that.

First, it’s happening during the week of the Detroit Auto Show. Maybe more importantly, Cruz invited Tesla’s VP of engineering instead of the brand’s CEO, Elon Musk. Those factors appear to be the main reasons that Ford looks poised to skip the hearing, and GM and Stellantis might follow that lead.

When Cruz announced the hearing and his invitations to Jim Farley, Mary Barra, and Antonio Filosa, it was big news. If they all attend, it’ll be the first time that the CEOs of America’s Big Three automakers all appear before Congress since 2008.

More: Detroit 3 CEOs And Tesla Exec To Face Congress Over Soaring Car Prices

The hearing, officially titled “Pedal to the Policy: The Views of the American Auto Industry on the Upcoming Surface Transportation Reauthorization,” is being framed by Cruz as a referendum on soaring vehicle prices and the regulatory burden facing automakers. Ford is pushing back, though.

Uneven Ground?

According to The Detroit News, Farley has already called the Detroit Auto Show the “Super Bowl week for autos,” and that ethos likely applies just as much to GM and Stellantis. On top of that, council for Farley called out Cruz’s invitation to Tesla’s VP, Lars Moravy, as another reason that Farley might skip it.

Ford laid out its case in a December 12 letter to Senator Cruz, written by Brian Smith of Covington & Burling LLP. The carmaker noted that hiring outside counsel for a congressional hearing is routine, but the letter took issue with how the invite list was structured.

Ford Challenges Uneven Representation

“We greatly appreciate the constructive dialogue we have had with you and your staff regarding this hearing, including Mr. Farley’s recent conversation with you adjacent to the White House event on fuel economy standards. Ford remains committed to working with you and your colleagues in a cooperative manner, including in a potential hearing before the Committee,” Smith wrote.

While the letter didn’t mention Tesla by name, it directly criticized what Ford sees as inconsistent treatment.

“Ford believes that it is essential that any potential hearing adhere to Congress’s longstanding tradition of ensuring comparable treatment for similarly situated companies,” Smith added. “If a vice president of engineering is appropriate for the planned hearing, the other companies should have the opportunity to offer a similar witness.”

GM Waits, Stellantis Watches, Cruz Stands Firm

Apparently, GM is on roughly the same page, confirming that Mary Barra will attend only if the other Detroit CEOs do the same. Stellantis has declined to say whether Filosa will appear. Cruz, for his part, appears unmoved. A spokesperson for the senator said plans for the hearing remain unchanged and that all four executives are still expected to attend.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/wergerg-copy.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 16:58:44.685771

December 30, 2025 - WASHINGTON – On Monday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released the following:

On Christmas Eve, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin published an op-ed in The Hill highlighting the agency’s role in helping to curb food waste across the country during this holiday season and beyond. With nearly one-third of all food in the United States being discarded every year, EPA has launched the Feed It Onward initiative to connect surplus food with people and organizations that make use of it and reduce its chances of being discarded in landfills. EPA’s efforts in redirecting food waste increases access to healthy meals for families, allows farmers and businesses to find new value in products, and allows communities to strengthen the systems that help keep America fed.

Read what Administrator Zeldin had to say:

“As Americans gather throughout the holiday season, we are surrounded by the traditions that bring families and communities together. Across the country, tables are full, neighborhoods are active, and people are taking time to connect with those who matter most. This season of sharing also reminds us of a simple truth: Good, nutritious food should be consumed, not wasted.

“More than one-third of all food in the U.S. is discarded each year. We can do better, and we are doing better. When surplus food is reduced, redirected, or repurposed, families gain access to healthy meals, farmers and businesses find new value in products that might otherwise go unused, and communities strengthen the systems that help keep America fed. Leaning into food waste reduction is a common sense, critical effort that will help make America healthy again.

“Throughout my travels to all fifty states this year, I have seen how local leadership is driving this progress. Communities are finding practical ways to make better use of the food moving throughout their supply chains. When people coordinate, share ideas, and build on each other’s strengths, families thrive, businesses benefit, and the entire system becomes stronger.

“The vision behind the EPA’s Feed It Onward initiative is straightforward: to share the stories of individuals and organizations across the nation who are addressing food waste. The initiative aims to connect surplus food with people and organizations that can make use of it. Good food should not be discarded in landfills when it can serve a meaningful purpose.

“Kansas City offers a compelling example of what is possible, which I witnessed firsthand when I visited Kanbe’s Markets there and met with the team from Pete’s Garden and KC Can Compost. I left encouraged by how local leaders are building real, community-driven solutions that work.

“Kanbe’s has created a model that moves good-to-eat produce into neighborhood stores that traditional distribution often overlooks. Their work strengthens small retailers, fills access gaps, and ensures that families can purchase fresh fruits and vegetables that might otherwise be thrown away.

“Pete’s Garden repackages surplus meals from restaurants and caterers into take-home dinners for families. KC Can Compost broadens composting access for homes and businesses. Together, these groups have diverted millions of pounds of food from landfills — feeding families, supporting farmers, and enriching soil. It is a full-circle model and a clear example of what communities can accomplish when they coordinate and share resources.

“This summer, I visited Scott Air Force Base in Southern Illinois for the launch of EPA’s first Feed It Onward Partnership. Working with Frey Farms, we redirected produce that would have been thrown away just for being labeled ‘imperfect.’ Rather than end up in a landfill, truckloads of fresh watermelons, corn, and pumpkins went straight to military families. This is a clear example of the difference that Feed It Onward aims to make.

“Big venues around the country are also working hard to reduce food waste. During my visit to Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama, I participated in efforts between NASCAR, Denali Water, and Levy to cut food waste at the track.

“I also toured the Kia Center, home to the Orlando Magic, whose arena managers have partnered with Levy to redirect surplus food to local organizations. Even in fast-paced and high-volume environments, effective planning can turn surplus food into valuable resources for the community.

“This issue is gaining global attention. At the G7 Energy and Environment Ministers’ Meeting in Toronto, I spoke with counterparts from around the world and the idea struck a chord, as many shared that they want to learn from the U.S. in this regard, to tackle this challenge in their own countries.

“As the U.S. prepares for the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2028 Olympic Games, there’s an opportunity to showcase our nation’s efforts in reducing food waste.

The administration announced on Dec. 22 it was pausing leases and halting work on five major offshore wind projects under construction along the east coast, citing national security concerns identified by the Pentagon. These include complaints that the movement of massive turbine blades and the highly reflective towers that support them can interfere with radar used to locate security threats.

The Richmond-based utility’s Dec. 23 lawsuit seeks to block the order for its $11.2 billion Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project. It’s the largest of the five affected projects, all of which were expected to enter commercial operation over the next two years.

Dominion estimated CVOW would begin generating electricity in early 2026, with enough energy to power approximately 660,000 residences. In its lawsuit filed, the utility described the administration’s stop-work order as “arbitrary and capricious.”

The utility has already received all federal, state and local approvals necessary for the construction and operation of CVOW, spending approximately $8.9 billion to date, according to the lawsuit. Customers are contributing to these costs.

The lawsuit claims the pause is causing “serious, irreparable harm” to the utility and its customers.

“Our nation is governed by laws, and a stable legal and regulatory environment is essential to allow regulated public utilities … to invest and support our nation’s energy needs and associated jobs,” Dominion argued. “Sudden and baseless withdrawal of regulatory approvals by government officials cannot be reconciled with the predictability needed to support the exceptionally large capital investments required for large-scale energy development projects like CVOW critical to domestic energy security.”

U.S. District Court Judge Jamar Walker was earlier scheduled to hear the case Dec. 29, but granted the administration’s request to delay the hearing until January.

The judge ordered U.S. Department of Justice lawyers to get “classified information” regarding the stop-work order to him by Jan. 9. The hearing will now take place on Jan. 16.

Asked for comment on the ruling, Dominion spokesperson Jeremy Slayton said CVOW is essential to meeting customers’ needs.

“Delaying the project will lead to increased costs for customers and threaten long-term grid reliability,” Slayton said. “Given the project’s critical importance, we have a responsibility to pursue every available avenue to deliver the project as quickly and at the lowest cost possible on behalf of our customers and the stability of the overall grid.”

What’s Slowing Down Solar Deployment in Europe and How to Fix It

Lisandra Perez | Hive Module

Abstract

Europe’s solar sector is facing an unexpected slowdown. Despite record installations and low-cost technology, annual solar growth in Europe plunged from 53% in 2023 to just 4% in 2024. The issue is not technology, it is the system around it.

This paper analyzes this slowdown through a dual lens: first, the well-researched systemic barriers of market design, grid limitations, and policy friction; second, the critically under-examined operational and delivery bottlenecks within the industry's project execution model.

Drawing on academic research, industry reports, and real-world field experience, this article argues that Europe’s solar progress is stalled because policy reforms and project execution practices are evolving out of sync. The solution requires addressing both.

This analysis incorporates insights derived from professional experience in European solar project delivery. These operational perspectives are presented as informed industry analysis to contextualize the systemic challenges identified in the published literature.

1.Introduction: Europe’s Solar Slowdown: A Paradox in the Middle of a Boom

Europe finds itself in a solar energy paradox. On one hand, solar photovoltaic (PV) technology has achieved unprecedented competitiveness, becoming ""among the cheapest options for new electricity generation"" [2], and is central to the EU’s REPowerEU strategy, which targets 700 GW by 2030. However, deployment has slowed significantly. Recent market data shows a 92% decrease in year-on-year growth, and solar’s contribution to electricity demand growth has dropped sharply [1]. This slowdown indicates that challenges have shifted from cost and technology to systemic, institutional, and operational barriers.

2.Layer One: The Documented Systemic Headwinds

Academic and institutional research consistently identifies three primary macro-level barriers stifling solar momentum in Europe.

2.1 Market Design & the Price Cannibalization Trap

Europe’s energy markets were not built for high-renewable penetration. Solar energy floods the grid when the sun shines, causing predictable price drops, and therefore lower revenues for solar itself.

Analysis confirms this creates ""serious financial problems, especially for solar power plants"" [4]. The International Energy Agency (IEA) notes that while market designs are evolving, the revenue stability for new utility-scale solar projects in Europe remains a concern without adequate policy support [5]. This market failure disincentivizes new investment just when it is most needed.

2.2 Grid Congestion and Ageing Infrastructure

The physical infrastructure for transmission is a major bottleneck. Europe’s grid is often ageing and was designed for a centralized, predictable flow of power, not for a decentralized, variable-input system like solar.

The result: long connection queues, curtailment in solar-rich regions, mismatch between where electricity is produced vs. consumed

The European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSO-E) highlights that significant grid reinforcement and expansion are prerequisites for achieving national climate goals, with thousands of kilometers of new lines needed to integrate planned renewable capacity [6].

2.3 Administrative & Permitting Delays

Permitting remains one of the slowest, least predictable parts of the entire project lifecycle. Even where EU-wide guidance exists, national processes remain uneven.

A Renewables Grid Initiative study identifies permitting delays as one of the top structural blockers for renewable expansion [8].

3. Layer Two: The Overlooked Problem, How Projects Are Built

Even when market and policy conditions are supportive, many projects still get stuck because the project delivery model is broken. Industry experience reveals a delivery model in crisis.

3.1 The Fragmentation Trap and Decision Paralysis

The prevailing industry model relies on long chains of specialized subcontractors. This fragmentation leads to misaligned incentives, communication breakdowns, and a critical absence of unified accountability. When challenges arise, be they technical, logistical, or regulatory, the lack of embedded, on-site decision-making authority causes paralysis. Each layer of subcontracting adds a point of potential failure, slowing progress and inflating costs.

3.2 The Skilled Labor Deficit and the BESS Bottleneck

The solar sector suffers from a chronic shortage of a trained, cohesive workforce. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) reports that while global renewable energy jobs are growing, skill gaps and inadequate training programs persist, potentially constraining growth [9].

The BESS bottleneck is a prime example. It is not solely a supply chain issue but an integration competency gap. Deploying a functional solar-plus-storage system requires seamless synergy between civil, electrical, and software engineering, a synergy nearly impossible to achieve with disparate subcontractors and a workforce lacking specific cross-disciplinary training [3, 9].

3.3 The Vertical Integration Antidote: A Case in Point

In response to this, a contrasting model has emerged from industry practice: the vertically integrated, compact team. This approach internalizes the end-to-end workflow, from planning and procurement to construction and commissioning, within a single accountable entity.

From direct site experience, even high-performing EPCs struggle when project delivery depends on disconnected subcontractors. A unified, cross-trained team can reduce delays dramatically

4. Fixing the Slowdown Requires a Two-Front Strategy

Europe must address policy barriers and execution barriers at the same time.

4.1 Macro-Level: Policy and Market Reformation

Market Reform: Transition from energy-only to capacity and flexibility markets. This would provide revenue streams for solar paired with storage, valuing its ability to deliver power on demand and support grid stability [5].

Grid Acceleration: Coordinated investment in grid digitalization, reinforcement, and smart grid technologies, as outlined in network development plans [6].

Permitting Standardization: Enforce and digitize permitting across the EU, implementing ""positive silence"" and designating pre-approved ""Renewables Acceleration Areas"" to slash development timelines, applying best-practice guidance available [8].

4.2 Micro-Level Fixes (Delivery & Workforce)

The industry needs a shift toward:

Vertically integrated delivery teams: Most European solar projects still rely on long subcontracting chains: one company for piling, another for mechanical work, another for electrical installation, and another for commissioning.

Every layer adds delays, miscommunication, and diluted accountability. A vertically integrated team replaces this fragmentation with a single unified structure that handles the full A-Z workflow.

Cross-trained workforces: Europe doesn’t just face a worker shortage; it faces a shortage of workers with the right blend of skills. Modern projects demand teams who understand electrical installation, mechanical structures, BESS integration, and grid requirements, not just one part of the process.

Strong on-site decision-making: Workers wait for subcontractor approvals, subcontractors wait for managers, managers wait for clients, and the project stalls.

Empowered, competent on-site leadership solves this.

When site managers and team leads are trained and authorized to make real-time decisions, projects move faster, adapt better, and avoid unnecessary standstills.

Direct accountability for project outcomes:With fragmented delivery, responsibility gets blurred. When something goes wrong, everyone points elsewhere, delaying fixes and eroding trust with investors and developers. Direct accountability means one team owning the full project outcome, one internal standard for quality and safety, one decision chain, one responsible entity clients can rely on. This eliminates the “not my task” culture and creates projects that are more predictable, safer, and ultimately more profitable.

This model directly targets the operational failures slowing projects today. Hive Module’s operational approach (compact, integrated electrical and construction teams) is increasingly aligned with what the industry now requires for consistent on-time deployment.

5. Conclusion: Building the Bridge with New Tools and New Teams

The next phase of the transition is more complex, requiring the integration of solar into a resilient, flexible, and intelligent energy system. The analysis reveals that this cannot be achieved by merely tweaking the same old approaches.

The systemic barriers of market design, grid limits, and permitting are very real. However, their negative impact is powerfully amplified by an industry plagued by operational fragmentation and skill shortages. Therefore, the pathway to fixing Europe's solar deployment is necessarily dual. It requires bold policy reforms to correct market signals and modernize infrastructure, coupled with a ground-level revolution in how projects are delivered.

The move toward vertically integrated, expert-led project teams is not a mere niche trend but a necessary evolution. It represents the operational counterpart to the macro-level policy shift, providing the capable, agile, and accountable execution engine required to build the system Europe needs. By simultaneously reforming the rules of the game and elevating the quality of the players, Europe can transform its solar paradox into a story of renewed momentum and secure, clean energy leadership.

West Virginia is one of 12 states and Washington, D.C., which are part of PJM.","CHARLESTON — Gov. Patrick Morrisey set a goal nearly six months ago for West Virginia to triple its electric-generating capacity, but the comprehensive plan is still in the works with a public comment period now closed.

The West Virginia Office of Energy sought public comment and recommendations as it works on developing a comprehensive energy policy around Morrisey’s 50 by 50 energy initiative. The public comment period opened on Dec. 9 and closed last Friday. According to the office, 71 public comments were submitted by Friday’s deadline.

During speeches in August in White Sulphur Springs and Wheeling, Morrisey unveiled his 50 by 50 initiative aimed at increasing base load electric generating capacity in the state from just under 16 gigawatts to 50 gigawatts by 2050.

“This 50 by 50, that’s a needle mover,” Morrisey said during an end-of-the-year press conference last Monday. “West Virginia needs to be America’s energy state … and to really be a driver of America’s energy renaissance.”

According to the solicitation for public comments, the Office of Energy said Morrisey’s 50 by 50 initiative will be an all-of-the-above energy, focused on traditional fossil fuel sources (coal, natural gas), and include nuclear energy, hydrogen power and renewable energy sources (wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric.) The comprehensive energy policy being developed around 50 by 50 will include a transmission plan.

“It will address the need for sufficient electricity transmission lines and natural gas transmission pipelines to support the increase in baseload electricity generation,” according to the Office of Energy’s solicitation for public comment. “It will recommend locations for the placement of natural gas pipelines and electricity transmission lines in locations throughout the state that lack sufficient access and in areas where access to increased supplies of electricity or natural gas will spur manufacturing or other economic development.”

The comprehensive energy policy will include an energy security plan in order to protect against blackouts and other disruptions, and prevent potential threats to the electrical grid, such as cyber-attacks. This plan will include inventories of energy sources in the state and critical infrastructure; developing emergency protocols and coordination plans between local, state and federal agencies; and conducting tabletop exercises and other scenario planning.

The comprehensive energy policy will include 25-year strategic development for each source of energy in West Virginia. These plans will focus on expanding electrical generation, infrastructure expansions, economic development incentives, site development, legislation and rule-making, workforce development, education, financial and tax incentives, safety, environmental mitigation and energy security.

Since October, there have been several natural gas power plant projects announced that would add an additional five gigawatts to what is produced by the state’s power plants, including projects announced by FirstEnergy and a partnership between Kindle Energy, GE Vernova, Blackstone and Wolf Summit Energy.

Morrisey’s 50 by 50 initiative and the comprehensive energy policy being developed by the Office of Energy is focused on making West Virginia the battery of the east coast and making the state more appealing to energy-intensive data center and AI projects.

House Bill 2014, a new law first proposed by Morrisey, is aimed at attracting high-impact industrial businesses and data centers to West Virginia along with microgrids to power the data centers using both fossil fuels and renewable energy generation. The rules governing these new data center and microgrid districts are still awaiting approval from the Legislature, with the Legislative Rule-Making Review Committee slated to review these proposed rules next month.

“We’re going to be leveraging the intersection between energy and technology,” Morrisey said last week. “We’re excited about that and we’re going to keep going. We’re working on finalizing those plans. That’s been a big, big project.”

West Virginia only has one natural gas-fired power plant that provides electricity to retail customers in the PJM market, a regional electric transmission organization that operates a competitive wholesale electricity market in the northeast. West Virginia is one of 12 states and Washington, D.C., which are part of PJM.

The state has nine coal-fired power plants, with coal-fired power accounting for 86 percent of West Virginia’s total electricity net generation. In its public comment filing, the West Virginia Coal Association argued that existing coal-fired power plants should be prioritized as the foundational assets of the state’s power grid to ensure reliability and economic stability.

“West Virginia’s nine existing coal-fired power plants represent ‘premium assets’ in this age of increased power demand and should serve as the fundamental building block of any plan to increase generation within the State of West Virginia,” wrote West Virginia Coal Association President Chris Hamilton.

In its public comments, the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce advocated for a free-market approach that balances environmental stewardship with the practical needs of the state’s business community. The chamber expressed strong support for a diversified power generation strategy that utilizes both traditional fossil fuels and renewable resources to ensure grid reliability.

“The chamber applauds the goal of the plan to develop new generation capacity utilizing a combination of natural gas, nuclear, coal, geothermal, solar and wind,” wrote West Virginia Chamber of Commerce President Steve Roberts. “The resource rich opportunities that West Virginia has need to be harnessed for growth of the state’s economy for the benefit of all its citizens.”

West Virginians for Energy Freedom, a coalition of groups that advocate for electric ratepayers, submitted public comments calling for any comprehensive energy policy to prioritize consumer autonomy and protections that protect ratepayers for bearing the financial costs for expanding electric generation. The group called for allowing ratepayers to purchase power from nearby customers, use of plug-in solar systems and removing caps on net metering solar credit programs.

“Without taking a position on the wisdom of tripling energy capacity in 25 years, we caution that, if West Virginia ratepayers or taxpayers would be required to pay for any of power plants built under this plan, there be guarantees and protections in place to ensure that the plants will be useful and beneficial for West Virginians,” the organization wrote.",,N,,2025-12-31 01:12:21.821913

However, as the EV market matures, reliance on such financial stimuli becomes less sustainable due to increasing numbers of EVs and societal pressure to downsize public spending (Albrahim et al., 2019). The progressive phase-out of policy instruments is crucial once the consumer cost differential between EVs and internal combustion engine alternatives diminishes, thereby ensuring that the market can stand on its own without perpetual subsidies (Karlsson et al., 2016). This transition necessitates a careful calibration of policy wind-downs to prevent market disruptions, as abrupt policy reversals can introduce significant uncertainty for both consumers and industry stakeholders (Bhardwaj et al., 2025). Indeed, the gradual reduction and eventual elimination of incentives should align with declining battery costs, which are projected to make EVs more accessible (Nafde, 2024). This strategy mirrors global trends where successful EV policy support, like that seen in Norway, eventually transitions from direct financial incentives to broader ecosystem enhancements, such as charging infrastructure development and regulatory measures (Figenbaum et al., 2015; Lindsay & Emimal, 2023). However, abruptly ceasing these financial incentives could significantly impede the sales trajectory of battery electric vehicles, potentially delaying widespread adoption by as much as a decade (Broadbent et al., 2022). Stakeholders acknowledge that government incentives bolster sales, yet their effectiveness is often hampered by partial implementation and opaque procedures (Adzhani et al., 2025). Furthermore, while governmental support is critical for spurring technological progress by sharing research and development risks, the ultimate business models for electric vehicles should aim for self-sufficiency (Ziegler & Abdelkafi, 2021). The transition away from incentives must be carefully managed, as premature withdrawal before price parity with internal combustion engine vehicles is achieved could significantly hinder market growth (Albrahim et al., 2019; O'Neill et al., 2020). This is because the sudden removal of financial aid, such as exemptions from purchase stamp duty and vehicle goods and services tax, can make battery electric vehicles disproportionately more expensive than internal combustion engine vehicles, deterring potential buyers (Broadbent et al., 2022). This pricing disparity, combined with the lack of robust charging infrastructure, could severely impede the market penetration of EVs, particularly in regions where initial adoption rates have been heavily reliant on financial inducements (Jurlin, 2023). Moreover, the effectiveness of financial incentives in driving EV adoption is evident in markets such as Europe and Asia, where substantial consumer financial incentives have correlated with dramatic increases in sales growth (Broadbent et al., 2022). However, the removal of these incentives, particularly in nascent markets, could reintroduce the significant upfront cost barrier, previously offset by subsidies, thereby diminishing consumer willingness to adopt EVs (Haldankar et al., 2024). This reduction in consumer demand would subsequently disincentivize further investment in charging infrastructure, thereby creating a negative feedback loop that further constrains EV market expansion (Broadbent et al., 2022). Such a scenario could lead to a protracted period of stagnation in EV adoption, making it challenging to meet ambitious decarbonization targets (Broadbent et al., 2022). Moreover, the absence of incentives would likely exacerbate existing challenges such as high upfront costs and range anxiety, as consumers would face the full economic burden of EV ownership without governmental support (Javadnejad et al., 2023; Knittel & Tanaka, 2025). The efficacy of various fiscal and non-fiscal incentives in overcoming such barriers has been extensively studied, revealing that purchasing subsidies and tax exemptions are particularly effective in making EVs more competitive with conventional vehicles, especially when targeted at specific consumer groups (Candra, 2022; Qadir et al., 2024). Without these incentives, the economic disparity between EVs and traditional internal combustion engine vehicles becomes more pronounced, posing a significant hurdle for widespread market penetration (Javadnejad et al., 2023). This is primarily due to the elevated purchase cost of EVs, which remains a significant deterrent despite long-term savings, largely driven by expensive battery technology and limited economies of scale (Knittel & Tanaka, 2025; Sathyan et al., 2024). Consequently, the absence of incentives could perpetuate the perception of EVs as luxury items, limiting their accessibility to a broader demographic and hindering their integration into mainstream transportation (Broadbent et al., 2022; Liang & Li, 2023). This challenge is further compounded by the limited availability and accessibility of charging infrastructure, which, without incentives, would continue to lag behind the rapid expansion required to support a growing EV fleet (Lindsay & Emimal, 2023). The withdrawal of purchase subsidies, without corresponding countervailing measures, has been shown to result in substantial decreases in electric vehicle market share, with some estimates suggesting a drop of 21% to 42% (Nie et al., 2022). This substantial decline underscores the critical role incentives play in bridging the price gap between EVs and conventional vehicles, especially during early market development phases. For instance, analyses of the US and Dutch markets reveal that the abrupt cessation or significant reduction of subsidies directly correlates with a substantial collapse in EV sales (Mantulet, 2020). For example, when Georgia eliminated its $5,000 tax credit for EV purchases, sales plummeted by approximately 85% (Albrahim et al., 2019). Such dramatic decreases highlight the significant impact of financial incentives on consumer purchasing decisions, particularly for a technology with a higher upfront cost like electric vehicles (Wahab & Jiang, 2019; Zhou & Li, 2015). The initial purchase price disparity between EVs and internal combustion engine vehicles, driven by higher manufacturing costs, remains a primary consideration for car buyers (Bridi et al., 2024; Cruz & Tolentino, 2023). This high initial outlay acts as a significant barrier for many consumers, limiting widespread adoption even when long-term operational costs might be lower (Guo, 2024). The battery pack, constituting roughly two-thirds of the electric powertrain's cost, is the single largest contributor to this higher production cost in battery electric vehicles compared to equivalent internal combustion engine vehicles (Broadbent et al., 2022). In 2022, the average manufacturer suggested retail price for an EV in the United States was over $65,000, significantly higher than the $48,000 for internal combustion engine vehicles, primarily due to the mineral-intensive nature of EV battery manufacturing (See et al., 2024). Even substantial reductions in battery costs, such as a drop from $161/kWh to $100/kWh, would only reduce the average EV MSRP by a modest $1,525, insufficient to offset the observed price differences between EVs and ICEVs (See et al., 2024). Despite an 89% decrease in battery pack prices since 2011, the inflation-adjusted Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price of the average EV has continued to climb due to simultaneous increases in horsepower and feature density (See et al., 2024). However, decreasing battery costs have still offered substantial savings, with a $1/kWh decline in lagged battery costs associating with a $25 reduction in EV MSRP, accumulating to approximately $30,750 in savings between 2011 and 2023 (See et al., 2024). Despite these past savings, projections indicate that cost parity between mid-range EVs and internal combustion engines may not be achieved until after 2025, thereby prolonging the necessity of subsidies to maintain affordability and market competitiveness (Jetin, 2023).

This is the legacy she connects to decades of drinking water contaminated with trichloroethylene, also known as TCE, on Tucson’s south side.

Sitting at a concrete picnic table outside the Pueblo Neighborhood Center, Herrera, 73, remembers how water contaminated with TCE — from about the 1940s to the 1980s — impacted her family, and how it led to her involvement in advocating for clean water for more than 30 years.

For decades, families on Tucson’s south side have lived with the consequences of water contamination: burying loved ones, organizing for accountability and forcing federal and local agencies to reckon with the damage. Many of these families helped build Southern Arizona’s environmental justice movement. Now, as they age, longtime advocates like Herrera are focused on something else: ensuring that the history and unfinished fight for clean water are passed to a new generation.

Herrera’s mother, Josie Herrera lived to be 96, but was diagnosed in her 60s with a rare, deadly cancer.

“She went through surgery and treatment. She had a cadaver bone put in her jaw. Part of her hip was taken to put in her jaw, to rebuild the jaw, because the cancer just ate away, so she ended up with no teeth,” Herrera says.

“It was horrible watching my mother try to recover and eat,” she says. Her voice catches. She holds back tears.

Her mother later developed leukemia as well. Her last two years were the most painful, Herrera says.

She pauses for a moment, looks up at the sky, a moment of silence before she talks about her sister’s battle with cancer and about her many Sunnyside High School classmates who died of cancer.

Her sister, Becki Quintero, also was diagnosed with cancer. She’s in her 70s.

“She is a survivor, and I hope she continues to be a survivor,” Herrera says.

Quintero’s son, James, died of cancer. Non-hodgkin’s lymphoma. He was in his 40s.

“He had the one that you can survive. But he did not,” she said. “After a year plus of treatment, he just didn’t make it.”

Another sister, Cecelia Herrera, also is a cancer survivor.

Since at least the early 1950s, Hughes Aircraft, the U.S. Air Force and other companies discharged TCE and other contaminants, an industrial solvent that at the time was used to degrease planes, into areas of Tucson’s south side. Some, including Herrera, say the pollution started in the 1940s, when three massive hangars — where military aircraft were cleaned — were built at the Tucson International Airport near San Xavier District of the Tohono O’odham Nation.

In 1942, Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation (later a division of General Dynamics) built the hangars to modify B-24 bombers, according to the Tucson Airport Authority.

The contamination resulted in cancer cases and other rare illnesses from drinking the water until the wells were closed by 1983.

At the time, TCE in Tucson’s water source was just one of many toxic waste dumps across the country. As communities started learning about how toxic waste could impact their health and drawing national attention to it, Congress established the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act in 1980, more commonly known as Superfund. The law created a tax on chemical and petroleum industries. It also established broad federal “authority to respond directly to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances that may endanger public health or the environment,” using trust fund revenue generated from the taxes to clean up hazardous waste sites..

The Environmental Protection Agency added the Tucson International Airport Area to the Superfund list in 1983. The approximately 24-square mile site includes the airport, parts of Tohono O’odham Nation, South Tucson residential areas and Air Force Plant #44. The federally-owned military plant is a weapons manufacturing facility operated by Raytheon Missile Systems Company, formerly Hughes Missile Systems, according to the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality.

An EPA investigation cited one source of the contamination: Air Force Plant #44.

The contaminated groundwater at the site is part of the Santa Cruz Basin — the aquifer Tucsn uses as its principal source of water. Contaminated city wells in the area have been shut down.

The decades-long fight to clean up the contamination continues today with leaders like Herrera —- who co-chairs a Superfund community advisory board — involving young people in holding the government accountable for protecting their health and making their water safe to drink again.

Taking the torch from her father

In the early 1980s, Herrera’s father, Manuel Herrera Jr., and community organizer Lorraine Lee traveled to Washington D.C. to raise awareness about the rare illnesses they were seeing in their community.

“Dad ended up being a community advocate from age 55 until, pretty much until he passed away,” she says. Manuel Herrera Jr. died in 2021.

It took years of public pressure, including extensive community organizing by Tucson’s south side families, an investigative journalism series by Jane Kay with the Arizona Daily Star, and a series of lawsuits before Hughes Aircraft, city officials and other parties would admit to any wrongdoing.

In June 1985, a month after Kay’s series was published, Tucsonans for a Clean Environment was formed. By then, community members already knew their drinking water had been polluted by the military industry. A school teacher kept a list of neighbors who had become ill, and hundreds of residents had shared their stories with Kay, as she reported on the contamination.

Members of Tucsonans for a Clean Environment would be the first in a long line of environmental justice advocates from Southern Arizona.

Manuel Herrera Jr. was a founding member of the Sunnyside Neighborhood Association in 1988. He also helped create the Unified Community Advisory Board in 1995, which allowed residents to have a formal voice in the EPA’s clean-up process.

The advisory group provides “a public forum for community members to present and discuss their needs and concerns related to the Superfund decision-making process,” as well as offers EPA officials an opportunity “to hear and seriously consider community preferences for site cleanup and remediation,” according to the EPA.

Yolanda Herrera joined the Sunnyside Neighborhood Association and started attending advisory board meetings in the early 1990s, after her father suggested she get involved. She is now the community co-chair.

In a video interview currently on display at Tucson’s Museum of Contemporary Art, part of the exhibit Living With Injury, Herrera tells the interviewer, environmental scientist Denise Moreno Ramírez, that the Unified Community Advisory Board was created so residents could speak to the government agencies responsible for the water contamination.

“And look them in the eye and ask them the hard questions and make sure that they weren’t going to try to lessen the effects that we were suffering,” Herrera says in the video. “We needed to be in front of them so that they know what they did to this community.”

The MOCA exhibit was co-curated by environmental scientist Sunaura Taylor, who wrote a book about southside Tucson’sTCE contamination and the struggle for environmental justice, titled, “Disabled Ecologies: Lessons from a Wounded Desert.” Taylor’s book examines the contaminations “ripple effects through the largely Mexican American community.

Fellow curator, historian Alisha Vasquez is co-director of the Mexican American Heritage and History Museum at the Sosa-Carrillo House. The exhibit features work by artists, journalists, and researchers including Alex! Jimenez, Franc Contreras, and Ramírez. It’s part of Survival and Resistance, a yearlong project that aims to acknowledge the harm Tucsonans experienced and to celebrate the progress and knowledge of southside organizers.

Herrera said it’s important to continue to pass down that knowledge. In her decades of volunteer organizing, Herrera has worked with national and local leaders to make sure residents’ voices are taken into account as the EPA continues to clean up chemical pollution left behind. She has also worked to educate younger generations so that they can step up and continue to advocate for clean, healthy water for Tucsonans.

“We do need to encourage younger people to pick up the torch, get involved, learn about what happened, because until they learn it, it runs the risk of repeating itself,” Herrera says. “We need somebody to continue to hold our elected officials’ feet to the fire.”

El Pueblo Neighborhood Center became a hub for community members trying to organize and hold powerful companies accountable. It’s where the Unified Community Advisory Board first met and continues meeting quarterly. The El Pueblo Health Center hosted a TCE program where people impacted by the contamination could be screened and receive healthcare for certain illnesses.

In November, the El Pueblo 50 exhibition launched, commemorating 50 years of the neighborhood center’s history and its role as a community gathering space. Part of the exhibit highlights the fight for justice and accountability as TCE chemicals harmed families in the surrounding neighborhood.

“The people who literally pay with their lives”

Herrera served on the curation team for El Pueblo 50, alongside a group of other longtime residents and city leaders. Raul Aguirre, a longtime Chicano community leader and organizer, was also among that group. Aguirre was a radio show host in the early 80s. His talk show was titled, “Tabúes y Realidades: Pláticas de la Vida.”

While he wasn’t in the meeting rooms where community members gathered to demand accountability, Aguirre used his radio platform to educate the community and hold local politicians accountable. He brought in doctors, scientists, advocates, and the local elected officials “that were supposed to be doing something about this,” Aguirre says.

Aguirre was a close friend of Lorraine Lee, the Tucson community organizer and leader who traveled in the 1980s with Herrera’s father to the nation’s capital to raise awareness about the rare illnesses in their neighborhoods. They met at Pueblo High School, where he was her unofficial campaign manager when she ran for class president.

In college, he recruited her to help him reactivate the University of Arizona chapter of MEChA, which stands for Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan, or the Chicano Student Movement of Aztlan, a student movement founded in 1969.

“She became very active in, you know, advocating for funding, advocating for investigations, advocating for the community of the south side,” Aguirre says.

By then, Lorraine Lee was a leader at Chicanos Por La Causa. In that role, she made connections with other national advocacy organizations. Aguirre credits her leadership and those connections at least partially to Tucson becoming a Superfund site.

Lorraine Lee died of throat cancer in 2007 at 52. She left behind a legacy of social justice and organizing work. As Aguirre walked through the Living with Injury exhibit on opening night in November, he felt sad knowing people had to die because of a lack of awareness or consciousness. He says it’s important to commemorate those who fought for a cleaner environment and suffered from the contamination.

“The memorials are important because those are the people who literally pay with their lives for lack of responsibility on behalf of, you know, some of the corporations and the institutions,” Aguirre says. “So I think it’s very, very important that we honor the leadership of people like Lorraine, and people who are alive, you know that are still contributing.”

“La lucha continua, the struggle continues”

In December, about a month after the Living with Injury exhibit opened at the MOCA, more than a hundred Tucsonans, many who grew up in the south side, gather near the playground at Mission Manor Park.

About a dozen people at the park hold a printed photo of their loved one who died of water contamination. They are here to see Alex! Jimenez’s new mural, “Groundwater Embodied,” a mosaic of colorful clay tiles depicting a body lying in the desert above water. Jimenez grew up on Tucson’s south side, and her artwork has centered the Sonoran Desert and water.

For the mural, Jimenez invited community members throughout the year to make clay tiles with their loved ones’ names or tiles in the shape of the body parts that were affected. The tiles with names, in the shape of a wave, were painted blue to depict water.

Before the mural unveiling, community organizers and elected leaders who grew up in the south side speak about the impact of TCE and of the region’s environmental justice movement. The sounds of creaking swings, children laughing, a basketball bouncing on the court, fills the background as Eduardo Quintana slowly walks up a ramp onto the stage and takes the microphone.

Quintana is a former employee at Hughes Aircraft and a union organizer. He helped found Tucsonans for a Clean Environment and has run for office under the Green Party several times.

“I’m shocked to be here with a megaphone in my hand and surrounded by all you people,” he says. “But needless to say, la lucha continua, the struggle continues, and it’s because of the young people, the 40-year-olds like Alicia. They’re not going to let it go, because they’re either victims, or their relatives are victims or the people who died. They will never, ever be forgotten, and that’s why the struggle will continue.”

Quintana is also featured in the MOCA exhibit. In a video interview, he tells Moreno Ramírez that the goal of Tucsonans for a Clean Environment was to get justice. He said that hasn’t happened yet.

“People lost family members,” he said. “There were deaths. People have been sick for decades, suffering.”

Before the city and aircraft companies admitted wrongdoing, members of Tucsonans for a Clean Environment knocked on doors and surveyed their neighbors. They used pins on a map to track where people were getting sick. That map almost mirrored the EPA’s map of the plume, where the highest concentration of illnesses were found closest to the wells.

“This is generational”

Eva Carrillo Dong spent a lot of time at Mission Manor Park with her close friend Dorrie Ann Duarte in high school. They played in a girls softball team at the park. And they drank water from the park’s fountains. This was in the early 1970s, before they knew the water they were drinking was contaminated and would make them sick.

Duarte was diagnosed with liver cancer and died months later. She was 23.

“She was the one I was supposed to grow old with and be on a rocking chair with, you know, talking about the good old days,” Carrillo Dong says, leaning on a cane and wearing a mask to protect herself.

Carrillo Dong has two autoimmune diseases. Because of the water contamination, family members have been diagnosed with brain tumors, liver tumors, and other cancers, she says.

That includes her father, Clemente Trejo Carrillo, and her brother, Tony Carrillo. Those who didn’t die early have seen their quality of life affected by autoimmune diseases like lupus and Sjögren’s Disease. Some women in the community have not been able to conceive, she says.

“We didn’t know that when we were 15, 16 years old, and losing parents and losing grandparents, that eventually it would come to us too, and that we would eventually become ill,” Carrillo Dong says. “And now our children have, you know, different things that are going on with them. So this is generational. It’s not just one generation, not just my parents’ generation, but it’s our generation. It’s my children’s generation.”

As generations continue to be affected by the water contamination, those same generations have organized and continue to hold leaders accountable.

Carrillo Dong watched and participated in discussions regarding water clean up, but she felt that things were moving too slow. So she worked with Roberto Jaramillo and other organizers to educate city leaders. In 2015, Carrillo Dong and Roberto Jaramillo founded Las Aguas, an organization that aims to educate people about water contamination in Tucson’s southside since the 1940’s.

Carrillo Dong is a former Sunnyside Unified School District board member. She says it’s important to continue educating youth about what happened with Tucson’s water. She hopes they continue to step up and hold elected leaders accountable for finally making their water safe to drink.

“I reflected a lot on my friend because we spent so much time at this park,” she says, holding back tears. “Having so much fun, so many good memories.”

Once the line of people taking photos in front of the mural subsides, Carillo Dong walks up to the mural and silently reads the names on the blue tiles. She places her hand on the tile with her childhood friend’s name, then on the names of family members, taking a moment to reflect on their memory.

A High-Stakes Crossroads for U.S. Clean Energy Energy markets also feel the shock.","The U.S. offshore wind sector has been thrown into uncertainty after the Trump administration announced an immediate pause on all large-scale offshore wind projects already under construction. The Interior Department said the decision stems from “national security risks” flagged by recently completed classified reports from the Department of War. Officials argue the pause gives time to reassess whether these risks can be reduced through mitigation measures.

However, the move has triggered intense pushback from states, developers, utilities, grid operators, and industry groups. Many warn that the decision could raise electricity prices, delay clean energy deployment, threaten investments, hurt reliability, and undermine years of planning and regulatory approvals.

Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said:

“The prime duty of the United States government is to protect the American people. Today’s action addresses emerging national security risks, including the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies, and the vulnerabilities created by large-scale offshore wind projects with proximity near our east coast population centers. The Trump administration will always prioritize the security of the American people.”

National Security Concerns Take Center Stage

According to the Interior Department, the pause affects major U.S. offshore wind projects, including:

The following leases are paused:

Vineyard Wind 1 (OCS-A 0501)

Revolution Wind (OCS-A 0486)

CVOW – Commercial (OCS-A 0483)

Sunrise Wind (OCS-A 0487)

Empire Wind 1 (OCS-A 0512)

Officials claim large offshore wind turbines can interfere with national defense radar systems. Their rotating blades and reflective towers can create what’s called “radar clutter,” which may obscure real targets or generate false signals — a concern highlighted in earlier U.S. government assessments. A 2024 Department of Energy report noted that raising radar thresholds to reduce this clutter could also mean missing actual threats.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum framed the pause as a security-first decision, saying the administration must prioritize protecting Americans amid evolving adversary capabilities.

Industry Pushes Back: “We’ve Already Cleared Defense Reviews”

The BBC reported that developers and energy leaders strongly dispute the need for the pause. Dominion Energy, developer of the major Virginia offshore wind project, stressed that its site is far offshore and has not caused security issues. The company noted its two pilot turbines have operated for five years without any national security concerns. Still, Dominion’s stock fell over 3% following the announcement, while Danish developer Ørsted sank 12%, and turbine maker Vestas dropped 2.6%.

Similarly, S&P Global also highlighted that the National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA) called the action unnecessary. President Erik Milito said all projects under construction had already passed Department of Defense coordination and clearance through rigorous legal processes. He urged the administration to end the pause quickly and highlighted that defense officials were engaged at every permitting stage.

The same S&P Global report also cited that the Oceantic Network, representing the offshore wind industry, called the decision a “veiled attempt” to derail offshore wind progress, arguing it contradicts years of multi-agency review and previous Pentagon approvals. The network warned the pause could delay nearly 6 GW of new power capacity — at a time of rapidly rising electricity demand — while driving prices higher and discouraging investment.

Political and Legal Fallout Intensifies

Governors and state leaders are sounding alarm bells. Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont criticized the decision as “erratic,” saying it will raise electricity costs and disrupt jobs and predictability for businesses. Many of these projects are nearing completion or already supplying power, and states argue that sudden federal reversals undermine economic confidence.

The pause also arrives after the administration has suffered multiple legal defeats. Earlier in December, a federal judge rejected a broader wind project ban, calling it “arbitrary and capricious.” Courts also blocked attempts to halt Revolution Wind and overturned the January permitting freeze. Analysts at ClearView Energy Partners suggested the timing of the new pause may be a strategic response — a “counterpunch” to recent judicial losses.

Meanwhile, 17 states led by New York are already challenging earlier wind restrictions, calling them an “existential threat” to the U.S. wind industry. That broader political and legal confrontation is now expected to deepen.

Grid Reliability Concerns: “We Need Every Electron”

Energy security isn’t just about defense — it’s also about keeping the lights on. Former FERC Chairman Neil Chatterjee sharply criticized the pause, calling it reckless at a time when the U.S. needs every available power source. With electricity demand projected to surge — especially from artificial intelligence data centers — offshore wind plays a growing role in supporting grid reliability.

ISO New England echoed the concern. Vineyard Wind is already feeding power to the grid, while Revolution Wind is expected to be online by 2026. Both are built into regional power planning and winter reliability strategies, when offshore wind often performs strongest while other energy supplies tighten. Pausing or canceling them, ISO warned, would raise costs and increase reliability risks.

Offshore Wind Was Finally Gaining Momentum: Wood Mackenzie

Before the pause, the U.S. offshore wind market was finally building traction after years of delays, inflation pressures, supply chain constraints, and permitting battles. Wood Mackenzie projected strong growth ahead, forecasting 46 GW of new U.S. wind capacity from 2025 to 2029 across onshore and offshore projects combined.

The U.S. offshore sector had begun recovering from cost overruns and contract cancellations. Near-term projects targeting 2026 commercial operation were advancing, even though post-2027 developments still faced hurdles like limited installation vessel capacity and tariff uncertainty. Major players like Ørsted and Equinor were restructuring finances and navigating policy headwinds, but momentum was slowly returning.

Wood Mackenzie expected total national wind capacity to reach nearly 197 GW by the end of the decade — including 6 GW of offshore wind. A peak year of 12 GW or more installations was forecast for 2027. This new federal pause now threatens to disrupt that trajectory.

A High-Stakes Crossroads for U.S. Clean Energy

Energy markets also feel the shock. S&P Global reported growing concern within the sector that halting projects could tighten power supply and worsen price pressures, especially in high-demand regions like the Northeast.

MarketNewsUpdates.com News Commentary

NEW YORK, Dec. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Zero-carbon nuclear electricity plays a critical role in the global transition to clean energy by providing reliable, large-scale power with virtually no direct greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike intermittent renewable sources such as wind and solar, nuclear plants operate at high capacity factors, delivering steady baseload electricity regardless of weather or time of day. This reliability makes nuclear power especially valuable for decarbonizing industrial sectors and supporting electric grids with growing shares of variable renewables, while maintaining energy security. Industry research indicates that the global nuclear power market is expected to grow steadily into 2026. Multiple market analysts project the market value to be in the approximate range of $38–42 billion in 2026. One report estimates the market at about $40.48 billion in 2025 and rising to roughly $41.68 billion in 2026, reflecting a multi-year expansion trend as nuclear capacity increases worldwide and investments in plant life extensions and new builds continue. - The market for zero-carbon nuclear electricity is shaped by policy frameworks, capital costs, and technological innovation. Government support through carbon pricing, clean energy standards, and long-term power purchase agreements has become a key driver of new investments and life-extension projects for existing reactors. At the same time, advanced reactor designs—including small modular reactors (SMRs)—are gaining attention for their potential to reduce upfront costs, improve safety, and serve niche markets such as remote regions, data centers, and industrial heat applications. Active companies in the markets this week include DevvStream Corp. (NASDAQ: DEVS), XCF Global Inc. (NASDAQ: SAFX), Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (NASDAQ: DJT), Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ: CEG) and NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR).

Despite its advantages, the nuclear electricity market faces challenges that affect competitiveness, including high initial investment requirements, long project timelines, and public perception concerns related to safety and waste management. However, as countries commit to net-zero targets and seek firm, zero-carbon power sources, nuclear energy is increasingly viewed as a complement to renewables rather than a competitor. This evolving perspective is driving renewed interest in nuclear electricity as a strategic asset within a diversified, low-carbon energy market. Looking ahead, the zero-carbon nuclear electricity market is positioned for measured but durable growth. Challenges remain—particularly around project execution, waste management, and public acceptance—but the macro drivers of decarbonization, electrification, and energy security are structural and long-term. As grids demand clean, reliable power at scale, nuclear energy is likely to secure a larger and more resilient role in the global electricity mix, supporting both climate objectives and economic competitiveness.

DevvStream, Southern, IP3, and XCF to Evaluate Development of America-First Nuclear Power, Advanced Fuels, and Digital Environmental Asset Monetization - Potential to advance next-generation eSAF pathways by pairing continuous clean electricity with electrolysis, hydrogen production, and low-carbon fuel synthesis - DevvStream Corp. (NASDAQ: DEVS) ($DEVS) (""DevvStream""), a leading carbon management and environmental-asset monetization firm, today announced a non-binding memorandum of understanding (""MOU"") to evaluate a strategic collaboration focused on small modular reactor (""SMR"") nuclear power development, electro-sustainable aviation fuel (""eSAF"") production, and the creation, verification, and monetization of eligible environmental attributes alongside IP3 Corporation (""IP3""), Southern Energy Renewables Inc. (""Southern""), and XCF Global Inc. (NASDAQ: SAFX) (""XCF"") (together ""the parties"").

The MOU outlines a proposed integrated framework to assess the development and deployment of firm, zero-carbon nuclear electricity from SMRs to support clean fuel production and energy-intensive end markets, including AI data centers, while enabling robust environmental-attribute structures that may meet evolving compliance, reporting, and market standards. The MOU also outlines a framework to explore the development and deployment of SMR-generated electricity to support existing and future operating assets, including a potential nuclear power solution for a proposed SAF refinery in Louisiana, and to enable a scalable portfolio of verifiable environmental attributes.

If pursued, the parties intend to advance reliable, zero-carbon nuclear power to enable continuous electrolysis, hydrogen production, and downstream fuel synthesis, while also supporting excess clean-power offtake for third-party customers where appropriate.

The parties also intend to evaluate, as part of the negotiation of definitive agreements, environmental-attribute structures associated with eSAF and related low-carbon fuel pathways, including emerging ""book-and-claim"" and SAF certificate frameworks that allow airlines and corporate buyers to access verified in-sector emissions reduction attributes when physical fuel delivery is constrained.

In parallel, and pending the execution of definitive agreements, the MOU contemplates future development of digital infrastructure to enhance transparency, provenance, and auditability, including tokenization of eligible environmental assets and the use of digital measurement, reporting, and verification (""MRV"") systems to support data quality, provenance, and auditability.

""Together, we are exploring real-world asset and tokenized environmental-asset frameworks with the potential to unlock additional value, improve liquidity, and help lower the delivered cost of clean energy and fuels,"" said Sunny Trinh, Chief Executive Officer of DevvStream. ""We see this as a potential America-first model that combines U.S. resources, digital infrastructure, and scalable markets.""

""This MOU reflects our focus on putting American energy, infrastructure, and production first,"" said Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern Energy Renewables. ""As the development of advanced nuclear platforms gain momentum, we believe the goal of developing and deploying firm, domestic power is becoming essential for fuels, manufacturing, and data-driven industries. We are committed to exploring how nuclear power, combined with U.S. biomass resources, can enable an integrated, multi-product approach that strengthens U.S. industrial leadership while remaining globally competitive.""

RDML (Ret.) Mike Hewitt, Chief Executive Officer of IP3, added: ""Clean, reliable nuclear power is increasingly being pursued as foundational infrastructure for American energy security and industrial growth. We are excited to explore a strategic relationship with XCF, DevvStream, and Southern, including the potential deployment of small modular reactor technology to provide firm power and support e‑SAF production for European markets. IP3's business model to develop infrastructure projects to privatize Small Modular Reactors for multiple offtakers such as AI and data centers that support government and commercial requirements. We believe pairing firm power development with practical environmental‑asset design and monetization can create a differentiated platform that meets real customer demand while delivering the transparency the market expects.""

Gas turbines provide firm capacity and remain the option for many large players deploying data centers.
Lastly, dual-use climate technologies with superior unit economics that happen to strengthen domestic supply chains.
But there will be a lot more talk of a build-out bubble (in data centers, not electricity generation).
Yes, there’s been massive excitement around everything connected to data centers, energy generation, storage, transmission, cooling.","There will still be the need for more power, though, and investors saw geothermal, nuclear, solar, and batteries as having benefited from the boom. “Zero-carbon generation is already among the cheapest sources of power, and growing demand for both grid-scale and distributed batteries is accelerating cost reductions faster than expected,” said Daniel Goldman, managing partner at Clean Energy Ventures.

Investors also acknowledged the AI bubble might burst; some voiced skepticism about whether it would drag the energy sector down with it.

“Could a bubble burst in 2026? Sure,” said Kyle Teamey, managing partner at RA Capital Planetary Health. But it’s not likely to affect infrastructure plans, he added. “The spending for 2026 is already budgeted. The train has left the station.”

Andrew Beebe, managing director at Obvious Ventures, thinks the data center bubble might burst in 2026 or early 2027, but that no such bubble exists in electricity generation. “We still need a LOT more power, and we’ll use that — no build-out bubble there … yet.”

Outside of AI and data centers, Anil Achyuta, partner at Energy Impact Partners, said reindustrialization will take more of the spotlight this year. “We need to rebuild supply chains for systems that require multiple components and complex flowsheets,” he said, citing robotics, batteries, and power electronics as examples.

The continuing quest for power

Thanks to the drumbeat of new data center announcements, energy-related startups have gotten a boost this past year, perhaps none more than those working on nuclear fission. In the last few weeks, nuclear startups have announced rounds totaling over $1 billion, leading to speculation that many will SPAC or go public through a traditional IPO in 2026.

“Nuclear everything is in vogue right now,” Teamey said.

But it will take a while for nuclear power to make a dent in electricity demand. In the meantime, tech companies and data center developers have been turning to solar and batteries as inexpensive, rapidly deployable power sources. Grid-scale batteries, in particular, have been a major beneficiary, seeing record-setting deployments in 2025. As alternative battery chemistries like sodium-ion and zinc come to market, they stand to lower costs and drive further adoption.

“We’ll see growth in 2026 with new plays on [battery] chemistry and business models.” said Leo Banchik, director at Voyager. “One of the key lessons from earlier failures was scaling gigafactories before proving demand or achieving better unit economics than the status quo. The new wave is more disciplined.”

Several investors felt geothermal would step in to help fill the void in the coming years. It helps that investors see enhanced geothermal as a relatively mature technology that’s ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026.

“Geothermal will be hot on solar’s heals in terms of new generation,” said Joshua Posamentier, managing partner at Congruent Ventures. “Natural gas assets are growing pretty linearly. There’s not much new capacity in turbine manufacturing coming online, and they’re selling everything they can. Geothermal will go geometric.”

And while AI is helping to drive demand, companies and technologies that think beyond the data center will benefit the most, said Laurie Menoud, founding partner at At One Ventures. “Data centers are one demand driver, not the whole market.”

Which startup is most likely to go public in 2026?

Not everyone was in agreement or would proffer a guess. But among those who did, several said nuclear or geothermal startups were most likely to go public, either via IPO or SPAC.

The name mentioned most was Fervo, the enhanced geothermal startup that recently raised a $462 million round. The company is widely seen as a leader in the sector and is in the midst of building a 500-megawatt development in Utah that should serve as a template for future power plants. Tapping the public markets would give the company more reserves to tackle additional projects.

Trends to watch

Beyond data centers, investors are interested in a range of technologies and sectors, including critical minerals, robotics, and software to manage the electrical grid.

“We should be paying more attention to grid execution as a category,” said Amy Duffuor, general partner at Azolla Ventures. “The quiet winners are companies that make interconnection, planning, and deployment faster software, hardware, and supply-chain solutions that help utilities actually move projects forward.”

Resiliency and adaptation will be big themes in 2026, according to Coca of Toyota Ventures and Posamentier of Congruent Ventures. Achyuta at EIP zeroed in on one potential application: robots that bury electrical transmission lines quicker and more cheaply than humans, mitigating wildfire risks and increasing the grid’s reliability.

Beebe, at Obvious Ventures, said that EV trucking would also be an area to watch. “One of the biggest pieces of news of 2026 is going to be the release and specs behind the Tesla Semi. The range and pricing of that vehicle will change that industry in ways as powerful as the Model S or 3.”

AI, of course, is likely to play a role in climate tech’s transformation. “We will see massive innovation where AI meets the physical world in 2026 on both the infrastructure and consumer app layers,” said Matt Rogers, founder at Incite and Mill. “Combining AI with smart hardware and physical infrastructure will ensure the transformation of trillion-dollar industries from manufacturing to life sciences to food systems.”

But it might also pay to keep an eye on technologies that have already been written off, said Bronson at SOSV. “When investors finally get tired of a sector and come to the conclusion it won’t pan out, that’s when the real breakthroughs finally happen,” he said.

Anil Achyuta, partner at Energy Impact Partner

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

Reindustrialization beyond data centers will be a major theme. We need to rebuild supply chains for systems that require multiple components and complex flowsheets. For example, supporting next-generation robotics to address labor shortages and national security concerns will require integrated supply chains. Batteries, power electronics, fuel cells, gas turbines, and even home building are examples of end markets/technologies where parts of the value chain will need to be reindustrialized.

Another area to watch is AI-driven physical science. While companies like Zanskar (predictive AI for geothermal) and Fabric8Labs (generative cooling for data centers) have shown promise, we haven’t seen many visible breakthroughs yet. That said, the talent pool working on these problems is impressive and could lead to exciting developments.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

Gas turbines provide firm capacity and remain the option for many large players deploying data centers. Beyond that, batteries — particularly sodium-ion — represent one of the most economical and near-term solutions at the grid-scale. I am bullish about the progress in this technology, and pairing solar with batteries (as companies like Peak Energy are doing) continues to be a highly attractive approach. Next-gen geothermal is also showing a good amount of promise but the timelines are like that of nuclear, potent but will take about a decade to bring full capacity online.

In addition, algorithmic solutions to unlock new power using existing infrastructure (e.g., Gridcare, ThinkLabs AI) and optimize workloads (e.g., Emerald AI) can further enhance grid efficiency. There are also other innovations worth noting in bringing more power, such as applying optical coating to transmission lines to reduce losses being advanced by AssetCool (an EIP portfolio company).

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

Fervo Energy, Commonwealth Fusion, Redwood Materials would be my personal guesses, but I could be wrong.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Sodium-ion batteries for grid-scale storage are already being deployed and will accelerate significantly in 2026. Another technology to watch is solid-state transformers (note Heron Power is an EIP portfolio company). The industry is advancing faster than expected and scale similarly to semiconductors, though at-scale production might take longer.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

One emerging trend is the underground build-out of transmission lines. Advances in robotics could enable a rapid, cost-effective approach that significantly reduces wildfire risk and, in turn, mitigates the substantial carbon emissions associated with such events.

Distributed power, heat, and computation are the last class of trends we are curiously tracking for 2026.

Leo Banchik, director at Voyager

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

Data centers will keep driving record power demand as AI workloads scale. Despite talk of overbuild, we’re unlikely to see much stranded capacity — as compute gets cheaper and more available, we’ll keep finding new uses for it. The interesting shift is hyperscalers differentiating between clean power sources — firm vs. intermittent, location, and additionality — rather than just headline megawatt-hours. This is already playing out in bespoke offtake deals and on-site supply strategies.

Fission and geothermal should see continued momentum from both private capital and federal support. Fusion will likely attract increased federal support as geopolitical competition intensifies, though we’re still many years away from high-capacity-factor grid-scale deployment.

Natural gas peaker alternatives will gain traction too — using new turbines and modular designs with integrated carbon capture as grids manage new peak demands from AI.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

Solar and battery build-out will continue given their strong economics. For dispatchable, 24/7 baseload power, we’ll see growth in fission, geothermal, and peaker alternatives like modular gas turbines with integrated carbon capture. There’s also a grid-edge opportunity worth watching: large facilities procuring dedicated baseload on-site rather than adding to grid congestion.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

Most likely fission or geothermal. These companies have raised substantial capital and built strong offtake agreements with hyperscalers and utilities. With multibillion-dollar project pipelines and the need for continued growth financing, several could pursue public markets in 2026.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Energy storage deployment is accelerating across residential, commercial, industrial (including data center backup), and grid-scale applications. Domestic supply chains, including second-life battery systems, are gaining traction for stationary storage. We’ll see growth in 2026 with new plays on chemistry and business models. One of the key lessons from earlier failures was scaling gigafactories before proving demand or achieving better unit economics than the status quo. The new wave is more disciplined.

Industrial heat pumps and thermal storage systems for steam and process heat are becoming cheaper to operate than gas boilers in many regions and applications, especially where waste heat is available and electricity prices are favorable.

We’ll also see more growth in critical minerals and battery materials projects — lithium, rare earth, magnesium refining; battery component and cell manufacturing; copper recycling — maturing with federal support as supply chain security becomes a strategic priority.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

Software and AI enabling physical infrastructure: real-time factory intelligence that improves energy efficiency and manufacturing yields, AI-based design tools that speed up product development cycles, grid management software that orchestrates intermittent renewables with storage and dispatchable power.

Companies taking a clean-sheet approach to reimagining foundational technologies — a SpaceX-style rethink of components once considered solved problems. Motor designs that eliminate rare earth dependencies, grid infrastructure like transformers with modern manufacturing techniques, advanced materials processing that significantly reduces costs while improving quality. Improvements in robotics help to enable these cost curves, making U.S. manufacturing economically viable where it wasn’t before.

Lastly, dual-use climate technologies with superior unit economics that happen to strengthen domestic supply chains. Defense and industrial policy are backing these not for climate reasons, but because they deliver cost advantages and supply security.

Andrew Beebe, managing director at Obvious Ventures

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

Data centers will again dominate. But there will be a lot more talk of a build-out bubble (in data centers, not electricity generation). We will live with the dual reality of too much money/debt spent on data centers, and the speculation bubble will likely burst (maybe early 2027). But at the same time, we’ll still need a LOT more power, and will use that — no build-out bubble there … yet.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

For power generation: geothermal in the near-term. Fission in the mid-term. Fusion in the 10-year-plus long-term. For actual siting: The above technologies can be sited anywhere, but mainly western states for geothermal. For batteries — PJM [the grid that covers the mid-Atlantic west to parts of Illinois] and Texas.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

Venture-backed: Fervo

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Geothermal and grid-scale batteries.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

Grid software and EV trucking. One of the biggest pieces of news of 2026 is going to be the release and specs behind the Tesla Semi. The range and pricing of that vehicle will change that industry in ways as powerful as the Model S or 3.

Po Bronson, managing director at SOSV’s IndieBio

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

I’m still hearing about an ever increasing concentration of effort and focus on data centers virtually every single day in meetings, especially with corporates. To some extent this is from “picks and shovels” companies who don’t want to get commoditized so they’re strategizing how to be a bigger player/more integrated rather than just a component that’s purchased.

A related phrase I hear more frequently is power density and/or specific power (power to weight), as a load of corporates are anticipating or planning how their energy divisions branch into robotics. Duncan Turner here is our expert.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

I don’t have a climate tech company in my portfolio going public in 2026. Tidal Vision is targeting 2027. That’s my closest. I don’t want to opine on other VC’s portfolio companies, even though I have my feelings, because I shouldn’t open my mouth where I’m only partially informed.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

For larger scales in 2026, my fastest scaling companies are Tidal Vision and Voyage Foods, which has taken over a General Motors plant in Ohio.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

On what to pay more attention to, I’ll toot Duncan’s horn here again — what he’s doing with the Plasma Forge is IMHO going to be super compelling and make everyone study at night.

One last note is my consistent feeling that it’s when investors finally get tired of a sector and come to the conclusion it won’t pan out that the real breakthroughs finally happen. I learned this lesson back in 1999 when we were all wondering if the search space was going to be won by Yahoo, AltaVista, Excite, Lycos, or Infoseek.

I do feel like that’s happening in my personal portfolio. I said this to AgFunder recently, but when the VC world asks about winning sectors, there’s a presumption that the sector will be so hot that there will be multiple winners. Most markets don’t have multiple winners, and the sector doesn’t win; just one company wins.

Tom Chi, founding partner at At One Ventures

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

There will be a lot more around data centers in 2026. They are creating their own financial ecosystem, and there is enough actual momentum in current AI efforts that I don’t see the hyperscalers pulling back in 2026.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

Budgets for hyperscalers are in the $50 billion to $100 billion range, which encompasses power, chips, and much more. The chips are expensive enough that folks are willing to pay a bit more to get power on the grid sooner as the losses from chip depreciation are greater than most things you could incrementally add to your power scale-up budget.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

IPO market still a bit murky, and most folks don’t telegraph exactly when they will go public.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Folks like Fervo are at an interesting inflection point. One of our portcos Provectus Algae is also at an interesting point.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

We’ve had a pretty big pendulum swing away from the more capital-intensive work in industrial decarbonization that aren’t in AI. They are still critical for our collective future, even if out of fashion for a few years.

Lisa Coca, partner at Toyota Ventures

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

In our view at Toyota Ventures, the 2026 data center energy conversation is likely to shift from demand to resilience and the need to accelerate plans to decouple from the grid.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

We believe that the biggest investment opportunities are in firm, dispatchable, and scalable carbon-free energy. We have actively invested in technologies that support increasing baseload power, both geothermal and nuclear, through portfolio companies such as Rodatherm and Natura Resources. For critical grid flexibility, we are backing advanced, long-duration energy storage battery technologies with an investment in e-Zinc.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

We anticipate that nuclear power will continue to lead the way in terms of IPOs and SPACs in 2026.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Challenging question since we believe it is more a function of how, and if, the capital stack continues to evolve. There is a healthy number of climate tech companies across multiple sectors that are on the cusp of deploying at a larger scale. The biggest hurdle is securing FOAK financing to de-risk the all-important step of advancing from first of a kind to nth of a kind.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

Our team expects resiliency and adaptation will continue to reign strong in 2026. The Toyota Ventures portfolio illustrates this: BurnBot addresses wildfire mitigation, ZymoChem bolsters supply chain resilience with sustainable materials, and Alora creates adaptable resource solutions.

Amy Duffuor, general partner at Azolla Ventures

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

My prediction is that the energy conversation shifts from generation of power to how fast power can actually be delivered. Interconnection timelines, permitting, and physical grid constraints continue to be a bottleneck and data centers will increasingly rely on hybrid strategies that blend grid power, storage, and demand flexibility to hit timelines.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

One opportunity is at grid-ready sites, like places with existing transmission and substation. Anything that shortens interconnection timelines creates outsized value right now because access to the grid is scarce. Also interested in wireless transmission of power even though it’s in the early stages.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

There has been a lot of talk about Fervo Energy…!

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Long-duration energy storage technology companies, which will move from initial pilots to demos to repeatable deployments. We’re particularly excited about our portfolio company Noon Energy.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

We should be paying more attention to grid execution as a category. The quiet winners are companies that make interconnection, planning, and deployment faster software, hardware, and supply-chain solutions that help utilities actually move projects forward.

Daniel Goldman, managing partner at Clean Energy Ventures

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

We expect to see an acceleration of deal making in the data center/hyperscaler space consisting of the following:

While we don’t expect an overall “bust cycle” for data center and hyperscaler development activities, we do expect some rationalization of development and implementation of efficiency options to reduce capacity needs.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

The greatest near-term opportunity — and challenge — lies in improving the grid itself. Grid modernization through digitalization, decarbonization, and decentralization will unlock cost savings, optimize existing infrastructure, and better integrate significant distributed energy resources — probably not saying anything new here. Zero-carbon generation is already among the cheapest sources of power, and growing demand for both grid-scale and distributed batteries is accelerating cost reductions faster than expected.

We expect this trend to continue despite recent policy shifts in the IRA and there are hundreds of venture capital-backed companies that can have a material impact on the grid as they scale-up and see more adoption rates in the market. Disruption is here!

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

Factorial appears to be a leading candidate following its plans to de-SPAC in 2026. Its trajectory illustrates that companies with strong customer traction in large markets, clear cost and performance advantages, and rapidly scaling revenues are well-positioned for the public markets. (This SPAC market contrasts with the 2020 one where entrants such as QuantumScape did not have meaningful revenues and perhaps were ill-prepared for public markets.)

Watch out for more companies hitting public markets on hype, instead of good fundamentals.

Beyond Factorial, several companies in energy storage, generation, and critical minerals are approaching scalable revenue levels to access low-cost of capital public markets (a real benefit), though in the minerals sector we may see growth in mergers and acquisitions precede any public offerings in 2026.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Projects in energy storage, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), critical minerals, and material manufacturing facilities across the energy supply chain will see significant investment in the U.S., with manufacturing tax credits and attractive market opportunities still available notwithstanding federal policy headwinds.

In 2025, we extensively evaluated and developed new risk transfer solutions for FOAK project developers. We see commercial lenders and private credit starting to lean more heavily into this space with the support of insurance underwriting and catalytic capital. We expect to see more projects and more debt financing for early commercialization, which up until this point has only trickled in. This is the key enabler of the greater scale we need across the industry.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

For western markets to compete with China’s manufacturing and increasingly innovation prowess, financial innovation is CRITICAL. Global markets need to deploy $3 trillion to $9 trillion per year through 2050 on climate related technologies and implementation of projects if we hope to reduce global temperatures and compete in these markets internationally. Global spending on climate related investment was only $2 trillion in 2024 and is on a path for a similar amount in 2025.

To increase the rate of deployment, we must convince public and private investors that the risk-return balance is favorable to deploy capital across the climate capital stack — early-stage venture, growth-stage venture, private equity, commercial lending and private credit, and infrastructure. Our sector is not attracting enough capital; in simple terms, risks need to decline or returns need to increase.

We see opportunities to use risk-sharing mechanisms to optimize capital stacks and lower the cost of capital for new technology projects, which also brings them down the cost curve faster. Promising solutions include technology and performance risk insurance, surety bonds for managing construction risks, pooling off-take agreements among buyer groups (e.g., hyperscalers for clean power or airlines for SAF), filling gaps in construction financing, and more. Clean Energy Ventures’ spent time during 2025 identifying new risk transfer solutions working closely with our counterparts in the finance and insurance sectors. We believe 2026 will see more innovative financing solutions enabling faster scaling of climate technologies.

We should also be paying very close attention to cost curves. The impact of AI is showing up but not being widely reported in climate tech. Inside large companies and small startups the benefits of AI are driving costs down, allowing faster innovation at complex facilities and in supply chains. This is apparent in chemicals, mining and refining, power generation and grid optimization, manufacturing (steel, cement), recycling and waste management, and more.

We are only at the embryonic stage of seeing the impact of AI on the cost curves in a wide range of commodities and industries. As we talk about the upward impact on power prices driven by AI infrastructure requirements, we need to keep in mind that AI will also radically transform industries globally and reduce cost of production.

Laurie Menoud, At One Ventures

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

Yes, there’s been massive excitement around everything connected to data centers, energy generation, storage, transmission, cooling. But from a VC perspective, building and scaling data centers isn’t a startup timeline. It’s a decade-long struggle of permits, substations, and grid upgrades. To put numbers on it, hyperscale data centers take 3 to 6 years to permit and connect in the US today. In some markets, interconnection alone can exceed 5 to 7 years. So in 2026, I expect to see continued traction for energy companies that are not only tied to data centers but can expand into commercial and industrial use cases and front-of-the-meter applications. Data centers are one demand driver, not the whole market.

Related to this is the supply of critical metals, which I continue to be very focused on: mining, extraction, refining, and recycling. This is critical not only for data centers (especially copper), but also for EV batteries with lithium, nickel, manganese, and cobalt.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

In places where thermal (coal and gas) and nuclear plants are being retired, because those sites already have high-capacity grid connections. That makes deploying new clean generation dramatically faster. In the U.S. alone, more than 60 GW of coal capacity has retired since 2015, and another 40+ GW is scheduled to retire by 2030. Each retirement frees up a transmission node that took decades to build. Reusing that interconnection is often the difference between a 2-year vs. an 8-year project timeline. And that’s where you could install next-gen nuclear reactors, like Stellaria, that cut long-lived waste, capex, opex, deployment time, and extends fuel use, or geothermal energy like Factor2 Energy, utilizing underground CO2 reservoirs for lower constraints on deployment location.

The same is true of industrial sites (chemicals, steel, refineries) that already have oversized grid connections. These sites are trying to expand production, and add storage, and they already have one of the hardest problems solved: interconnection. If you want to electrify heavy industry quickly, you go where the grid already exists.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

No one can really know, but the battery recycling and circular critical materials subsector is one I’d watch closely. Lithium, nickel, and cobalt prices are extremely sensitive to geopolitics, and recycling provides a lower-risk, domestic supply for the U.S.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Relectrify is deploying their battery systems at commercial production scale in 2026 with a cumulative capacity of 100 MWh. They use cell-level semiconductor circuitry to individually control battery cells at high frequency, directly producing an alternating current waveform. No need for an inverter anymore, which is a direct win on CAPEX, improved usable lifetime battery capacity, and lower OPEX by identifying and replacing malfunctioning cells with precision. It’s happening now.

And overall, grid-scale energy storage beyond lithium, driven by both AI data centers and renewable growth. Without it, you simply can’t run 24/7 clean power outside of nuclear and hydro. Globally, stationary storage is projected to grow from ~45 GWh in 2023 to hundreds of GWs by 2030. Some of the new technologies are already ready today.

Battery recycling and closed-loop supply chains with automakers (recycled lithium, nickel, cobalt, and copper going back into new batteries) are also already scaling. 2026 is about acceleration. Ascend Elements has already built the largest lithium-ion battery recycling facility in North America, and has now achieved the first production of recycled lithium carbonate. Imports make up the majority of the US supply of lithium carbonate today, mostly from Argentina and Chile. If you can secure your metal supply with lower-cost recycled content, isn’t that a big win?

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

Companies like Chemfinity, that could make domestic metal refining at cost parity with China, and anything tied to mining, extraction, refining, and recycling of critical metals for data centers and EVs. Copper is THE metal for data centers. It’s used in power cables, busbars, transformers, cooling loops. A single gigawatt of data-center capacity requires on the order of tens of thousands of tonnes of copper. And about 40% – 45% of the world’s copper refining is in China, followed by Chile. It’s the same geographical structure as lithium refining and battery precursor chemistry. People talk about energy security. This is what it actually looks like.

Joshua Posamentier, managing partner at Congruent Ventures

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

Push for growth will continue but attention will shift from flashy gigawatt announcements to construction, commissioning, and dealing with the brutal realities of interconnect and permitting delays. The result will be a huge upwelling of “bring your own generation” and “demand flexibility.”

The age of ASSPs/ASICs will begin in earnest for AI data centers. GPUs will continue to grow, but the rate will taper in favor of more specialist chips that are far more efficient, especially for inference loads. This will start decoupling data center power consumption from token generation.

The unit economics of the marquee foundational AI shops will leak. They will not look good. But they will convince investors to support them through their trough of upside down unit economics until they achieve positive unit economics, which will come sooner than expected. But the shine will be off: These will fall into a different bucket than high margin SaaS companies from prior bubbles.

Data centers will become far better grid participants through flexibility, load shaping, and power quality, and they will be rewarded with far faster interconnect times than other big loads — the more tech they adopt, the faster they’ll get connected.

We’ll see the first off-grid world-scale data center NTP [notice to proceed, or a letter telling a contractor to begin work]. We’ll also see more NIMBY pushback on proximate data centers because of everything from power costs to size to water use.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

Nuclear fusion! I think we’ll see the first net gain by analysis (i.e., deuterium fusion where it would be Q>1 if it were tritium) in a startup reactor.

Geothermal will be hot on solar’s heels in terms of new generation with linearly deploying gas assets.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

SPAC or IPO? Lots in the pipe, pun intended.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Geothermal for electricity and district heating. Friction is still way too high for single site geothermal heat loops to scale much faster than today. Thermal energy storage (load shifting) for industrial applications.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

Robotics (not the humanoid kind) are taking over a huge number of labor-intensive industries; they will impact many industrial, agriculture, waste, and manufacturing operations in 2026.

Logistics and manufacturing efficiency: electrification, efficiency, onshoring, and AI are pushing on emissions from half of the economy and these sectors are economic, not impact buyers. Give them long-term certainty on lower costs vs. conventional fuels, for example, and you’ll have buyers. This is everything from electrified autonomous trucking to electric autonomous rail and dark terminals.

Resilience technology is going to really get going. Insurance costs (due to climate risk) are outpacing every other cost for homeowners and impacting commercial operations. Businesses and individuals are going to aggressively begin to invest in resilience in the face of accelerating climate change and extreme weather but also aging infrastructure and a shift from centralized to distributed resource paradigms.

Matt Rogers, founder at Incite and Mill

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

Data centers will serve as factories for the next phase of AI innovation powering America’s society and economy. I think local governments will step up more in 2026 and challenge hyperscalers to deliver solutions that are more in line with community needs and municipal partnership that allows for swifter construction. Energy affordability is top of mind, and we really need to reverse the trend of 2025 of rising costs.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

The call is coming from inside the house in 2026. In other words, consumers have more impact than anyone thinks. Decentralized infrastructure solutions, including rooftop solar, energy storage, and distributed energy resources, like heat pumps and smart thermostats, are available today. Households can turn them on swiftly, cost-effectively, and without the major disruptions to grids across the nation we are seeing today. It’s faster to permit than building new centralized power plants.

If enough people adopt these approachable solutions, America’s grid has a better shot at handling the increased capacity from the data center AI boom.

There’s also an alignment opportunity hiding in plain sight: AI pioneers and Big Tech companies want a faster, more predictable path to build. Local and state governments want affordability, economic investment, and resilience. Communities are actually in a unique position to trade swift permitting and flexible construction timelines for economic rejuvenation, tax revenue, and job creation from the private sector.

By enabling more efficient households with lower utility bills, hyperscalers can access the energy they need to operate AI data centers. Much faster. That’s why this isn’t a moonshot. The opposite, in fact.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Mill. We’ll deploy more Food Recyclers, and on a different scale, than ever before. We’re planning more partnerships to encourage more households, businesses, and communities to view food as something to return back to the food system rather than leave for weeks in dumpsters and then years in landfills.

Robotics is going to attract massive funding and private sector attention in 2026. Simultaneously, builders will move away from the hype around humanoid models towards functional robots designed to handle specific tasks and make life easier. The future of robotics will look more like Roomba than your neighbor Rhonda, which actually bodes well from both an affordability and technology risk perspective.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

We will see massive innovation where AI meets the physical world in 2026 on both the infrastructure and consumer app layers. Combining AI with smart hardware and physical infrastructure will ensure the transformation of trillion-dollar industries from manufacturing to life sciences to food systems. In order for AI to power the future without tanking grids or negatively impacting communities, it must be paired with physical hardware that solves problems and makes everyday life better for people. We’ll benefit as much from an AI smartphone as we will with an AI-powered waste facility.

Kyle Teamey, managing partner at RA Capital Planetary Health

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

I think data centers will still dominate in 2026. But I guess I’m a little jaded on this stuff because I was in the last AI cycle — it’s a lot of the same conversation. But the level of investment is orders of magnitude greater. The level of attention is orders of magnitude greater. And so it’s going to take a long while for this to shake out one way or another.

The spending for 2026 is already budgeted. The train has left the station. Could a bubble burst in 2026? Sure. But that would take a while to be manifested. It’s going to take months to a year perhaps to to really be manifested. You’d have to shut it off midstream and try to claw your money back. That’s pretty hard to do.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

This has been talked about a lot, but the data use, the requirements for data, it scales fairly exponentially. Power it scales quite linearly. As a consequence, it’s going to take a long while, I think, for the physical world to catch up to the data demand side. It’s really all of the above. If you can if you can do anything in power generation, power storage, transmission, distribution, if you can improve grid operations — the list goes on and on and on.

A bull market in electricity like this, I don’t know how long it’s been, maybe like a century? And so it really, at least to us, it looks like it’s all of the above. Lots and lots of interesting opportunities within that. We’ve seen some companies go public in the like the last 12, 18 months. We probably will see more. I think it’s fair to to think that there will be.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

I think power generation is gonna see more public companies in 2026, for sure. There could be a wide, wide variety there. Nuclear everything is in vogue right now. We’ll likely see more of those. Geothermal, we’ll definitely see some of those. And you’ve already got a bunch of interesting players who are in project development and implementation, some of those could go public as well. It’s not just the tech companies, but the folks up and down the value chain.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Nuclear fission companies in particular. That could be a bubble for sure, but if some of these companies start succeeding and start getting uh projects built. Every few years these opportunities pop up, and it makes sense that people take advantage of those opportunities to raise some additional cash and grow more rapidly.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

There haven’t been any technologies I’ve seen recently where I’m like, ‘Oh wow that’s going to change the world, everyone should be looking at that.’ I do think it is more about scaling for a lot of these right now. If you can hit scale quickly, it’s an amazing opportunity.

If you look at the the various trends, it’s not just the manufacturing demand. The other driver is the regionalization of everything, which is driving demand for labor, for resources. Fill in the blank, there’s demand for it.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XpmsFQ5xvaYXNWYPv.KLEA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/techcrunch_finance_785/1d051dd99e83a750cbc29efe69f9cd3d,N,,2025-12-30 16:58:28.296657

Although clean nuclear generation is generally not associated with traditional voluntary offset carbon credits, the parties believe nuclear-powered activity could support a range of environmental attributes and claims frameworks, subject to jurisdiction and program rules. These may include energy attribute certificates such as renewable energy certificates (""RECs"") or Guarantees of Origin, zero-emission credit frameworks and clean energy standards that recognize nuclear generation, and zero-carbon Scope 2 claims.

The parties also intend to evaluate environmental-attribute structures associated with eSAF and related low-carbon fuel pathways, including emerging ""book-and-claim"" and SAF certificate frameworks that allow airlines and corporate buyers to access verified in-sector emissions reduction attributes when physical fuel delivery is constrained.

Sunny Trinh, Chief Executive Officer of DevvStream, commented:

""Together, we are exploring real-world asset and tokenized environmental-asset frameworks with the potential to unlock additional value, improve liquidity, and help lower the delivered cost of clean energy and fuels. We see this as a potential America-first model that combines U.S. resources, digital infrastructure, and scalable markets.""

In parallel, the MOU contemplates future development of digital infrastructure to enhance transparency, provenance, and auditability, including tokenization of eligible environmental assets and the use of digital measurement, reporting, and verification (""MRV"") systems to support data quality, provenance, and auditability.

Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern Energy, added:

""This MOU reflects our focus on putting American energy, infrastructure, and production first. As the development of advanced nuclear platforms gains momentum, we believe the goal of developing and deploying firm, domestic power is becoming essential for fuels, manufacturing, and data-driven industries. We are committed to exploring how nuclear power, combined with U.S. biomass resources, can enable an integrated, multi-product approach that strengthens U.S. industrial leadership while remaining globally competitive.""

The MOU reflects a shared intent to collaborate on SAF and other low-carbon fuel opportunities. The MOU is non-binding and subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, of which there can be no assurances.

Solar Holler Founder and CEO Dan Conant said solar may be an option for Mountain State residents who may be looking to use solar power as an energy source for their property ahead of the expiration of the 30 percent federal clean energy tax credit Dec. 31. The recommendation was made as his company continues the installation of dozens of 5-kilowatt solar panel systems designed for residential use, along with larger systems for properties that host nonprofit organizations and commercial businesses ahead of the deadline.

“If folks want to take advantage of that tax credit that covers 30 percent of the costs of the project, it has to be installed this year,” Conant said recently on WAJR’s “Talk of the Town.” “And then next year, it goes away.”

According to Conant, the cost for an installation varies depending on the size of the property, with most 5 kW solar panel systems expected to cost just over $10,000 to fully integrate into an average four-bedroom household. Once everything is installed, homeowners can then incorporate up to 30 percent of the total installation costs of the system towards their federal tax payment. This will also be separate from a new process that residents can take part in where usage of the solar panels can be incorporated into monthly energy bills.

“We actually tie it into the power grid, so when you’re not home and it’s a sunny day, the solar will spin your meter backward,” said Conant. “And then you’ll build up credits that you can apply against your bill.”

Conant said not only is there expected to be a direct cost benefit for individual consumers but also investment in solar panel-based energy sources that directly affects the West Virginia economy.

According to Conant, a wide variety of solar panel pieces of equipment are produced and sold in various parts of the Mountain State. Added with the use of contractors with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Solar Holler hopes the immediate investment into an industry that has over 700 people employed across West Virginia will also entice new users alongside the tax credit and energy bill benefits that can be negotiated with service providers.

“A lot of panels from around the country are actually being made out of West Virginia sand, and we’ve got batteries being made up in Weirton, and steel and all kinds of stuff so the solar industry as a whole is construction but also manufacturing.”

The expiration of the federal tax credit is expected to be fully applied at the start of 2026, with the credits for nonprofits, farmers, and commercial businesses allowed to be safe harbored until 2029. The credit for safe harbored projects can only be applied if the solar panel installation is locked in place by the end of this year. With projects taking place in homes all the way to religious centers from as far south as Flatwoods and as far north as Monongalia County, Conant encourages West Virginians to give solar power a shot.

“Depending on what you’re looking for, it can either just be a price hedge to make sure you’re protected from the utility increases, or it can also be a security for power to run,” said Conant. “For power to run the freezer and fridges and everything you need.”

Topline:

The Eaton and Pacific Palisades fires renewed attention to issues such as utility oversight, insurance coverage, and the broader challenges of wildfire planning in a changing climate. But California found pushing its climate agenda forward to be an uphill battle this year: ambitious climate goals faced a hostile federal government economic pressures.

Agenda setbacks: Anticipating opposition from President Donald Trump, state leaders chose to abandon important clean-air rules before he even took office, including plans to phase out diesel trucks and transition to cleaner trains. Nearing mid-year, Trump and his allies in Congress blocked the state’s clean-car mandate, a blow to emissions reduction plans. By the end of the legislative session, these issues converged, as legislators passed a six-bill deal that included a plan to boost oil drilling, relief for ratepayers who fund wildfire mitigation, and an extension of the now rebranded “cap-and-invest” program.

Read on... for more on what 2025 delivered on the climate front.

Days after 2025 began, two fires scorched through Los Angeles neighborhoods, the most destructive in California’s history. The Eaton and Pacific Palisades fires also renewed attention to issues such as utility oversight, insurance coverage, and the broader challenges of wildfire planning in a changing climate. And their harms rippled outward, leaving thousands of low-income workers and immigrants without jobs.

But California found pushing its climate agenda forward to be an uphill battle this year: Ambitious climate goals faced a hostile federal government economic pressures.

Anticipating opposition from President Donald Trump, state leaders chose to abandon important clean-air rules before he even took office, including plans to phase out diesel trucks and transition to cleaner trains. Nearing mid-year, Trump and his allies in Congress blocked the state’s clean-car mandate, a blow to emissions reduction plans.

Nevertheless, as part of budget negotiations, Gov. Gavin Newsom sought to reauthorize California’s landmark cap-and-trade program, launching a debate that would resolve in the final hours of the legislative session.

Blaming climate and environmental regulation, Phillips 66 and Valero followed through on plans to shutter oil refineries, raising concerns about gas prices and the future of the state’s oil industry. In Wilmington, Phillips 66 is now closed. A high-profile explosion at Chevron’s El Segundo refinery nearby underscored persistent safety and environmental risks tied to remaining facilities.

By the end of the legislative session, these issues converged, as legislators passed a six-bill deal that included a plan to boost oil drilling, relief for ratepayers who fund wildfire mitigation, and an extension of the now rebranded “cap-and-invest” program.

As lawmakers passed sweeping reforms to California’s landmark environmental review law, critics warned exemptions may make it easier for potentially high-polluting advanced manufacturing facilities to take root in already vulnerable areas.

Longstanding conflicts over water continued to simmer this year. The governor continued pressing to fast-track a $20 billion tunnel around the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to send more water south — to the outrage of Delta lawmakers. And dry conditions led to dire projections for the Colorado River, a vital water supply for Southern California. They ramped up the tensions — and the urgency — as negotiators from states that rely on the river tried, and failed, to reach a deal portioning out water supplies.

2026 Outlook

Affordability, the cost of climate adaptation, and pollution harms, in the skies and in the waste stream, continue to be key issues for California. As Gov. Gavin Newsom’s balancing act continues, the state will navigate tensions with environmental justice advocates unhappy with compromises. Emerging risks include the cost – in energy and water – of data centers, and the environmental consequences of the battery economy.

For more than a century, the Rose Parade has delighted audiences across Southern California with its colorful, elaborate floats and fanfare.

The parade will celebrate its 137th year when floats begin traveling through Pasadena at 8 a.m. Jan. 1, 2026. This year's theme is ""Magic in Teamwork,"" and Magic Johnson is the Grand Marshal.

This year, for the first time in two decades, rain appears to be highly likely on parade day. Rain conditions are rare for the legendary parade.

Showing off SoCal weather, in fact, was one of the main drivers of the parade's creation.

As the Pasadena Tournament of Roses website recounts, Charles F. Holder led Valley Hunt Club members in creating the parade in 1890, saying: “In New York, people are buried in snow. Here our flowers are blooming and our oranges are about to bear. Let’s hold a festival to tell the world about our paradise.”

Here are photos from some of the Rose Parades past, with details about key participants — from movie and music stars to sports legends to real-life heroes, and a even a couple of fictional characters:

Topline:

Nearly one year after fires destroyed thousands of homes in L.A. County, many families have concluded that rebuilding isn’t in their budget. In nearly half of recent deals for empty lots, homeowners are selling to investors. That’s the conclusion researchers with the online real estate listings platform Redfin reached in a new report published this morning.

The numbers: Analyzing transactions in L.A. County burn zones during July, August and September, they found that about 40% of Pacific Palisades vacant lots went to corporate buyers. In both Altadena and Malibu, about 44% of such vacant lot sales went to investors.

The context: Investor activity is common following disasters. While some say they can be helpful in bringing homes back to ravaged communities, others are skeptical about their plans. Some lawmakers and organizations have been working to counteract speculative development in Altadena.

Read on… to learn why one Altadena fire survivor sees this trend as “disaster capitalism” coming for the diverse foothill community.

Shortly after the Eaton Fire destroyed thousands of homes in and around Altadena, signs sprung up across the community announcing “Altadena is not for sale.”

Now, nearly one year later, hundreds of Altadena families have concluded that rebuilding isn’t in their budget. In nearly half of recent deals for empty lots, homeowners are selling to investors.

That’s the conclusion researchers with the online real estate listings platform Redfin reached in a new report published Tuesday.

Analyzing transactions in L.A. County burn zones during July, August and September, they found that about 40% of Pacific Palisades vacant lots went to corporate buyers. In both Altadena and Malibu, about 44% of such vacant lot sales went to investors.

“It's not uncommon to see that when disasters hit a place, investors come in,” said Sheharyar Bokhari, Redfin’s principal economist. “It's hard to value a vacant lot, so you could perhaps buy lower than what it should sell for and then flip it.”

More vacant lots are getting scooped up

To conduct the analysis, Redfin researchers looked at sales in the zip codes 90272 for the Pacific Palisades, 91001 for Altadena and 90265 for Malibu. They categorized buyers as investors if their names contained words or abbreviations such as LLC, Inc, Corp or Homes.

There was a marked increase of vacant lots sales in all communities, according to the report. In the Pacific Palisades, 119 lots sold in July, August and September. Altadena saw 61 lot sales. In 2024, before the fires, neither Pacific Palisades nor Altadena had any lots selling in those months.

Malibu saw some vacant lots sell in that time frame in 2024. But before the fires, only about 21% of those sales were to investors.

The findings are similar to those in a separate report published in October by the nonprofit Strategic Actions for a Just Economy. That report found that 49% of sales in the Eaton Fire burn zone went to corporate entities.

Zaire Calvin lost his family’s home in Altadena and had a sister who died in the fire. He said the trend shows “disaster capitalism” poised to change the diverse foothill community.

“If rebuilding becomes a race for capital instead of a return home for families, then disaster has been basically repackaged as opportunity for those with the most resources,” Calvin said. “It's like they're preying on us while we're still praying for hope and help.”

Some lawmakers and organizations have been working to counteract speculative development..

Assembly Bill 851, signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in October, outlawed unsolicited offers on properties in burn zones until 2027.

The nonprofit Greenline Housing Foundation has been buying lots from distressed sellers in Altadena, giving them an alternative to more bottom-line driven investors. The organization has said it intends to rebuild homes and sell them at below market prices to first-time buyers.

Corporate buyers: disaster capitalists or helpful rebuilders?

Bokhari, the Redfin economist, said investor activity is not entirely detrimental to communities recovering from disaster.

“Investors who have a lot more capital can come in and build that community,” he said. They can afford to clean up lingering environmental damage and build homes that comply with the latest fire safety codes, he said.

“Investors play that role in bringing back those homes,” Bokhari said.

Still, uncertainty around investors’ plans have left many Altadenans anxious. Will homes be for sale or for rent? How will those homes look? Will investor-built properties give Black families a way to continue building generational wealth in a historically Black corner of L.A. County?

Lori Gay, president and CEO of Neighborhood Housing Services of L.A. County, said in the grand scheme of L.A. real estate, not many lots in Altadena are trading hands so far. Only 61 lots in the community sold in July, August and September according to the Redfin report.

“More will go up for sale over time,” Gay said. But in her organization’s work advising families on how to rebuild, she said, “Most families we’ve seen want to go back home. They’re not trying to leave. They’re trying to figure out how to stay.”

The Distributed Wind Energy Futures Study leverages a highly detailed evaluation of more than 150 million U.S. land parcels to enable a high-resolution view of the landscape of opportunity for distributed wind deployment. The study uses NLR's Distributed Wind (dWind) model, a module within the Distributed Generation Market Demand (dGen™) model suite.

To explore this high-resolution dataset, NLR has developed the DW Scenario Analyzer. This tool allows users to explore the key data products of the research. Raw data are published on the DOE Atmosphere to Electrons (A2e) Wind Data Portal. With this portal, county, ZIP code, and U.S. census block group statistics can be downloaded to make custom maps or to conduct user-specific analysis.

An Opportunity for Economic Development

The findings show that the potential for distributed wind energy is considerably higher than previously estimated. We calculate that there are 8,695 GW of distributed wind technical potential for front-of-the-meter applications in the Baseline 2022 scenario and 7,796 GW in the Baseline 2035 scenario, which is, on average, 1.8 times more technical potential in the contiguous United States than previously reported. Similarly, there is, on average, 2.1 times more technical potential for behind-the-meter applications: 1,749 GW in the Baseline 2022 scenario and 3,743 GW in the Baseline 2035 scenario.

The improved model also highlights additional economic potential for behind-the-meter applications. Compared to the estimated 4,000 TWh of electricity consumption in the United States, a substantial fraction of that energy could be generated with distributed wind technology. Taking the most conservative estimates, 2.5% of demand could be satisfied using economic behind-the-meter scenarios, and an additional 78.5% of demand could be satisfied with economic front-of-the-meter scenarios. Additional incentives or net metering regulations (for behind-the-meter scenarios) could allow an even greater potential.

High Potential in Rural and Agricultural Regions

NLR finds the regions with the highest potential for distributed wind tend to have a combination of high-quality wind, relatively high electricity rates for behind-the-meter applications, higher wholesale power rates for front-of-the-meter applications, and siting availability.

The Midwest has the overall highest potential for distributed wind. The Pacific Northwest and Northeast regions have significant potential for expansion of behind-the-meter distributed wind deployments. States with the most near-term potential for behind-the-meter applications include Texas, Minnesota, Montana, Colorado, Indiana, and Oklahoma. States with the most near-term potential for front-of-the-meter applications include Oklahoma, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, and South Dakota.

In alignment with recent programs from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and DOE, we also note significant existing opportunities for distributed wind generation in agricultural and rural areas: The top 10 states for front-of-the-meter systems have an annual energy production of 1,199 TWh, and the top 10 states for behind-the-meter applications have an annual energy production of 19 TWh. Overall, agricultural land represents 33% of the total distributed wind opportunity for the 2022 behind-the-meter scenario, and 42% for the 2022 front-of-the-meter scenario, indicating that agricultural and rural areas represent the greatest opportunity for distributed wind—more than any other land use type.

He then raised money to add solar panels to a charitable school he supports nearby.","Ismet Booley, a dentist in Cape Town, had a serious problem a few years ago. Patients showed up for appointments, only to find the power had gone out.

No power meant no X-rays, no fillings, no root canals. “I just couldn’t work,” Dr. Booley said.

South Africans like Dr. Booley have found a remedy for power cuts that have plagued people in the developing world for years. Thanks to swiftly falling prices of Chinese made solar panels and batteries, they now draw their power from the sun.

These aren’t the tiny, old-school solar lanterns that once powered a lightbulb or TV in rural communities. Today, solar and battery systems are deployed across a variety of businesses — auto factories and wineries, gold mines and shopping malls. And they are changing everyday life, trade and industry in Africa’s biggest economy.

This has happened at startling speed. Solar has risen from almost nothing in 2019 to roughly 10 percent of South Africa’s electricity-generating capacity.

No longer do South Africans depend entirely on giant coal-burning plants that have defined how people worldwide got their electricity for more than a century. That’s forcing the nation’s already beleaguered electric utility to rethink its business as revenues evaporate.

Joel Nana, a project manager with Sustainable Energy Africa, a Cape Town-based organization, called it “a bottom-up movement” to sidestep a generations-old problem. “The broken system is unreliable electricity, expensive electricity or no electricity at all,” he said. “We’ve been living in this situation forever.”

What’s happening in South Africa is repeating across the continent. Key to this shift: China’s ambition to lead the world in clean energy.

Over the past decade, while the United States ramped up fossil fuel exports, China has focused on dominating renewables. Today, Chinese companies make so many of the world’s solar panels, electric vehicles and batteries that they are slashing prices and scrambling to find buyers.

Tariffs have thwarted them somewhat in the United States and Europe, but they’re finding enormous new markets in Africa, where around 600 million people lack reliable electricity. Across the continent, solar imports from China rose 50 percent the first 10 months of 2025, continuing a trend, according to a review of Chinese export data by Ember, a British energy tracking group.

South Africa was the largest destination for Chinese solar, but not the only one. Sierra Leone imported the equivalent of more than half its total current electricity-generating capacity, and Chad, nearly half.

China has much to gain. Not least, new markets and new geopolitical influence. Its companies are doing more than just exporting. State-owned Power China is also building utility-scale solar farms in South Africa, as in other developing economies.

And now China is bidding on contracts from the state-owned utility, Eskom, to add 14,000 kilometers (about 8,700 miles) of transmission lines that South Africa desperately needs to move its increasing supply of solar power around the country.

“Obviously we don’t have money for that,” South Africa’s deputy minister for electricity and energy, Samantha Graham-Maré, said in an interview, referring to the hefty upfront costs of expanding the grid.

Who does? China.

Chinese state-owned companies are among several international firms to bid on South Africa’s $25 billion grid expansion, vying to build the lines and then make money, in part, by operating them. Chinese firms hold similar build-operate contracts in countries including Brazil and the Philippines.

The solar surge does little to address the most pressing social and economic problems of developing countries like South Africa, the need to generate new jobs for millions of young citizens. Installation labor is local, but the panels and batteries are almost all made in China.

“The economic trade-offs are significant,” said Marvellous Ngundu, a researcher with the Institute of Security Studies, a think tank in Pretoria. “Jobs are created elsewhere. South Africa consumes advanced green technologies without capturing the industrial benefits.”

Then there are the security implications of a foreign company running the electricity grid. Asked about this, Ms. Graham-Maré said the outside companies could operate the lines for an unspecified period of time and that the grid as a whole would remain owned and controlled by the state. (In other countries, China’s State Grid owns stakes in national grids.)

Asked about security concerns, she said, “Our grid is very, very safe.”

The Race to Adapt

The rapid shift by so many businesses and people to install their own panels and batteries is causing headaches for Eskom, the already troubled utility.

Every kilowatt generated by privately owned solar installations is a hit to its bottom line. Eskom’s coal-burning plants, which provide most of South Africa’s power, are old and in poor shape.

Power cuts have subsided recently, but it wasn’t long ago that Eskom had to turn off electricity to some areas for hours at a time — a practice called “load shedding” that hurt the economy and fed public anger. During the worst days of load shedding, the latest of which came in early 2024, even Ms. Graham-Maré, the deputy electricity minister, installed a solar system in her home. Her energy bill, she said, fell by two-thirds.

Multiply her hack by the thousands and you have what South Africans call Eskom’s “death spiral.” Well-off customers lower their bills with solar, which causes Eskom to lose money, which in turn forces Eskom to raise prices and encourages more people to install solar.

It doesn’t help that some people tap power lines to draw electricity illegally, without paying for it, or that Eskom has suffered years of mismanagement.

In the past five years alone, South Africans installed solar panels representing more than seven gigawatts, or about a tenth of the total installed capacity of 55 gigawatts. Most is privately owned.

Now, unable to beat solar, Eskom is joining solar.

The utility has removed onerous licensing requirements on private installations. It has allowed people to sell power to the grid. And it has tweaked its rates so that customers pay a fixed charge in addition to the cost of any power they consume. Essentially, people pay simply to be connected to the grid, a standard feature in other nations that’s new in South Africa.

The problem, experts said, is that South Africa lacks policies to require local manufacturing. But creating them would drive up costs. The prices of made-in-China panels are by far the lowest in the world.

South Africa’s rapid pivot to Chinese solar gear, as affordable as it is, also doesn’t resolve a basic problem. The country’s poorest citizens still can’t afford to put up their own panels.

They lack the money to buy the gear outright and the ability to get loans.

In Langa township, one of Cape Town’s largest low-income suburbs, one of the rare businesses with solar is Colin Mkosi’s bicycle delivery service, Cloudy Deliveries. His single panel, donated by a charity, powers a few lights and computers. It doesn’t provide nearly enough to charge the electric bikes his business relies on.

The e-bikes are, of course, from China. But his power still comes from South Africa’s unreliable grid. “It’s expensive,” he said, and “we can’t operate without electricity.”

Mr. Mkosi’s wants are part of a broader problem. South Africa buys growing volumes of high-value technologies from China, while selling it raw materials of limited value. China overtook the U.S. as its biggest trading partner in 2008. With its trade gap rising to more than $9 billion in 2023, compared with barely $1 billion in 2000, there are increasing calls to make trade relations with China less unequal.

The difference between South Africa’s trade ties with China and with the U.S. is stark.

President Trump has imposed a 30 percent tariff on South African goods and excluded the government from participating in an international summit of the world’s 20 biggest economies. He has also reversed a Biden administration plan to help the country accelerate its planned closures of its oldest, dirtiest coal plants.

“As relations with the United States have become increasingly strained, Beijing has positioned itself as a reliable and sympathetic partner,” Dr. Ngundu said.

Sun and Wine

Far from the hand-wringing over trade and geopolitics, in South Africa’s storied wine region of Stellenbosch the sun is as bright as the chardonnay.

Which explains why, on the Lanzerac Wine Estate in December, workers were finishing installation of rows of solar panels between rows of vines. The panels would soon supply all the electricity to run the 54-room luxury hotel on the estate, and the winery’s operations.

Batteries would store power for the night. For only two or three months a year, during winter, would the winery need to buy much electricity from the grid.

He installed a bigger system for his home, and his electricity bills dropped to a fifth of what they were. He then raised money to add solar panels to a charitable school he supports nearby.

One recent evening, as dusk drew in, the lights in his house came on, powered by batteries, and his swimming pool was warm, heated by electricity from his panels. The family sat around a kitchen table, cooing over a grandchild. By next June, he expects his home system will be paid off.

This gives Dr. Booley solace. He’s planning for retirement, and solar has eliminated one of his worries, he said — “that I’ll not be able to afford electricity when I’m a pensioner.”

North Carolina Rate Increase Approved A proposed Duke Energy rate increase has gotten quite a lot of press (Duke is giving that eldest sibling energy).
But the middle child, PSNC Enbridge, has just scored its own rate increase, resulting in no news coverage whatsoever.","We get our heating and cooling from three main types of providers, and sometimes they resemble a trio of siblings. There’s the eldest child — the legacy electric utilities like Duke Energy or Georgia Power. There’s the youngest child — the renewable energy providers that operate at both grid scale and behind the meter (solar, wind, batteries). And then there’s that middle child — the gas local distribution companies (LDCs) like Piedmont Natural Gas and PSNC Enbridge (formerly Dominion). The middle child often flies below the radar and doesn’t attract the attention that the oldest and youngest get. One particular middle child, PSNC Enbridge, has been overlooked in North Carolina. Let’s see what they’ve been up to.

Persistently Over-Estimating Gas Need

The consulting group London Economics International took a look at how PSNC Enbridge estimates how much gas capacity it will need to buy from the big interstate pipeline companies. These estimates determine just how big new pipeline projects are. This is important because these pipeline costs are passed straight to ratepayers, and PSNC Enbridge has no risk and no incentive to look out for you, the ratepayer.

The gas resources PSNC Enbridge needs, called design day demand, are based on what is required to meet the demand of 655,000 customers on the coldest day of the year. LEI found that PSNC Enbridge

Starts with a baseline that is higher than historical data indicates it should be

Uses 70 years of temperature data to find the coldest day, while most LDCs use 40 years of data (inflating design day demand)

Adds another 9% they call a “kick factor” to calculate what would be needed on the coldest day

Consistently overestimates the annual rate of future demand growth

These all add up to PSNC Enbridge contracting for way too much capacity on expensive new interstate pipeline projects. The company has no real incentive to not overestimate the amount of interstate capacity it needs and no incentive to negotiate the best rates for that capacity. All this adds up to higher bills (talk about a “kick factor”).

North Carolina Rate Increase Approved

A proposed Duke Energy rate increase has gotten quite a lot of press (Duke is giving that eldest sibling energy). But the middle child, PSNC Enbridge, has just scored its own rate increase, resulting in no news coverage whatsoever. The North Carolina Utilities Commission gave the middle child an early Christmas present when it approved a rate increase for the gas customers of PSNC Enbridge on December 3.

For residential customers, the rate increase is bigger in the winter than in the summer, right when home gas consumption hits its peak. That’s another unwelcome “kick factor.” PSNC Enbridge calculates that the rate increase will be about 7.2% for residential customers.

Big Profits for Shareholders

PSNC Enbridge is part of the larger Canadian pipeline developer Enbridge Inc. Thanks to all of the new pipeline construction (including the T-15 project in North Carolina), Enbridge just increased its profit projection for 2026 by 4.12% to $14.5 billion. The company also increased its shareholder dividend by 3%.

PSNC Enbridge is building the expansion of the T-15 gas pipeline in Rockingham, Caswell, and Person Counties, a $700 million project to serve two gas plants being built by an “elder sibling” company, Duke Energy. Duke maintains that new data centers are driving demand for electricity, which drives the utility to claim it needs to build new gas plants and thus drives more demand for gas pipelines. But are these data centers being built for the same artificial intelligence boom that is headed for a bust? The head of Google parent Alphabet, Sundar Pichai, spoke to BBC News just last month.

So in sum, the middle child is over-estimating gas needs, contracting for too much expensive interstate pipeline capacity, building expensive pipelines, crediting/blaming AI and data center growth, and running to the NC Utilities Commission for a rate increase (and there will be more to come). Profits from all of these activities funnel up to shareholders while North Carolina billpayers struggle.

It’s time to pay closer attention to these middle children of the energy space – the local gas distribution companies. No more flying under the radar.",https://cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/cropped-sace-favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-30 12:59:19.067563

Ultimately, 2026 may prove pivotal in determining how Maryland manages PFAS.
The path forward will require coordination across all levels of government to align environmental and public health initiatives with effective, practical solutions.","Ahead of the 2026 Legislative Session, MACo is previewing some of the major issues likely to gain widespread attention amongst the General Assembly. Among them, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) remain one of the most persistent and complex environmental and public health challenges facing local governments throughout the state.

Valued for their industrial, waterproof, and nonstick properties, PFAS are used in thousands of products, from everyday household items such as water bottles, cookware, and carpets to components of modern infrastructure such as metal finishing. These synthetic substances are often called “forever chemicals” because they don’t easily break down in nature. Rather, they accumulate and persist in the environment and living organisms – even humans – for decades, leading to a wide range of serious environmental and health impacts.

With mounting evidence of PFAS-related risks, government officials are moving to reduce public exposure through new policies and regulations. In 2024, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) mandated regular PFAS testing at county landfills while the Maryland General Assembly passed the Protecting State Waters From PFAS Pollution Act, which aims to reduce PFAS contamination from industrial sources and strengthen testing and monitoring standards.

As previously reported by MACo, the 2025 Legislative Session featured extensive debate, particularly regarding the chemical’s presence in sewage sludge used as fertilizer. HB 909/SB 732 sought to limit PFAS concentrations in sewage sludge prior to land application, but local governments raised concerns that it shifted responsibility onto local treatment plants — which passively receive PFAS — rather than confronting the sources of contamination.

Other proposals would have required wastewater treatment facilities to massively overhaul their operations, including installing new storage and mitigation technologies. Ultimately, the legislation did not pass in 2025, but it is expected to reemerge in some form during the 2026 session.

Moreover, the shifting federal approach to PFAS will likely impact local plans for testing, treatment technology, and public reporting requirements. A recent press release confirmed that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will retain existing federal drinking water limits for PFOA and PFOS, two major PFAS compounds, but plans to extend compliance deadlines and offer added flexibility for water systems as they work toward meeting federal standards.

Ultimately, 2026 may prove pivotal in determining how Maryland manages PFAS.

Nevertheless, Duke expects to receive nearly four times as much productivity from that new nuclear capacity than from the new solar.","Duke Energy submitted a permit application Tuesday morning that could pave the way for a new nuclear reactor near an existing coal and natural gas power plant in Stokes County.

A nuclear reactor is at least a decade away from operation, but Duke Energy is moving forward with a permit process expected to last 18 months.

Duke has not committed to building new nuclear units, the utility emphasized in a news release. But the permit could help reduce delays during licensing and construction if nuclear plans move forward.

“The submittal is part of the company’s strategic, ongoing commitment to thoroughly evaluate new nuclear generation options to reliably meet the growing energy needs of its customers while reducing costs and risks,” according to the release.

“Building new nuclear capacity on existing coal sites makes a lot of sense,” said Jon Sanders, director of the John Locke Foundation’s Center for Food, Power, and Life. “Power infrastructure is already there, so it would yield savings in money as well as time. Permitting and building new nuclear facilities, even small modular ones, take a long time. It’s good for Duke to get the ball rolling early.”

The early site permit application to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission “is a first for Duke Energy,” the utility explained. It’s a “risk-mitigation strategy” as Duke pursues options for new nuclear energy.

The application covers six “potential” nuclear designs for the site. Four are considered small modular reactor designs. The other two are labeled “non-light-water designs.” The application does not include reactors like the 11 “large light-water” units Duke operates now in North Carolina and South Carolina.

“Nuclear energy has and will continue to play an essential role in powering communities in the Carolinas,” said Kendal Bowman, Duke Energy’s North Carolina president, in the release. “Submitting an early site permit application is an important next step in assessing the potential for small modular reactors at the Belews Creek site.”

The Belews Creek Steam Station opened in 1974 on Belews Lake in Stokes County as a coal-fired power plant. Duke added natural gas to the plant in 2020 and 2021. The plant has an existing capacity of 2,200 megawatts. Current units are scheduled to be shut down in the late 2030s. Repurposing the site would save customers money, Duke said on its website.

The new federal permit application focuses on a 1,000-acre site near the existing steam station.

“We’re taking a strategic approach to new nuclear development that allows us to advance licensing activities while reducing risks and allowing technologies to mature,” said Kelvin Henderson, Duke Energy chief nuclear officer.

Duke describes the ESP process as optional. Federal regulators would resolve environmental and site safety topics “on the front end” of a project and confirm a site’s suitability for nuclear reactors. Having an approved permit could cut the risk of delays if Duke proceeds with plans for nuclear power in Stokes County.

Because the permit is “technology-neutral,” Duke could wait to select a particular type of nuclear reactor later in its development process.

If nuclear plans move forward at Belews Creek, Duke plans to add 600 megawatts of “advanced nuclear” to its system by 2037. The first small modular reactor could be in use in 2036.

A permit would last for 20 years with a possible 20-year renewal.

“Over the next decade and a half, Duke will be closing or converting all of North Carolina’s coal-fired power plants,” said Sanders of the Locke Center for Food, Power, and Life. “The utility will need to replace that generation as well as add more generation for increasing demand. North Carolinians will need the new generation to be at least as reliable as coal, while the dictates of the Carbon Plan law push Duke to lower-emission sources. Nuclear energy checks both those boxes as a zero-emissions source that is also the most reliable option.”

The state’s Carbon Plan law requires Duke to cut down on carbon dioxide emissions in the years ahead.

“Duke’s most recent filing before the North Carolina Utilities Commission shows, among other things, how much new solar, natural gas, and nuclear capacity the utility wishes to build in North Carolina by 2040,” Sanders explained. “It also shows how much productivity it expects from those sources.”

“The differences between solar and nuclear in both those measures are stark,” Sanders added. “For one, Duke expects to build more than four times more new capacity in solar than it does in nuclear. Nevertheless, Duke expects to receive nearly four times as much productivity from that new nuclear capacity than from the new solar. Getting more nuclear on the grid is crucial to ensuring reliable electricity in the coming years.”",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/light-switch-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-30 18:58:03.386088

CHARLESTON — Gov. Patrick Morrisey set a goal nearly six months ago for West Virginia to triple its electric-generating capacity, but the comprehensive plan is still in the works with a public comment period now closed.

The West Virginia Office of Energy sought public comment and recommendations as it works on developing a comprehensive energy policy around Morrisey’s 50 by 50 energy initiative. The public comment period opened on Dec. 9 and closed last Friday. According to the office, 71 public comments were submitted by Friday’s deadline.

During speeches in August in White Sulphur Springs and Wheeling, Morrisey unveiled his 50 by 50 initiative aimed at increasing base load electric generating capacity in the state from just under 16 gigawatts to 50 gigawatts by 2050.

“This 50 by 50, that’s a needle mover,” Morrisey said during an end-of-the-year press conference last Monday. “West Virginia needs to be America’s energy state … and to really be a driver of America’s energy renaissance.”

According to the solicitation for public comments, the Office of Energy said Morrisey’s 50 by 50 initiative will be an all-of-the-above energy, focused on traditional fossil fuel sources (coal, natural gas), and also include nuclear energy, hydrogen power, and renewable energy sources (wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric). The comprehensive energy policy being developed around 50 by 50 will also include a transmission plan.

“It will address the need for sufficient electricity transmission lines and natural gas transmission pipelines to support the increase in baseload electricity generation,” according to the Office of Energy’s solicitation for public comment. “It will also recommend locations for the placement of natural gas pipelines and electricity transmission lines in locations throughout the state that lack sufficient access and in areas where access to increased supplies of electricity or natural gas will spur manufacturing or other economic development.”

The comprehensive energy policy will include an energy security plan in order to protect against blackouts and other disruptions, and prevent potential threats to the electrical grid, such as cyber-attacks. This plan will include inventories of energy sources in the state and critical infrastructure; developing emergency protocols and coordination plans between local, state and federal agencies; and conducting tabletop exercises and other scenario planning.

The comprehensive energy policy will also include 25-year strategic development for each source of energy in West Virginia. These plans will focus on expanding electrical generation, infrastructure expansions, economic development incentives, site development, legislation and rule-making, workforce development, education, financial and tax incentives, safety, environmental mitigation, and energy security.

Since October, there have been several natural gas power plant projects announced that would add an additional five gigawatts to what is produced by the state’s power plants, including projects announced by FirstEnergy and a partnership between Kindle Energy, GE Vernova, Blackstone, and Wolf Summit Energy.

Morrisey’s 50 by 50 initiative and the comprehensive energy policy being developed by the Office of Energy is focused on making West Virginia the battery of the east coast and making the state more appealing to energy-intensive data center and AI projects.

House Bill 2014, a new law first proposed by Morrisey, is aimed at attracting high-impact industrial businesses and data centers to West Virginia along with microgrids to power the data centers using both fossil fuels and renewable energy generation. The rules governing these new data center and microgrid districts are still awaiting approval from the Legislature, with the Legislative Rule-Making Review Committee slated to review these proposed rules next month.

“We’re going to be leveraging the intersection between energy and technology,” Morrisey said last week. “We’re excited about that and we’re going to keep going. We’re working on finalizing those plans. That’s been a big, big project.”

West Virginia only has one natural gas-fired power plant that provides electricity to retail customers in the PJM market, a regional electric transmission organization that operates a competitive wholesale electricity market in the northeast. West Virginia is one of 12 states and Washington, D.C., which are part of PJM.

The state has nine coal-fired power plants, with coal-fired power accounting for 86% of West Virginia’s total electricity net generation. In its public comment filing, the West Virginia Coal Association argued that existing coal-fired power plants should be prioritized as the foundational assets of the state’s power grid to ensure reliability and economic stability.

“West Virginia’s nine existing coal-fired power plants represent ‘premium assets’ in this age of increased power demand and should serve as the fundamental building block of any plan to increase generation within the State of West Virginia,” wrote West Virginia Coal Association President Chris Hamilton.

In its public comments, the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce advocated for a free-market approach that balances environmental stewardship with the practical needs of the state’s business community. The chamber expressed strong support for a diversified power generation strategy that utilizes both traditional fossil fuels and renewable resources to ensure grid reliability.

“The chamber applauds the goal of the plan to develop new generation capacity utilizing a combination of natural gas, nuclear, coal, geothermal, solar, and wind,” wrote West Virginia Chamber of Commerce President Steve Roberts. “The resource rich opportunities that West Virginia has need to be harnessed for growth of the state’s economy for the benefit of all its citizens.”

West Virginians for Energy Freedom, a coalition of groups that advocate for electric ratepayers, submitted public comments calling for any comprehensive energy policy to prioritize consumer autonomy and protections that protect ratepayers for bearing the financial costs for expanding electric generation. The group called for allowing ratepayers to purchase power from nearby customers, use of plug-in solar systems, and removing caps on net metering solar credit programs.

“Without taking a position on the wisdom of tripling energy capacity in 25 years, we caution that, if West Virginia ratepayers or taxpayers would be required to pay for any of power plants built under this plan, there be guarantees and protections in place to ensure that the plants will be useful and beneficial for West Virginians,” the organization wrote.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.theintelligencer.net/images/2025/12/29234026/Power-Plant-12-29-25-667x500.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 16:58:31.582116

Hundreds of residents and local officials have expressed concerns about property values, environmental impact and potential costs to ratepayers.

The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin is expected to make a decision on the project and its route in the spring of 2026.

Heidi and Michael Prodoehl felt lucky to find their forever home in rural West Bend.

Out their dining room window, they can see a thick line of trees, an open field and a small wooden playground in their backyard. In the Prodoehls' 13 years living there, they have had two children, started a garden and planted about 300 trees on the property, as well as around the surrounding prairie. Their children ride bikes along a dirt path in the woods, where an old maple towers above them. They marvel at passing turkey and deer. Mike said they spend almost all their days off outside.

Since moving there, they’ve found a quiet, natural escape from the Milwaukee suburbs. But they are sick with worry it could all be lost if a proposed power line cuts through their land.

“It’s like losing a limb,"" Mike said. ""They’re just cutting off a whole part of what we had.""

The proposed power line is part of a $1.6 billion American Transmission Co. project spanning several Wisconsin counties to provide power for a sprawling, $15 billion artificial intelligence data center campus for tech companies Vantage, Oracle and OpenAI in nearby Port Washington.

ATC's proposal filings do not explicitly identify the data center, but they do say the power lines are needed ""to reliably serve a load interconnection request by We Energies to serve a new large load addition in the Port Washington area.""

The Waukesha-based power line company's plans include building around 100 miles of high-voltage lines, upgrading existing ones and constructing up to five new substations across Ozaukee, Washington, Fond du Lac, Calumet, Sheboygan and Manitowoc counties, according to ATC's proposal, which includes thousands of pages the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reviewed.

ATC is a subsidiary of the WEC Energy Group, the parent company of We Energies. The proposal was submitted in September 2025 to Wisconsin's Public Service Commission, a state agency that oversees utility companies and approves new projects.

ATC's application proposes two options for the power line routes.

The company's preferred route (which would run through the Prodoehl family's land) would be 11 miles shorter, run near fewer homes and be less expensive, costing $1.4 billion, which is appealing to those with concerns that regular energy ratepayers will foot the bill for these power lines.

The alternative route would be longer and costlier at $1.6 billion, but it would run by fewer farms, build more upon existing lines and disrupt fewer natural spaces; it's garnered endorsements from local elected officials and, most recently, the data center's development company, Vantage.

Proposed power lines are tied to data center campus project in Port Washington

Since the data center project was announced in January 2025, word about the power line proposal has spread. In February, some homeowners and businesses along the proposed routes told the Journal Sentinel they'd received letters from ATC, and many expressed concerns that the lines would slice through their communities and disrupt their natural spaces.

Over the last several months, many of these residents have collectively submitted over 500 complaints to ATC, detailing their concerns about the potential impact on homes, businesses, farmland, the environment and recognized cultural or historical sites, as well as frustrations about bearing the burden of infrastructure intended to support a few private companies.

Many have also directed concerns toward the companies behind the data center campus project driving energy demand for the new lines, as well as the local officials paving the way to approve it. They've joined the growing group of regional residents voicing opposition to the data center project at local city meetings.

Meanwhile, the data center project's supporters, including many southeast Wisconsin business leaders and trade groups, emphasize the data center companies' promises that the project will create jobs, improve the region's grid for all users, add over $2.7 billion to the area's gross domestic product and position Wisconsin at the forefront of a technological revolution that cannot be stopped.

Without the new power lines, the grid would not be able to support the new data center, according to ATC's application.

ATC's proposed power line project would meet 'substantial' energy needs of data center project, which would otherwise overwhelm Wisconsin's grid

If fully built out, the data center campus could be one of the largest in the country with committed capacity from a utility. But even the first phase of development, with its four data center buildings and around 1.3 gigawatts, will require a significant amount of new energy infrastructure.

The amount of energy needed to power the center is ""substantial and [the proposed energy load addition] would be one of the largest in Wisconsin,"" ATC's application says.

Without the proposed 138- and 345-kilovolt power lines and substations, the flurry of new energy projects for the data center campus would overwhelm parts of Wisconsin's grid, according to the application.

Power line project spans six counties, including dozens of farms, hundreds of homes and several natural spaces

The price tags of both the $1.4 billion preferred and a $1.6 billion alternative routes include the costs of building at least four new substations, totaling between 94 and 104 acres:

A 40-acre Decker Substation in Port Washington

An 18-acre Sheboygan River Substation in the Town of Osceola

A 16-acre Mullet River Junction Substation in the Town of Lima

A 20-acre Cedar Creek Junction Substation in the Town of Jackson

A 10-acre Adell Substation in the Town of Sherman (if the alternative route is chosen)

The routes span farmland, pastureland, grasslands and wetlands, as well as residential, commercial, industrial and public areas across six different counties: Calumet, Fond du Lac, Ozaukee, Manitowoc, Sheboygan and Washington.

The preferred route runs alongside roughly 110 animal farms, including nearly 50 dairy farms. The alternate route runs alongside roughly 80 animal farms, including nearly 40 dairy farms, according to the proposal.

The preferred route would run within at least 300 feet of 128 homes and two apartment buildings. The alternate route would run by 226 homes and 16 apartment buildings within that same distance.

The preferred route would run by roughly 1,391 acres of wetlands. The alternative would run by about 886 acres of wetlands.

The preferred route would cross over portions of the Fox River State Trail, Nichols Creek Wildlife Area, Stony Creek River corridor, Sheboygan County Waterfowl Production Area and Gough Lake north of Cedarburg Bog. The alternate route would cross over portions of Brillion Wildlife Area, Kettle Moraine State Forest, Mullet Creek Wildlife Area, Quade Park and Cedarburg Bog Natural Area.

The two routes would also cross through areas of archaeological, historical and ecological significance, including indigenous burial mounds, though most of the information in the application about these sites is redacted in the public-facing filings.

Asked about the redactions, ATC said they largely covered locations of rare species, known burial sites or archaeological artifacts, which is kept confidential to prevent tampering.

Some costs for power lines and substations, along with other new power plant projects, could eventually fall on customers

Executive Director of the utilities watchdog Citizens Utility Board Tom Content said ATC's proposal is the biggest project he's ever heard of just to plug one customer into Wisconsin's grid.

Citizens Utility Board has been advocating to protect regular energy customers from the massive scale of costs for new power plants and power lines in the PSC pipeline to support data centers.

When the Journal Sentinel asked ATC how the power lines would be financed, the company indicated that an unspecified portion of the costs could be spread across all electricity customers in the state over time.

ATC does not bill large energy and infrastructure beneficiaries like data center developer Vantage. Instead, ATC said it bills local distribution company customers, like We Energies and other utilities, as is established under a federal tariff that regulates transmission companies.

We Energies and other local distributors then pass those costs on to their own customers, ATC said.

In March 2025, We Energies proposed a new electric rate for data center companies, where those companies would cover 75% of the costs for nearly $6 billion in new power plants serving data centers.

That proposal also includes a ""transmission service charge,"" which would allow We Energies to pass some costs to data center companies, but the application is murky about how much data centers would actually pay.

This is a big question mark for energy consumer advocates, Content said. ""We're very concerned about the transmission cost piece of this.""

For residents, property and environmental impacts are among the top concerns, along with stray voltage, historical sites, farmland and the data center

Included in ATC's application documents are hundreds of pages of survey responses and emails from residents along the proposed route, expressing concerns about either parts of the routes or the entire project.

A total of 511 people sent feedback to ATC during late August and early September 2025, according to a Journal Sentinel analysis. The survey responses do not include around 509 people who signed three separate petitions opposing the power lines, which were also submitted to ATC.

85% said they had concerns about the project's potential impact to their property, including their business and home values.

74% had concerns about potential impacts to the environment, natural resources and wildlife.

24% expressed concerns about health and safety, especially regarding stray voltage or the impact of electromagnetic fields on humans or cattle.

20% expressed concern about the impact on important cultural and historical sites.

16% expressed explicit opposition to the data center campus in Port Washington driving demand for the proposed power lines.

13% were concerned about the proposed lines' intrusion onto farming and agricultural land.

10% were concerned about the potential impact on the grid's reliability or their energy costs.

Asked about the top concerns in the analysis, ATC said the company's public engagement efforts, including six open house sessions and four informational mailings, helped inform its proposal. The company also said, moving forward, it would respond to additional feedback on its application as needed.

In its application, ATC said its proposal strives for minimal impact to existing homes, schools, places of worship, cemeteries, natural spaces and areas used for cultural, historical, archaeological, recreational, economic, transportation and agricultural purposes.

Dairy farmers near the proposed routes express concerns over stray voltage

Jason Vorpahl is the co-owner and CEO of Rockland Dairy, which owns 5,000 acres of farmland in Random Lake and Saukville. The two farms have 3,600 dairy cows and produce 300,000 pounds of milk each day.

In a letter to ATC, Vorpahl said cows at the farm struggled with electrical currents and stray voltage before a substation 1 mile away from was removed in 2007. Electromagnetic fields arise from the flow of electricity through the power line and decrease as you move farther from the line, according to ATC.

“Prior to 2007, our cows did not perform well,"" Vorpahl said. ""They did not drink water well, did not eat well, did not milk well, had thin sores on their feet, did not breed and get pregnant well and had many metabolic issues.”

He said those issues disappeared when the substation was removed. Those improvements are now threatened by the proposed lines being too close to the dairy farms, especially the one in Saukville, he said.

""If that power line goes through, we will be done milking cows there,"" Vorpahl said.

Dozens of other dairy farmers who sent feedback to ATC also said they've noticed health and performance issues with their cows near substations or power lines.

Venture Dairy Cooperative, a Wisconsin dairy farmers advocacy group, also sent a letter to ATC saying the group was ""gravely concerned"" the project would pose a ""serious risk to the viability of our farms.""

Residents are concerned about the natural and cultural areas that the proposed lines and substations would run through ‒ and unfairness

Tom Stolp, executive director of Restoring Lands, a nature preservation land trust, said the routes could ""negatively and irreversibly"" affect some of the trust's 7,500 acres of protected land, including 30 community nature preserves and conservation easement holdings.

The preferred route especially would cut directly through lands intentionally protected for the public's benefit – protections paid for with millions of dollars in philanthropy and public investment, Stolp said.

In an interview with the Journal Sentinel, Cheryl Nenn, who works for the environmental advocacy nonprofit Milwaukee Riverkeeper, said the group is concerned about transmission line construction cutting through vegetation near streams and creeks, such as Cedar Creek, the Milwaukee River and the Sheboygan River.

Cooler temperatures found in the north branch of the Milwaukee River watershed are critical for trout spawning and trout populations are of great concern, Nenn said. Clearing trees for the lines would likely raise temperatures in those already warming waterways.

“Losing shade is not going to help that situation,” Nenn said.

Several respondents said they moved into their homes to get away from existing or new power lines near previous homes, including Saukville resident Suzanne Szucs, who left her home in the City of Milwaukee three years ago to escape power lines.

""I only want to see nature and trees outside my windows,"" Szucs wrote in her feedback statement. ""I want to enjoy the property we purchased alongside the neighboring properties that brought us out here in the first place ‒ unmarred.""

Others said it's unfair that people in municipalities far from the data center in Port Washington will have to face the scale of infrastructure costs.

Port Washington residents Ann and Kim Pemble wrote in their feedback statement, ""It is unconscionable that any of us in the proposed study zone would have to bear the burden of the transmission lines when all potential benefit will accrue solely to the city of Port Washington.""

""The entire data center project is for a multibillion dollar company. It is not a public project in any way, shape or form,"" the Pembles said.

Many respondents formed their own groups to oppose the power lines, including the Responsible Energy Alliance, consisting of residents from Saukville, Trenton, Fredonia and Farmington. Two different factions of the alliance, Advocates for Responsible Power and the Protect Fredonia Coalition, have already filed notices of intervention to the PSC.

Separately, the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty publicly threatened legal action against any potential uses of eminent domain for the project on behalf of local landowners and artists Tom and Mary Uttech. The proposed routes would run through the family’s scenic property in Saukville, which is protected by a conservation easement and inspires many of Tom's nationally renowned paintings.

Local officials have also weighed in

The Saukville and Fredonia town boards separately passed resolutions opposing the proposed routes through their communities on Aug. 27 and Sept. 10, respectively.

Washington County's Board of Supervisors also unanimously passed a resolution opposing new power line infrastructure proposed in the county. County Executive Josh Schoemann sent a letter to ATC expressing significant concerns about the proposed routes after the county held several public listening sessions.

Port Washington Mayor Ted Neitzke and the city's common council issued a proclamation urging the PSC to approve the alternative route, which Neitzke said builds more upon lines and infrastructure that already exist.

""The preferred route impacts some of the most pristine and rural areas of our county and I do not want that area to be impacted,"" Neitzke said in a letter to the PSC.

A spokesperson for State Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin, who represents parts of Ozaukee County, told the Journal Sentinel that she also plans to advocate for the alternative route during the PSC's public comment period. State Rep. Rob Brooks, who represents parts of Ozaukee and Washington counties, also signaled support for the alternative route.

At the City of Port Washington's Dec. 16 common council meeting, a representative of the data center developer Vantage voiced support the alternative route.

A public comment period before the Public Service Commission has not been scheduled. A decision is expected in spring 2026.

ATC expects the Public Service Commission to issue a decision on whether to approve the application and which route to choose during the spring of 2026. If approved, construction would begin May 2026 for completion by December 2027, shortly before the first phase of the data center is set to go online.

A public comment period will take place during which people can weigh in on the project during public hearings. Those dates have not been announced, but ATC has suggested the week of Week of April 13, 2026.

In addition to the Public Service Commission's approval, the transmission line company will need numerous permits and approvals from local, state and federal agencies, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, the Wisconsin Historical Society, and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, according to the application.

Did You Guess the Coffee Shop?

Many of you recognized this Downtown Cary coffee shop. Mike S. guessed it correctly first.

Jenn T. also guessed it correctly, and wrote “I have spent many hours at those windows trying to work instead of people-watch. Great mission, great coffee.”

It’s Esteamed Coffee! This shop has a meaningful mission as a nonprofit organization:, to employ and increase quality of life for adults with “intellectual, developmental, communication, and/or visual disabilities by creating meaningful jobs and social opportunities in a warm, supportive environment.”

A 1940s cottage on Academy Street in Downtown Cary is home to the business that employs baristas, cashiers, and other workers with disabilities. Featured work from artists and makers who have disabilities are also on display and for sale.

The menu includes classic espresso bar items and a seasonal menu includes flavored lattes, matcha, cider, and hot chocolate. I got a peppermint mocha and got my on-school-break second grader a “kids temp” hot chocolate.

What else to know: Besides the standard seating, there’s a small conference room on site that can be reserved. Esteemed Coffee also hosts events and clubs.

Find it: 114 S. Academy Street, Cary, open 7:30 a.m.-4 p.m. Tuesdays-Thursdays, 7:30 a.m.-5 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Sundays.

That’s because, unlike the light switches they power, turning a power plant on and off is a delicate procedure.

Mike Deising is executive director of communications for the Midcontinent Independent Systems Operator, or MISO, the organization that balances energy supply and demand across a 15-state region including eastern Missouri. He said ice can take out transmission lines and prolonged cold snaps can negatively impact the machines that make electricity.

“If your car sits outside for too many cold days in a row, it may not start the next time you go out to it,” Deising said. “That same type of principle can apply with a large power plant. It is a piece of machinery.”

Although severe temperatures and winter storms can affect energy infrastructure, industry experts locally and regionally say the system is prepared.

Regional transmission operators such as MISO act as balancing authorities for energy produced and consumed within a territory. Missouri is split by multiple grid operators, including MISO and the Southwest Power Pool, or SPP.

The organizations keep a close eye on weather conditions due to their potential impact on power infrastructure.

“If we do see sustained cold temperatures for long periods of time, that's when you can see machinery start to break down. We can see generation go offline,” Deising said.

Meteorologists at MISO are predicting an average winter for Missouri, according to Deising. The grid operator anticipates power providers across the region have more than enough capacity to meet demand as temperatures fall.

The Southwest Power Pool coordinates power supply and demand across parts of 14 states including western Missouri.

“One of the benefits of being a regional organization like ours is that it is likely that some of the northern states experience colder than average temperatures and if that was to affect the availability of generation or transmission, we are able to rely on resources in the southern part of our region in order to meet the demand for electricity and vice versa,” said SPP spokesperson Derek Wingfield.

Winter power demand increasing

Power plants can be turned off when the equipment needs to undergo maintenance. Energy supply can also fluctuate due to availability of fuel such as coal and gas and the variability of sunlight and wind that feed renewable sources.

Grid operators coordinate tapping into emergency reserves of power as needed when plants are out of service throughout the winter.

The City of Columbia owns and operates multiple so-called “peaker” power units that don’t run constantly but are turned on when energy demand is particularly high.

“Very early in the morning is when you have your coldest temperatures and that's when our staff has to be able to go out and start those units up and get them operational,” said City of Columbia Utilities Director Erin Keys.

Columbia sees the highest demand for power in the summer months, but Keys said winter consumption is creeping up.

The city’s municipal electric utility generates some of its own energy and buys the rest. Keys said the price of power on the marketplace has been rising.

“Our prices to purchase that energy are increasing, and at some point we're going to have to pass that on to the customers as well, so their prices are going to increase over time,” Keys said.

Keys said prices have risen due to a supply and demand mismatch. As coal plants have been retired across the Midwest, replacement generation hasn’t kept up, she said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a07feb7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x2999+0+253/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb2%2Ff9%2F77748a9d4dcd8a94086137f39d8f%2Fgas-plant-edit.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 12:13:02.458859

If that happens, the AI power land grab moves from story to steady state, with Wall Street underwriting the new base layer of the internet.","Goldman Sachs shares were little changed near $892 as the bank moved to co-lead financing for a 5-gigawatt buildout of private power campuses in Texas designed for artificial intelligence workloads. The deal marks one of the largest Wall Street bets yet on dedicated electricity for data centers, a market racing to secure firm, around-the-clock power outside the clogged grid queue. The size is eye-catching: 5 gigawatts is on par with several nuclear units and signals that private power for AI is shifting from pilot to industrial scale.

Wall Street backs private power for AI

The financing gives developers a way to stand up “power islands” for hyperscalers and AI startups that cannot wait years for grid interconnections. Instead of relying on traditional utility procurement, these campuses bundle onsite generation, transmission, and data hall buildouts under one umbrella, often with long-term capacity contracts from tenants. For banks, the structures look familiar: asset-backed loans, project finance tranches, and revenue visibility tied to blue-chip offtakers. For AI players, it is a speed-to-energize calculation. Latency is money, and the fastest route today is often building your own power.

Texas becomes AI energy ground zero

Texas is where this strategy is scaling. In recent weeks, capital has flooded into the state’s AI power stack: a $5 billion financing package at VoltaGrid to accelerate more than 4.3 GW through 2028, Blackstone’s more than $500 million into Lancium to build over 5 GW of sites in West Texas, and Alphabet’s reported $40 billion commitment to three Texas data centers. The logic is simple. Texas offers land, access to abundant wind and solar, and a market design that rewards flexible generation. Developers can site near fuel, transmission corridors, and fiber, then stitch together the power and compute blocks AI tenants demand.

Why banks like Goldman want in now

For Goldman Sachs (GS), the fee pool spans origination, underwriting, syndication, and hedging. These deals come with commodity complexity—natural gas supply, power price exposure, and ancillary services—that suit a balance sheet bank with a trading engine. The repeatability matters. Once one 1- to 2-gigawatt campus is financed and operational, the blueprint can be cloned across Texas and other permissive jurisdictions, turning a headline transaction into a pipeline. With public markets rewarding AI infrastructure stories and private credit awash in cash, the syndicate base is deep. That combination can compress execution timelines, a selling point to tenants starved for megawatts.

Grid strain forces a parallel buildout

ERCOT is dealing with an avalanche of gigawatt-scale requests that would have seemed implausible two years ago. Demand from AI, crypto, and industrial reshoring is testing Texas’ ability to connect load fast enough. Private power campuses are a workaround. By generating behind the meter or tapping lightly congested interties, developers cut years off interconnection queues and reduce curtailment risk. That does not eliminate dependencies. Gas pipelines, water permits, and air approvals still govern pace. But compared with waiting in the queue, the campus model offers a more controllable critical path—and that is the currency AI operators value most.

The emissions math raises policy risk

The rush has an environmental cost profile that investors must underwrite. Texas developers have filed plans for more than 100 new gas-fired plants over the next few years to meet industrial and data center loads, a slate that could add more than 100 million metric tons of greenhouse gases annually if fully built. Many AI campuses will pair gas turbines with batteries and co-locate near renewables to shave emissions and hedge costs, yet the near-term reality is simple: firm power in ERCOT still means gas. If federal or state rules tighten, financing costs could rise, timelines could stretch, and operating profiles may shift toward cleaner blends faster than pro formas assume. That uncertainty does not kill the deals—but it should price into covenants, step-in rights, and hedging packages.

Who pays and who benefits in this model

AI tenants are signing multi-year, capacity-like contracts that function more like infrastructure offtakes than traditional utility bills. The structure pulls forward capital from lenders and sponsors, recouped through fixed and indexed payments tied to uptime commitments. It is a sweet spot for private equity and infrastructure funds seeking long-duration cash flows, and for banks like Goldman that can package debt, distribute tranches, then cross-sell commodity risk management. The result is a layered capital stack—term loans, asset-based revolvers, notes—secured by contracted megawatts and high-credit-quality counterparties. As more campuses hit commercial operation, expect refinancing waves that free up equity and recycle into the next build.

What it signals for GS stock and peers

GS finished the session little moved, but the strategic direction is clear. After a volatile consumer push and a subdued M&A cycle, bankable megaprojects with hard assets and contracted revenues look like the right lane. Competitors from JPMorgan to Morgan Stanley will chase mandates as data center developers consolidate and hyperscalers standardize procurement. Capital charges under Basel rules can shape how much holds stay on balance sheet, but distribution appetite is ample with private credit and insurance capital hungry for duration. If Goldman converts this Texas mandate into a multi-gigawatt franchise, the revenue mix tilts back to classic Goldman: originate, structure, distribute, hedge.

The Texas edge—and its limits

Texas confers advantages—permissive siting, merchant-friendly markets, and mature energy logistics—that are hard to replicate at scale elsewhere. That is why Lancium’s sites sit in wind- and solar-rich West Texas and why Google and others are planting flags around existing transmission spines. But the model has limits. Water scarcity can constrain turbine cooling in arid counties. Local pushback can slow permits even in friendly jurisdictions. Supply chains for turbines, switchgear, and large power transformers remain tight. The first wave of projects will get built; the second wave will compete for scarce kit and skilled labor, pushing timelines and budgets.

What to watch next

Near-term catalysts will come fast.

Track any shift in emissions permitting or incentives for cleaner onsite generation, including tax credits that could tilt designs toward hybrid gas-renewables-battery stacks.

Tesla published a compilation of analyst estimates on its website, and the fourth-quarter consensus from 20 firms pegs deliveries at 422,850 vehicles. If that figure holds, it lands roughly 15% below last year’s Q4 result and extends a slow, stubborn theme: Tesla’s growth story, in car units, keeps tripping over the real world.

The story here is less “analysts have an estimate” and more “Tesla chose the estimate.” And it chose a gloomy one. Tesla’s posted average is more pessimistic than Bloomberg’s compiled consensus (of about 445,061 vehicles), and other trackers have been higher, too (in the mid-440,000s range).

So Tesla is setting the bar where it wants the conversation to start: on the floor — and handing everyone a tape measure.

T​his “soft” fourth quarter is arriving after a year that has looked like three different stories taped together. Tesla delivered 336,681 vehicles in Q1 2025; deliveries rose to 384,122 in Q2; and then, Tesla hit a record in Q3: 497,099 deliveries. Now, the consensus says Q4 gives back a solid chunk of that momentum — and the reason is less about factory choreography or consumer behavior and more about policy gravity.

Federal EV tax credits — $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used — expired on Sept. 30, 2025. And deadlines like that don’t erase short-term demand so much as rearrange it. Buyers who were on the fence get shoved into a single quarter, and the next quarter gets stuck holding the bag. Tesla’s November U.S. sales fell nearly 23% year over year to 39,800 vehicles, according to Cox Automotive data, even after Tesla rolled out cheaper (but still not that cheap) “Standard” versions of the Model Y and Model 3.

CEO Elon Musk has tried to wave away vehicle demand anxiety as a media obsession — “they’re fine, don’t worry about it,” he said in May — even as he later warned investors to brace for “a few rough quarters” in what he called a “weird transition period.” Tesla has been trying to ramp up the conversation about its long-promised robotaxis in Austin, Texas, ahead of Musk’s year-end target for safety-monitor-free rides. With a day to spare, it looks like that prediction's at least true in testing (and not at the fleet level as Musk has promised): Musk says a “Tesla with no safety monitor” drove him around Austin, and Tesla’s AI lead posted video of an empty front seat.

Zoom out, and the EV market is growing, but unevenly. Global EV registrations rose 6% in November, yet North America fell 42% as the post-credit slump spread. Europe is moving in the opposite direction on adoption — battery-electric vehicles are 17% of EU registrations year-to-date through November. Add in intensifying competition, including cheaper EV options from legacy automakers such as Chevrolet and Ford and expanding Chinese brands overseas, and Tesla’s fourth-quarter setup starts to look structural, not seasonal.

And yet, none of this has stopped Tesla’s stock from behaving like the car business is merely the opening act. The company’s shares are up more than 10% this year (and 21% year to date), a sign that plenty of investors are paying for the robotaxi dream and tolerating the delivery math. That split — cars down, narrative up — remains Tesla’s one real magic trick.

Tesla has already trained investors to expect a rationale for every wobble. Earlier in the year, the company blamed a Model Y line changeover across all four factories for “several weeks” of lost production. Q4 doesn’t come with that built-in excuse. If the consensus is right, this is what demand looks like when the incentives are gone, the field is crowded, and Tesla has to sell cars like a normal automaker — while its stock still trades like an AI bet.","https://qz.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=85,format=auto/https://assets.qz.com/media/GettyImages-2225623996.jpg",N,,2025-12-30 12:12:52.883978

When fear takes flight: A dad's first flight with his daughter as the pilot

A parenting rite of passage is teaching your child to drive.

Parents can feel anxiety when their child moves into the driver's seat and the parent becomes the passenger. But it’s something completely different when your child starts flying planes.

On a recent spring morning, I stood on the tarmac at the Ann Arbor Municipal Airport, trying to steady my nerves. My youngest daughter, Sara, had just landed in a tiny two-seat Diamond to take me up for a flight. It’s a single-engine plane, and my first thought was: this thing is small. I wasn’t quite ready to climb in, so I stalled with a few questions.

Giant megaphone installed at Belle Isle Park to amplify the sound of nature

Belle Isle Park in Detroit is home to a new giant ""nature megaphone.""

High school kids lined up to cut the red ribbon to officially open the 10-foot wooden megaphone. They built it which is pretty ambitious considering the advanced carpentry needed to make it.

“Carpentry is my passion. I like the fact that you can take what a lot of people consider to be nothing and make it in to something,” Naim Rashawd, one of the high school carpenters who worked on the megaphone through a project coordinated by Detroit-based Atlantic Impact.

“To be able to do things like that and work on things like that, it’s a real pleasure for me,” he said with a smile.

The megaphone is designed to amplify the sounds of nature near it. Placed next to the Belle Isle Nature Center, it's on a platform in a rare wet-mesic flatwoods forest. Basically it’s a wooded marshy area that develops ephemeral wetlands in the spring which then dry up over the summer.

Why do we call ourselves Michiganders?

There's a longstanding debate in our state: are we ""Michiganians"" or ""Michiganders""?

It's not something you frequently hear people from other states debate.

There's nobody in California who questions; ""are we Californians?"" They're Californians. Texans are Texans. New Yorkers are New Yorkers. Hoosiers, even! Have you ever even heard someone call themselves an ""Indianaian""?

No.

In Michigan, we're less sure. But the truth is that an overwhelming percentage of us call ourselves, like a flock of opinionated, honking geese, Michiganders.

But how did it come to be this way? Here's a brief breakdown of the timeline that took us from a territory of ""Michiganians"" to the land of Michigander.

Powwow returns to downtown Detroit for first time in 30+ years

Downtown Detroit will awaken with dances and drum beats to honor Indigenous culture and resilience. For the first time in over 30 years, there will be a powwow downtown.

The event will open at noon with a Grand Entry, a procession of dancers in regalia. Hart Plaza will host drum performances, and the day will continue with contest dances. Visitors may even partake in those dances.

The event is organized by the North American Indian Association of Detroit with American Indian Health and Family Services, South Eastern Michigan Indians, Inc. and the Detroit Indigenous People’s Alliance.

Food and craft vendors from all over Michigan, Ontario, and Ohio will boast frybread tacos, beadwork, and other items for sale. Attendees are encouraged to bring cash to purchase items from vendors, but entry to the powwow is free and open to the public.

Wild berry foraging is gaining popularity in Michigan

With summer in full swing, you-pick farms have been seeing customers picking their own fruits and vegetables across the state. From blueberries and strawberries to tomatoes and asparagus, many people have opted for gathering their produce themselves.

For some, this food gathering goes beyond the farm. In recent years, many people have been turning to wild berry foraging. Instead of grocery stores, these foragers seek out fresh fruits, nuts and herbs from local hiking trails or even off the side of the road.

“I’ve been in the foraging space for about 25 years, and I can say without a doubt the interest in wild foods has grown tremendously,” wild food forager Lisa Rose said.

Rose has been foraging since she was young, and is the author of multiple books about Midwest foraging and wild food recipes. She attributes the pandemic to the growth in foraging interest.

In new book, ""Citizen Printer,"" Amos Paul Kennedy Jr. aims to ""Agitate! Agitate! Agitate!""

“Artists are the gatekeepers of truth.”

Those words from singer, actor, and activist Paul Robeson are emblazoned in bold black type on a vibrant yellow and green background. The image is one of hundreds of Amos Paul Kennedy Jr.’s posters collected in his new book Citizen Printer. The Library of Michigan has selected it for its 2025 Michigan Notable Books list.

My colleague Paulette Parker and I visited Kennedy's warehouse studio in Detroit. The walls are covered with his works.

To hear Kennedy tell it, his process is not that complicated.

“You just put ink on paper. That's it. It's that simple,"" he says. ""Any way that you want to do it, that's the way you do it.”

Brighton businesses prepare for thousands of Gilmore Girls fans

About a year ago, downtown Brighton watched as 40,000 people descended on the city of 8,000.

Organizers of Destination Stars Hollow, based on the fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut, where the TV show Gilmore Girls is set, had expected maybe 5,000 people, if all went well.

They got eight times as many. This year they're planning for even more — maybe up to 60,000.

Last year, local bookstore 2 Dandelions hit a record-high sale, said the store's event coordinator and social media manager Kelly Blazo. A line of Gilmore Girls fans wrapped around the block, and they weren’t ready for it.

“It was multiple days in one for sure,” Blazo told Michigan Public. “It was a boon for the town last year.”

This year, the 25th anniversary of the debut of Gilmore Girls, 2 Dandelions said it's ordered enough themed mugs and advent calendars to entertain the expected crowd.

Rising from the wreckage: Kegan Gill's Phoenix Revival

For a pilot, ejecting mid-flight is always a bad scenario.

Lt. Kegan ""Smurf"" Gill narrowly escaped from a fighter jet traveling 695 miles per hour, approaching the speed of sound. It’s the fastest survived ejection in naval aviation history.

“I have a very clear linear memory, right up to the point where I pulled the ejection handle, and after that I have no linear memory,” he said about the experience. “But over the course of the years, I'd gotten a lot back in flashbacks, which were often night terrors. So maybe not the most pleasant way to remember something, but that gave me some insights into what had happened.”

A former Naval fighter pilot, Gill flew a training exercise off the east coast in 2014 when his F/A-18E ran into trouble. His subsequent injuries, including head trauma, changed his life forever.

Gill wrote about the experience and aftermath in his new book “Phoenix Revival: The Aftermath of Naval Aviation's Fastest Ejection.”

Stateside Podcast: Ann Arbor's summer reading game goes way beyond books

Summer is prime reading time for many of us, and the Ann Arbor District Library knows just how to keep our noses in books during the warmer months. 2025 marks the 15th year of the Ann Arbor District Library’s Summer Game. It’s an event meant to incentivize people of all ages to read throughout the summer—and to get out into every corner of their community. Participants can earn points through reading or consuming other media. They can also collect codes hidden all around the city—from library branches to local businesses to the city bus. At the end of the summer, participants can redeem those points for library swag.

“It keeps people engaged all summer long. It’s a great way to get the entire household, the entire family, the entire community engaged, because it’s really popular with all ages—not just kids, and not just adults,” said Eli Neiburger, director of Ann Arbor District Library.

The library has been offering a summer reading program since the 1930’s. But about 20 years ago, the library started hearing from patrons that the summer reading challenge was having an unintended consequence.

Miquelle West grew up with a mother in prison. Then she helped set her free

This story was originally published by Outlier Media.

LOS ANGELES — On Feb. 17, Miquelle West drove herself to Los Angeles International Airport, parked her SUV and sobbed. The tears flowed in cathartic waves — a private celebration layered with grief, gratitude and long-awaited relief.

The celebrity stylist and self-described freedom fighter had packed just a few outfits for herself. Everything else in her suitcase was for her most important client yet: her mother.

“I researched and found vintage Oscar de la Renta for my mother because it needed to have a feeling of luxury. She had been deprived of luxury for so long,” Miquelle explained. “And I work in a world where luxury is the epitome, so I needed my mom to feel that.”

Miquelle boarded a three-hour flight to Minneapolis, where she met up with a small group of people who had traveled from across the country — each a freedom fighter in their own right. The next morning, they boarded a van headed an hour south. It wasn’t officially the coldest day of the year, but with a high of just 1 degree and a low of 19 below zero, it felt like it.

Fitted for a prosthetic leg in Flint, a boy from Gaza can chase his dreams again

12-year-old Waheed Al Ghalban didn’t expect to be met with flowers and posters when he arrived at the Detroit airport in April. His mother, Howaida, stood beside his wheelchair as the crowd of people waved Palestinian flags and began to chant “welcome” in Arabic.

Waheed lost an eye, an arm, and a leg to an Israeli bomb last year.

He flew to Michigan along with three other child amputees that the nonprofit organization HEAL Palestine helped evacuate from Gaza in order to receive medical care and prosthetic limbs in the United States.

At least 3,100 people in the territory lost limbs after Israel began military action in Gaza following the Hamas-led attack on its soil on October 7, 2023, according to a report published last June by the World Health Organization. At the time, there were no operational prosthetic services in Gaza.

At the start of this year a UN agency said there were more child amputees per capita in Gaza than anywhere else in the world.

Waheed said he didn’t think he would walk again. “In the time that I spent between the injury and coming here,” he said through a translator, “I didn't expect to get back to normal.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bdc331f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+100/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbe%2F4b%2F4ba50243427dac065314ba5cfcce%2Ffeel-good-cubao-narrow.png,N,,2025-12-30 12:00:49.515271

The Canadian Space Mining Corporation, a Toronto-based startup, has secured a $1-million grant from the Canadian Space Agency to develop LEUNR, a low-enriched uranium microreactor designed to power lunar operations and sustain human presence on the moon. The goal is to get the reactor up and running by 2029— a year before the target for NASA’s lunar reactor and five years ahead of Russia and China. Even if Canada doesn’t beat the superpowers, its efforts won’t be wasted: the same reactor technology is slated for Earthly use, powering remote communities with round-the-clock clean electricity.

2. Carney Will Hit the Brakes on Electric Vehicles…

Mark Carney’s government has paused the Trudeau-era policy that would have required 20 per cent of new cars sold this year to be zero-emission vehicles, with a long-term eye on 100 per cent by 2035. The strategy, designed to speed EV adoption and lower prices, was predicated on a zero-emissions future. But then came reality: Trump’s tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum and auto parts hit car manufacturers hard, and lobbyists lined up to demand relief. Slow consumer uptake made matters worse. Experts insist the EV transition isn’t dead—it’s just deferred. The 2035 target will likely survive, but 2026 will be a lost year for EV ambitions.

3. …and Swap the Climate Fight for Nation-Building

Canada just wrapped up its second-worst wildfire season on record, with nearly nine million hectares burned and smoky skies hanging over major cities. But the climate agenda is losing ground: Canada is already on track to miss its 2030 emissions-reduction targets. Recent drops in building emissions are being offset by ballooning oil and gas output, which is driven by growing global demand for Canadian oil. The latest federal budget, meanwhile, proposes reducing spending at Environment and Climate Change Canada by $1.3 billion over the next several years.

4. Deep Sky Will Collect Carbon From the Air

To counter Canada’s emissions, the feds are investing in direct air capture, which uses chemicals and filters to remove CO₂ from the atmosphere. Montreal’s audacious climate-tech builder Deep Sky unveiled a bold carbon-capture plan: a $500-million megafactory in southwestern Manitoba. The plant aims to yank 500,000 tonnes of CO₂ from the sky each year—the annual emissions from about 100,000 mid‑sized cars—with construction kicking off in 2026. As the Trump administration veers away from green incentives, Deep Sky hopes its prairie gamble will attract business partners from across the border and create a new green-tech job boom.

5. Bill Gates Will Become Canada’s Iron Man

In 2026, Canada is set to get a $910-million jolt to its industrial future: a clean-iron plant from Colorado-based Electra, backed by Bill Gates, Amazon and mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP. Electra’s low-heat process uses renewable electricity to produce iron while cutting emissions by up to 80 per cent. The plant promises to feed Canadian steelmakers, battery factories and automakers, shoring up domestic supply chains and staking Canada’s claim as a green-steel leader. Plus, with Canada exporting about 40 million tonnes of iron ore yearly, the model has potential to scale. The location is still under wraps, but Quebec and Ontario are both in the running.

6. The Government Will Retrofit Homes for Free

Ottawa is back with a second swing at helping Canadians shrink their energy bills. The newly rebadged Canada Greener Homes Affordability Program promises no-cost retrofits, covering the big-ticket upgrades that actually move the needle: insulation, heat pumps and even solar panels. The program will start in Manitoba, where Ottawa and the province are each tossing in nearly $30 million. If the feds get this right, it could cut energy use, reduce bills and make home upgrades feel more like a right than a luxury.

7. Climate Migration Will Ramp Up

The memories of Fort McMurray’s wildfire exodus in 2016 and Lytton’s near-erasure in 2021 are no longer outliers: they’re previews. This summer alone, thousands fled their homes in Newfoundland and Labrador, while 15,000 people were evacuated from northern Manitoba. As droughts, floods and smoke events stack up, Canada is quietly entering an era of internal climate migration. To complicate things, the communities set to absorb these displaced families are often already strained. Rural regions, home to 18 per cent of Canadians, are short on housing, health care, schools and basic services.

8. Canada Will Pour Cash Into Critical Minerals

Canada is no longer content to cheer from the sidelines of the global resource race. Ottawa’s latest budget plants a flag with a $2-billion Critical Minerals Sovereign Fund, giving the federal government the power to take ownership stakes in the country’s most prolific mines and extract more from our resource-rich lands. The goal: to jump-start production of minerals that power EV batteries, semiconductors, clean tech and defence systems. Ottawa is also expanding exploration tax credits to include minerals such as tin, tungsten and chromium. By signing on to the G7’s critical minerals alliance, Canada is stepping into a geopolitical cage match with China, the Goliath of the global mining market.

9. Winter Sports Will Go on the Endangered List

Canada owes its dominance at the Winter Olympics to its frigid weather—but climate change puts our advantage on thin ice. A University of Waterloo survey found 95 per cent of elite winter athletes say climate change is already hurting their sports. Shorter, warmer winters will force cancellations, compressed seasons and spiralling costs for resorts and ski-town economies as they invest in snow-making infrastructure and even indoor skiing.

10. Carney’s Nation-Building Plans Will Hit Roadblocks

Canada’s latest nation-building push is colliding head-on with some of the very nations it wants to partner with. Bill C-5, the government’s fast-track infrastructure legislation, hands Ottawa the power to green-light megaprojects deemed in the national interest—even when First Nations say no. At the First Nations Major Projects Summit this summer, leaders from across the country called out the move as a rollback of consultation dressed up as efficiency. Grand Chief Stewart Phillip said the summit’s real purpose was to warn communities that resistance won’t slow shovels. Exhibit A: Ontario’s Ring of Fire, where the province is charging ahead on mineral extraction without consent. Canada says this is an economic necessity.

“So we just sort of sit out there and produce energy.” Solar pays private landowners in Utah $17 million a year to lease their land.","This story was originally published by ProPublica.

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox believes his state needs more power — a lot more. By some estimates, Utah will require as much electricity in the next five years as it generated all last century, to meet the demands of a growing population as well as chase data centers and AI developers to fuel its economy.

To that end, Cox announced Operation Gigawatt last year, declaring the state would double energy production in the next decade. Although the announcement was short on details, Cox, a Republican, promised his administration would take an “any of the above” approach, which aims to expand all sources of energy production.

Despite that goal, the Utah Legislature’s Republican supermajority, with Cox’s acquiescence, has taken a hard turn against solar power — which has been coming online faster than any other source in Utah and accounts for two-thirds of the new projects waiting to connect to the state’s power grid.

Cox signed a pair of bills passed this year that will make it more difficult and expensive to develop and produce solar energy in Utah by ending solar development tax credits and imposing a hefty new tax on solar generation. A third bill aimed at limiting solar development on farmland narrowly missed the deadline for passage but is expected to return next year.

While Operation Gigawatt emphasizes nuclear and geothermal as Cox’s preferred sources, the legislative broadside, and Cox’s willingness to go along with it, caught many in the solar industry off guard. The three bills, in their original form, could have brought solar development to a halt if not for solar industry lobbyists negotiating a lower tax rate and protecting existing projects as well as those under construction from the brunt of the impact.

“It took every dollar of political capital from all the major solar developers just to get to something tolerable, so that anything they have under development will get built and they can move on to greener pastures,” said one industry insider, indicating that solar developers will likely pursue projects in more politically friendly states. ProPublica spoke with three industry insiders — energy developers and lobbyists — all of whom asked to remain anonymous for fear of antagonizing lawmakers who, next month, will again consider legislation affecting the industry.

The Utah Legislature’s pivot away from solar mirrors President Donald Trump taking a more hostile approach to the industry than his predecessor. Trump has ordered the phaseout of lucrative federal tax incentives for solar and other renewable energy, which expanded under the Biden administration. The loss of federal incentives is a bigger hit to solar companies than the reductions to Utah’s tax incentives, industry insiders acknowledged. The administration has also canceled large wind and solar projects, which Trump has lamented as “the scam of the century.” He described solar as “farmer killing.”

Yet Cox criticized the Trump administration’s decision to kill a massive solar project in neighboring Nevada. Known as a governor who advocates for a return to more civil political discourse, Cox doesn’t often pick fights. But he didn’t pull punches with the decision to halt the Esmeralda 7 project planned on 62,300 acres of federal land. The central Nevada project was expected to produce 6.2 gigawatts of power — enough to supply nearly eight times the number of households in Las Vegas. (Although the Trump administration canceled the environmental review of the joint project proposed by multiple developers, it has the potential to move forward as individual projects.)

“This is how we lose the AI/energy arms race with China,” Cox wrote on X when news surfaced of the project’s cancellation. “Our country needs an all-of-the-above approach to energy (like Utah).”

But he didn’t take on his own Legislature, at least publicly.

Many of Utah’s Republican legislators have been skeptical of solar for years, criticizing its footprint on the landscape and viewing it as an unreliable energy source, while lamenting the retirement of coal-generated power plants. The economies of several rural counties rely on mining coal. But lawmakers’ skepticism hadn’t coalesced into successful anti-solar legislation — until this year. When Utah lawmakers convened at the start of 2025, they took advantage of the political moment to go after solar.

“This is a sentiment sweeping through red states, and it’s very disconcerting and very disturbing,” said Steve Handy, Utah director of The Western Way, which describes itself as a conservative organization advocating for an all-of-the-above approach to energy development.

The shift in sentiment against solar energy has created a difficult climate for an all-of-the-above approach. Solar projects can be built quickly on Utah’s vast, sun-drenched land, while nuclear is a long game with projects expected to take a decade or more to come online under optimistic scenarios.

Cox generally supports solar, “in the right places,” especially when the captured energy can be stored in large batteries for distribution on cloudy days and after the sun goes down.

Cox said that instead of vetoing the anti-solar bills, he spent his political capital to moderate the legislation’s impact. “I think you’ll see where our fingerprints were,” he told ProPublica. He didn’t detail specific changes for which he advocated but said the bills’ earlier iterations would have “been a lot worse.”

“We will continue to see solar in Utah.”

Cox’s any-of-the-above approach to energy generation draws from a decades-old Republican push similarly titled “all of the above.” The GOP policy’s aim was as much about preserving and expanding reliance on fossil fuels (indeed, the phrase may have been coined by petroleum lobbyists) as it was turning to cleaner energy sources such as solar, wind and geothermal.

As governor of a coal-producing state, Cox hasn’t shown interest in reducing reliance on such legacy fuels. But as he slowly rolls out Operation Gigawatt, his focus has been on geothermal and nuclear power. Last month, he announced plans for a manufacturing hub for small modular reactors in the northern Utah community of Brigham City, which he hopes will become a nuclear supply chain for Utah and beyond. And on a recent trade mission to New Zealand, he signed an agreement to collaborate with the country on geothermal energy development.

Meanwhile, the bills Cox signed into law already appear to be slowing solar development in Utah. Since May, when the laws took effect, 51 planned solar projects withdrew their applications to connect to the state’s grid — representing more than a quarter of all projects in Utah’s transmission connection queue. Although projects drop out for many reasons, some industry insiders theorize the anti-solar legislation could be at play.

Caught in the political squeeze over power are Utah customers, who are footing higher electricity bills. Earlier this year, the state’s utility, Rocky Mountain Power, asked regulators to approve a 30% hike to fund increased fuel and wholesale energy costs, as well as upgrades to the grid. In response to outrage from lawmakers, the utility knocked the request down to 18%. Regulators eventually awarded the utility a 4.7% increase — a decision the utility promptly appealed to the state Supreme Court.

Juliet Carlisle, a University of Utah political science professor focusing on environmental policy, said the new solar tax could signal to large solar developers that Utah energy policy is “becoming more unpredictable,” prompting them to build elsewhere. This, in turn, could undermine Cox’s efforts to quickly double Utah’s electricity supply.

Operation Gigawatt “relies on rapid deployment across multiple energy sources, including renewables,” she said. “If renewable growth slows — especially utility-scale solar, which is currently the fastest-deploying resource — the state may face challenges meeting demand growth timelines.”

Rep. Kay Christofferson, R-Lehi, had sponsored legislation to end the solar industry’s state tax credits for several legislative sessions, but this was the first time the proposal succeeded.

Christofferson agrees Utah is facing unprecedented demand for power, and he supports Cox’s any-of-the-above approach. But he doesn’t think solar deserves the advantages of tax credits. Despite improving battery technology, he still considers it an intermittent source and thinks overreliance on it would work against Utah’s energy goals.

In testimony on his bill, Christofferson said he believed the tax incentives had served their purpose of getting a new industry off the ground — 15% of Utah’s power generation now comes from solar, ranking it 16th in the nation for solar capacity.

Christofferson’s bill was the least concerning to the industry, largely because it negotiated a lengthy wind-down of the subsidies. Initially it would have ended the tax credit after Jan. 1, 2032. But after negotiations with the solar industry, he extended the deadline to 2035.

The bill passed the House, but when it reached the Senate floor, Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Pleasant Grove, moved the end of the incentives to 2028. He told ProPublica he believes solar is already established and no longer needs the subsidy. Christofferson tried to defend his compromise but ultimately voted with the legislative majority.

Unlike Christofferson’s bill, which wasn’t born of an antipathy for renewable energy, Rep. Casey Snider, R-Paradise, made it clear in public statements and behind closed doors to industry lobbyists that the goal of his bill was to make solar pay.

The bill imposes a tax on all solar production. The proceeds will substantially increase the state’s endangered species fund, which Utah paradoxically uses to fight federal efforts to list threatened animals for protection. Snider cast his bill as pro-environment, arguing the money could also go to habitat protection.

As initially written, the bill would have taxed not only future projects, but also those already producing power and, more worrisome for the industry, projects under construction or in development with financing in place. The margins on such projects are thin, and the unanticipated tax could kill projects already in the works, one solar industry executive testified.

“Companies like ours are being effectively punished for investing in the state,” testified another.

The pushback drew attacks from Snider, who accused solar companies of hypocrisy on the environment.

Industry lobbyists who spoke to ProPublica said Snider wasn’t as willing to negotiate as Christofferson. However, they succeeded in reducing the tax rate on future developments and negotiated a smaller, flat fee for existing projects.

“Everyone sort of decided collectively to save the existing projects and let it go for future projects,” said one lobbyist.

Snider told ProPublica, “My goal was never to run anybody out of business. If we wanted to make it more heavy-handed, we could have. Utah is a conservative state, and I would have had all the support.”

Snider said, like the governor, he favors an any-of-the-above approach to energy generation and doesn’t “want to take down any particular industry or source.” But he believes utility-scale solar farms need to pay to mitigate their impact on the environment. He likened his bill to federal law that requires royalties from oil and gas companies to be used for conservation. He hopes federal lawmakers will use his bill as a model for federal legislation that would apply to solar projects nationwide.

“This industry needs to give back to the environment that they claim very heavily they are going to protect,” he said. “I do believe there’s a tinge of hypocrisy to this whole movement. You can’t say you’re good for the environment and not offset your impacts.”

One of the more emotional debates over solar is set to return next year, after a bill that would end tax incentives for solar development on agricultural land failed to get a vote in the final minutes of this year’s session. Sponsored by Rep. Colin Jack, R-St. George, the bill has been fast-tracked in the next session, which begins in January.

Jack said he was driven to act by ranchers who were concerned that solar companies were outbidding them for land they had been leasing to graze cows. Solar companies pay substantially higher rates than ranchers can. His bill initially had a slew of land use restrictions — such as mandating the distance between projects and residential property and creeks, minimum lot sizes and 4-mile “green zones” between projects — that solar lobbyists said would have strangled their industry. After negotiating with solar developers, Jack eliminated the land use restrictions while preserving provisions to prohibit tax incentives for solar farms on private agricultural land and to create standards for decommissioning projects.

Many in rural Utah recoil at rows of black panels disrupting the landscape and fear solar farms will displace the ranching and farming way of life. Indeed, some wondered whether Cox, who grew up on a farm in central Utah, would have been as critical of Trump scuttling a 62,300-acre solar farm in his own state as he was of the Nevada project’s cancellation.

Peter Greathouse, a rancher in western Utah’s Millard County, said he is worried about solar farms taking up grazing land in his county. “Twelve and a half percent is privately owned, and a lot of that is not farmable. So if you bring in these solar places that start to eat up the farmland, it can’t be replaced,” he said.

Utah is losing about 500,000 acres of agricultural land every 10 years, most of it to housing. A report by The Western Way estimated solar farms use 0.1% of the United States’ total land mass. That number is expected to grow to 0.46% by 2050 — a tiny fraction of what is used by agriculture. Of the land managed by the Utah Trust Lands Administration, less than 3,000 of the 2.9 million acres devoted to grazing have been converted to solar farms.

Other ranchers told ProPublica they’ve been able to stay on their land and preserve their way of life by leasing to solar. Landon Kesler’s family, which raises cattle for team roping competitions, has leased land to solar for more than a decade. The revenue has allowed the family to almost double its land holdings, providing more room to ranch, Kesler said.

“I’m going to be quite honest, it’s absurd,” Kesler said of efforts to limit solar on agricultural land. “Solar very directly helped us tie up other property to be used for cattle and ranching. It didn’t run us out; it actually helped our agricultural business thrive.”

Solar lobbyists and executives have been working to bolster the industry’s image with lawmakers ahead of the next legislative session. They’re arguing solar is a good neighbor.

“We don’t use water, we don’t need sidewalks, we don’t create noise and we don’t create light,” said Amanda Smith, vice president of external affairs for AES, which has one solar project operating in Utah and a second in development. “So we just sort of sit out there and produce energy.”

Solar pays private landowners in Utah $17 million a year to lease their land. And, more important, solar developers argue, it’s critical to powering data centers the state is working to attract.

“We are eager to be part of a diversified electricity portfolio, and we think we bring a lot of values that will benefit communities, keep rates low and stable, and help keep the lights on,” Rikki Seguin, executive director of Interwest Energy Alliance, a western trade organization that advocates for utility-scale renewable energy projects, told an interim committee of lawmakers this summer.

The message didn’t get a positive reception from some lawmakers on the committee. Rep. Carl Albrecht, R-Richfield, who represents three rural Utah counties and was among solar’s critics last session, said the biggest complaint he hears from constituents is about “that ugly solar facility” in his district.

“Why, Rep. Albrecht, did you allow that solar field to be built? It’s black. It looks like the Dead Sea when you drive by it,” Albrecht said.",https://townlift.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-29-at-8.42.35-AM.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 11:12:48.038764

Dec 30 (Reuters) – Tesla deliveries were expected to fall in the fourth quarter, as the loss of U.S. tax credits and rising global competition sapped demand even as the company rolled out cheaper versions of its best-selling ‍electric vehicles.

The decline would follow plummeting sales in the first two quarters of the year when CEO Elon Musk faced a backlash for his political rhetoric. Third-quarter sales got a boost as buyers rushed to lock in tax credits before they expired in September. Still, Tesla is likely to report its second straight drop in annual deliveries, with this year’s decline steeper.

In October, Tesla launched stripped-down versions of the Model Y SUV ‌and Model 3 compact sedan called Standard. It will face competition ‌from affordable EVs made by Chevrolet and Ford, which are expected to hit the market over the next two years.

Analysts expect Tesla’s sales to recover next year, as the Standard versions, priced about $5,000 below previous base models, help the company defend volumes in Europe and Asia, where Chinese EVs are gaining ground.

The ​company is expected to report fourth-quarter and annual production and delivery numbers on Friday.

NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE SALES HURT

Investor enthusiasm in Tesla largely rests on Musk’s pivot to expanding robotaxis, producing humanoid ‍robots, and improving self-driving technology in its cars. Still, EV ​sales generate much of its current revenue.

Tesla is expected to deliver 432,810 ​vehicles in the December quarter, down about 13% from a year earlier, according to analysts polled by ‍Visible Alpha (VA). Another consensus of 20 analysts compiled by Tesla and released on Monday shows that a sharper drop of 15% to 422,850 vehicles is expected.

Tesla’s full-year deliveries were expected to be 1.65 million vehicles this year, down 7.8% from a year earlier, marking the second consecutive annual decline, according to Visible Alpha’s poll.

The fall will be driven largely by sales in North ‍America and Europe, Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu said in a note.

MUSK MAY BE MORE FOCUSED IN 2026

The slowdown in sales has not dampened a rise in the company’s share price. Tesla shares rose ‍over 14% this year, boosting ‍Musk’s wealth. Facing criticism for running a cost-cutting arm of President Donald ​Trump’s administration, Musk has indicated he will focus on his businesses.

A ​recent court ⁠ruling cleared the way for Musk to reclaim a Tesla pay ‌package that had been voided by a Delaware court. Shareholders in November also approved a new compensation package that could be worth roughly $878 billion over the next 10 years for the world’s richest person.

Delivering 20 million vehicles in total is a key goal for that pay along with other milestones on robotaxi expansion, robot sales and valuation.

Perhaps the most significant contribution of the Wind Proxy Hedge is that its structure is replicable.","A number of specialty insurers are increasingly turning to parametric insurance solutions as an effective tool to help support clean energy deployment, particularly by stabilising revenues and improving access to project finance, according to Jason Kaminsky, CEO, kWh Analytics.

kWh Analytics is a leader in insuring the energy transition, underwriting property insurance and revenue firming products for renewable energy assets.

The company is highly involved in supporting renewable energy project finance transactions, most recently creating and implementing the wind proxy hedge to support developers of wind farms.

kWh Analytics offers the Wind Proxy Hedge product as part of its suite of Climate Insurance and risk transfer solutions for renewable energy projects. This product is aimed at reducing wind speed variability risk and helping project sponsors and lenders improve the bankability of wind farms.

Speaking to Artemis during a recent interview, Kaminsky emphasised that renewable energy is playing an “increasingly important role” towards meeting heightened load demand, thanks to its quickness to deploy, and the fact that it tends to be less expensive than ramping up coal production.

“However, as tailwinds from enhanced tax credits are projected to sunset, project economics have changed significantly, necessitating innovative risk-transfer solutions to enable financing solutions for both new and existing projects,” the CEO said.

Kaminsky also said that specialty insurers are evolving from providing traditional property and casualty coverage for renewable energy to becoming strategic risk management partners that help unlock the capital needed to move projects forward within the market.

“One of the primary ways we’re seeing this is through the use of novel parametric insurance solutions that protect against climate-related losses and stabilize project economics. Not only do these solutions provide asset owners with rapid financial relief when predefined weather conditions are triggered, but new products are being introduced to improve the project finance structure often used to fund these infrastructure assets. In some cases, they enable banks to adjust their downside stress tests in the financial forecast, thereby extending more capital to these types of projects,” Kaminsky told Artemis.

With extreme weather events continuing to rise, and demanding data centers underscoring the need for a robust and resilient grid, the key role that insurers can play towards enabling power supply growth is now more critical than ever.

The executive explained that renewable energy assets are often complex to underwrite and can attract very large limits.

“Lenders are not well suited to handle revenue volatility, and often underwrite to extreme downside scenarios. This is a perfect opportunity for insurers, who can price volatility. If we also consider that projects are now extending into more areas of the country, and into more marginal geographic zones, like ridgelines, with higher resource volatility, we can see why financing and insuring this asset class has allowed for new and creative ways of thinking,” Kaminsky said.

These factors have not only forced insurers to rethink traditional geographic risk assumptions for renewable energy projects and push insureds toward resilience-first approaches, but they’re also motivating them to establish unconventional ways to allocate risks in order to unlock critical financing.

According to Kaminsky, this is where parametric solutions can play a critical role.

“Parametric products can be utilized as hedging structures that are designed to ensure a stable revenue stream to cover debt service obligations for projects over their first several years of operation,” the CEO noted.

He continued: “Financial hedge solutions are not new to power projects; both a revenue put and a heat rate call option exist for methane gas-fired power plants. However, wind projects are one area of renewable energy where we’re seeing truly innovative risk transfer solutions, with a standard wind financial hedge, proxy revenue swap, and a wind proxy hedge floor all currently available in the market.”

In 2024, reinsurer Munich Re provided the capacity to support a parametric wind proxy hedge risk transfer product structured using a solution from kWh Analytics, for a 59MW, 14-turbine wind project in Maine, developed by a Greenbacker Capital Management-affiliated investment vehicle.

As we reported at the time, the financial structure featured the embedded wind proxy hedge, provided by reinsurer Munich Re, advised by kWh Analytics, and using its kWh Analytics Indifference Structure for debt sizing. This marked the first time a parametric wind hedge had been paired with kWh Analytics’ Indifference Structure to support a project finance loan.

Providing further context surrounding the product, Kaminsky said: “The structure paired the carrier’s parametric wind hedge with our proprietary indifference structure to mitigate wind resource volatility—a critical financing barrier in wind projects. By anchoring a revenue floor to proxy wind-speed data, the structure enabled the sponsor to boost its P99 scenario – a financing worst-case 1-in-100 year forecast – and secure ~20% more debt than it would have otherwise.

“Simply put, the hedge paid out if average wind speeds for a certain period of time dropped below a predetermined index. For every dollar of premium paid, the project realized approximately six dollars in additional loan proceeds – a clear case of innovation driving capital efficiency and bankability for renewable energy assets.”

Kaminsky affirmed that this solution was particularly significant for a variety of reasons.

“First, wind projects have historically been tricky to finance. The wind’s variability raises concerns among lenders, often resulting in less debt and reliance on more expensive equity. The Wind Proxy Hedge tackles this head-on: by putting a floor on wind speed, it essentially guarantees a minimum level of revenue even if the wind doesn’t blow as expected. This calibrates the hedge so that even in a worst-case wind scenario, the project maintains a solid financial condition for lenders.”

Furthermore, the CEO noted that the indifference structure is employed to customise the hedge strike price according to quarterly cash flows. In practical terms, the structure determines specific entry and exit strikes that align Wind Proxy Hedge payouts with the precise variations in cash flows across different sizing scenarios.

“When lenders run their downside P99 debt sizing models, they now include guaranteed Wind Proxy Hedge payouts in their cash flow calculations, effectively transforming the project’s risk profile. With the Wind-Proxy Hedge in place, projects become less risky to lenders, making wind a more attractive investment,” Kaminsky added.

Kaminsky also went on to highlight how this marked the first time that a parametric solution for wind has resulted in improved financing terms for the asset owner.

Removing the risk to lenders ultimately means more debt can be used to finance projects, which results in a lower cost of capital.

Perhaps the most significant contribution of the Wind Proxy Hedge is that its structure is replicable. Case in point, the duo successfully closed on a second parametric Wind Proxy Hedge risk transfer deal, which substantially improved the project’s credit profile and enabled higher debt capacity.

“Innovative risk transfer solutions like the Wind Proxy Hedge are opening new pathways for renewable energy project development, exemplifying climate risk transfer at its most impactful – not merely managing risk, but fundamentally restructuring it to accelerate development capital for clean energy deployment,” Kaminsky concluded.",https://www.artemis.bm/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jason-kaminsky-ceo-kwh-analytics.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 11:12:37.898602

This milestone reflects POET’s commitment to providing high-quality, sustainable feed solutions to its customers around the world.","POET, the world’s largest producer of biofuels, celebrated several milestones throughout 2025, including new facilities and partnerships that continue to expand the company’s reach, both domestically and internationally.

“At POET, we believe the future belongs to those who innovate,” said Jeff Broin, POET Founder and CEO. “Our story has always been one of growth and change, and this year was no exception. Every day we work to fuel and feed the world through the power of American agriculture, and we are proud to play a role in growing the global bioeconomy from right here in the heartland.”

In February, the company announced that its Fairmont, Nebraska, bioprocessing facility would join the Tallgrass Trailblazer carbon dioxide (CO2) pipeline. Under the arrangement, POET Bioprocessing – Fairmont will capture bioCO2 for transportation and permanent underground sequestration in Wyoming. This process lowers the carbon intensity of POET’s bioethanol, which will open new market opportunities that create value for Nebraska corn growers and bioethanol producers.

In September, POET acquired a bioprocessing facility in Obion, Tennessee, growing its portfolio to 35 facilities across nine states and reaffirming its status as the world’s largest producer of bioethanol, with an annual production capacity of 3.1 billion gallons. Each year, the company also produces 15 billion pounds of high-protein feed ingredients, 1 billion pounds of corn oil used for renewable diesel, and 800,000 tons of bioCO2 for industrial and consumer applications.

POET also expanded its global footprint with the opening of POET de Ecuador, a new branch dedicated to serving the rapidly growing aquaculture industry and strengthening the company’s growing animal feed division in Latin America. This milestone reflects POET’s commitment to providing high-quality, sustainable feed solutions to its customers around the world.

The company’s global momentum was further emphasized by its ranking as the United States’ 15th-largest container shipper by S&P’s Journal of Commerce, a testament to POET’s scale, reliability, and growing influence in worldwide trade.

On the policy front, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) granted a waiver to allow summertime sales of E15, though POET is still seeking a permanent fix to outdated regulations, which could have a significant impact on ag prices in the longer term. Additionally, California passed a bill allowing the sale of E15 in the state, reaffirming the power of American-made biofuels to provide consumers with a lower-cost, lower-emission option at the pump.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/epm/posts/web/2018/05/PoetLogo_15252986878511.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 12:13:06.954483

During the 2025 regular and special sessions, Gov. Jeff Landry signed several bills into law, including insurance and tort reform, tax elections, and unemployment benefit modifications.

The regular session lasted for nearly two months and concluded on June 12.

Here’s what to know about the laws taking effect soon.

Act 6: Landry approved a bill that changes rules about when certain local tax elections can be held. After passing the bill, small towns can hold special Saturday elections for sales use tax questions with the permission of state authorities.

Act 15: Rep. Emily Chenevert sponsored this bill that changes how fault is handled in civil injury cases by replacing “pure comparative fault” with a “modified comparative fault” rule. This means if someone is found at 51% at fault, you cannot recover anything in a civil lawsuit.

Act 19: A bill authored by Rep. Rodney Schamerhorn focuses on motor vehicle insurance for commercial vehicles. It requires insurance companies to give discounts on liability rates for commercial vehicles equipped with dash cameras or telematics systems.

Act 77: The new bill gives the Louisiana Department of Health power and direction on how it classifies hospitals and sets standards for them. These changes are meant to align hospital regulatory standards with current policy and ensure consistency in how hospitals are overseen.

Act 85: Rep. Gabe Firment authored this bill with plans to change how insurance companies can set their rates by defining what advertising expenses they can add when calculating premiums. The new law says only expenses related to running the business, such as regular administrative costs, can be counted in calculations.

Act 151: This bill, authored by Rep. Troy Hebert, made revisions to the state’s unemployment insurance eligibility requirements. This would require those who are unemployed to actively search for at least five employment opportunities weekly and have documentation proving their applications to continue earning unemployment benefits.

Act 162: Rep. Steven Jackson introduced this bill, requesting that all Louisiana Board of Ethics meetings and the Supervisory Committee on Campaign Finance Disclosure be live-streamed and remain accessible online for at least two years.

Act 501: This new law changes how much the Louisiana Department of Insurance is allowed to collect from people and companies involved in the insurance industry, including license fees for producers and financial regulation fees.

After years of policies that constrained investment and delayed infrastructure, the industry delivered measurable results in 2025. LNG export approvals resumed, long-overdue permitting reform advanced, and production records continued to fall, strengthening national security, supporting the economy, and keeping energy affordable for American households. Federal forecasts show U.S. LNG exports climbing to an average of 14.7 billion cubic feet per day in 2025, up from a record 11.9 billion cubic feet per day in 2024.

These outcomes marked a clear shift from the prior policy approach, which prioritized restrictions over reliability and slowed critical energy infrastructure development. In 2025, the Trump administration’s renewed focus on energy dominance and infrastructure realigned federal priorities with market demand, restoring momentum across the energy sector and unlocking new opportunities for growth.

Here’s a look at the highlights from 2025:

Permitting Reform Gains Momentum

Permitting reform gained strong support in 2025 as lawmakers, industry leaders, and business groups pushed to modernize outdated approval processes that delay critical infrastructure. Following Congress’s return from the August recess, a diverse coalition urged Congress to streamline reviews, reduce delays, lower costs, and boost energy investment.

The letter, signed by a broad cross-section of business and energy groups, including the Independent Petroleum Association of America, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the National Association of Manufacturers, stated:

“The time has come to modernize our nation’s permitting systems so that our communities can build the infrastructure necessary to grow our economy, create good-paying jobs, and meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.”

By modernizing permitting processes and reducing approval delays, critical energy infrastructure can be built faster to meet rising demand and address grid constraints. Streamlined approvals also help lower project costs and support economic growth, enabling more reliable and affordable energy for American households.

The National Petroleum Council (NPC) reinforced this urgency in a new report that underscored that permitting challenges create structural vulnerabilities in the nation’s energy system, contributing to price volatility, supply insecurity, higher costs, and job losses.

Energy Secretary Wright, who commissioned the NPC report, called its findings an important step forward:

“The National Petroleum Council’s findings confirm what President Trump has said from day one: America needs more energy infrastructure, less red tape, and serious permitting reform. These recommendations will help make energy more affordable for every American household.”

Momentum continued to build toward the end of the year. In December, the House advanced the bipartisan SPEED Act, which would overhaul the National Environmental Policy Act, and passed the PERMIT Act, targeting Clean Water Act reforms designed to reduce permitting backlogs. Together, these measures signal meaningful progress toward faster, more predictable permitting outcomes.

LNG Exports Resume and Break Records

Following the LNG moratorium under the previous administration, the U.S. Department of Energy officially reopened LNG export authorizations in early 2025. The move restored regular order to the LNG approval process, as required under the Natural Gas Act. Record-setting exports followed throughout the year, demonstrating that domestic prices remain stable even as American LNG reaches global markets.

In 2025, the United States set LNG export records for four consecutive months, further demonstrating the resilience of the U.S. energy system. The United States now supplies 55 percent of Europe’s LNG, helping EU countries reduce reliance on Russian gas.

According to the International Gas Union’s Global Gas Report 2025, Asia and other emerging economies drove the bulk of global gas demand growth in 2024, while global LNG demand is projected to rise by another 71 Bcm in 2025. This highlights that U.S. LNG exports are critical not just for Europe but also for meeting fast-growing energy needs in Asia.

With LNG exports poised to double, North American export capacity is projected to grow from 15.4 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) to nearly 30 Bcf/d by 2029, an increase of 13.9 Bcf/d according to EIA estimates. This expansion positions the U.S. to meet European energy security needs while supporting rising demand in Asia, American jobs, and long-term economic growth.

During an interview with Axios, Jarrod Agen, executive director of the White House National Energy Dominance Council, captured the global demand for American energy:

“It’s Europe, it’s Asia. They are looking for U.S. energy. They want to get off of Russian energy sources, and we have such a supply.”

U.S. LNG exports have already provided over 273,000 American jobs and are projected to generate $166 billion in tax revenue through 2040, with additional projects under construction expected to amplify these benefits.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright summarized the global importance of U.S. LNG exports in May 2025:

“The facts are clear: expanding America’s LNG exports is good for Americans and good for the world.”

Offshore Production Expands

In 2025, Congress and the administration prioritized expanding offshore energy consistent with the President’s energy dominance agenda. Early in the year, one of the first House Committee on Natural Resources’ oversight hearings highlighted the importance of restoring offshore oil and natural gas development.

Momentum continued in the fall when a federal court reaffirmed presidential authority over offshore leasing, clearing the way for new development. In November, the Interior Department followed with a major offshore leasing expansion, covering waters off California, Florida, and Alaska. These actions align with the Department of the Interior and BOEM’s Five-Year Offshore Leasing Plan (2026–2031), which proposes up to 34 lease sales across the Gulf of America, Alaska, and the Pacific coast. By providing long-term clarity and predictability, the plan encourages investment, supports thousands of jobs, and strengthens U.S. energy security.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum emphasized the importance of these developments:

“Through a transparent and inclusive public engagement process, we are reinforcing our commitment to responsible offshore energy development—driving job creation, bolstering economic growth, and strengthening American energy independence. Under President Donald J. Trump’s leadership, we are unlocking the full potential of our offshore resources to benefit the American people for generations to come.”

Offshore energy continues to deliver substantial economic benefits. activity in the Outer Continental Shelf supported 250,000 jobs and $59.5 billion in economic output. In 2025, BOEM held Lease Sale Big Beautiful Gulf 1, generating over $300 million in high bids for 181 blocks. This sale reflects strong industry confidence in U.S. offshore energy and continued growth across the sector.

Future offshore leasing is projected to produce 2.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day through 2040 , while maintaining stringent environmental standards. Gulf operations continue to emit significantly less per barrel than most other producing regions worldwide.

Alaska Energy Resurgence

Alaska’s energy sector regained momentum in 2025 as coordinated federal and state actions focused on unlocking the state’s vast resource potential. On his first day in office, President Trump signed the executive order Unleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Potential, supporting the Alaska LNG project, reopening access to leases in ANWR and NPR-A, and encouraging responsible resource development.

State leaders praised the move as a critical step toward strengthening energy security and affordability. Senator Lisa Murkowski wrote in a statement:

“The policies laid out in this Executive Order will improve our economy, our budget, and our quality of life while simultaneously making energy more affordable and enhancing national security. Alaska is the blue chip in the United States’ energy portfolio, and I thank President Trump for helping us capitalize on our resources.”

EIA forecasts show Alaska crude oil production is expected to grow in 2026 for the first time since 2017, driven by projects such as Nuna and Pikka—marking the largest annual increase since 2002 and signaling renewed long-term production strength.

Source: Energy Information Administration (EIA), 2025

According to the Alaska Oil & Gas Association, the industry supported more than 69,000 jobs and $5.9 billion in wages in 2022, underscoring its importance to Alaska’s economy and national energy supply.

Record Production While Reducing Emissions

Even through increased demand and renewed energy dominance, U.S. producers continued to demonstrate that record production and emissions reductions can advance together. Methane emissions intensity in the Permian Basin dropped by more than 50 percent from 2022 to 2024, even as the basin contributed nearly half of U.S. oil production and over 20 percent of natural gas output.

Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights, 2025

This year’s Environmental Partnership report highlighted how nationwide methane emissions declined 40 percent since 2015, even as production increased by more than 50 percent.

Return to Realistic Energy Expectations

Also notable in 2025 is that the International Energy Agency (IEA) returned to its core mission of providing objective, market-based energy analysis. After years of speculative scenarios that assumed peak fossil fuel demand by 2029, the IEA reinstated its Current Policies Scenario, projecting continued growth in oil and natural gas demand through 2050.

As Bloomberg reported:

“The annual report being prepared by the International Energy Agency shows decades more of robust fossil-fuel use, with oil and gas demand growing over the next 25 years — not just possible, but probable.”

The shift is more than academic. Banks, investors, and governments rely on IEA modeling to guide infrastructure and energy security decisions. The return to tried-and-tested demand projections has already produced tangible benefits: renewed investment in oil and gas projects, stabilization of energy markets, and clearer signals to policymakers on infrastructure priorities.

After years of underinvestment that risked future shortages, banks reversed course and renewed commitments to oil and natural gas development. Similarly, from Massachusetts and New York to California and Pennsylvania, policymakers quietly reopened the door to natural gas infrastructure, delayed unrealistic emissions targets, and backed away from climate litigation. Together, these developments signal a return to pragmatic energy expectations and policies grounded in reality.

Looking Ahead to 2026

The momentum built in 2025 sets the stage for continued U.S. energy leadership in 2026. Permitting reform, expanded offshore development, and renewed investment in Alaska will remain central to meeting growing global demand. Europe is actively reducing reliance on Russian energy, while Asian markets are increasing imports of U.S. LNG.

At home, think tanks and policy experts are stressing energy strategies that bolster economic competitiveness and grid reliability while accounting for growing electricity needs from AI, data centers, and electrification. AI and data centers are driving significant electricity demand in North America and Asia, highlighting the need for flexible, reliable natural gas to stabilize grids and integrate renewables efficiently.

U.S. energy remains a critical tool for allies and a foundation of domestic prosperity. 2026 will be a year where energy leadership, pragmatic policy, and technological innovation converge to provide reliable, affordable, and globally impactful energy.

Bottom Line

2025 reinforced that the United States can lead the world in energy production while strengthening the economy, meeting global demand, and reducing emissions. With policy reform, infrastructure investment, and continued innovation, the U.S. oil and natural gas industry enters 2026 positioned to deliver affordable, reliable energy at home and abroad.",https://www.energyindepth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EID-EOY-post-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 11:03:04.473754

This marks a pivotal milestone in the American nuclear fuel supply chain, which has lacked domestically owned large-scale enrichment capability for more than a decade.

The last U.S.-owned, large-scale uranium enrichment plant was constructed in the 1950s but shut down in 2013, leaving the United States heavily reliant on foreign, state-owned enterprises that dominate global enrichment capacity. With imports of Russian enriched uranium banned starting in 2028, Centrus Energy’s endeavors address the urgent and growing need for secure, U.S.-owned enrichment capacity.

Centrus Energy is strategically moving ahead to expand its uranium enrichment plant in Piketon to support the production of both Low-Enriched Uranium and High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU). The company is already a leading contender for funding from the Department of Energy, with potential task orders indicated at approximately $900 million each.

Centrus Energy raised $1.2 billion via convertible note transactions in November 2024 and August 2025 and recently launched a $1 billion at-the-market offering. The company also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (“KHNP”) and POSCO International, a subsidiary of POSCO PKX, attracting foreign investment.

Beyond capital support, the collaboration with KHNP and POSCO creates strategic opportunities, such as additional supply agreements for Low-Enriched Uranium and HALEU. Notably, POSCO International is also advancing a next-generation High-Temperature Gas Reactor powered by HALEU.

Centrus Energy already has $2.3 billion in contracts in place from both domestic and international customers to support new U.S. uranium enrichment capacity. These agreements are, however, contingent upon it achieving key milestones toward building the new capacity.

The California TFAIA

The California TFAIA applies to “frontier developers,” or developers that have trained or initiated the training of a frontier model. A “frontier model” is defined as a large foundation model trained using a quantity of computing power greater than 10^26 integer or floating-point operations per second (i.e., a very large model).

The California TFAIA introduces enhanced transparency and accountability obligations for “large frontier developers” whose combined annual revenue exceeded $500 million in the previous calendar year (including affiliates). Large frontier developers must create, implement, and prominently publish a “Frontier AI Framework” describing the company’s approach to identifying and mitigating “catastrophic risks” (i.e., foreseeable and material risks that a model will contribute to the injury of more than 50 people or more than $1 billion in property damage, in connection with biological, chemical, or other weapons, cyberattacks without human oversight, and evasion of control) and should include, among other things,

alignment with national and international standards and industry best practices;

engagement of third parties to assess risks and audit mitigation effectiveness;

cybersecurity measures to protect unreleased model weights; and

internal governance to ensure compliance with these protocols.

The California TFAIA also requires “critical safety incident” management and reporting, which include

unauthorized access or modification of frontier model weights causing death or injury;

harms caused by a catastrophic risk, loss of control of a model leading to death or injury; and

models using deceptive methods to bypass controls.

The California TFAIA is one of several California AI-related measures effective on January 1, 2026, including the GAI Training Data Transparency Act (AB-2013) and the AI Content Transparency Act (SB-492), each of which imposes significant penalties for noncompliance. Companies operating in California should prepare for a layered AI compliance environment as these measures take effect.

The Texas RAIGA

The Texas RAIGA applies broadly to developers and deployers of AI systems that conduct business in Texas, provide products or services used by Texas residents, or develop or deploy AI systems within Texas. The Texas RAIGA prohibits such developers and deployers from intentionally creating or using AI systems for “restricted purposes,” which include:

encouragement of self-harm, violence, or criminality;

infringement of federal constitutional rights;

unlawful discrimination against protected classes; and

the creation or distribution of AI-generated child sexual abuse material, unlawful deepfakes, or communications impersonating minors in explicit contexts.

The Texas Attorney General (“AG”) may issue civil investigative demands requiring detailed information about the AI system in question, including a description of its use; the types of data used for training; a summary of inputs and outputs; the metrics and evaluation methods for assessing performance; and monitoring and safeguards in place. The Texas RAIGA clarifies that developers and deployers are not liable solely because end users misuse their AI systems; rather, liability depends on the developer’s or deployer’s intent in creating and distributing an AI system. Enforcement by the AG can lead to significant penalties.

The Texas RAIGA provides affirmative defenses for parties that self-detect through feedback from a developer, deployer, or other person; testing procedures, such as red-teaming or adversarial testing; adherence to state agency guidelines; or an internal review process, provided that the party is otherwise in compliance with a nationally recognized AI risk management framework, such as NIST’s AI Risk Management Framework.

The Texas RAIGA also creates an AI regulatory sandbox, managed by the Texas Department of Information Resources, allowing approved participants to test AI systems under relaxed requirements for up to thirty-six (36) months, during which the AG will not pursue enforcement actions.

The Executive Order

The Executive Order directs the Executive branch to coordinate federal action and encourage federal legislation for a uniform standard. The Executive Order directs the Attorney General to establish an AI litigation task force (the “Task Force”) to challenge state AI laws deemed inconsistent with the Executive Order’s language, including on the grounds of unconstitutional regulation of interstate commerce and federal preemption. The Executive Order calls for an evaluation of state AI laws, including those that compel disclosures or alter model outputs in ways that may raise constitutional concerns, underscoring potential federal-state conflict across an existing and growing slate of state AI laws.

The Executive Order also directs the Secretary of Commerce to publish, by March 11, 2026, an evaluation identifying burdensome state AI laws that conflict with the federal policy and merit referral to the Task Force. At a minimum, the evaluation must flag state laws that require AI models to alter truthful outputs or compel disclosures or reporting that would violate the First Amendment or other constitutional protections.

The Executive Order leverages federal funding and regulatory standards by directing:

the Secretary of Commerce to condition certain remaining “Broadband Equity Access and Deployment” program funds on states’ avoidance of “onerous” AI laws to the maximum extent permitted by federal law;

agencies to consider conditioning discretionary grants on states refraining from enacting or enforcing conflicting AI laws during performance periods;

the Federal Communications Commission to initiate a proceeding to consider adopting a federal AI reporting and disclosure standard that would preempt conflicting state laws; and

the Federal Trade Commission to issue a policy statement by March 11, 2026, describing how the FTC Act applies to AI and when state laws requiring alteration of truthful outputs are preempted by federal law barring deceptive practices affecting commerce.

The Executive Order does identify categories of regulation that are not proposed for preemption, including regulation of child safety, AI compute and data center infrastructure (except for generally applicable permitting reforms), and state government procurement and use of AI.

The Road Ahead

It will fall to the courts to determine if, whether and how the Executive Order will affect multiple state AI laws, including those in California, Colorado, Illinois and Texas. Companies should maintain flexible compliance programs capable of adjusting to the shifting state and federal regulatory environment. We will continue to follow these developments closely, as they reflect a dynamic and uncertain future for AI regulation in the United States.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.12073_3056.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 11:02:54.715736

LITTLETON, Colorado, Dec 30 (Reuters) - For supporters of the energy transition, 2025 had plenty to complain about: the scrapping of U.S. clean energy policies, wind droughts in Europe, corporate retreats from wind power generation and a resurgence in coal-fired power output.

Yet there were also developments to celebrate, including record deployment of battery storage systems, historic power generation shares from solar farms in dozens of countries, and continued growth in electric vehicle sales in key car markets.

Below are eight charts that capture some of the key milestones and developments impacting global energy transition progress in 2025, as well as key data points to track heading into 2026 and beyond.

CHINA’S GROWING CLEAN CLOUT

China remains at the forefront of clean energy generation, and deploys more nuclear, solar, wind and bioenergy power than any other nation.

Clean electricity production is on track to record its seventh consecutive year of strong growth. Over the first 11 months of 2025, total clean power output rose 15.4% from a year earlier, Ember data shows.

Clean power sources will generate more than 40% of China’s utility-supplied electricity for the first time in 2025, while fossil fuels’ share will drop to a record low.

Fossil fuels remain the primary pillar of China’s power system, but since 2019 clean power output has grown more than four times faster than fossil-fuel generation.

With Beijing set to keep expanding its solar, wind, nuclear and battery power capacity over the coming decade or so, clean power’s share in China’s generation mix is likely to keep climbing.

China is also making its mark overseas via record clean-technology exports, which climbed to more than $180 billion over the first 10 months of 2025, according to customs data compiled by Ember.

Battery storage systems have emerged as China’s most lucrative clean-tech export, with nearly $66 billion in sales, followed by around $54 billion in EV exports.

Exports of grid equipment and heating and cooling units have also hit record highs in 2025, cementing China’s role as the dominant supplier of hardware for the world’s electrification push.

U.S. SETBACK

In contrast to China’s momentum, U.S. clean energy progress hit reverse in 2025 after federal support for renewables was scrapped under the second administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.

Steep cuts to tax credits for power developers are expected to slash clean energy investments in coming years and leave the U.S. power system heavily dependent on fossil fuels.

Natural gas remains the main source for U.S. electricity, but in 2025, coal-fired plants delivered the biggest jump in output, driven largely by a spike in gas prices that squeezed utility margins.

Coal-fired electricity output from January to November increased 13% from a year earlier, its highest in three years, according to Ember.

Because coal plants emit far more carbon dioxide than gas plants - over 900,000 metric tons of CO2 per terawatt hour versus about 550,000 tons for gas - U.S. power-sector emissions also climbed in 2025.

Total emissions from coal and gas plants reached 1.526 billion metric tons of CO2 from January to November, up 3% from the same period in 2024 and the highest since 2021, Ember data shows.

Given that U.S. natural gas prices look set to finish 2025 at roughly 50% above their 2024 average, utilities are likely to lean further on cheaper coal to meet winter demand.

That means even higher power-sector pollution heading into 2026 and beyond.

BATTERY BOOM AND STEALTHY PROGRESS

Even as U.S. utilities burned more coal in 2025, they also rolled out record battery storage capacity to capture surplus solar and wind power for later use.

Total U.S. installed battery storage capacity surpassed 39 gigawatts in 2025, a 43% increase from 2024, according to energy data portal Cleanview.

That surge is reshaping power flows in key electricity networks. Both California and Texas have added enough battery capacity to materially alter their power grid’s generation mix during peak demand.

The California Independent System Operator (CAISO), the state’s main grid and the country’s largest battery adopter, uses batteries to supply around 15% to 18% of electricity during the evening peak demand, according to Grid Status data, reducing the need for gas and other power sources.

In the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), a more recent adopter of battery systems, around 3% of electricity during peak demand was supplied from battery storage systems - a modest share but up from near zero just a year ago.

Solar power systems have also made their mark again in 2025, generating record shares of utility electricity supplies in several countries.

China and the U.S. typically dominate discussions about solar capacity, but solar’s widespread penetration in recent years now means that developed and emerging economies alike deploy the technology at scale.

At times in 2025, countries such as Bulgaria, Pakistan, Hungary and Poland sourced around 20% or more of their electricity from solar farms, cutting both costs and emissions.

In 2026, solar’s generation share will likely set new records in even more countries, helping to keep global energy transition momentum alive even if some major economies, such as the U.S., step back.

Greater Grace: (4) Level 2 Dual Port Chargers

Detroit-Based EV Charging Pilot Delivers BABA-Compliant Infrastructure Across Underserved Communities

DETROIT, MI, UNITED STATES, December 30, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Dunamis Charge today announced the successful completion of its Communities in Charge (CIC) pilot program, a groundbreaking initiative launched in 2024 in partnership with DTE Energy to expand equitable access to electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure across underserved communities in Southeast Michigan.

The program officially concluded in 2025 with the installation of 56 Level 2 dual-port EV chargers across 26 community locations, delivering a total of 102 charging ports at churches, nonprofits, and community organizations throughout Detroit and surrounding areas. All charging equipment deployed through the program is Buy America, Build America (BABA) compliant, reinforcing a commitment to domestic manufacturing and resilient infrastructure.

Closing the EV Access Gap

Communities in Charge was intentionally designed to address EV deserts—areas historically underserved by charging infrastructure—while prioritizing Black, Brown, low-income, and rural communities that often face barriers to EV adoption.

By placing chargers at trusted neighborhood institutions such as places of worship and nonprofit organizations, the program expands access while also building community trust, education, and awareness around electric mobility.

A Model Built for Impact and Sustainability

The Communities in Charge program was structured to create long-term value for community partners and support a sustainable clean energy ecosystem:

- DTE Energy funded the procurement and installation of all EV charging equipment

- Dunamis Charge, a Detroit-based manufacturer, supplied Level 2 dual-port charging stations

- Host sites cover electricity costs while retaining the ability to generate revenue from charging sessions

This approach empowers community organizations to become long-term charging hosts while creating a scalable pathway for local economic participation in the clean energy transition.

Program Achievements at a Glance

- 26 community locations activated

- 56 Level 2 dual-port chargers installed

- 102 total charging ports deployed

- 100% BABA-compliant equipment

- Expanded EV education, vendor experience, and workforce participation

Community Installations & On-the-Ground Impact

As part of the Communities in Charge program, EV charging stations were installed at trusted community anchors throughout Detroit and Southeast Michigan. These sites serve as access points for clean transportation and hubs for EV education and awareness.

A partial list of participating locations includes Focus: HOPE, The Yunion, Neighborhood Service Organization (NSO), Covenant House, Greater Grace Temple, Fellowship Chapel, Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church, Gethsemane Missionary Baptist Church, MiSide, and Gesu School.

By placing chargers at mission-driven organizations, Communities in Charge helps ensure EV infrastructure reaches residents where they live, work, worship, and receive essential services—directly addressing EV deserts and advancing inclusive mobility.

Leadership Perspective

“We are incredibly proud of the partnership with DTE Energy and deeply grateful for the vendors and community partners who helped make Communities in Charge such a success,” said Natalie King, CEO of Dunamis Charge. “This program proves that equitable infrastructure deployment is not only possible—it’s scalable. Our goal is to replicate this model across the nation so more communities can participate fully in the future of transportation.”

Vendor & Partner Appreciation

Dunamis Charge extends its sincere gratitude to the installation and service partners whose expertise and commitment were critical to the program’s success.

By partnering with local installation firms including Edgewood, Income Power, Walker-Miller, and Detroit Voltage, the program delivered high-quality installations while creating hands-on workforce experience, expanding EV infrastructure awareness, and directly supporting economic and workforce development among Metro Detroit–based suppliers.

Whether you want to spend less, declutter or eat right, here are a few choices that could make a difference for you and the climate. Bonus: They’re all low-effort and low-cost.

Saving money on bills

If you want to save money, start at home. Electronics and appliances can continue drawing power even when they’re turned off. You can cut phantom energy use by unplugging items you’re not using, such as chargers and entertainment systems or using a power strip with an on-off switch.

Adjusting your thermostat a few degrees when you’re not home can also reduce energy use and save money. The U.S. Department of Energy says that adjusting your thermostat by 7-10 degrees Fahrenheit (4-6 degrees Celsius) for eight hours a day can save up to 10% a year on heating and cooling.

Another simple tip: Washing your clothes on the cold setting and air-drying them when possible can help lower energy use and utility costs. Heating water is the biggest energy draw in laundry, and clothes dryers are among the most energy-intensive household appliances, said Matthew Gonzales, the vice chairman of the National Hispanic Energy Council, which advocates for affordable energy for communities of color. This can also reduce wear and tear on clothing.

Gonzales said other simple swaps include switching to LED bulbs, sealing drafty windows and replacing dirty air filters so heating and cooling systems run more efficiently. He also suggested using natural light during the day, opening or closing curtains and windows strategically to manage heat and turning off the lights when you don’t need them.

Savings vary widely depending on where someone lives, how old their home is and local energy prices. But he said households in high-cost states can see meaningful savings from small changes over time.

“Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good enough,” Gonzales said.

Eating healthier and wasting less

Cutting down food waste can also benefit your wallet, your diet and the environment.

Food waste costs U.S. consumers $728 every year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, and generates the annual planet-warming greenhouse gases equivalent to 42 coal-fired power plants.

One place to start is by using what you already have in your pantry before hitting the grocery store, said cookbook author Anne-Marie Bonneau.

“If you have fat and an onion and a couple of random vegetables — or even one random vegetable or some leftover cooked proteins or grains — you’ve got soup in the making,” Bonneau said. “If you’ve cleared out so much food that you don’t even have an onion and fat, it’s probably time to go shopping.”

She also recommends preserving food before it spoils, including fermenting vegetables, which, she says, is easier than it seems. For example, you can make sauerkraut with just cabbage, salt and a glass jar. You can also make sauces from seasonal vegetables like tomatoes and freeze them for use later in the year.

Using a multicooker to make things like apple sauce, yogurt, stews and beans can also help with meal prep while reducing energy use.

As a general rule, Bonneau added, eating fewer ultra-processed foods — such as sugary cereals, hot dogs, chicken nuggets and TV dinners — can benefit both your health and the environment. Those foods are often heavily packaged in plastic, which can shed into food and contribute to pollution.

“You’ll improve your diet, you’ll reduce your waste and your food will come in less contact with plastic,” she said.

Decluttering and buying less

Getting organized doesn’t have to mean buying storage bins or throwing things out. Often, it starts with using what you already have.

Spending even an hour organizing your space, spotting duplicates and rediscovering forgotten items can reduce impulse spending by helping people understand what they actually use, said Katrina Caspelich, communications director for Remake, an advocacy group for human rights and climate justice in fashion.

She said a “one-in, one-out” rule — where you can only buy a new thing if it replaces an old thing — can be effective because it keeps wardrobes from growing and helps prevent clutter by encouraging more intentional purchases.

Unsubscribing from brand emails and sale alerts can also help. “Most impulse purchases start with a notification, not a need,” Caspelich said, adding that waiting 24 hours before buying something new often turns a “must-have” into a pass.

For a more structured reset, you might try a no-buy challenge, pausing new purchases for 30 or 90 days while re-wearing, repairing, swapping with friends, or, if you can't commit to buying nothing, shopping secondhand instead of new. “The key is flexibility,” she said. “Framing it as an experiment rather than a strict rule makes it feel empowering instead of restrictive.”

Remake estimates that someone who takes part in a 90-day no new clothes challenge can save about 3,900 liters (1,030 gallons) of water, avoid roughly 300 kilograms (about 661 pounds) of carbon dioxide emissions, and keep around 9 kilograms (about 20 pounds) of clothing waste out of landfills while saving an average of nearly $300 by pausing new purchases.

Zoom out and the scale becomes clearer: Americans generated about 17 million tons of textile waste in 2018, most of it clothing, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

For anyone overwhelmed by the advice, the takeaway is simple: You don’t have to do everything, and you don’t have to do it perfectly. Starting with one habit you’ll actually keep can make a difference for your budget, your routine and the climate.

Selling Factories and ...,"Kim Jeong-hwan, Han Ji-yeon",,,,,https://www.mk.co.kr/en/business/11919552,"On the 11th, SK On announced its split from Ford Motor Company due to the industry downturn.
An industry executive explained, ""By separating production facilities from Ford Motor Company, SK On is now going it alone.
Ford Motor Company has licensed lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP battery) technology from CATL and is accelerating construction of a plant in Michigan, with plans to begin EV battery production next year.
The Ford Motor Company Kentucky plant, now separated from SK On, will also be converted into an ESS production facility using CATL technology.
According to SNE Research, CATL's global EV battery market share (excluding China) rose from 27.2% in January–October last year to 29.2% this year.","The domestic battery industry has been hit hard by the temporary stagnation in electric vehicle demand, facing a severe downturn. LG Energy Solution and cathode material supplier L&F Corp. recently lost contracts worth a total of 17.3 trillion won over the past two weeks, following sales setbacks at Ford Motor Company and Tesla, Inc.

Earlier, on the 15th, Ford Motor Company abruptly announced the suspension of production for its electric pickup truck, the F-150 Lightning, and halted development of its next-generation electric pickup (T3) and electric commercial van. General Motors (GM) and Volkswagen are also reconsidering their EV plans, fueling concerns that the market will inevitably contract.

The shock has also been significant for material suppliers like L&F Corp., which provides cathode materials for Tesla, Inc.'s Cybertruck batteries. While Tesla, Inc.'s Texas Gigafactory has the capacity to produce up to 250,000 Cybertrucks annually, actual sales have reportedly remained at around 20,000 units per year.

According to market research firms EV Sales and Eugene Investment & Securities Co., Ltd., US electric vehicle sales are expected to reach 1,598,000 units this year, up just 1.8% from last year. This figure is far behind China (14,125,000 units, 26.6% growth) and Europe (3,747,000 units, 27.2% growth).

The direct impact comes from the Donald Trump administration's reversal of green policies, ending EV tax credits last September. As a result, the decline in sales accelerated toward the end of the year. US EV sales, which had hovered around 140,000 units per month in August and September, plummeted to 69,000 in October and 65,000 in November after the tax incentives ended. Since the US is a major export destination for Korean battery firms and they have actively partnered with automakers like Ford Motor Company and Stellantis, the shock is particularly severe.

A senior executive at a battery company stated, ""Until EV demand fully recovers, we have no choice but to endure by securing revenue through other businesses such as Energy Storage Systems (ESS).""

With growing uncertainty in orders, some companies have begun tightening their belts by selling assets such as factories. On the 24th, LG Energy Solution announced it would sell its Ohio plant, jointly operated with Honda Motor, to Honda Motor's US subsidiary for 4.2 trillion won. This decision was made to use the funds for joint venture operations rather than tying up capital in a factory amid slowing US growth.

Major restructuring of business models has also become more frequent. On the 11th, SK On announced its split from Ford Motor Company due to the industry downturn. The two companies are now restructuring the operation of their US battery joint venture, BlueOval SK. Previously, SK On and Ford Motor Company each held a 50% stake in BlueOval SK, jointly operating plants in Tennessee and Kentucky. Going forward, SK On will own the Tennessee plant, while Ford Motor Company will take ownership of the Kentucky plant.

An industry executive explained, ""By separating production facilities from Ford Motor Company, SK On is now going it alone. While this may improve operational efficiency, it will inevitably reduce the stable battery demand that joint ventures previously ensured.""

The problem is that while Korea hesitates, China is quickly filling the gap with its price competitiveness. Ford Motor Company, which has parted ways with SK On, is a prime example, expanding its facilities using technology from CATL, the world’s top battery manufacturer. Ford Motor Company has licensed lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP battery) technology from CATL and is accelerating construction of a plant in Michigan, with plans to begin EV battery production next year. The Ford Motor Company Kentucky plant, now separated from SK On, will also be converted into an ESS production facility using CATL technology.

Other products face similar challenges. According to SNE Research, CATL's global EV battery market share (excluding China) rose from 27.2% in January–October last year to 29.2% this year. BYD's share also jumped from 4.1% to 7.6%.

In contrast, the three major Korean companies—LG Energy Solution (from 24.2% to 21%), SK On (from 10.7% to 9.9%), and Samsung SDI (from 9% to 6.6%)—all saw their shares decline, widening the gap.

Korean battery companies are seeking new opportunities by expanding into the more promising ESS sector. In June, LG Energy Solution became the first to launch mass production of LFP batteries for ESS at its Michigan plant. Domestically, it will begin producing 1GWh annually at the Ochang Industrial Complex starting in 2027.

SK On has completed mass production validation of LFP batteries for ESS at its Seosan plant in South Chungcheong Province and will begin mass production next year after converting part of its Georgia plant’s production lines to LFP batteries. Samsung SDI is also rapidly converting production lines at its Indiana joint venture plant with Stellantis for ESS use.

According to SK Securities, the global EV battery market is expected to grow by 89% from 1,075GWh this year to 2,026GWh in 2030, while the ESS battery market is projected to expand even faster, rising 159% from 288GWh to 745GWh over the same period. An industry executive noted, ""As AI data centers expand in Korea and the US, demand for ESS will surge rapidly. The strategy is to minimize the impact of the demand stagnation through the ESS business.""

Additionally, by accelerating the commercialization of advanced solid-state batteries (SSB), which have a lower risk of fire, Korean firms aim to overcome the demand stagnation by targeting high-quality markets that are difficult for Chinese competitors to enter, such as luxury vehicles. In fact, LG Energy Solution recently secured an alternative revenue source by signing a 2.06 trillion won battery supply contract with Mercedes-Benz this month, even as US contracts were canceled.

Each school year, every grade from kindergarten through 12th participates in our 13 Summits Program, an annual hike of a local or regional peak that connects students to the natural environment and to one another.

Over their years at Summit, students progress from gentle introductory trails for younger grades, such as Sunset Rock and Whiteside Mountain, to more challenging peaks like Yellow Mountain, Looking Glass, Black Balsam, and The Pinnacle. Even with varied ages and abilities, each class approaches its summit with the same goals: to learn, to explore, and to engage with the world beyond the classroom walls.

As a key part of our place-based education model, these excursions utilize our natural Blue Ridge surroundings as an extension of the classroom.

Students learn about local ecology, geography, environmental stewardship, and trail safety as they prepare for and complete their grade-level summit. At the top, they take time to journal about what they observed and reflect on their current place in what could become their full 13-year Summit journey.

The 13 Summits Program also reinforces core aspects of Summit’s culture, especially the Seven Virtues that guide our school community: Honesty, Respect, Responsibility, Compassion, Self-Discipline, Perseverance, and Giving. On their hikes, students practice communication and collaboration, contributing to a supportive school community by strengthening relationships across grade levels, faculty, and family volunteers.

ATLANTA, Dec. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- For more than 50 years, nuclear energy has played a critical role in Georgia's energy mix – currently providing approximately 25% of the state's electricity each year from just two nuclear plants: Plant Hatch near Vidalia and Plant Vogtle near Augusta. The plants sit at the center of the state's energy mix, operating efficiently and reliably for customers around the clock with an average capacity factor – the time at which they operate at full power – of 94% over the last decade. More than 1.2 billion megawatt hours of net generation have been produced by Georgia nuclear units since 1975 – enough total electricity to power the entire United States for more than 100 consecutive days.

Georgia Power and the plants' other co-owners – Oglethorpe Power Corporation, the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia and Dalton Utilities – are celebrating historic milestones this year for the state's nuclear fleet. Georgia's first nuclear power facility – Plant Hatch Unit 1 – entered commercial operation in December 1975 and marks 50 years of continuous operation this year. Additionally, the historic expansion of Plant Vogtle 3 & 4 marked the one-year anniversary of completion this past spring.

""Nuclear energy serves as the bedrock of our diverse generation fleet, ready and available when we need it, with a stable, predictable cost to operate and no air emissions,"" said Kim Greene, chairman, president and CEO of Georgia Power. ""We're grateful that, well over 50 years ago, state leaders at that time recognized the value of this energy source and took steps to make sure that a growing Georgia had the energy it needed. Customers today directly benefit from that foresight. Now, as our state continues to be the economic powerhouse of the Southeast, work continues with the Georgia Public Service Commission and many other stakeholders to build on that legacy as we maintain, evolve and expand our diverse generation mix to serve customers today, and 50 years from today.""

That includes ongoing investments to modernize and maximize the company's already high performing units, including the potential to extend operating licenses and extract additional megawatts. Southern Nuclear, which operates Plants Hatch and Vogtle on behalf of Georgia Power and the co-owners, is an industry leader in safety, innovation and performance. The company is known for innovation in nuclear energy at Georgia power plants, having consistently been awarded the most prestigious awards for developing industry-changing advancements, from digital modernization and AI application to being the first in the world to install enhanced Accident Tolerant Fuel (ATF) technologies at Plant Hatch in 2018 and the historic installation of higher-uranium-enriched fuel earlier this year at Vogtle Units 1 & 2, a significant achievement that will positively transform the fuel cycle for all existing and future nuclear reactor designs.

""Our workforce comes from a wide variety of backgrounds, including the nuclear Navy, with each individual dedicated to safely and efficiently operating these nuclear units to serve electric customers across Georgia,"" said Pete Sena, chairman, president and CEO of Southern Nuclear. ""The nuclear industry represents the best of American energy production, and I couldn't be more proud to lead this team of highly skilled professionals across Southern Nuclear who work together to drive innovation and performance at our current plants, but also as we work together to grow the future of clean energy in this country.""

Southern Nuclear currently employs more than 2,600 people across Plants Hatch and Vogtle. Over the decades, the nuclear plants have provided high-quality, full-time jobs for an estimated 18,000 people.

Beyond providing jobs for thousands of people, Plants Hatch and Vogtle support vibrant and healthy local communities. Combined, the plants contribute more than $85 million in property taxes each year, which goes to support local schools, roads and other infrastructure. Plant teams also share a commitment to citizenship and community service with the plants supporting a variety of local charities and causes including STEM education efforts, the work of the United Way, multiple veterans groups and environmental/sustainability efforts.

A Bright Future for Georgia's First Nuclear Facility

In 1975, the year Hatch Unit 1 entered service, Georgia's population was around 5 million people and, 50 years later, that number has more than doubled with more than 11 million people now calling Georgia home. Plant Hatch has helped meet the electrical needs of that growth year after year, with its opening also marking a pivotal moment for Georgia Power's commitment to developing a diverse, cleaner generation mix to serve customers. At the end of the 1960s, prior to the introduction of emission-free nuclear energy to Georgia Power's generation mix, approximately 85 percent of the company's electricity came from fossil-fuel sources including coal.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) granted Hatch Unit 1 an initial license to operate in 1974, with Unit 2 following in 1975. In 2002, Plant Hatch's operating license was extended by the NRC for an additional 20 years. In 2023, Southern Nuclear began the process of seeking the NRC's approval for subsequent license renewal of Hatch Units 1 and 2, with the formal application filed with the NRC in May 2025 (read more). This renewal would extend the operating license of both units for an additional 20 years and allow the site to continue providing the state of Georgia with clean and reliable electricity around the clock.

The Largest Generator of Clean Energy in the U.S.

Named after World War II hero, and subsequent Southern Company CEO, Alvin Vogtle, Plant Vogtle's original Units 1 & 2 opened as Georgia's second nuclear facility in the late 1980s. With all four units now in operation, Plant Vogtle is the largest generator of clean energy in the nation, expected to produce more than 30 million megawatt hours of electricity each year. The Vogtle 3 & 4 nuclear expansion was the first newly constructed nuclear facility in more than 30 years, and was completed in May 2024 with the commercial operation of Unit 4.

Since entering commercial operation, the new Vogtle units have performed safely and reliably at or above industry average. In September, Unit 4 successfully completed its first refueling outage and, through strategic fuel planning, Southern Nuclear was able to delay Unit 4's first planned refueling outage until the fall, allowing it to operate during the hottest months of the year when customers needed reliable power the most.

Planning approvals for offshore wind developments jumped more than sevenfold to 9.9GW from 1.3GW last year.
Planning approvals for battery, wind and solar power have risen by more than 400% over the past five years.
The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, said: “After years of delay and underinvestment, this government is keeping its promise to take back control of Britain’s energy with clean homegrown power.
“But approvals don’t generate electricity, and we urgently need to move from ambition to actual delivery of these projects.","A record number of renewable energy projects were given the go-ahead in Great Britain in 2025, after planning approvals almost doubled year on year, according to an analysis.

The energy capacity of new battery, wind, and solar projects that received approval climbed to 45GW this year, 96% higher than in 2024, according to data from Cornwall Insight.

The boom was driven by applications to build new battery storage, which almost doubled to 28.6GW this year from 14.9GW in 2024. Planning approvals for offshore wind developments jumped more than sevenfold to 9.9GW from 1.3GW last year.

Planning approvals for battery, wind and solar power have risen by more than 400% over the past five years.

The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, said: “After years of delay and underinvestment, this government is keeping its promise to take back control of Britain’s energy with clean homegrown power.

“Every project we approve, every investment we make is about getting the country off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel markets, protecting households and lowering bills for good.”

The record-breaking surge in planning approvals signals real momentum in the UK’s energy transition, according to Robin Clarke, a senior analyst at Cornwall Insight, but many could still face delays starting up.

“On paper, the UK’s renewables pipeline has never looked stronger,” he said. “But approvals don’t generate electricity, and we urgently need to move from ambition to actual delivery of these projects. Too much capacity is still stuck in queues or waiting on grid upgrades. Grid bottlenecks remain one of the biggest risks to turning today’s approvals into tomorrow’s power.”

Although approvals have accelerated, the pace of projects starting up has lagged behind, largely as a result of long construction timelines and grid connection delays, according to Cornwall.

Many projects have been stuck in a “first come, first served” connections queue, but recent reforms to remove “zombie projects” from the queue and shift to a “first ready, first needed, first connected” approach is expected to clear some of the bottlenecks and quicken the pace of Britain’s renewable energy buildout.

Britain’s energy system operator pulled the plug on hundreds of electricity generation projects earlier this month to clear a huge backlog that had stopped many “shovel-ready” schemes from connecting to the power grid.

More than half of the energy projects in the queue will be removed to make way for about £40bn-worth of schemes considered the most likely to help meet the government’s goal to build a virtually zero-carbon power system by 2030.

Britain’s growing renewables industry may also have accelerated in 2025 as developers rush to get their projects over the line before tougher rules over which projects can connect to the grid, and upcoming local elections that could create uncertainty over future renewable energy planning policies.

Clarke said: “The recent grid connection reforms are a significant step forward, and should help clear some of the backlog, but they won’t solve everything. We need faster decisions, more investment in the grid, and real collaboration between government, regulators and industry. Without that, these record numbers risk becoming just another statistic.”

Cornwall added that the rapid expansion of renewable projects would also mean the UK must reinforce and build out its electricity grid at scale.

“The current infrastructure was never designed for such high volumes of intermittent generation and storage, so investment in grid flexibility, transmission upgrades, and smart technologies will be critical to ensure these projects can deliver power where and when it’s needed,” it said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/592c61a067c35a9322076bbbce02d6d7308262c9/216_0_4840_3872/master/4840.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d2a79557e4dec05066db310c998f6567",N,,2025-12-30 11:01:31.017439

It seems that every day there is a new headline that is just as dramatic and important as the last. With the constant buzz of news, it’s easy to forget how much the Trump administration has shaped climate policy in the U.S. and around the world. From leaving the Paris Climate Agreement on day one to the administration’s most recent dismantling of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, climate science and the environment have taken a hit under Donald Trump’s presidency.

January: Trump’s First Executive Orders

Trump’s second first day as president of the United States was January 20, 2025. Promising to sign 100 executive orders on his first day, he ultimately signed 26. In those 26 executive orders, Trump began his environmental damage.

An executive order (EO) is a statement by the president that instructs federal agencies on how to implement and enforce laws. While they are not laws themselves, they indicate to Congress which laws to prioritize. Many presidents use executive orders to rescind orders issued by previous presidents.

President Trump reversed many of former President Joe Biden’s climate-focused orders, including the creation of clean energy task forces and the Climate Change Support Office, the “30 by 30” conservation initiative, and federal efforts to improve sustainable, climate-resilient infrastructure in the U.S. In an order titled “Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements,” Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Agreement and revoked the International Climate Finance Plan.

He also signed orders expanding fossil fuel use and exploration, “Unleashing American Energy” and “Unleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Potential,” as well as an order “Declaring a National Energy Emergency,” which states that inadequate energy production in the U.S. is an “unusual and extraordinary threat.” He notably excludes wind and solar power from the order’s definition of “energy,” highlighting the construction of pipelines and the leasing of land for oil and gas production.

In the first two weeks of his presidency, the Trump administration scrubbed thousands of data pages from government websites, many of which related to climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) website lost all references to climate change on its homepage.

February: Paper Straws, Layoffs, and the National Energy Dominance Council

Trump began February in a battle with paper straws. On February 10, he signed an EO stating that the government will exclusively use plastic straws. He banned the use of paper straws in federal buildings, saying that they “don’t work.”

On February 14, Trump signed an order establishing the National Energy Dominance Council to enhance energy security. The council aims to expand the production and use of oil, gas, coal, and other critical resources, excluding wind and solar.

Throughout the month, the EPA dismissed over 400 employees and froze funds for federally approved projects. Democratic Senator Ed Markey from Massachusetts said:

“Thousands of EPA projects worth tens of billions of dollars have been illegally shut down, shut off, and shut out of funding in red and blue states alike.”

Government websites continued to scrub mentions of climate change. On February 19, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) sent a memo titled “Recovery Guidance for Terminology Changes.” The memo included 10 instances of “climate change terminology to remove,” including “global warming,” “net-zero,” and “changing climate.”

March: The Trump Administration Cuts Emissions Regulations

March was a difficult month for climate regulations in the United States. Chris Wright, Trump’s energy secretary, kicked off the month by saying that climate change is “a side-effect of building the modern world” and encouraging the world to use more fossil fuels.

Trump concluded the month by stating that automobile emissions do not affect the environment. When Trump announced tentative plans to relax pollution limits on vehicles, he claimed that it wouldn’t “mean a damn bit of difference to the environment.” With these sentiments as bookends to the month, it makes sense that regulations took a hit.

The EPA Administrator, Lee Zeldin, announced 31 deregulation actions on March 12. Among these actions, the EPA halted enforcement of pollution regulations at energy facilities, including the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. They also attacked the Biden-Harris Administration Risk Management Program, which required facilities to develop risk management plans for handling hazardous chemicals.

On March 27, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) voted to end rules requiring companies to disclose greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks. “The goal of today’s Commission action and notification to the court is to cease the Commission’s involvement in the defense of the costly and unnecessarily intrusive climate change disclosure rules,” said Acting SEC Chairman Mark T. Uyeda.

In late March, Trump signed an executive order titled “Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production.” The order opened up crucial habitats and conservation areas for logging. He also called for expansion in mining, signing “Immediate Measures To Increase American Mineral Production.”

April: Trump’s 100 Days and 145 Actions

April 29 marked Trump’s 100th day in office and 145 climate rollbacks. In his first few months as president, Trump launched more actions against the environment than he did during his entire first term.

Earlier in the month, he signed an executive order to revive the American coal industry. The order highlighted Trump’s desire for strong energy security and AI competitiveness. He also lifted air pollution restrictions on coal plants, hoping to avoid closures and increase production and use.

Trump went on to attack state climate laws. He signed an executive order titled “Protecting American Energy From State Overreach,” which claimed that specific state laws undermined federal efforts for energy dominance.

Then on April 9, the administration canceled funding for the U.S. Global Change Research Program. The program is key to publishing the National Climate Assessment, a comprehensive guide to climate change.

May: An End to Climate Justice

May began with the Trump administration cutting the EPA’s Energy Star program, which highlighted the energy efficiency of home appliances.

Additionally, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) ceased updates to its billion-dollar disaster tracker. The administration claimed that the tracker caused climate anxiety as the dramatic increase in disasters highlighted human-caused climate change.

On May 26, the Trump administration announced cuts to a Biden-era guidance on greenhouse gases. The guidance required new energy projects to consider environmental justice and climate policies.

June: “Drill, Baby, Drill”

The Department of the Interior encouraged more mining throughout the United States by rolling back mining standards. Following the day-one executive order to unleash Alaska’s energy potential, the Trump administration began moving forward with opening Alaska to mining.

On June 11, the government signed an agreement with JERA Co., Inc., a Japanese energy company, to sell liquified natural gas (LNG). The U.S. promised to supply JERA with 5.5 million tons of LNG annually.

July: Climate Science Denied

The U.S. Department of Energy released a 140-page report denying climate science on July 29. Fact-checkers found that the report contained more than 100 false or misleading claims, prompting more than 85 scientists to issue a rebuttal.

Earlier in the month, Trump signed an EO claiming that “green” energy hinders national security and compromises the grid. In the order, he encouraged federal agencies to phase out subsidies for wind, solar, and other forms of renewable energy.

August: Wind and Solar Tax Credits Eliminated

The Department of the Interior made moves to limit wind and solar projects. U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said:

“Gargantuan, unreliable, intermittent energy projects hold America back from achieving U.S. Energy Dominance.”

The EPA cancelled the Biden-era “Solar for All” program, which aimed to provide low-income families with access to solar energy. The $7 billion grant was intended to provide low-cost, clean energy to over 900,000 households.

Early in the month, the administration also asked NASA to decommission two climate satellites that provide information about carbon dioxide. Farmers rely heavily on these satellites, which also provide data on crop health.

In an ongoing effort to remove information from public view, the EPA ceased updating its “Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emissions Factors” database.

September: Trump Calls Climate Change a “Con Job”

Trump spoke at the United Nations on September 23, calling climate change a hoax. He said that climate change was the “greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world” and admonished countries that had adopted renewable energy sources.

At the Energy Department’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, “climate change,” “green,” and “decarbonization” were added to a list of words to avoid. The list already included words such as “sustainability,” “carbon footprint,” and “tax breaks/subsidies.” The list is a growing part of Trump’s efforts to downplay and ignore the realities of climate change.

October: Government Shut Down, Pollutants Scale Up

While the government was shut down in October, work continued in the fossil fuel sector. The Department of the Interior opened over 250,000 acres of land in Nebraska and Wyoming to oil drilling, and the Bureau of Land Management approved a copper mine expansion in Utah.

Trump removed another Biden-era air pollution rule that imposed stricter rules on pollution from copper smelters, curbing pollutants such as mercury, lead, and arsenic. Trump rolled back this rule in an effort to increase copper production and promote American mineral security.

November: No to COP30, Yes to Forever Chemicals

The U.S. government notably refused to attend COP30 in Brazil this year. The absence of any high-ranking officials caused climate negotiations to stall and climate finance plans to fall short

Meanwhile, the EPA released a proposal concerning perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The proposal aimed to roll back Biden’s reporting requirements. The EPA administrator, Zeldin, claimed that removing these “regulatory burdens” would boost the economy.

December: Trump Suspends Wind Energy Projects

The Trump administration suspended five offshore wind projects on the East Coast, claiming national security risks. The move comes after a Massachusetts judge blocked Trump’s executive order restricting wind energy. Judge Patti Saris said that halting wind farms violates U.S. law.

In addition, the administration defunded the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. NCAR is a critical climate science research center that develops and maintains research tools used by scientists worldwide.

In December, President Trump also announced a rollback of fuel efficiency requirements under his “Freedom Means Affordable Cars” initiative. Experts claim that the idea that these rollbacks will save consumers money is “highly speculative.”

The Good News

There are some silver linings among the climate chaos brought on by the current administration. The New York Times wrote in October that renewable energy was “booming” despite the administration’s efforts to slow renewables.

On May 30, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) announced the Permitting Technology Action Plan. The plan should speed up and modernize environmental reviews and the permitting processes for new projects in the U.S., increasing transparency and reducing delays.

After the Energy Department terminated $7.6 million in clean energy grants, an internal watchdog began investigating the move. Many Democrats welcome this investigation, as many have claimed that funding cuts will increase electricity bills, threaten thousands of jobs, and hinder progress.

Individual states have increased clean energy efforts. Maine established the Department of Energy Resources, Oregon launched a heat pump rebate program, and Nevada is expanding solar access. New York Governor Kathy Hochul

Whether the PACK Act succeeds or fails, it represents a significant acknowledgment that the current system isn’t working.","If you’ve ever stood at your recycling bin wondering whether a package’s chasing arrows symbol means you can actually recycle it, you’re not alone. A new bill in Congress, the PACK Act, aims to change that.

On December 18, U.S. Representative Randy Weber (R-Texas) introduced the Packaging and Claims Knowledge Act (PACK Act), a bill that would establish the first federal framework for recyclable, compostable, and reusable claims on consumer packaging. The bill faces a long road in Congress, but it represents a potential bipartisan path to a more mature recycling system.

According to a McKinsey & Company survey, two-thirds of consumers are not confident they know which products are recyclable. Nearly half of Americans incorrectly believe plastic bags can go in curbside recycling bins, according to research by The Recycling Partnership.

A Patchwork of Confusion

The current landscape of packaging labels in the United States is a regulatory maze. The Federal Trade Commission’s Green Guides, last updated in 2012, provide guidance on environmental marketing claims but lack the force of law. But the FTC cannot preempt state regulations, which has created what packaging industry groups call a “patchwork” of conflicting requirements that creates compliance headaches for businesses and confusion for consumers.

“Retailers, consumer packaged goods companies, and their suppliers are facing a patchwork of state laws related to making recyclable, compostable, and reusable claims on packaging,” explains Ameripen, the packaging industry trade group that has championed the PACK Act.

“This is leading to interstate commerce issues for businesses and causing consumer confusion on how to dispose of packaging.”

California’s SB 343, set to take effect in October 2026, is among the most stringent state-level approaches. Under this “Truth in Labeling” law, packaging cannot display the familiar chasing arrows or other recyclability claims unless the material meets two 60% thresholds: it must be collected by curbside recycling programs serving at least 60% of California’s population, AND be sorted into defined streams by facilities serving at least 60% of the state’s recycling programs. The intent is to ensure industry takes action to follow through on recyclability claims.

What the PACK Act Would Do

The PACK Act takes a different approach, establishing a voluntary federal standard that would preempt state laws. According to Waste Dive, the bill would amend the Federal Trade Commission Act to establish parameters for recyclable, compostable, and reusable claims, including mandatory third-party certifications.

“Americans want to do the right thing, but misleading labels make that harder,” Rep. Weber said in a statement. “The PACK Act cuts through that confusion. It’s pro-environment, pro-business, and rooted in common sense, all while holding companies accountable and giving consumers clear, honest information they can trust.”

Key provisions of the PACK Act include:

Third-party certification requirements: All recyclable, compostable, and reusable claims on consumer packaging must be backed by accredited third-party certification bodies. This allows independent parties to verify that packaging meets industry standards and follows FTC guidance. It’s worth noting that How2Recycle, the widely-used on-pack labeling system, is not a third-party certification scheme—it’s a membership-based program that helps brands communicate disposal instructions. Under the PACK Act, actual certification would come from bodies like the Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI), which certifies compostability, or similar accredited organizations.

Prohibition on misleading symbols: Packaging that doesn’t meet the stated parameters would be prohibited from bearing resin identification codes surrounded by chasing arrows, intended to reduce consumer confusion caused by the recycling symbol appearing on items that aren’t actually recyclable in most communities.

One national standard: States would be prohibited from enacting or enforcing any legal requirement that is not identical to federal requirements, creating one national standard rather than 50 different state approaches.

FTC oversight with EPA input: The bill continues to vest the FTC with primary authority but calls on the agency to work with the Environmental Protection Agency and establish an advisory council of experts. Both agencies are under attack by the Trump Administration, which has cut their budgets and argued for reducing or eliminating their authority.

Industry Supports The PACK Act

The PACK Act has significant industry support. A coalition of packaging companies, consumer goods manufacturers, and trade associations backs the legislation, including Amcor, Anchor Packaging, Dart, Kraft Heinz, General Mills, Nestlé USA, and dozens of trade groups ranging from the Plastics Industry Association to the Biodegradable Products Institute and the Can Manufacturers Institute.

“This new framework will address concerns with the patchwork of state regulations and its negative effect on interstate commerce and consumer awareness regarding management of consumer packaging,” said Ameripen Executive Director Lynn Dyer in Weber’s press release.

Peter DePasquale, Vice President of Government Affairs at Keurig Dr Pepper, called the bill “a welcome step” toward establishing “a single, national framework for packaging claims.” He added that “by setting clear, national standards and certifications through credible third parties, this legislation helps ensure consumers receive accurate information while giving companies the consistency they need to innovate and accelerate investment in sustainable packaging solutions nationwide.”

“We believe that a federal law for the labeling of packaging for compostability, recyclability, and reusability that supports existing national labeling programs makes far greater sense than a state-by-state approach of passing related laws and will lead to more—not less—consumers properly handling flexible packaging at its end of life,” Flexible Packaging Association CEO Dan Felton said in a statement to Waste Dive.

Voluntary vs. Mandatory

A notable feature of the PACK Act is its voluntary nature. According to The Daily News of Galveston, Weber explained that “the industry came to us looking for a federal standard, and by making it voluntary we are allowing companies to choose to follow the guidelines to build consumer confidence.”

“Our hope is that when companies see consumers buying products with the PACK Act approval, they will want to join,” Weber said, suggesting that market pressure rather than mandates would drive adoption.

This approach differs significantly from California’s SB 343, which carries potential criminal penalties for non-compliance. Environmental advocates may question whether a voluntary framework will achieve the same level of accountability as mandatory state laws. This leaves consumers, not government, as the ultimate influence on brand decisions.

What This Means for Recycling’s Future

The PACK Act arrives at a pivotal moment for U.S. recycling policy. While no federal recycling legislation has been signed into law in 2025, multiple state bills have advanced, along with growing Congressional bipartisan support for several national changes, including the Steward Act, the Reuse Act, and the Circle Act, which would establish a 30% investment tax credit for recycling infrastructure.

Meanwhile, the FTC Green Guides have remained unchanged since 2012, despite the agency seeking public comment on potential updates in 2022. The effort “has been quiet under the Trump administration,” according to Packaging Dive.

The PACK Act may signal broader federal packaging rules on the horizon. Rob Waterfield, Ameripen’s policy director, told Packaging Dive that “if we could potentially see Congress enact the PACK Act in the next year, it could be a very good bellwether on what the appetite is” for federal extended producer responsibility frameworks.

View From The Curb

For American consumers trying to make environmentally conscious choices, the PACK Act stakes could change recycling dramatically.

The U.S. recycling system is at a turning point, one that could reduce confusion or compound it as the circular economy in packaging develops. The current single-stream system, which has been the subject of criticism for more than a decade, has not produced the clean, well-separated materials streams necessary to enable advanced manufacturing processes that reuse materials efficiently. Contamination rates, which foul recycling loads, remain stubbornly high, according to a 2025 report by the Solid Waste Association of North America (SWANA).

A 2025 National Academies of Sciences report on recycling notes that “inconsistent and misleading packaging labels, including the use of the chasing arrows symbol and resin identification codes, are significant causes of consumer uncertainty.”

According to The Recycling Partnership, only 60% of people know that food does not belong in recycling bins. This confusion has real consequences: contamination from improperly sorted materials can render entire batches of recyclables worthless, undermining the circular economy that sustainable packaging advocates envision.

The PACK Act’s proponents argue that clear, nationally consistent labeling backed by third-party verification could help restore consumer confidence in recycling programs and reduce contamination rates.

Rough Road Ahead?

The PACK Act now faces the deeply divided legislative decision-making process that is the House of Representatives. The bill’s bipartisan framing and broad industry support may give it a better chance than previous packaging-related legislation. However, environmental groups and state regulators who have invested in developing robust labeling standards may push back against federal preemption of state laws.

For consumers, the key takeaway is that a change to packaging labels may be coming, but it won’t happen overnight. In the meantime, the best approach remains to check with your local recycling program to understand what materials they actually accept, regardless of the symbols on packaging.

Whether the PACK Act succeeds or fails, it represents a significant acknowledgment that the current system isn’t working. The question now is whether federal action can succeed where state-by-state approaches have created confusion, and whether a voluntary framework can achieve the accountability that consumers and the environment need.",https://earth911.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AdobeStock_1734958278-cropped.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 11:01:50.514539

General Motors stock is ending the year looking more like a disciplined value play than a go?for?growth EV moonshot. After a choppy ride driven by union strikes, an EV strategy rethink and a cyclical auto slowdown, the shares have climbed meaningfully over the past twelve months, even if the latest trading sessions show a market taking a breather.

As of the latest market data (intraday, cross?checked via multiple financial platforms including Reuters and Yahoo Finance), General Motors trades in the mid?$40s per share, with the last close also sitting in that range. Over the past five sessions, the stock has largely moved sideways after a strong autumn run?up, suggesting consolidation rather than capitulation. The 90?day chart still tilts decisively higher, with the stock up solidly double?digits over that period, while the 52?week range runs from the low $20s at the trough to the mid?$40s at the recent peak.

That range tells the story: investors who stepped in when Detroit fell out of fashion have been well rewarded, while newcomers are now debating whether GM is late?cycle expensive or still structurally undervalued. The tone of trading and fresh analyst commentary points to a cautiously bullish sentiment: not the euphoric optimism of the EV boom, but a grind?higher narrative driven by capital discipline, buybacks, and surprisingly resilient U.S. consumers.

One-Year Investment Performance

Roll the tape back twelve months and General Motors was trading roughly in the high?$20s per share at the prior year’s close, weighed down by strike concerns, an uncertain EV roadmap and macro gloom. Using the last closing price in the mid?$40s, that translates into an approximate gain of about 55–65% over the past year, depending on the exact entry point within that earlier range.

For investors who were willing to buy into peak pessimism, that outcome is nothing short of dramatic: every $10,000 wagered on GM stock a year ago is now worth around $15,500 to $16,500, excluding dividends. In an equity market where richly valued tech names have hogged the limelight, this kind of old?economy rerating stands out. The move has pushed GM’s market capitalization substantially higher, yet the valuation on a forward earnings basis still screens like a cyclical industrial rather than a frothy growth story.

Emotionally, this is the kind of performance that tests investor discipline. Those who exited amid last year’s headlines about stalled EV adoption and labor strife are watching from the sidelines as the company repurchases shares and reinstates a narrative of controlled, profitable growth. Those still in the stock must decide whether to lock in outsized gains or double down on a thesis that GM’s transformation is only in its middle innings.

Recent Catalysts and News

Earlier this week and in recent sessions, headlines around General Motors have focused less on splashy product launches and more on balance sheet strategy and operational execution. Management has continued to emphasize capital returns: increased share buybacks, a re?rated dividend and a tighter focus on profitable vehicles over sheer EV volume. This pivot, increasingly visible in the latest commentary and filings, has resonated with investors who are weary of cash?burning electric ventures across the industry.

Over the past several days, financial outlets such as Bloomberg, Reuters and major business portals have homed in on a few key themes. First, GM’s EV ambitions are being reframed around profitability and selective scaling rather than an all?in race with pure?play EV competitors. That includes a more measured roll?out on its Ultium platform and a renewed focus on trucks, SUVs and crossovers that still print cash in North America. Second, the company’s software and subscription revenue narrative – from connected car services to hands?free driving features like Super Cruise – remains a slow?building but important pillar in analyst models. Finally, the macro backdrop has been kinder than once feared: while higher interest rates have pressured auto financing, the feared collapse in U.S. auto demand has so far not materialized, allowing GM to maintain relatively strong pricing and mix.

Within the last week, there has also been stepped?up coverage of GM’s cost discipline and manufacturing footprint optimization. After last year’s labor turbulence, the company is now signaling stability on the labor front, while seeking efficiency gains through automation and supply?chain normalization. This story may lack the glamour of a shiny new EV reveal, but it is precisely the sort of blocking and tackling that supports sustained margins, which in turn underpins the stock’s rerating.

Wall Street Verdict & Price Targets

Across Wall Street, the tone on General Motors has brightened noticeably in recent weeks. Fresh research notes from major firms released over the past month consistently tilt toward positive. The consensus rating from large brokerages sits firmly in the ""Buy"" or ""Outperform"" camp, with only a minority of houses advocating a neutral ""Hold"" stance and very few outright ""Sell"" calls.

Price targets from top?tier institutions cluster above the current trading range. Several bulge?bracket banks have set 12?month targets in the high?$40s to low?$50s per share, implying modest but still meaningful upside from the latest quote. A handful of more bullish analysts, factoring in aggressive buybacks, a stable macro backdrop and upside from software and services, have floated targets stretching into the mid?$50s. On average, consensus numbers suggest a high single?digit to low double?digit percentage upside from here.

The justification is threefold. First, GM trades at a discount to the broader market on a price?to?earnings basis despite a balance sheet that has been steadily fortified and an earnings profile that, while cyclical, looks less fragile than during previous downturns. Second, analysts are increasingly crediting management for dialing back uneconomic EV spending and focusing on returns on invested capital rather than headline EV delivery numbers. Third, the capital return story – large, ongoing buybacks and a recurring dividend – is reshaping the shareholder base toward long?term, income?oriented and value?driven investors rather than momentum chasers.

There are caveats embedded in these reports. Many analysts underline that auto demand is inherently cyclical and vulnerable to any recessionary shock. They also flag intense competition in EVs, regulatory uncertainty on emissions standards, and potential geopolitical disruptions in supply chains. But taken together, the latest 30?day wave of analyst commentary suggests that, for now, the Street believes GM is better positioned than it has been in years.

Future Prospects and Strategy

Looking ahead, General Motors stands at a crossroads that is less about survival in the EV age and more about strategic calibration. Instead of chasing volume at any cost, the company is leaning into what it does best: building profitable trucks and SUVs, leveraging its scale in North America, and gradually layering on EVs and software in a way that protects margins. This pragmatism may not win every environmental or tech?centric headline, but it is exactly what many investors have been demanding after the sector’s speculative excesses.

One critical plank of GM’s future is the evolution of its EV lineup on the Ultium platform. Management wants to convince investors that it can convert its entrenched dealer and service networks into a long?term edge, selling a mix of combustion, hybrid and full?battery vehicles tailored to regional demand. If the company can avoid the deep discounting and inventory buildups that have plagued parts of the EV market, the earnings power embedded in this hybrid strategy could surprise to the upside.

Equally important is the software and services layer. Automakers worldwide are trying to emulate the recurring revenue models of Big Tech, and GM is no exception. Features such as connected safety services, in?car entertainment, and advanced driver assistance – monetized through subscriptions – are already showing up in forecasts as a growing, higher?margin revenue stream. The pace at which consumers adopt and stick with those services will be a key swing factor for the stock’s long?term multiple.

Then there is the capital allocation story. GM’s board and management have signaled that shareholders, not sprawling side bets, will be the primary beneficiaries of free cash flow. With substantial share repurchases underway and a commitment to a sustainable dividend, the company is effectively underwriting a ""share count shrink"" thesis: even if revenue growth remains modest, per?share metrics can climb as the pie is divided among fewer owners. In an era of higher interest rates, this kind of disciplined, cash?yield narrative has strong appeal.

Risks remain. A sharper?than?expected economic slowdown could erode demand for big?ticket vehicles; regulatory changes could force faster, more costly electrification; supply?chain shocks could re?ignite cost inflation; and technological competition, particularly from nimble EV manufacturers and Chinese automakers, will not abate. But for now, the market seems to believe that General Motors has moved from playing defense to playing a measured, capital?efficient offense.

For investors watching from the sidelines, the question becomes simple yet difficult: is the recent rally a late?cycle flourish, or the re?rating phase of a legacy manufacturer successfully reinventing itself for a more disciplined, less speculative automotive era? The next year of execution – on EV profitability, software adoption and sustained capital returns – will likely determine whether General Motors stock remains merely a solid value play or graduates to a durable, growth?and?income compounder in global portfolios.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405007_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 11:02:14.903070

Tina Kotek Orders Removal of Barriers to Oregon Renewable Energy Projects — ProPublica,"Tony Schick, shoshana.gordon@propublica.org",,,,,https://www.propublica.org/article/oregon-renewable-energy-legislative-progress,"The state’s energy department, in a first, recommended lawmakers consider creating a state entity to finance, plan and build transmission lines.
There has been new attention on electrical transmission in Washington state, as well.
The federal agency’s transmission lines and substations constitute 75% of the region’s electrical network.
Foes say rural transmission and wind projects blight the landscape, and they have used the permitting system as a means of delay.
“This would be something that could potentially really help move the needle,” said Joni Sliger, a senior policy analyst with the Oregon energy department.","A few months ago, Oregon’s green energy outlook was bleak.

The state Legislature and Gov. Tina Kotek had repeatedly failed to address a huge obstacle that has held back wind and solar projects in the Northwest for years: aging electrical lines too jammed up to handle more renewable power.

A series of articles by Oregon Public Broadcasting and ProPublica identified barriers in the federal and state bureaucracies that delayed improvements to the beef up the grid. The failure to complete upgrades is the main reason Oregon, like its fellow progressive state and neighbor Washington, has lagged most of the nation in the growth of clean energy despite an internal mandate to go green.

Bills to tackle the transmission problem continued to languish and die in the Oregon Legislature as recently as this spring.

But there has been a groundswell of urgency since the stories were published.

Kotek, a Democrat, has now issued two executive orders mandating that state agencies speed up renewable energy development by any available means, including fast-tracking permits and directly paying for new transmission lines.

Those efforts could eventually be backed up by money. The state’s energy department, in a first, recommended lawmakers consider creating a state entity to finance, plan and build transmission lines. A lawmaker whose bill to create such an authority failed this year suddenly has hope for getting it done, and he said the governor’s office is working with him to make it happen.

What was essentially an unacknowledged problem among many Oregon policymakers now has the full attention of the governor and the key agencies that report to her. There has been new attention on electrical transmission in Washington state, as well.

The shift comes as President Donald Trump has created new obstacles to ramping up renewable energy. This year, he removed tax credits that made wind and solar cheaper to build, blocked new wind permits and fired employees of the federal agency that reviews them.

This was the year “where you’ve seen all these factors coming together — we know that our outdated grid is choking our ability to grow across the state, and we’re already paying more for electricity,” Kotek said in an interview last week.

Kotek acknowledged the role of OPB and ProPublica’s reporting when asked what prompted the changes.

“You’ve been doing some great stories,” she said.

In May, OPB and ProPublica showed that the state ranked 47th in renewable energy growth over the past decade. Washington is 50th.

An analysis by the news organizations found that Northwest wind and solar farms face the longest odds in the country for successfully connecting to the power grid, under a process heavily controlled by the Bonneville Power Administration. The federal agency’s transmission lines and substations constitute 75% of the region’s electrical network.

Out of 469 large renewables projects that have sought access to Bonneville’s system since 2015, only one was successful. Backers of the other projects either abandoned their requests or were still waiting on studies and necessary upgrades to power lines and substations.

Northwest utilities fear rolling blackouts within the decade unless transmission capacity is expanded to meet surging energy demand, particularly from data centers that support artificial intelligence.

Kotek said she hadn’t seen the numbers on Oregon’s stagnant renewable energy growth before OPB and ProPublica reported them.

“I hope — and we will be planning — to make our numbers look better and better in the coming years,” she said.

In 2021, when lawmakers enacted Oregon’s plan to eliminate the use of fossil fuels in electrical generation by 2040, they failed to account for transmission and the glacial pace set by Bonneville for improvements. (The agency has said previously its project approval decisions are guided by financial prudence.)

Oregon leaders also did not address the state’s slow process for evaluating energy projects, with appeals that can prolong permit decisions on new power lines or wind and solar farms for years. The rules originated with the 1970s antinuclear movement. Foes say rural transmission and wind projects blight the landscape, and they have used the permitting system as a means of delay.

Bills to smooth out the state permitting process, even those supported by rural interests, went nowhere. Efforts to bypass Bonneville also withered. Advocates proposed a state financing authority for new transmission lines and substations as recently as this year. The legislation, which lacked the endorsement of either Kotek or the Oregon Department of Energy, died.

Emily Moore, director of climate and energy for the Seattle-based think tank Sightline Institute, called OPB and ProPublica’s reporting “invaluable” in prompting change.

“It has motivated policymakers and advocates alike to try to find solutions to get Oregon and Washington unstuck and is recruiting new people to the effort,” Moore said.

Kotek’s latest executive order calls for a wide array of state agencies to recommend ways to overcome obstacles to clean energy development. This followed her October order for state agencies to take “any and all steps necessary” to fast-track solar and wind permits.

Separately, the energy department recommended lawmakers look into creating a new entity like state authorities in Colorado and New Mexico, which plan transmission routes, partner with transmission developers and issue bonds to finance construction. The agency’s strategic plan, finalized in November, said the state must streamline clean energy development and take a more active role in getting regional transmission lines built.

Similar findings emerged in a Dec. 1 report by a state working group created by Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, which called for a dedicated state entity focused on increasing transmission capacity. The authors cited OPB and ProPublica’s 2025 coverage in stating that Washington is falling behind on infrastructure needed to hit its green energy goals. (Ferguson requested the report following reporting by The Seattle Times and ProPublica last year on the energy consumed by data centers, which receive generous state tax breaks.)

“This would be something that could potentially really help move the needle,” said Joni Sliger, a senior policy analyst with the Oregon energy department.

The governor has also ordered the department and Oregon utilities regulators to designate physical paths through the state in which permitting for transmission lines can be streamlined and to gather financial support for projects that serve the public interest.

Kotek cited the Boardman to Hemingway transmission line in Eastern Oregon that got caught in permitting limbo for nearly 20 years, an episode highlighted in OPB and ProPublica’s reporting. The governor called the state’s handling of the project a “red flag.”

“We have to get out of our own way,” she said.

Kotek’s executive orders drew praise from a range of organizations who appeared with the governor when she announced her most recent moves in November.

“It makes our energy system stronger and more reliable, enhancing grid resilience, expanding storage and bolstering transmission to keep electricity affordable and dependable for every Oregonian,” Nora Apter, Oregon director for the clean energy advocacy group Climate Solutions, said at the time.

The head of Oregon Business for Climate, which represents interests including real estate developers, wineries and coffee roasters, also spoke at the event.

Tim Miller, the group’s director, said that although Oregon has put in place an energy permitting system to ensure siting is done right, Kotek’s order “reminds the state that we also have to get things done.”

Lawmakers now are working on a plan to enact a state transmission financing authority during the next full legislative session, in early 2027.

Rep. Mark Gamba, the Portland-area Democrat whose effort to create such an agency last year failed, said the governor’s office is in discussions with him about the new legislation and that he expects it to pass thanks to her involvement.

“Her leaning in the way she has is what we needed,” he said.

Gamba said he’s seeing newfound support for expanding transmission from across the political spectrum.

“I’ve gotten calls from interests that typically I’m on the other side of the fight with,” Gamba said, “because they recognize that this is an economic development issue as well.”","https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/OG-RQCU4KFX2VHWXCXQBJYJOOQFXU.jpg?resize=2000,1049",N,,2025-12-30 11:01:36.356261

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Dec. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy announced today its submission of an early site permit (ESP) application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a site near the Belews Creek Steam Station in Stokes County, N.C., culminating two years of work. The submittal is part of the company's strategic, ongoing commitment to thoroughly evaluate new nuclear generation options to reliably meet the growing energy needs of its customers while reducing costs and risks.

Submitting an ESP application is a first for Duke Energy and a risk-mitigation strategy for the company as it pursues new nuclear generation options. An ESP is an optional NRC process that resolves environmental and site safety topics on the front end of a project and confirms a site's suitability for new nuclear generation. Having an approved permit reduces the risk of delays during licensing and construction if the company decides to build new nuclear units in Stokes County in the future.

""Nuclear energy has and will continue to play an essential role in powering communities in the Carolinas,"" said Kendal Bowman, Duke Energy's North Carolina president. ""Submitting an early site permit application is an important next step in assessing the potential for small modular reactors at the Belews Creek site.""

The ESP is technology neutral, allowing Duke Energy to receive the permit and select a technology later in the development process. The company's application includes six potential reactor technologies, including four small modular reactor designs and two non-light-water designs. Large light-water reactors, similar to the 11 units Duke Energy currently operates in the Carolinas, are not included in the permit application.

""We're taking a strategic approach to new nuclear development that allows us to advance licensing activities while reducing risks and allowing technologies to mature,"" said Duke Energy Chief Nuclear Officer Kelvin Henderson.

While Duke Energy has yet to make a decision to build new nuclear units, receiving an ESP provides future optionality for the company's customers and the communities it serves. If additional evaluation confirms small modular reactor technology at the Belews Creek site offers the best value for customers, the company plans to add 600 megawatts of advanced nuclear to the system by 2037, with the first small modular reactor coming on line in 2036.

Drive through the plains of Iowa or Kansas and you’ll see more than rows of corn, wheat and soybeans. You’ll also see towering wind turbines spinning above fields and solar panels shining in the sun on barns and machine sheds.

For many farmers, these are lifelines. Renewable energy provides steady income and affordable power, helping farms stay viable when crop prices fall or drought strikes.

But some of that opportunity is now at risk as the Trump administration cuts federal support for renewable energy.

Wind power brings steady income for farms

Wind energy is a significant economic driver in rural America. In Iowa, for example, over 60% of the state’s electricity came from wind energy in 2024, and the state is a hub for wind turbine manufacturing and maintenance jobs.

For landowners, wind turbines often mean stable lease payments. Those historically were around US$3,000 to $5,000 per turbine per year, with some modern agreements $5,000 to $10,000 annually, secured through 20- to 30-year contracts.

Nationwide, wind and solar projects contribute about $3.5 billion annually in combined lease payments and state and local taxes, more than a third of it going directly to rural landowners.

These figures are backed by long-term contracts and multibillion‑dollar annual contributions, reinforcing the economic value that turbines bring to rural landowners and communities.

Wind farms also contribute to local tax revenues that help fund rural schools, roads and emergency services. In counties across Texas, wind energy has become one of the most significant contributors to local property tax bases, stabilizing community budgets and helping pay for public services as agricultural commodity revenues fluctuate.

In Oldham County in northwest Texas, for example, clean energy projects provided 22% of total county revenues in 2021. In several other rural counties, wind farms rank among the top 10 property taxpayers, contributing between 38% and 69% of tax revenue.

The construction and operation of these projects also bring local jobs in trucking, concrete work and electrical services, boosting small-town businesses.

The U.S. wind industry supports over 300,000 U.S. jobs across construction, manufacturing, operations and other roles connected to the industry, according to the American Clean Power Association.

Renewable energy has been widely expected to continue to grow along with rising energy demand. In 2024, 93% of all new electricity generating capacity was wind, solar or energy storage, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration expected a similar percentage in 2025 as of June.

Solar can cut power costs on the farm

Solar energy is also boosting farm finances. Farmers use rooftop panels on barns and ground-mounted systems to power irrigation pumps, grain dryers and cold storage facilities, cutting their power costs.

Some farmers have adopted agrivoltaics – dual-use systems that grow crops beneath solar panels. The panels provide shade, helping conserve water, while creating a second income path. These projects often cultivate pollinator-friendly plants, vegetables such as lettuce and spinach, or even grasses for grazing sheep, making the land productive for both food and energy.

Federal grants and tax credits that were significantly expanded under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act helped make the upfront costs of solar installations affordable.

However, the federal spending bill signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025, rolled back many clean energy incentives. It phases down tax credits for distributed solar projects, particularly those under 1 megawatt, which include many farm‑scale installations, and sunsets them entirely by 2028. It also eliminates bonus credits that previously supported rural and low‑income areas.

Without these credits, the upfront cost of solar power could be out of reach for some farmers, leaving them paying higher energy costs. At a 2024 conference organized by the Institute of Sustainability, Energy and Environment at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I work as a research economist, farmers emphasized the importance of tax credits and other economic incentives to offset the upfront cost of solar power systems.

What’s being lost

The cuts to federal incentives include terminating the Production Tax Credit for new projects placed in service after Dec. 31, 2027, unless construction begins by July 4, 2026, and is completed within a tight time frame. The tax credit pays eligible wind and solar facilities approximately 2.75 cents per kilowatt-hour over 10 years, effectively lowering the cost of renewable energy generation. Ending that tax credit will likely increase the cost of production, potentially leading to higher electricity prices for consumers and fewer new projects coming online.

The changes also accelerate the phase‑out of wind power tax credits. Projects must now begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be in service before the end of 2027 to qualify for any credit.

Meanwhile, the Investment Tax Credit, which covers 30% of installed cost for solar and other renewables, faces similar limits: Projects must begin by July 4, 2026, and be completed by the end of 2027 to claim the credits. The bill also cuts bonuses for domestic components and installations in rural or low‑income locations. These adjustments could slow new renewable energy development, particularly smaller projects that directly benefit rural communities.

While many existing clean energy agreements will remain in place for now, the rollback of federal incentives threatens future projects and could limit new income streams. It also affects manufacturing and jobs in those industries, which some rural communities rely on.

Renewable energy also powers rural economies

Renewable energy benefits entire communities, not just individual farmers.

Wind and solar projects contribute millions of dollars in tax revenue. For example, in Howard County, Iowa, wind turbines generated $2.7 million in property tax revenue in 2024, accounting for 14.5% of the county’s total budget and helping fund rural schools, public safety and road improvements.

In some rural counties, clean energy is the largest new source of economic activity, helping stabilize local economies otherwise reliant on agriculture’s unpredictable income streams. These projects also support rural manufacturing – such as Iowa turbine blade factories like TPI Composites, which just reopened its plant in Newton, and Siemens Gamesa in Fort Madison, which supply blades for GE and Siemens turbines. The tax benefits in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act helped boost those industries – and the jobs and local tax revenue they bring in.

On the solar side, rural companies like APA Solar Racking, based in Ohio, manufacture steel racking systems for utility-scale solar farms across the Midwest. https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bcet_aaaMq8?wmode=transparent&start=0 An example of how renewable energy has helped boost farm incomes and keep farmers on their land.

As rural America faces economic uncertainty and climate pressures, I believe homegrown renewable energy offers a practical path forward. Wind and solar aren’t just fueling the grid; they’re helping keep farms and rural towns alive.

The U.S. Department of Justice anticipates its online filing portal will be operational by the end of this year.","“Forever chemicals” seeping into drinking water, a federal shift in public lands and the historic inclusion of New Mexican downwinders in a federal restitution program all led the news cycle this year.

Issues of climate and public health shaped the state’s political landscape in 2025. All year, Source NM covered the intersection of the climate and public health. The stories documented profound impacts at the local, state and national levels.

“What we do to the climate, to the atmosphere, to the land or water, we do to ourselves,” Melissa Troutman, climate and health advocate for WildEarth Guardians, wrote in an email to Source NM. “Fines are rarely, if ever, issued to companies polluting New Mexico’s air, land, and water while risking public health and climate.”

These issues are felt acutely in New Mexico, where state leaders have sought to earn the state a reputation as “a national leader in clean energy.” Here are the year’s top environmental and health stories, as reported by Source NM.

Regulating ‘forever chemicals’

Like many states across the nation, New Mexico has worked to mitigate the presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly known as PFAS or “forever chemicals.”

The Environmental Protection Agency has said that exposure to the chemicals may cause cancer. The EPA last year set a 2029 deadline for public water systems to comply with new drinking water requirements.

New Mexico officials in August sought to end a dispute over monitoring PFAS levels in the water aquifer under Cannon Air Force Base near Clovis. Testing found the “forever chemicals” in the blood of nearly 600 people in the area.

Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham this year signed legislation that tasked state environment officials with creating laws to phase out consumer products with intentionally added “forever chemicals.”

The New Mexico Environment Department in October proposed PFAS rules to the state Environmental Improvement Board. At the time, department officials said public hearings could be scheduled as early as February.

100 measles cases in 6 months

New Mexico logged its first measles case of the year — the third such case since 2021 — in February. But it didn’t stop there.

By May, state health officials warned of possible exposures in Albuquerque and Santa Fe. The state’s congressional delegation promptly called on Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. to address the crisis.

After logging more than 100 cases over six months, state officials declared an end to the outbreak in September.

A federal shift in land policies

During a turbulent year for the federal government, federal agencies unveiled plans that marked a shift in land policy for the Western U.S. and New Mexico, in particular.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture in August solicited public feedback on its plans to repeal a ban on constructing roads on U.S. Forest Service land, which had ramifications for 1.6 million acres in New Mexico.

U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) opposed the plans, saying at the time: “The bottom line is that when we build new roads in protected areas, we risk more fires, not fewer.”

The “roadless rule” was not the federal government’s only target this year. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in September said the Conservation and Landscape Health Rule — which seeks to give conservation of public lands due consideration along other uses such as timber, grazing and recreation — stood in the way of oil and gas development.

New Mexico’s congressional delegation called on Burgum to reverse course on plans to remove federal protections around Chaco Culture National Historical Park.

Compensation for downwinders

For the first time, the federal government included New Mexican downwinders in its Radiation and Exposure Compensation Act. The law, passed in 1990, sought to give restitution to people who fell ill following exposure to radiation and uranium. Until this year, though, it excluded New Mexican downwinders and post-1971 uranium miners.

U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) had advocated for their inclusion every year since first winning federal office in 2008. The RECA fund briefly expired in 2025, but bipartisan efforts to restore and expand the restitution finally succeeded when U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri included it in President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending bill.

The deadline to apply for RECA compensation is Dec. 31, 2027, according to Heinrich’s office. The U.S. Department of Justice anticipates its online filing portal will be operational by the end of this year.

Data center’s effects on water and air

Some residents say the scope of the project still wasn’t clear when Doña Ana County commissioners in September approved $165 billion in bonds for a development with a number of generically named LLCs — including Red Chiles LLC and Green Chile Ventures LLC — on the project application.

County officials approved the bonds for what is now known as Project Jupiter, a massive campus of data centers planned to support tech companies like OpenAI and Oracle.

Since then, documents have revealed how developers plan to build natural gas generating stations to power the project, prompting concern over whether it will comply with the state’s clean energy law.

Developers have asked state officials to approve permits that would let it emit as many greenhouse gases annually as New Mexico’s two largest cities combined, Source NM was the first to report in December. The state environment department subsequently ruled that the permits were “incomplete” and gave them until Jan. 19 to provide more information.

The applications for air quality permits must go to a public hearing if a member of the community requests one, a spokesperson for the state environment department said. Such a hearing has yet to be scheduled.

Toxic metals found in groundwater

Two New Mexico state agencies in November told Mora County residents to test their private wells after discovering high levels of toxic metals in the area’s groundwater.

The metals — antimony, arsenic and uranium, all of which threaten the kidneys, skin and cardiovascular and nervous systems — were the same ones found in firefighting foams that crews used to combat the massive Hermits Peak/Calf Canyon fire.

Residents and New Mexico leaders, including Democratic U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, quickly pointed to the blaze as a likely source of the contamination and called on the federal government to respond.

Officials overseeing the approximately remaining $2 billion in federal compensation for people affected by the Hermits Peak/Calf Canyon fire responded by saying they’d consider addressing the water contamination if victims could prove “injuries and causation.” Leger Fernández, in response, said FEMA “should create a protocol to quickly address these claims.”

“If [the metals] are a consequence of the fire, it is my belief that they should be covered by the Hermits Peak money that I secured for these claims,” Leger Fernández told Source NM at the time. “And we need to make sure that FEMA reads the report to understand that this is not naturally occurring contamination and that they are heavy metals that come from the fire suppression efforts.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-93/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pueblo-bonito-1-1024x6841767100947.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=M-idYxEb,N,,2025-12-30 12:13:18.248657

I didn’t think it would shatter my understanding of the U.S. energy transition.

First, a quick word about myself for any Heatmap readers who may not know: Along with delivering you scoop after scoop, I’ve been writing and playing music as the front person of a band called Ekko Astral. Last fall, we had the privilege of touring the entire U.S. opening for two of my favorite rock acts, PUP and Jeff Rosenstock. The tour itself was immensely successful, with packed-out rooms full of thousands of screaming fans. Getting to play those stages was the culmination of a dream I’d had since playing guitar at age 11 at the local coffeeshop open-mic. It was awesome.

What I hadn’t considered about this cross-country rock n’ roll tour, however, was that it would take me through the fields of wind turbines and solar projects being built across the country that I’d reported on but mostly hadn’t seen in person.

Driving across the country with my band, I saw solar and wind projects in Wisconsin, Kansas, Arizona, and Idaho. One drive from Austin, Texas to Rozwell, New Mexico, sent me through a dizzying maze of wind farms in a western portion of the Lone Star State that surrounded my vehicle on all sides with spinning blades and transmission lines — and fracking rigs, because it was Texas. It felt like some sort of twisted, magnificent energy wonk video game level.

I also drove through myriad pockets of rural America where companies have been fighting tooth-and-nail to build utility-scale renewable energy and sometimes losing to hardened opposition. I drove through open fields and farmland in the Midwest and the Great Plains, for example, including places where building solar or wind is banned outright. I drove straight through the part of central Idaho where Lava Ridge, once the largest wind farm in the country, would have been built this year if not for Donald Trump. Sure, there were counties where I could understand wanting to avoid solar farms on farmland, or wind turbines cluttering more picturesque vistas. But I can’t tell you how many times I looked out the window of my vehicle and thought, Why isn’t this a solar farm? There’s no one here!

At the same time, I was trapped in my own form of climate hypocrisy, touring the country in a gas-powered Ford Transit van. I kept longing for us to have the capacity to tour by electric van. But setting aside the limited availability of electric vans for touring purposes, the sheer logistical requirements of going electric would be difficult for any touring band. Music venues do not always have reliable charging access, and calculating when and how to charge the van on our tour probably would’ve made already time-limited logistics impossible. Sure, Ed Sheeran might be able to do it, but not an up-and-coming band on a budget.

To make matters more frustrating, it turns out band merch isn’t great for the planet. Yes, you can choose greener materials for T-shirts and record packaging, but vinyl records are produced with petrochemicals. Cleaner alternatives, known as biovinyl, have been tried but can have serious quality issues (see: the Billie Eilish experiment). Then add in the shipping required to get multiple rush orders of shirts dropped in random spots across the country and, well, you’re looking at quite a lot of potential carbon emissions.

One day, late in the tour, I walked off stage in Salt Lake City and opened my phone to a text from a source notifying me that Esmeralda 7 — the largest solar project in the U.S. — had been killed. I wrote the piece, then went back to selling more copies of Ekko Astral songs printed onto petroleum discs.

All of this made me feel angry and helpless. By the time the tour ended I wasn’t quite a doomer, but I was tired, and my views on climate action had changed in three important ways.

First, we need to rethink what kind of “permitting reform” is necessary for the energy transition. After driving through so many open areas with so little economic development and no new renewable energy generation, I no longer think that changing federal environmental laws will make much of a difference, except to make more polluting forms of energy more economical. The permitting issues delaying projects in these places are, as I have reported for Heatmap, sometimes caused by people on social media who are manipulating a decline in civil engagement and participation in municipal government to block energy projects they personally dislike, even when the developments enjoy broad community support.

This is not a federal permitting problem, it’s a local one. But national politicians could help mitigate this issue if they really wanted to. New gas pipelines need approval from just one entity — the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission — but transmission lines have to cross all the Ts with every state agency along their path. Lawmakers trying to rectify that problem should also turn their attention to the local moratoria and restrictive ordinances holding up what Heatmap Pro data shows is more than a thousand renewable energy and battery storage projects across the country. I do not know what the specific policy solution is here, but we need policy experts to start coming up with ideas.

Second, I believe that artists need to practice what we preach.

In the wake of my tour, I’ve found myself daydreaming about what a true climate-friendly tour would look like, and have spoken with fellow musicians — and climate wonks — about how to make it happen. Maybe one day I will commandeer an electric vehicle and bring only enough gear to play music off the battery in the car. Or perhaps I will put on an outdoor concert run entirely on renewable-powered generators, as the band Massive Attack did earlier this year, claiming it slashed most of the emissions from their performance. In any case, these forms of radical thinking will be crucial because culture is upstream of politics, and art is the soundtrack that defines action.

Lastly, I think more of us need to go out and see the rest of our world, because it’s frustrating it took me a rock n’ roll tour to see what was right there this whole time: the frustratingly slow pace of progress.

I’m used to hearing from all sides that renewable energy deployment in the U.S. is moving at a rapid clip, even in spite of Trump’s rise to power. Nearly half of all new power coming online this year is going to be solar and wind. Battery manufacturing investments continue to be a bright spot. Carbon emissions are going down, albeit slowly. All of this is nice to hear, but I just traveled the whole country and it didn’t feel like I was seeing or feeling the transition that is supposedly underway.

This country has a lot of potential. I want to see us go so much further towards a greener electric grid, transportation system, and arts community.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjU5MzY1My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgwNDY1ODg3Mn0.QhMzVB_jW1znNne8xt-tMBz7QVuXp18q4q3VlLQsa8o/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-12-30 10:13:54.211663

South Korean battery materials company L&F Co. disclosed this week that a previously announced supply agreement with Tesla has been reduced to a fraction of its original value.

The contract, first announced in February 2023 and originally valued at 3.83 trillion won (US$2.67 billion), has been slashed by roughly 99% to just 9.73 million won (US$6,700), according to a regulatory filing.

L&F said the dramatic reduction stemmed from a “change in supply quantity,” without naming specific vehicle programs. However, people familiar with the deal say the high-nickel cathode material was intended for 4680 batteries used in the Cybertruck, Tesla’s stainless-steel electric pickup. Deliveries were scheduled to run from January 2024 through December 2025, but only minimal volumes were ultimately supplied. (via Bloomberg)

The sharp pullback reflects a combination of delayed development timelines and softer-than-expected demand for the Cybertruck, currently the only Tesla vehicle utilizing the 4680 battery cells.

Broader economic and policy shifts also played a role. Sources cited the elimination of certain U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) subsidies as another factor that weighed on projected battery volumes. Across the industry, automakers and suppliers have been reassessing EV investments amid slowing growth rates, rising costs, and regulatory uncertainty.

In a statement, L&F stressed that the contract revision was driven by changing market conditions rather than product quality issues. “There have been no changes to shipments or customer supply of the company’s flagship high-nickel product,” the company said, adding that deliveries to major Korean battery cell manufacturers remain on track.

For Tesla, the development highlights how its vertically integrated battery strategy—particularly around newer formats like the 4680 cell—remains closely tied to vehicle demand. The Cybertruck was expected to be a major showcase for these cells, but scaling production has proven more difficult than initially forecast. Challenges with manufacturing yields and advanced processes, such as dry-electrode coating, have limited output and reduced material requirements.",https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/model-y-4680.jpg?fit=2016%2C908&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-30 12:01:05.445703

The Pricing Recommendation Engine simplifies complex market dynamics into an intuitive, color-coded visual guide, the company said.

Intelligence and Compatibility

Comprehensive data fusion: The “Recommendation Engine” is the only solution that integrates all five critical pricing factors into a single recommendation. Local utility rates (including time-of-use (TOU) pricing and demand charges), historical site behavior, and nearby competitor pricing. Competing tools typically focus on either nearby charger pricing or utility rates, rarely both.

Site-specific accuracy: The model evaluates actual charging patterns at the site, producing accurate cost-recovery estimates superior to generic assumptions. It also provides baseline guidance for new sites with no history, refining automatically as data accumulates.

Universal compatibility: The “Recommendation Engine” works across all supported hardware brands and does not require additional devices, subscriptions, or telematics data. AmpUp said this simplifies deployment and onboarding. Many pricing engines require complex questionnaires, manual tariff selection, or complex onboarding, which AmpUp bypasses entirely.

Automatic compliance: The backend automatically updates pricing recommendations as utility tariffs and regulatory rates change. The company said this removes the need for manual research and ensuring continuous profitability.

“Pricing uncertainty is the biggest barrier preventing site operators from maximizing their EV charging investments,” said Tom Sun, CEO of AmpUp. “This solves this by putting immediate, comprehensive market power directly into the hands of our customers.”

With all the challenges facing private companies this year, they must leverage every available tax benefit.

Fortunately, lawmakers have packed the federal tax code with credits and incentives to reward taxpayers for specific activities and investments.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act made significant revisions to energy credits, imposing new restrictions and phasing out many of the credits early.

Despite the changes, there is still considerable runway for many projects, and both the tax equity financing and credit transfer markets should remain robust over the next several years.

In addition, the OBBBA enhanced existing incentives, offering new opportunities for tax-efficient structuring.

Energy Provisions

The OBBBA has reshaped the energy credit landscape. Several credits were extended or enhanced, while many others are subject to new sourcing and investment requirements or are phasing out early.

The legislation does not affect the ability to transfer or claim refundable payments for specified credits.

Consumer Credits: The OBBBA repeals several energy-related tax credits directed to consumers, each with distinct effective dates:

Section 25E—Previously Owned Clean Vehicle Credit: Repealed for vehicles acquired after Sept. 30, 2025.

Section 30D—Clean Vehicle Credit: Repealed for vehicles acquired after Sept. 30, 2025.

Section 45W—Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit: Repealed for vehicles acquired after Sept. 30, 2025.

Section 30C—Alternative Fuel Refueling Property Credit: Repealed for property placed in service after June 30, 2026.

Section 25C—Energy-Efficient Home Improvement Credit: Repealed for property placed in service after Dec. 31, 2025.

Section 25D—Residential Clean Energy Credit: Repealed for expenditures made after Dec. 31, 2025.

Section 45L—New Energy-Efficient Home Credit: Repealed for property acquired after June 30, 2026.

Depreciation: The bill eliminates the five-year depreciable life for qualified energy property, and the Section 179D deduction is repealed for construction beginning after June 30, 2026.

Investment, Production Tax Credits

The OBBBA accelerates the phaseout of the investment tax credit under Section 48E and the production tax credit under Section 45Y.

Projects that begin construction after 2033 will generally no longer qualify for these credits, with solar and wind facilities facing even earlier deadlines. To remain eligible, solar and wind projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026, must be placed in service by the end of 2027.

The legislation also introduces new restrictions related to prohibited foreign entities. Facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2025, may not receive material assistance from such entities.

Material assistance is determined based on a cost ratio tied to the sourcing of eligible components. In addition, Section 48E now includes stricter domestic sourcing requirements to obtain the 10% bonus credit, reflecting a broader policy shift toward supply chain security and energy independence.

Importantly, the IRS has tightened the rules for establishing that construction has begun for purposes of the July 4, 2026, deadline for solar and wind facilities.

Under Notice 2025-43, the 5% safe harbor method is available only if taxpayers can use it to establish that construction began by Sept. 1, 2025.

Starting Sept. 2, the physical work test is the sole method for establishing the beginning of construction for wind and solar projects for purposes of the July 4, 2026, deadline.

This change applies to the credit phaseouts under the OBBBA, but not to the foreign entity of concern rules.

For FEOC exemption purposes, facilities may still use the 5% safe harbor to establish that construction began by Dec. 31, 2025.

Additionally, low-output solar facilities (≤1.5 MW AC) may continue to use the 5% safe harbor beyond that date. The four-year continuity safe harbor remains in place for projects that meet BOC requirements.

Historically, taxpayers could rely on either the physical work test or the 5% safe harbor. Notice 2025-42 now limits this to the physical work test, which requires significant physical work related to the energy property, either on-site or off-site, under a binding contract. Preliminary activities, such as design or site clearing, do not qualify.

To maintain credit eligibility, taxpayers must also meet the continuity requirement, which is satisfied if the facility is placed in service within four years of the BOC year.

Advanced Manufacturing Credit

The advanced manufacturing credit under Section 45X has been modified significantly.

While the credit is repealed for wind energy components sold after 2027, it remains available for other eligible components before a phasedown begins in 2031.

Components sold in 2031 will qualify for a 75% credit, decreasing to 50% in 2032 and 25% in 2033.

The credit is fully repealed for sales occurring in 2034 or later. Notably, the scope of the credit has been expanded to include metallurgical coal.

As with other energy provisions, the material assistance restrictions for prohibited foreign entities apply to all qualifying components.

Clean Fuel Production Credit

Under the OBBBA, the clean fuel production credit under Section 45Z has been extended through 2031.

The bill also reinstates the small agri-biodiesel credit under Section 40A, which can now be stacked with the 45Z credit.

A new geographic restriction has been added, disallowing the credit unless the feedstock is produced or grown in Canada, Mexico, or the U.S.

Additionally, the methodology for calculating greenhouse gas emissions has been revised to exclude indirect land use changes.

Prohibited foreign entity rules have also been extended to apply to clean fuel production facilities.

Planning considerations: Facilities must establish BOC by Dec. 31, 2025, to avoid FEOC restrictions beginning in 2026, and can continue to rely on the 5% safe harbor specifically to meet this deadline through the end of 2025.

Solar and wind projects beginning construction more than 12 months after the OBBBA enactment must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to qualify for Section 48E or 45Y credits.

Facilities that establish BOC by the deadline can rely on the four-year continuity safe harbor to place in service and preserve credit eligibility.

Other Energy Provisions

The clean hydrogen production credit under Section 45V is repealed for construction beginning after 2027—two years later than previously proposed.

Section 45Q credit rates for carbon capture used as a tertiary injectant or for productive use are increased to match those for permanent geologic storage, subject to new foreign-entity restrictions.

Publicly traded partnership rules now include income from carbon capture; nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal energy projects, as well as the transport or storage of sustainable aviation fuel or hydrogen.

The nuclear production credit under Section 45U is also subject to foreign entity restrictions.

Planning considerations: Taxpayers should assess project timelines and sourcing strategies in light of phaseouts and new restrictions. For Sections 45Y and 48E, construction must begin within eligibility windows—especially for solar and wind projects facing a 2027 placed-in-service deadline.

Supply chain planning is critical to avoid disqualification under foreign entity rules. Manufacturers of wind property eligible for Section 45X should consider accelerating production before the phaseout in 2027.

Clean fuel producers must ensure feedstock sourcing complies with geographic limits and updated emissions rules.

Entities pursuing carbon capture, hydrogen, or nuclear projects should factor in expanded PTP eligibility and foreign entity restrictions when structuring financing and partnerships.

Early action can help preserve credit eligibility and provide long-term benefits.

State Tax Credit Transfers

Following the enactment of the OBBBA, many states have expanded or introduced transferable tax credit programs, particularly in clean energy, affordable housing, and infrastructure.

These programs allow taxpayers to sell unused credits to third parties, creating liquidity and broader access to state-level incentives.

Transfer mechanisms vary by state, with some requiring pre-approval, certification, or registration, while others impose annual caps or limits on transfer volume.

The trend mirrors federal credit transferability under Section 6418 and reflects growing interest in flexible credit monetization strategies.

States are also beginning to adopt market infrastructure—such as broker platforms and insurance products—to support credit transfers and mitigate buyer risk.

As more jurisdictions adopt these frameworks, taxpayers with multistate operations should monitor developments closely to identify new opportunities.

Planning considerations: Taxpayers should assess eligibility and timing for generating transferable credits, especially in states with strict certification or sourcing requirements.

Early coordination with legal and tax advisors is essential to confirm compliance with documentation and reporting rules. Buyers should conduct due diligence on project qualification, transfer terms, and potential recapture risks.

Engaging with credit brokers or marketplaces may help improve pricing and identify reliable counterparties.

Additionally, taxpayers should consider how state credit transfers interact with federal incentives, particularly in structuring financing and partnership arrangements.

Strategic planning now can help enhance credit value and avoid missed opportunities as state programs continue to evolve.

New Markets Tax Credit Program Permanent

The New Markets Tax Credit program supports capital investments in low-income communities by offering tax credit-subsidized loans to eligible businesses for use toward eligible costs (e.g., real estate and furniture, fixtures, and equipment).

These loans often feature interest-only terms, below-market rates, and principal forgiveness after seven years, providing businesses with a permanent cash benefit.

Previously set to expire at the end of 2025, the NMTC program was made permanent by the OBBBA, with a continued annual allocation authority of $5 billion.

Eligible businesses—both for-profit and nonprofit—can apply for NMTC financing for capital expenditure projects in qualifying census tracts.

The program supports a wide range of sectors, including manufacturing, healthcare, education, renewable energy, and retail, though it excludes farming and residential rental activities.

Each year, certified Community Development Entities apply to the CDFI Fund for NMTC allocations.

If awarded an allocation, CDEs raise equity from tax credit investors and deploy capital to eligible businesses (otherwise known as Qualified Active Low-Income Community Businesses) based on community impact and strategic priorities, which may vary by geography or industry.

Planning considerations: The NMTC program remains highly competitive. Early engagement with CDEs and timely application are critical to securing financing.

Businesses should prepare detailed project plans that demonstrate substantial community impact and align with CDE priorities.

Acting early improves the likelihood of receiving funding and may unlock additional benefits.

Work Opportunity Tax Credit Set to Expire

The OBBBA did not extend the work opportunity tax credit, which is now set to expire for any individuals who begin work after Dec. 31, 2025.

The WOTC provides a valuable incentive for employers who often hire workers from specific targeted populations, including veterans, people with disabilities, people on food assistance, certain youth employees, and ex-felons.

Employers who frequently screen for qualified individuals as part of their hiring process should monitor the legislative process for a potential extension of the credit.

Pass-Through Deduction

The OBBBA makes permanent the 20% deduction for qualified business income under Section 199A and favorably adjusts the phaseout of the deduction for taxpayers who do not meet the wage expense and capital investment requirements or who participate in a “specified service trade or business.”

Planning considerations: The permanence of this provision provides welcome certainty for private companies engaged in qualifying activities.

The deduction is not available for a range of specified service businesses. There may be opportunities to segregate activities and to increase or allow deductions.

The safe harbor for rental activity to qualify as a Section 199A trade or business under Rev. Proc. 2019-38 remains in effect.

R&D Credit Opportunities

The research credit remains one of the most powerful incentives in the tax code, and the IRS continues to receive a high volume of claims, straining examination resources.

To improve administration and reduce improper claims, the IRS recently made several changes to Form 6765, clarifying documentation requirements for claiming the credit.

The revised Form 6765 was partially finalized for tax year 2025, with the IRS making the mandatory reporting of qualified research expenses by business component optional in Section G.

When Section G becomes mandatory for the 2026 tax year, taxpayers will be required to disclose the top 80% of QREs, with controlled group members required to attach detailed entity-level breakdowns.

Section E is currently mandatory and includes new questions related to officer wages, acquisitions, and use of the ASC 730 directive.

These updates reflect the IRS’s ongoing efforts to enhance transparency and strengthen audit readiness.

In response to ongoing compliance concerns, the IRS has increased scrutiny of research credit filings, including more frequent audits.

However, due to temporary resource constraints, some IRS Exam functions are operating at reduced capacity, which may delay enforcement actions.

Taxpayers should confirm that they are properly documenting claims and exploring state credit opportunities.

State Credit Changes

Over the past year, several states have enacted or revised legislation related to research and development tax credits. These changes reflect a growing trend to incentivize innovation and attract high-tech investment.

These states include:

Arizona: Arizona now permits the use of the alternative simplified credit (ASC) method for computing its credit for increased research activities. This provides greater flexibility and may lead to greater benefits. Refundable credits are available for small businesses with fewer than 150 employees, subject to pre-approval from the Arizona Commerce Authority.

Arkansas: Arkansas expanded its credit options, offering up to 33% for strategic research areas and university partnerships. Credits are nonrefundable but can offset 100% of state tax liability and be carried forward for up to nine years.

Connecticut: Connecticut expanded its R&D and R&E credits under H.B. 7287. Single-member LLCs may now qualify if they meet specific criteria. Refundability increased to 90% for small biotech firms and 65% for other small businesses, capped at $1.5 million per company annually.

Iowa: Iowa enacted Senate File 657, replacing its research activities credit with a targeted R&D tax credit program effective Jan. 1, 2026. Eligibility is limited to sectors such as advanced manufacturing, bioscience, finance, insurance, and technology. Credits are capped at $40 million annually and require CPA-verified QREs and a competitive application process through the Iowa Economic Development Authority.

Massachusetts: Massachusetts increased the maximum allowable credit for certain industries and introduced new documentation requirements for software development and AI-related R&D.

Michigan: Effective Jan. 1, 2025, Michigan reintroduced its R&D tax credit. Large businesses may claim 3% of qualifying expenses up to a base amount and 10% above it, capped at $2 million. Small businesses may claim 15% above the base amount, capped at $250,000. An additional 5% credit is available for university collaborations, capped at $200,000. The credit is refundable and subject to an annual cap of $100 million.

Minnesota: Minnesota introduced partial refundability for its R&D credit: 19.2% for 2025, increasing to 25% for 2026–2027.

Oklahoma: Oklahoma revised its R&D credit to align more closely with federal QRE definitions and introduced a new pre-approval application process.

Texas: Texas enhanced its franchise tax R&D credit via SB 2206 and repealed the R&D equipment sales tax exemption effective Jan. 1, 2026.

Planning considerations: Navigating the R&D credit has become more complex amid heightened review, evolving case law, and new compliance measures.

Taxpayers should make sure claims are well-supported and consistent with updated guidance to reduce audit risk and avoid delays.

Taxpayers should carefully assess eligibility for both federal and state research credits, maintain contemporaneous documentation, and prepare to defend claims under examination.

Strategic planning is essential to leveraging available incentives, especially given the complexity and variability of state-level programs.

Using a trusted tax advisor can help taxpayers maintain compliance with IRS and state regulations and effectively substantiate research credit claims.

Rules Changed for Qualified Small Business Stock

The OBBBA significantly enhances a tax-efficient structuring option for private companies. Qualified small business stock under Section 1202 offers tax-free appreciation and has been increasingly used by private equity in recent years.

Enacted in 1993, Section 1202 generally allows a non-corporate taxpayer to exclude a percentage of the gain from the sale or exchange of QSBS held for more than five years.

The eligible gain exclusion percentage is based on the date the stock is issued.

For stock issued before July 5, 2025, the maximum amount of gain on QSBS that can be excluded for any tax year by each taxpayer with respect to each issuing C corporation is generally limited to the greater of: (i) $10 million, minus the amount of gain excluded by that taxpayer in prior years with respect to the same issuing corporation; or (ii) 10 times the taxpayer’s aggregate adjusted basis in the QSBS sold during the tax year.

For stock issued after July 4, 2025, the OBBBA increases the $10 million limit to $15 million and adjusts this limit for inflation beginning in 2027. In addition, the OBBBA creates new 50% and 75% gain exclusion categories for QSBS held for at least three and four years, respectively.

The various QSBS exclusion percentages, exclusion limits, and required holding periods by stock issuance date are set out in the table below.

The OBBBA also increases the limit on aggregate gross assets to satisfy the qualified small business test for purposes of Section 1202. These thresholds are now as follows:

At all times through the date of issuance, the corporation’s aggregate gross assets must not have exceeded $50 million for issuances before July 5, 2025, or $75 million for issuances after July 4, 2025; and

Immediately after the date of issuance (and after considering amounts the corporation received in the issuance), the aggregate gross assets of the corporation must not exceed $50 million or $75 million for issuances before July 5, 2025, or after July 4, 2025, respectively. Aggregate gross assets are defined as cash plus the aggregate adjusted tax basis of the corporation’s other assets.

Planning considerations: After an issuance is deemed to be QSBS under Section 1202, the corporation’s gross assets can exceed the applicable threshold (either $50 million or $75 million) at a later date without prohibiting the previously issued stock from receiving Section 1202 treatment.

By increasing the threshold, the OBBBA renews an existing corporation’s ability to issue QSBS if their aggregate gross assets have exceeded $50 million in the past but have never exceeded $75 million.

This higher threshold also expands the potential QSBS benefits for private equity firms when acquiring target businesses with enterprise values of up to $75 million.

Opportunity Zone Extension

The OBBBA made the qualified opportunity zone program permanent, preserving one of the most generous tax incentives ever offered by Congress.

The provision can offer benefits to investors looking for tax-efficient returns, individual private companies investing in specific geographies, or asset managers setting up funds.

The OBBBA not only makes the program permanent, but it also changes the rules in essential ways. Funds and investors should consider the implications for their planning strategies.

The changes could affect the timing of gain transactions and capital contributions, the location of investments, and the compliance burdens for funds.

The current QOZ designations will expire at the end of 2026. New zones will be designated in rolling 10-year designation periods under new criteria that are expected to shrink the number of qualifying zones.

Under the current program, taxpayers can defer capital gains by investing in a qualified opportunity fund.

For investments made after 2026, taxpayers will be required to recognize the deferred gain five years after investing, but will receive a 10% increase in basis for holding the investment for five years. For QOFs operating in a new category of rural opportunity zones, this basis increase is 30%.

Taxpayers who make investments before the end of 2026 must still recognize the deferred gain at the end of 2026.

The more powerful tax benefit may be the tax-free appreciation on the underlying investment itself. Taxpayers will still receive a full basis step-up to fair market value for property held 10 years, but the OBBBA added a rule freezing the basis step-up to the FMV at 30 years after the date of the investment.

The operational rules for QOFs and qualified opportunity zone businesses are generally unchanged, except for property held in a rural opportunity zone.

The threshold for establishing the substantial improvement of qualifying property in a rural opportunity zone will be 50% of the basis rather than 100%, effective for any determinations after July 4, 2025.

QOFs and QOZBs will both be subject to increased reporting requirements.

Companies looking for new tax-efficient investing opportunities and gain deferral strategies should reassess their investment options, paying particular attention to which geographies are likely to qualify in 2027.

Planning considerations: The timing of capital gains transactions will be important. Delaying a capital gain transaction could allow taxpayers to make a deferral election in 2027 and defer recognizing the gain until well after the current 2026 recognition date.

Conversely, taxpayers planning investments in geographic areas that are unlikely to be redesignated may need to make the investments before the end of 2026.

Existing QOFs and QOZBs should consider their long-term capital needs because it is not clear whether any “grandfathering” relief will allow additional qualified investments in funds operating in QOZs that are not redesignated.

The new reporting rules will apply to both new and existing QOZs and QOZBs for tax years beginning after the date of enactment, and those entities will need to collect and report substantial new information that has never before been required.

REIT Structuring, Real Estate Benefits

The real estate investment tax structure remains an effective way to structure certain real estate activities with only one layer of tax.

The OBBBA raises from 20% to 25% the portion of the gross asset value of a REIT that may be attributable to equity and debt securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries, effective for tax years beginning after 2025. The change should provide added flexibility.

In addition, the OBBBA allows the completed contract method of accounting for many residential condominium, construction, and sale projects, effective for contracts entered into after July 4, 2025.

For residential developers that meet the average annual gross receipts test under Section 448 ($31 million in 2025), the maximum estimated contract length is increased from two to three years to qualify for the exception from the UNICAP rules under Section 263A.

Planning considerations: This provision provides much-needed tax relief to condo developers who had to report income under the percentage-of-completion method, which often required reporting income before receiving payment.

Allowing the use of the completed contract method of accounting allows better matching of reporting taxable income with the receipt of cash by the developer.

Unfortunately, the relief is provided only prospectively for contracts entered into after the July 4, 2025, enactment date.

Therefore, taxpayers with contracts entered into before the enactment date will continue to be subject to the old rules.

Moreover, reporting income for projects begun in prior years may be bound to the prior method of accounting.",https://www.cbia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Tax-Analysis_092518.png,N,,2025-12-30 11:12:42.418750

The Phillips Rd project is poised to qualify for New York’s Value of Distributed Energy Resources (VDER) compensation mechanism under Case 15-E-0751, with an estimated first-year average rate of US$0.0971/kWh. This VDER rate ensures fair compensation for clean energy delivered to the grid, reinforcing the project’s financial and environmental viability.

The Project is also expected to qualify for incentives under NYSERDA’s NY-Sun program and federal Investment Tax Credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025.

Upon securing permits and financing, PowerBank will commence construction, with the project set to operate as a community solar initiative. This innovative model enables renters, businesses, and homeowners to subscribe to the solar farm, receiving bill credits and savings without installing on-site equipment. By feeding clean energy directly into the local grid, the Project offers an accessible pathway for New Yorkers to embrace the clean energy transition.

PowerBank’s proven expertise, with over 100 MW of completed projects and a development pipeline exceeding 1 GW, underpins the projects’ execution. Strategic partnerships and institutional-grade development capabilities position PowerBank to deliver reliable, high-impact renewable energy solutions.

The Phillips Rd project advances New York’s path to 10 GW of solar by 2030. The State leads the United States in community solar capacity, having achieved the New York State Climate Act 6 GW solar goal in the fall of 2024.

There are several risks associated with the development of the Project. The development of any project is subject to receipt of a community solar contract, receipt of required permits, the availability of third-party financing arrangements for the Company and the risks associated with the construction of a solar power project. In addition, governments may revise, reduce or eliminate incentives and policy support schemes for solar power, which could result in future projects no longer being economic. Please refer to “Forward-Looking Statements” for additional discussion of the assumptions and risk factors associated with the Projects and statements made in this press release.

By contrast, 20 other states still follow the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.

In Utah, people who party too heartily — and get caught driving drunk — could be among the first to have their driver's licenses striped red with the label: “No Alcohol Sale.”

And motorists in Georgia could become the first to display their patriotism via the stylings of President Donald Trump with a special “America First” vehicle license plate.

The first of the year brings with it a variety of new state laws, including some that appear to contain first-of-their-kind policies, programs or procedures.

Here's a look at some of the new laws taking effect:

The first tourism tax for the earth

Many cities and states impose special taxes on hotel stays and vacation rentals. Hawaii will become the first state to hike its tourist lodging tax specifically to help cope with the effects of a changing climate.

State officials hope to use the proceeds from the additional 0.75% daily room rate tax for projects like replenishing sand on eroding beaches or removing invasive grasses similar to those that fueled a deadly wildfire on Maui in August 2023. Officials estimate the so-called “Green Fee” will generate nearly $100 million annually.

“As an island chain, Hawaii cannot wait for the next disaster to hit before taking action. We must build resiliency now,” Democratic Gov. Josh Green said while signing the legislation earlier this past year.

`ID please' — no matter your age

Utah's already strict alcohol laws are getting even stricter. As part of a new law intended to keep alcohol away from some people convicted of drunken driving, restaurants and bars will be required to check the identification of every customer, regardless of age, before serving or selling them alcohol.

People convicted of “extreme driving under the influence” — defined as a blood alcohol content of at least 0.16% or one of several other factors — must surrender their driver's licenses. Any replacement ID will bear a prominent red stripe on the front alongside the words, “No Alcohol Sale.” Judges also will have the discretion to impose the restriction for lesser offenses, and anyone wanting to shun booze can voluntarily obtain a red-striped ID.

“While this isn’t completely bulletproof in terms of ensuring that somebody that’s alcohol-restricted isn’t going to drink, it just makes it more difficult for them,” said Republican state Rep. Steve Eliason, sponsor of the legislation.

State-branded insulin for sale

California is targeting high prescription drug prices by getting into the business itself. It will become the first state to sell affordable insulin under its own label.

The sales come nearly three years after Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a partnership with the nonprofit Civica to sell state-branded generic drugs at lower prices. The “CalRx” brand of insulin pens will be available at a recommended price of $11 per pen, or a maximum of $55 for a five-pack.

Newsom also signed legislation this past year that will require large health insurers to start capping insulin copayments at $35 per month.

A minimum wage tops $17 an hour

An annual inflationary adjustment will raise Washington's statewide minimum wage to $17.13 an hour, making it the first state to exceed the $17 threshold.

Others aren't too far behind. The statewide minimum wage will rise to $16.94 an hour in Connecticut and $16.90 and California.

Some cities will have even higher minimum wages. The rate will rise to $21.30 an hour in Seattle and $21.65 in its suburb of Tukwila, Washington.

At least a dozen states will have minimum wages of $15 or more, including new rates set by voter-approved ballot measures in Missouri and Nebraska. By contrast, 20 other states still follow the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.

Patriotic plates for the road

New specialty vehicle license plates in Georgia will display an image of the American flag with the words “America First.” The plate will cost $90 the first year and $55 to renew, compared to $20 yearly for a standard license plate.

The new license plate gives people an opportunity to “show your support for President Trump and his movement with every mile you drive,” said Republican state Sen. Steve Gooch, who sponsored the legislation.

“No other state has passed it,” Gooch said. But “I predict other states will copy our legislation next year.”

Several other states also are introducing new patriotic license plates timed to the nation's 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Michigan will have a new red, white and blue license plate. South Carolina will have a liberty flag plate with the words, “Where the Revolutionary War Was Won.” Pennsylvania got a head start on the celebration earlier this year, printing a “Let Freedom Ring” license plate featuring the Liberty Bell.

(Nasdaq: NUAI) (“New Era” or the “Company”), a developer and operator of next-generation digital infrastructure and integrated power assets in the Permian Basin, today issued the following statement responding to the civil complaint (the “Lawsuit”) recently filed by the State of New Mexico Attorney General and the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division:

“The New Mexico Lawsuit is a baseless and uninformed attack on our Company and on our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, E. Will Gray II. We will aggressively defend New Era and its leadership in Court against these false allegations.

We urge our investors and other stakeholders to take note of the following:

We believe the allegations in the Lawsuit do not relate to any assets that would have a meaningful impact on our near-term business or operations. As announced on December 23, 2025 we entered into a binding agreement to acquire Sharon AI’s 50% ownership interest in Texas Critical Data Centers LLC (“TCDC”), our flagship 1+ gigawatt hyperscale data center development located in Ector County outside Odessa, Texas. We are focused on bringing TCDC under a single ownership structure and entering the next phase of development of this Texas-based facility. Our focus is on our digital infrastructure business and driving value for our investors.

In particular, the 87 wells referenced in the Lawsuit are immaterial to our current business. These wells no longer align with the Company’s business model, and we were already in the process of divesting them, in line with our focus on our digital infrastructure business.

We believe the Lawsuit contains myriad factual errors and misstatements. As the legal process plays out, we look forward to refuting the Lawsuit’s allegations in further detail. For now, we want to make crystal clear that we do not intend to allow any misrepresentations to stand unaddressed.

The Attorney General and the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division made no attempt to contact us. Had the plaintiffs reached out to us, we would have answered their questions. They provided us with no opportunity to refute what we believe are inaccuracies and falsehoods contained in the Lawsuit.

Neither New Era, nor Chairman and CEO Will Gray, have ever been affiliated with Acacia Operating Company, LLC or Acacia Resources, LLC, nor did New Era or Will Gray scheme to defraud the State. This fact alone renders a large part of the Lawsuit’s theory about supposed “schemes” involving New Era and Will Gray meaningless.

New Era has contributed meaningfully as a corporate citizen in the state of New Mexico. New Era, through its operating entity Solis Partners, has already spent more than $10 million on New Mexico state taxes and with local businesses through operations since the Company’s inception. Just last month, we entered into a land option purchase agreement for approximately 3,500 acres in Lea County, New Mexico, intended for the development of a large-scale seven-gigawatt hyperscale AI data center campus.

The bottom line is that New Era will not be distracted by misguided attacks. We will continue to execute our business plans and work to deliver value for all our stakeholders. We look forward to providing further updates on our core business as we continue to announce key milestones on our Ector County data center complex.”

Dec 30 (Reuters) - Tesla deliveries were expected ‌to ​fall in the fourth quarter, as ‌the loss of U.S. tax credits and rising global competition sapped demand even as ​the company rolled out cheaper versions of its best-selling electric vehicles.

The decline would follow plummeting sales in the first two quarters of ‍the year when CEO Elon Musk faced ​a backlash for his political rhetoric. Third-quarter sales got a boost as buyers rushed to lock in tax credits ​before they expired ⁠in September. Still, Tesla is likely to report its second straight drop in annual deliveries, with this year's decline steeper.

In October, Tesla launched stripped-down versions of the Model Y SUV and Model 3 compact sedan called Standard. It will face competition from affordable EVs made by Chevrolet and Ford, which are expected to hit the market over the next two ‌years.

Analysts expect Tesla's sales to recover next year, as the Standard versions, priced about $5,000 below previous base models, ​help ‌the company defend volumes in Europe ‍and Asia, where ⁠Chinese EVs are gaining ground.

The company is expected to report fourth-quarter and annual production and delivery numbers on Friday.

NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE SALES HURT

Investor enthusiasm in Tesla largely rests on Musk's pivot to expanding robotaxis, producing humanoid robots, and improving self-driving technology in its cars. Still, EV sales generate much of its current revenue.

Tesla is expected to deliver 432,810 vehicles in the December quarter, down about 13% from a year earlier, according to analysts polled by Visible Alpha (VA). Another consensus of 20 analysts compiled by Tesla and released ​on Monday shows that a sharper drop of 15% to 422,850 vehicles is expected.

Tesla's full-year deliveries were expected to be 1.65 million vehicles this year, down 7.8% from a year earlier, marking the second consecutive annual decline, according to Visible Alpha's poll.

The fall will be driven largely by sales in North America and Europe, Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu said in a note.

MUSK MAY BE MORE FOCUSED IN 2026

The slowdown in sales has not dampened a rise in the company's share price. Tesla shares rose over 14% this year, boosting Musk's wealth. Facing criticism for running a cost-cutting arm of President Donald Trump's administration, Musk has indicated he will focus on his businesses.

A recent court ruling cleared the way for Musk to reclaim ​a Tesla pay package that had been voided by a Delaware court. Shareholders in November also approved a new compensation package that could be worth roughly $878 billion over the next 10 years for the world's richest person.

Delivering 20 million vehicles in total is a key goal for that pay along with other milestones ​on robotaxi expansion, robot sales and valuation.

The draft permit would allow a PureField subsidiary to inject up to 1.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into deep rock formations in Russell County over a 12-year period. The emissions would come from the company’s nearby ethanol facility and be transported by pipeline to a Class VI injection well drilled roughly 3,500 feet underground.

If finalized, the permit would mark the first approval of its kind in Kansas, signaling growing federal support for carbon sequestration projects tied to biofuels. The EPA’s review found that the targeted storage zone is separated from drinking water supplies by thousands of feet of dense rock layers, reducing the risk of contamination.

The California connection

For PureField, the project is designed to lower the carbon intensity of its fuel, a key requirement for selling into premium markets such as California’s low-carbon fuel program. Federal tax incentives, including credits for carbon capture and clean fuel production, have become central to the economics of such projects.

Relevant: From Corn To CO2: How The Midwest Is Powering The Carbon Capture Drive

Kansas is not alone in exploring underground carbon storage. The EPA is reviewing additional applications from ethanol producers in the state, reflecting a broader Midwest push to pair agriculture-based fuels with climate technology. Ethanol plants are considered particularly attractive candidates for carbon capture because fermentation produces a relatively pure stream of carbon dioxide, keeping costs lower than in other industrial settings.

Nationally, carbon capture has gained renewed attention as policymakers look for ways to cut emissions without shutting down existing industries. Projects are already operating in Illinois and North Dakota, while new pipeline networks are emerging to move carbon dioxide across state lines for storage or enhanced oil recovery.

The Kansas proposal fits into a wider U.S. effort to scale carbon sequestration, an approach many energy analysts view as essential for meeting long-term climate goals while sustaining domestic fuel production.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/getty-images-Dp6juePDgoA-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 11:02:04.333952

Steady income remains the sector’s primary draw, with consistent distribution growth and share buybacks supporting investor sentiment as the market looks ahead to 2026.

In 2025, energy infrastructure companies navigated a tough outlook for oil. Meanwhile, natural gas demand growth took center stage. It was fueled by the rapid buildout of artificial intelligence (AI) data centers and U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export capacity. The sector continued to execute on dividend growth and opportunistic buybacks as companies generated free cash flow.

These were the five top-read stories on energy infrastructure in 2025:

The Permian Basin is best known for oil. However, the production mix within the basin has been shifting as natural gas production grows faster than crude. This piece explained how midstream companies capitalize on this growth with robust M&A activity and the construction of new processing plants and long-haul pipelines.

2. Charting Annual MLP Distribution Changes & Performance

Distribution growth represents a key tailwind for Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs). This article examined the historical relationship between year-over-year distribution changes and index performance for the Alerian MLP Index (AMZ). That capped, float-adjusted, cap-weighted index serves as the leading measure of energy infrastructure MLPs. As charted in the piece, MLPs tend to perform well when distributions are growing. More broadly, quarterly dividend recaps tend to be widely read (3Q25 recap here).

3. Energy Transfer Seizes Data Center Growth Opportunities

U.S. power demand growth, largely driven by AI data center buildout, continued to be a key theme this year. In a November webcast, Energy Transfer (ET) VP of Investor Relations Bill Baerg detailed how the midstream giant is leveraging its extensive pipeline network to secure high-return contracts with hyperscalers. Baerg highlighted a new project to supply Oracle’s (ORCL) facilities in Abilene, Texas. He noted that ET’s vast footprint is uniquely positioned to provide the 24/7 natural gas supply that AI data centers require. A broader update on midstream and the AI data center boom from September was also widely viewed (read more).

4. Sizing Up the Next Wave of U.S. LNG Export Projects

The U.S. LNG industry is growing rapidly, with export capacity projected to roughly double by 2031 based on sanctioned projects alone. This piece from September discussed the latest wave of Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) for major projects from Cheniere (LNG) and Venture Global (VG). The note also detailed timelines for upcoming projects. It explained how growing export capacity creates opportunities for the midstream companies connecting natural gas production to export terminals.

5. 2026 Midstream/MLPs: Company-Level Tailwinds Amid Macro Clouds

After relatively muted performance for energy infrastructure companies in 2025, investor attention has shifted to the outlook for 2026. This piece discussed the cautious outlook for oil next year and company-level strengths. Despite the challenging macro backdrop, midstream companies are positioned to deliver moderate EBITDA growth, continue growing dividends, and utilize buybacks as they generate free cash flow.

Bottom Line

The most-read content of 2025 reflected ongoing interest in the growth opportunities for midstream related to rising natural gas demand. Specifically, the ongoing buildout of U.S. LNG export capacity and power demand, particularly for data centers, remained in focus. Despite oil weakness, the midstream sector’s ability to provide reliable dividend growth remained a primary attraction for investors throughout the year.

“It was even more aggressive than we anticipated,” Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School, said of the administration’s attack on the climate.
And the Trump administration has shown it’s happy to go well beyond the letter of Project 2025.
Project 2025 called for breaking up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, but not NCAR.
Trump’s attack on climate science and action has also created a permission structure for companies and other governments to backslide.","Calling 2025 a disaster for the environment and renewable energy would be an insult to disasters. For the climate, 2025 was the equivalent of taking one of those rivers polluted enough to stand on, lighting it on fire and then driving a dodgy Amtrak train packed with scientists, puppies and nuclear waste into that river.

Funny enough, flaming rivers helped inspire the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970. Fifty-five years later, President Donald Trump’s EPA has all but dropped “Environmental Protection” from its name, thus fulfilling yet another prophecy of the satirical news site The Onion and also the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025. The latter might sometimes read like bleak satire, but it’s actually a deadly serious playbook for dismantling the regulatory state to make life easier and more lucrative for polluters of all kinds, especially the fossil-fuel companies whose products are heating the planet.

When running to get back into the White House last year, Trump denied any knowledge of Project 2025. You might want to sit down for this: He might not have been entirely truthful. Since taking office on Jan. 20, his administration has diligently carried out Project 2025’s commands, executing hundreds of actions to undermine renewable energy, environmental protection and climate science at home and abroad.

“It was even more aggressive than we anticipated,” Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School, said of the administration’s attack on the climate. “Project 2025 seems to be a pretty accurate blueprint for what’s happening.”

The Sabin Center has been tracking the regulatory rollback and lists 293 discrete events since Inauguration Day that have undermined environmental policy. It’s a valuable resource, but it’s not complete. Another tracker, from the nonprofit group Climate Action Campaign, lists some actions the Sabin Center omits. And that list is also not complete! Bloomberg Opinion has sporadically been tracking these actions, too, including a timeline published in March. And we’ve found some events not listed in those other trackers.

To mark the welcome end of this annus horribilis, we’ve put together another graphic, which you can see below, meant to visualize just how extreme this year has been. The graphic includes just 180 of the lowlights, mainly for aesthetic purposes. But hopefully it still provides a sense of how Trump’s lieutenants woke up each morning asking Project 2025 and the fossil-fuel industry that is essentially running the White House just how high they needed to jump that day.

One big question after a year like this is just how much meat is left to be picked off the climate carcass in 2026. Quite a lot, actually. Much of Project 2025’s wish list has been fulfilled, including the essential repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act, the gutting of regulatory agencies and the erasure of climate science and even language from government literature. America’s climate clock has been turned back decades. But there’s still more work to do before we achieve “burning rivers” status.

And the Trump administration has shown it’s happy to go well beyond the letter of Project 2025. On Dec. 16, the 331st day of Trump’s presidency, Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget — and a Project 2025 co-author — announced plans to end the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the nation’s top climate lab. Project 2025 called for breaking up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, but not NCAR. This is extra.

Trump’s attack on climate science and action has also created a permission structure for companies and other governments to backslide. Climate commitments made when the political waters were more inviting have been tossed aside at the first sign of turbulence. Even as they fail to meet their own temperature goals and watch tipping points like the mass death of coral reefs unfold, decision-makers worldwide are burning more coal, making fewer electric vehicles, softening their ambitions and shirking new commitments. Many justify this in the name of a false energy “pragmatism,” which promises everything will be fine, but we need just one more hit of fossil fuels to get by.

Everything will not be fine. Not at this rate. No matter what government scaffolding the Trump administration manages to dismantle next, the destructive fire lit in Washington is already spreading across the country. Americans will increasingly feel the loss of environmental protections, scientific expertise and new energy supplies at a time of soaring demand.

“A lot of what was done this year will come home to roost for people next year,” said Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director with the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit group that has also been keeping track of Trump’s attacks on science. “This is the moment where the reality of these cuts will become very real and put a lot of people in danger and the economy at risk.”

TORONTO, Dec. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ - PowerBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN) (Cboe CA: SUNN) (FSE: 103) (""PowerBank"" or the ""Company""), a North American energy infrastructure developer and asset owner, is pleased to announce a new 2.1 MW solar project located on a closed landfill in upstate New York, known as Phillips Rd (the ""Project"").

The Company secured site control on the Project in the form of a land lease and received positive results through its Coordinated Electric System Interconnection Review (CESIR) and now can proceed to permitting with local authorities.

The Phillips Rd project is poised to qualify for New York's Value of Distributed Energy Resources (VDER) compensation mechanism under Case 15-E-0751, with an estimated first-year average rate of US$0.0971/kWh. This VDER rate ensures fair compensation for clean energy delivered to the grid, reinforcing the project's financial and environmental viability.

The Project is also expected to qualify for incentives under NYSERDA's NY-Sun program and federal Investment Tax Credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025.

Upon securing permits and financing, PowerBank will commence construction, with the project set to operate as a community solar initiative. This innovative model enables renters, businesses, and homeowners to subscribe to the solar farm, receiving bill credits and savings without installing on-site equipment. By feeding clean energy directly into the local grid, the Project offers an accessible pathway for New Yorkers to embrace the clean energy transition.

PowerBank's proven expertise, with over 100 MW of completed projects and a development pipeline exceeding 1 GW, underpins the projects' execution. Strategic partnerships and institutional-grade development capabilities position PowerBank to deliver reliable, high-impact renewable energy solutions.

The Phillips Rd project advances New York's path to 10 GW of solar by 2030. The State leads the United States in community solar capacity, having achieved the New York State Climate Act 6 GW solar goal in the fall of 2024.

There are several risks associated with the development of the Project. The development of any project is subject to receipt of a community solar contract, receipt of required permits, the availability of third-party financing arrangements for the Company and the risks associated with the construction of a solar power project. In addition, governments may revise, reduce or eliminate incentives and policy support schemes for solar power, which could result in future projects no longer being economic. Please refer to ""Forward-Looking Statements"" for additional discussion of the assumptions and risk factors associated with the Projects and statements made in this press release.

These transactions are a result of several months of detailed compliance efforts, capital raising, debt repayment, intellectual property restructuring, and other key agreements, carried out for the purpose of complying with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act requirements to not become a prohibited foreign entity. Trina Solar’s equity holdings have never exceeded the 25% FEOC equity limits under the OBBBA. In addition, to further bolster the Company’s compliance position, T1 has amended its certificate of incorporation to provide certain limits on FEOC equity ownership. T1 Energy raised significant capital in late 2025 and has used some of that capital to make a substantial debt repayment to Trina Solar. As a result, the percentage of T1 debt held by Trina Solar is below the FEOC compliance threshold set by the OBBBA. T1 and Trina Solar have entered into an agreement that removes Trina Solar’s previous right to appoint a covered officer. After careful analysis and diligence, T1 does not believe it has any agreements that would render T1 a FEOC pursuant to OBBBA “effective control” provisions. T1 previously licensed certain patents and other intellectual property from Trina Solar. Trina Solar recently sold that intellectual property to Evervolt Green Energy Holding and as a result T1 now licenses such intellectual property from Evervolt. After conducting diligence on Evervolt, T1 believes that Evervolt is not a FEOC. After conducting supply chain diligence, T1 has purchased solar cells for use in a portion of its solar modules to be produced in 2026 from a supplier that has provided certifications of its non-FEOC status, and is undertaking diligence to ensure the remainder of cells for use in 2026 will be certified as non-FEOC. T1’s efforts to build a domestic supply chain, including domestic cells to be produced at T1’s G2 facility, domestic polysilicon from Hemlock Semiconductor, domestic wafers from Corning, and domestic steel frames from Nextpower are expected to further bolster T1’s ongoing material assistance compliance efforts.

Dec 30 (Reuters) - deliveries were expected to fall in the fourth quarter, as the loss of U.S. tax credits and rising global competition sapped demand even as the company rolled out cheaper versions of its best-selling electric vehicles.

The decline would follow plummeting sales in the first two quarters of the year when CEO Elon Musk faced a backlash for his political rhetoric. Third-quarter sales got a boost as buyers rushed to lock in tax credits before they expired in September. Still, Tesla is likely to report its second straight drop in annual deliveries, with this year’s decline steeper.

In October, Tesla launched stripped-down versions of the Model Y SUV and Model 3 compact sedan called Standard. It will face competition from affordable EVs made by Chevrolet and Ford, which are expected to hit the market over the next two years.

Analysts expect Tesla’s sales to recover next year, as the Standard versions, priced about $5,000 below previous base models, help the company defend volumes in Europe and Asia, where Chinese EVs are gaining ground.

The company is expected to report fourth-quarter and annual production and delivery numbers on Friday.

NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE SALES HURT

Investor enthusiasm in Tesla largely rests on Musk’s pivot to expanding robotaxis, producing humanoid robots, and improving self-driving technology in its cars. Still, EV sales generate much of its current revenue.

Tesla is expected to deliver 432,810 vehicles in the December quarter, down about 13% from a year earlier, according to analysts polled by Visible Alpha (VA). Another consensus of 20 analysts compiled by Tesla and released on Monday shows that a sharper drop of 15% to 422,850 vehicles is expected.

Tesla’s full-year deliveries were expected to be 1.65 million vehicles this year, down 7.8% from a year earlier, marking the second consecutive annual decline, according to Visible Alpha’s poll.

The fall will be driven largely by sales in North America and Europe, Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu said in a note.

MUSK MAY BE MORE FOCUSED IN 2026

The slowdown in sales has not dampened a rise in the company’s share price. Tesla shares rose over 14% this year, boosting Musk’s wealth. Facing criticism for running a cost-cutting arm of President Donald Trump’s administration, Musk has indicated he will focus on his businesses.

A recent court ruling cleared the way for Musk to reclaim a Tesla pay package that had been voided by a Delaware court. Shareholders in November also approved a new compensation package that could be worth roughly $878 billion over the next 10 years for the world’s richest person.

Delivering 20 million vehicles in total is a key goal for that pay along with other milestones on robotaxi expansion, robot sales and valuation.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/trkd-images/LYNXMPELBT0DY_L.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 06:58:49.892864

About T1 Energy T1 Energy Inc. (NYSE: TE) is an energy solutions provider building an integrated U.S. supply chain for solar and batteries.","AUSTIN, Texas and NEW YORK, Dec. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- T1 Energy Inc. (NYSE: TE) (“T1,” “T1 Energy,” or the “Company”) announced that today it has concluded a series of transactions with Trina Solar and other parties intended to allow T1 to continue its eligibility in 2026 for Section 45X tax credits. These transactions are a result of several months of detailed compliance efforts, capital raising, debt repayment, intellectual property restructuring, and other key agreements, carried out for the purpose of complying with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) requirements to not become a prohibited foreign entity (commonly referred to as a “Foreign Entity of Concern,” or “FEOC”).

“Looking to 2026 and beyond, we expect to continue executing our strategy to manufacture FEOC-compliant, high-domestic content, high efficiency, and technologically advanced solar energy products for our customers,” said Chairman and CEO Dan Barcelo. “We plan to give our customers what they want: domestic solar modules from a traceable and reliable solar supply chain.”

T1 would like to provide an update on how the Company has addressed major FEOC compliance requirements.

Equity

Trina Solar’s equity holdings have never exceeded the 25% FEOC equity limits under the OBBBA. In addition, to further bolster the Company’s compliance position, T1 has amended its certificate of incorporation to provide certain limits on FEOC equity ownership.

Debt

T1 Energy raised significant capital in late 2025 and has used some of that capital (together with shares of Common Stock) to make a substantial debt repayment to Trina Solar. As a result, the percentage of T1 debt held by Trina Solar is below the FEOC compliance threshold set by the OBBBA.

Appointment of Covered Officers

T1 and Trina Solar have entered into an agreement that removes Trina Solar’s previous right to appoint a covered officer.

Effective Control

After careful analysis and diligence, T1 does not believe it has any agreements that would render T1 a FEOC pursuant to OBBBA “effective control” provisions.

Intellectual Property

T1 previously licensed certain patents and other intellectual property from Trina Solar. Trina Solar recently sold that intellectual property to Evervolt Green Energy Holding Pte Ltd. (“Evervolt”) and as a result T1 now licenses such intellectual property from Evervolt. After conducting diligence on Evervolt, T1 believes that Evervolt is not a FEOC.

Material Assistance

After conducting supply chain diligence, T1 has purchased solar cells for use in a portion of its solar modules to be produced in 2026 from a supplier that has provided certifications of its non-FEOC status, and is undertaking diligence to ensure the remainder of cells for use in 2026 will be certified as non-FEOC. T1’s efforts to build a domestic supply chain, including domestic cells to be produced at T1’s G2 facility, domestic polysilicon from Hemlock Semiconductor, domestic wafers from Corning, and domestic steel frames from Nextpower are expected to further bolster T1’s ongoing material assistance compliance efforts.

With recent WOTUS rule changes being rolled out by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), questions remain across rural America about what the updated definition of Waters of the United States means for producers—and whether these changes could be locked in for the future. To better understand the implications, we caught up with Ethan Lane with the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association (NCBA) to discuss the regulatory landscape and the potential for codifying the new rule language.

Lane explained that the current situation is shaped heavily by recent Supreme Court decisions that significantly narrowed federal authority compared to past administrations.

“So I think it’s more complicated than that, and actually for once, to our benefit, right? Because you have the Sackett decision in the Biden administration, it really narrowed the scope when you combine that with the Chevron deference decision, the struck down Chevron deference. Take those two things, and you look at what’s possible in a regulatory space on WOTUS, and it is a tenth of what it was in the Obama years, right, and the original sort of scope of WOTUS.”

According to NCBA, these court rulings fundamentally changed the regulatory universe surrounding WOTUS, limiting how expansive future interpretations can be.

“We’re in such a different universe now. The Biden administration was forced to accept a definition that was much less expansive than they would have liked. That Supreme Court decision ensured that.”

Lane noted that the EPA’s current efforts aim to refine and stabilize the rule, rather than expand it.

“This is really an effort by Lee Zeldin, Administrator Zeldin at EPA, to button up that last 10% and make sure that this definition works for producers everywhere, that we don’t have anybody that falls through the donut hole on congressional intent versus legal interpretation. This should bring that to a conclusion.”

One of the biggest benefits for producers, Lane said, is reduced uncertainty across future administrations.

“And I think the benefit of that is in future administrations, there’s going to be far less room for them to monkey around with it because of that Supreme Court decision.”

He added that any significant expansion of federal authority would now require congressional action.

“They’re the ones that are now going to have to go get a statutory change in order to open up more room for them to gobble up more authority over farmer’s property.”

Ultimately, NCBA views the current moment as a positive step for cattle producers nationwide.

“If the enviros want to come back in and re-litigate this thing down the road, they’re going to need to go to the United States Congress and they’re going to need a statutory change to really do much in this space. That’s good news for producers around the country.”

“EV sales have slowed down in the short term, but the trend is there.” Others think 2025’s EV sales dip could deal a bigger blow to the industry, especially with new ZEV registrations down 40 per cent in the third quarter.
The Canadian Automobile Dealers Association has argued that it cannot meet EV sales targets set by the federal government, which are currently under review.
Other countries, like China, which saw EV sales jump 21 per cent from January through November, will reap those benefits.
“There has been this floor in terms of EV sales that has stuck,” said Zhang.","A 32 per cent year-on-year drop in zero-emission vehicle sales in the first three quarters of 2025 has sparked concern that weak EV demand could derail Canada’s emissions-reduction goals.

National zero-emission vehicle registrations, a proxy for sales, have been on a downward trend throughout much of the year, according to Statistics Canada, in stark contrast to the global upswing in every other major region outside of North America. Some Canadians see that as a sign that the country isn’t doing enough to spur adoption, while others believe Canada’s tough economic position requires a new approach to decarbonization.

Daniel Breton, CEO of Electric Mobility Canada, said Canada’s “topsy turvy” year shouldn’t be seen as a message about EV popularity. Rather, he said it has more to do with the U.S.-led global trade war and the abrupt end to federal EV purchase incentives in January, which the government has promised to bring back for months but have yet to materialize. Breton said some consumers are waiting to buy EVs and are confused why the rebates have taken so long to return. The industry association recently estimated that there are now more than 1 million EVs on Canadian roads, up from just 18,000 a decade ago.

“To say that the EV transition is not happening, or that Canadians are not interested. That’s false,” said Breton. “EV sales have slowed down in the short term, but the trend is there.”

Others think 2025’s EV sales dip could deal a bigger blow to the industry, especially with new ZEV registrations down 40 per cent in the third quarter. The Canadian Automobile Dealers Association has argued that it cannot meet EV sales targets set by the federal government, which are currently under review. Charles Bernard, the group’s chief economist, said some dealers are overloaded with extra EVs they couldn’t sell this year after consumers scrambled to take advantage of the disappearing rebates at the end of last year. Online car marketplace AutoTrader found in a survey in February and March that 42 per cent of non-EV owners were considering an EV for their next car, down from 68 per cent in 2022.

“Over the last two years, those consumers that really were looking to get an EV, they bought it when the incentive program was in full force, especially in provinces like Quebec,” said Bernard.

That mirrors patterns in other countries that dropped incentive programs. EV sales in Germany fell 27 per cent when the country killed its incentive program, said Baris Akyurek, vice-president of insights and intelligence at AutoTrader. U.S. sales are expected to drop sharply through the end of the year after EV tax credits ended.

“Now that we are going through what we’re going through macroeconomically,” said Akyurek, “consumers are kind of hitting the brakes.”

The EU has recently eased its EV targets slightly, and Bernard argued that the Canadian government should consider focusing on reducing vehicle emissions with hybrids or more fuel-efficient vehicles from Europe or South Korea, rather than just EV sales.

But Arthur Zhang, who works with the Canadian Climate Institute to measure the country’s progress toward climate goals, said it would be a missed opportunity for Canada to abandon the transition away from gas guzzlers, since many drivers could save money on future fuel costs by switching to these vehicles now. Other countries, like China, which saw EV sales jump 21 per cent from January through November, will reap those benefits.

“There has been this floor in terms of EV sales that has stuck,” said Zhang. “This is really a moment where we can assess: ‘What are currently the barriers for EV adoption? And how can governments reorient their programs to be focused on addressing those key problems?’”",https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Photo_Yorkdale_EV_showrooms-Toronto-May_2022-P_Justin_Greaves-TheLogic-1920x1280-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 07:58:10.550807

The relentless, escalating threat to human health and safety that was once the main driver of clean energy policy?

You’d be forgiven if it’s all a bit hazy, given how swiftly the term was dropped from the energy-transition lexicon this year.

Starting on Inauguration Day, President Donald Trump not only eviscerated climate policy but completely upended the way Americans talk about energy. Though Trump seemed more concerned with taking down ideological rivals than helping constituents’ bottom lines, his new lexicon got a boost from consumer concerns about soaring energy prices that had people casting around for quick fixes. Climate change was out. Talk of ​“energy dominance,” ​“energy abundance,” and ​“unleashing American energy” rushed in. The shift was like ​“6-7” taking over a fourth-grade classroom: inexorable and irresistible.

The new terminology made the scene on Trump’s first day back in the White House, when he signed an executive order with a grab bag of fossil-fuel giveaways under the title ​“Unleashing American Energy.” A few weeks later, he used another executive order to create the National Energy Dominance Council. Both orders touted the country’s ​“abundant” resources.

Clean energy advocates quickly began invoking similar terminology in an attempt to shoehorn solar power into the new narrative. The Solar Energy Industries Association even passed out stickers with the phrase ​“energy dominance” on Capitol Hill as part of its lobbying efforts.

Some media outlets followed suit in deemphasizing climate. In November 2024, five major U.S. newspapers published a total of 524 stories about climate change; in the same month this year, those papers ran just 362 climate change articles, according to researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder — a drop of almost a third. (Both numbers are way down from the October 2021 peak of 1,049 climate articles.)

A number of Democratic politicians embraced the vibe shift in their own ways. ​“All of the above” crept in among leaders — notably New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey — who wanted to signal they are open to the changing conversation, but not ready to give up on renewables entirely. In New Jersey and Virginia, Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger ran successful gubernatorial campaigns with hardly any mention of climate change; likewise, New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani spent little time on the topic.

Most notably, Democrats this year prioritized the issue of energy affordability, an increasingly urgent concern among voters — and one that Trump is belligerently dismissing.

Two liberal groups, Fossil Free Media and Data for Progress, put out a memo in November that endorses this affordability focus, suggesting it’s a way for Democrats to reconcile the new discourse with the old. The memo encourages them to promote the benefits of renewable energy as a cheap source of power in 2026. The headline: ​“Don’t run from climate — translate it.”

Though Republicans are failing to reckon with the issue of soaring energy costs, there’s still something seductive about their energy rhetoric. It suggests an economy teeming with possibility, held back only by those meanie Democrats with their snowflakey concerns about climate and their insufficient will to dominate. The language implies there are easy answers to at least some of our woes. Worried about soaring energy bills? Unleash the beautiful coal. Concerned about grid reliability? Exploit those abundant energy supplies. Never mind that fossil fuels are most definitely not the cheapest sources of electricity.

The vocab shift, particularly around ​“dominance,” also captures a vibe that has always appealed to Trump supporters: ​“That language does have this bravado and machismo that is important to his movement,” Cara Daggett, a professor of political science at Virginia Tech, told a reporter for Grist earlier this year.

What vocabulary will seize the collective imagination in 2026? Likely, more of the same (though Trump does have a seemingly inexhaustible ability to surprise us all with word choices). The bigger question for me, though, is which version of this new nomenclature will gain the most traction in the months to come. Will the left’s translations catch on, convincing people that clean energy too can be unleashed, abundant, and affordable? Or will the fossil fuel–loving MAGA crowd continue to corner the enticingly muscular language of supremacy?",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2224614127.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=7f8a55881cadf3ba981c9fff2f4287a9,N,,2025-12-30 04:12:52.959118

Several cases have been dismissed while others advanced through court systems, with some being considered before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2026. Critics of the litigation call it “woke lawfare” and an attempt to force progressive political policies through the judicial system.

Critics also argue the lawsuits threaten U.S. energy independence and, depending on outcomes, will have sweeping impacts on every American.

Here are some of those cases:

• Chevron USA Inc. v. Plaquemines Parish, La.: On Jan. 12, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Plaquemines Parish, La., vs. Chevron USA. The case questions to what extent a state court can litigate against an oil company for its production of oil even if it obtained federal permits to produce the oil.

The litigation challenges activities of the oil companies dating back to World War II in some cases. Chevron argued the lawsuit was flawed, claiming that the activities in question were permitted, legal and often conducted under federal direction — particularly those tied to national security during World War II.

A Plaquemines Parish jury in April ordered Chevron to pay $744 million in damages for its role in the degradation of the state’s coastal wetlands. Environmental activists celebrated the verdict. It was the first of 42 lawsuits filed since 2013 by parishes across coastal Louisiana to go to trial.

The Trump administration’s Justice Department stepped in on Chevron’s side, urging the Supreme Court to move the case from state court to federal court.

Business groups and energy advocates warned the verdict will drive jobs and investment out of Louisiana. The Louisiana Association of Business and Industry called the decision “shortsighted,” saying it would “brand Louisiana as a state that will extort the most recognizable companies on earth for billions of dollars, decades later.”

O.H. Skinner, executive director of Alliance for Consumers, told the Center Square the case seeks to score large settlements from the energy industry and stop oil production.

“The case arises from a broader campaign of woke lawfare in which activists and municipal governments seek to use courtrooms to determine what companies are allowed to produce and what consumers can buy,” Skinner said.

• Suncor Energy Inc. v. Boulder: The nation’s highest court is still deciding whether it will hear arguments in Suncor Energy Inc. v. Boulder; a case to decide whether state and local governments can use nuisance laws to sue energy companies for activities that may cause climate change.

The case, originating in Colorado, centers around a city of Boulder and Boulder County lawsuit in state court against Suncor Energy claiming it misled the public in its activities that the local governments claim led to climate change effects.

Lawyers for Suncor Energy argue that allowing a case like this one to play out goes against protections in the Clean Air Act that prevent lawsuits from occurring against emitters from across state lines.

“Public nuisance can’t be used for global problems. It can be used for local problems,” Skinner told The Center Square. “That’s what it’s supposed to be used for.”

However, Skinner said many organizations that are pursuing climate change litigation are seeking to bankrupt energy companies with large monetary settlements. He said litigants will likely attempt to drain energy companies of their resources and use the funds to advocate certain ideological causes.

“These are highly ideological dark-money-funded, multi-faceted legal campaigns to bankrupt an entire industry and confiscate it for ideological reasons,” Skinner said.

• City and County of Honolulu v. Sunoco: Similarly, in 2020, City and County of Honolulu v. Sunoco was one of the first examples of public nuisance lawsuits pursued in a state court. The city and county of Honolulu filed a lawsuit in 2020 accusing oil and gas companies, including Sunoco, Exxon Mobil, BP, Chevron and Shell, of misleading the public for decades about the dangers of climate change induced by burning fossil fuels.

The companies asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene in the case, but the court, without ruling on the merits, declined to do so in January.

While the case is based in Hawaii, Skinner said litigants there hope it will have far-reaching effects across the country.

“They’re not trying to stop behavior just in those states,” Skinner said. “The thing that really freaks me out is how people in regular, everyday, real America are going to potentially be affected.”

• The People of the State of California v. Exxon Mobil Corp.: Going a step further than Boulder and Honolulu, California Democrat Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a complaint against ExxonMobil in 2024 for what he says are its contributions to “the deluge of plastic pollution” affecting the state.

Exxon countersued, alleging “Bonta and the U.S. Proxies — the former for political gain and the latter pawns for the foreign interests — have engaged in a deliberate smear campaign against ExxonMobil, falsely claiming that ExxonMobil’s effective and innovative advanced recycling technology is a ‘false promise’ and ‘not based on truth,” the American Tort Reform Foundation reported.

One of the foreign interests is IEJF, an Australian nonprofit that’s connected to an Australian mining company “that competes with ExxonMobil in the low carbon solutions and energy transition markets, ATRF reported.

Skinner said the litigants in this case are attempting to significantly reduce plastic use throughout the state of California and potentially beyond.

“That’ll make your average person’s life dramatically harder, and it’ll make a lot of things a lot more expensive, and it’ll make having kids, like, brutal,” Skinner said.

• Leon v. Exxon Mobil Corp.: Aside from monetary settlements, petitioners in this case are seeking wrongful death claims against energy companies for their contributions to climate change. The case stems from a woman in Washington state who said her mother died from heat-related illness due to the exacerbated effects of climate change.

She is suing energy companies for their alleged creation of conditions during a period of decades that led to increased temperatures on the day her mother died.

Skinner told The Center Square this case is one of the more blatant examples of ideology affecting the way a litigant pursues cases.

“I think they care because a death is worth a lot of money,” Skinner said. “The climate homicide cases are one of the more far-fetched legal theories I’ve ever seen, because you’re leveling this incredibly staggering charge.”

Climate cases will continue to move through the court system, with one to be heard before the U.S. Supreme Court early in the year.

Skinner is urging the U.S. Supreme Court and lower courts to rule in favor of energy companies across the country.

“We want the energy companies to win, not because they are perfect actors, but because the alternative is that our lives are governed day in and day out by woke trial lawyers, woke (nongovernmental organizations) and local governments,” Skinner said.",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.heraldstaronline.com/images/2016/08/19083717/fbLIKE.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 07:58:27.305225

Despite Farmington's reputation for fossil fuels production in the oil- and gas-rich San Juan Basin, Farmington Electric Utility installed two high-efficiency engines at Bluffview Power Plant this month and is planning to break ground on a 4 megawatt AC solar facility with 12 megawatt-hours of battery storage next year.

""Our goals were based on reliability, low cost energy for our customers and environmental benefit,"" said Hank Adair, director of Farmington Electric. ""And one of the pieces of generation to be added in our portfolio was some reciprocating internal combustion engines, or RICE engines, as they're called.""

The new equipment will produce a combined 18 MW, or enough energy to power roughly 14,000 homes across the utility's service area, which includes a total of 46,000 metered customers in Farmington, Bloomfield and Kirtland, as well as portions of Rio Arriba County and the Navajo Nation.

The engines were installed under a contract Farmington Electric struck in the fall of 2023 with Wartsila, a Finnish energy company, and are located inside a new building at the plant at 755 W. Murray Drive in Farmington.

While one new full-time employee was hired to manage the engines, a total of 80 contractors were hired to help install them and construct the new building they're housed inside, Adair said, explaining that many workers came from the surrounding region.

The engines are currently powered by natural gas pumped from the surrounding San Juan Basin, but they're also capable of burning renewable energy sources, such as biofuels, synthetic fuels or hydrogen blends. The engines are also more flexible, Adair added, allowing the utility to calibrate them based on fluctuating energy demands.

Before the coal-powered San Juan Generating Station, located between Farmington and Shiprock and co-owned by Tuscon Electric Power and Farmington Electric, was decommissioned in 2017, the city of Farmington and its Public Utility Commission began creating a roadmap that included the gradual introduction of renewables into its existing energy portfolio.

""I think we reconcile it as what our governance and what our community would love to see,"" Adair said of the difference between renewable and non-renewable energy sources in the region. ""Our focus, again, is for reliable, low-cost energy generation and a sound portfolio, so we balance all that. I don't think they're at odds. I think this utility looks for what is the best fit at the time to meet all of our needs, right?""

A ribbon cutting for the RICE engines is set for Jan. 14 from 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.

The journey, undertaken earlier this year by three GM engineers, took them from Southeast Michigan to San Francisco and back, covering diverse terrains, climates, and driving conditions that cannot be fully replicated through simulations. The team used two pre-production electric vehicles — the Cadillac OPTIQ luxury crossover and the GMC Sierra EV pickup truck — both equipped with Super Cruise, GM’s advanced hands-free driver assistance system.

The GMC Sierra EV towed a fully loaded cargo trailer throughout the trip, enabling engineers to study how the vehicle’s range estimation system adapts under trailering conditions. According to the team, the real-time range prediction feature performed beyond expectations, accurately showing remaining battery range with and without the trailer attached.

The expedition was led by Tony Kraatz, a quality engineering manager, along with software engineers Max Schwinghammer and Chris Cline, all based near GM’s Warren Technical Center. Kraatz said the journey offered valuable firsthand exposure to real-world use cases, including navigation updates, trailering features, and Super Cruise performance in less predictable driving scenarios.

Both vehicles were equipped with advanced monitoring equipment, allowing the engineers to observe vehicle software behavior in real time. This setup proved crucial when the team identified an issue at a public DC fast-charging station, where the Cadillac OPTIQ was charging at unexpectedly slow speeds. Further analysis revealed a software error in the charger’s code, which was promptly reported and corrected by the charging network operator.

By the end of the round trip, the team had logged 2,987 kWh of energy consumption across 32 DC fast-charging stops, while Super Cruise was engaged for approximately 4,100 miles of the journey in the GMC Sierra EV, even while towing the trailer.

Meanwhile, although recent federal action has given automakers some breathing room with respect to the electric vehicle (EV) mandate imposed by California and other zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) states, regulatory uncertainty and other state regulatory requirements seem likely to continue to impose hidden costs on consumers for the sale of new cars.

Committee Hearing to Focus on EV Mandates

In his announcement about the upcoming hearing titled, “Pedal to the Policy: The Views of the American Auto Industry on the Upcoming Surface Transportation Reauthorization,"" committee chair Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) observed that the average price for a new car in the United States rose modestly between 2000 and 2010, from $20,356 to $24,296, but has increased sharply since 2010 and now exceeds $50,000. The committee has invited the heads of General Motors, Stellantis, and Ford, together with a Tesla executive, to testify at the hearing that will, according to Sen. Cruz, “examine how radical global warming regulations and mandated technologies have driven up the cost of vehicles for American consumers.”

Sen. Cruz also alluded in his announcement to recent legislative changes enacted by the U.S. Congress in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. These changes included the repeal of Biden-era emissions requirements imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards imposed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for model year (MY) 2027 and later vehicles. Meanwhile, the White House announced on December 3, 2025, that the Trump Administration intended to “reset” CAFE standards, claiming the prior administration “imposed unrealistic fuel economy targets that effectively resulted in an electric vehicle (EV) mandate.” In a parallel announcement that same day, NHTSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for amendments that would substantially reduce CAFE standards for MY22-31 vehicles.

Regulatory Uncertainty and State Regulation Impose Hidden Costs

While proposed changes to federal emissions and CAFE standards would give automakers breathing room, OEMs continue to face considerable regulatory uncertainty with respect to EV mandates. In early 2025, congressional Republicans invoked the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to reverse a decision by the EPA during the Biden Administration to waive the preemptive effect of the federal Clean Air Act. That waiver would have allowed California to adopt, among other things the Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II) regulatory regime, which would have required the complete phaseout of the sale of new gas-powered vehicles in California—and other ZEV states that chose to follow California’s lead—by 2035.

California and a coalition of 10 states filed a lawsuit challenging Congress’s authority to reverse the EPA’s waiver shortly after President Trump signed the CRA resolutions into law in June 2025. Industry participants—including the Alliance for Automotive Innovation and the National Automobile Dealers Association, trade associations representing the interests of OEMs and dealers, respectively—sought to intervene in the litigation, arguing their members would suffer harm if the EPA’s preemption waiver were reinstated, particularly “in light of California’s threat that it will retroactively enforce the ACC II regulations as to vehicles already sold and as to model years already past, should it be successful in this litigation.” A hearing on the federal government’s motion to dismiss set for late January 2026, but in the meantime, the automotive industry must assume the increased cost of regulatory uncertainty while it awaits the outcome of the legal and political battle over EV mandates.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15875_2214.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 05:12:54.746928

“This 50 by 50, that’s a needle mover,” Morrisey said during an end-of-the-year press conference last Monday.
The comprehensive energy policy being developed around 50 by 50 will also include a transmission plan.
The comprehensive energy policy will also include 25-year strategic development for each source of energy in West Virginia.
West Virginia is one of 12 states and Washington, D.C., which are part of PJM.","CHARLESTON — Gov. Patrick Morrisey set a goal nearly six months ago for West Virginia to triple its electric-generating capacity, but the comprehensive plan is still in the works with a public comment period now closed. The West Virginia Office of Energy sought public comment and recommendations as it works on developing a comprehensive energy policy around Morrisey’s 50 by 50 energy initiative. The public comment period opened on Dec. 9 and closed last Friday. According to the office, 71 public comments were submitted by Friday’s deadline. During speeches in August in White Sulphur Springs and Wheeling, Morrisey unveiled his 50 by 50 initiative aimed at increasing base load electric generating capacity in the state from just under 16 gigawatts to 50 gigawatts by 2050. “This 50 by 50, that’s a needle mover,” Morrisey said during an end-of-the-year press conference last Monday. “West Virginia needs to be America’s energy state … and to really be a driver of America’s energy renaissance.” According to the solicitation for public comments, the Office of Energy said Morrisey’s 50 by 50 initiative will be an all-of-the-above energy, focused on traditional fossil fuel sources (coal, natural gas), and also include nuclear energy, hydrogen power, and renewable energy sources (wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric). The comprehensive energy policy being developed around 50 by 50 will also include a transmission plan. “It will address the need for sufficient electricity transmission lines and natural gas transmission pipelines to support the increase in baseload electricity generation,” according to the Office of Energy’s solicitation for public comment. “It will also recommend locations for the placement of natural gas pipelines and electricity transmission lines in locations throughout the state that lack sufficient access and in areas where access to increased supplies of electricity or natural gas will spur manufacturing or other economic development.” The comprehensive energy policy will include an energy security plan in order to protect against blackouts and other disruptions, and prevent potential threats to the electrical grid, such as cyber-attacks. This plan will include inventories of energy sources in the state and critical infrastructure; developing emergency protocols and coordination plans between local, state and federal agencies; and conducting tabletop exercises and other scenario planning. The comprehensive energy policy will also include 25-year strategic development for each source of energy in West Virginia. These plans will focus on expanding electrical generation, infrastructure expansions, economic development incentives, site development, legislation and rule-making, workforce development, education, financial and tax incentives, safety, environmental mitigation, and energy security. Since October, there have been several natural gas power plant projects announced that would add an additional five gigawatts to what is produced by the state’s power plants, including projects announced by FirstEnergy and a partnership between Kindle Energy, GE Vernova, Blackstone, and Wolf Summit Energy. Morrisey’s 50 by 50 initiative and the comprehensive energy policy being developed by the Office of Energy is focused on making West Virginia the battery of the east coast and making the state more appealing to energy-intensive data center and AI projects. House Bill 2014, a new law first proposed by Morrisey, is aimed at attracting high-impact industrial businesses and data centers to West Virginia along with microgrids to power the data centers using both fossil fuels and renewable energy generation. The rules governing these new data center and microgrid districts are still awaiting approval from the Legislature, with the Legislative Rule-Making Review Committee slated to review these proposed rules next month. “We’re going to be leveraging the intersection between energy and technology,” Morrisey said last week. “We’re excited about that and we’re going to keep going. We’re working on finalizing those plans. That’s been a big, big project.” West Virginia only has one natural gas-fired power plant that provides electricity to retail customers in the PJM market, a regional electric transmission organization that operates a competitive wholesale electricity market in the northeast. West Virginia is one of 12 states and Washington, D.C., which are part of PJM. The state has nine coal-fired power plants, with coal-fired power accounting for 86% of West Virginia’s total electricity net generation. In its public comment filing, the West Virginia Coal Association argued that existing coal-fired power plants should be prioritized as the foundational assets of the state’s power grid to ensure reliability and economic stability. “West Virginia’s nine existing coal-fired power plants represent ‘premium assets’ in this age of increased power demand and should serve as the fundamental building block of any plan to increase generation within the State of West Virginia,” wrote West Virginia Coal Association President Chris Hamilton. In its public comments, the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce advocated for a free-market approach that balances environmental stewardship with the practical needs of the state’s business community. The chamber expressed strong support for a diversified power generation strategy that utilizes both traditional fossil fuels and renewable resources to ensure grid reliability. “The chamber applauds the goal of the plan to develop new generation capacity utilizing a combination of natural gas, nuclear, coal, geothermal, solar, and wind,” wrote West Virginia Chamber of Commerce President Steve Roberts. “The resource rich opportunities that West Virginia has need to be harnessed for growth of the state’s economy for the benefit of all its citizens.” West Virginians for Energy Freedom, a coalition of groups that advocate for electric ratepayers, submitted public comments calling for any comprehensive energy policy to prioritize consumer autonomy and protections that protect ratepayers for bearing the financial costs for expanding electric generation. The group called for allowing ratepayers to purchase power from nearby customers, use of plug-in solar systems, and removing caps on net metering solar credit programs. “Without taking a position on the wisdom of tripling energy capacity in 25 years, we caution that, if West Virginia ratepayers or taxpayers would be required to pay for any of power plants built under this plan, there be guarantees and protections in place to ensure that the plants will be useful and beneficial for West Virginians,” the organization wrote.

How far along is Akron in meeting the requirements of the consent decree?
The $265 million treatment plant is the final project, which Akron has been trying to remove from the decree for years.
If the plan is approved, the city will save hundreds of millions of dollars in the process.","Akron may be one step closer to saving nearly $230 million while still fulfilling the requirements of its water treatment consent decree.

The city presented a plan to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency to update its Cuyahoga Street Storage Facility for about $30 million rather than build a new $265 million “enhanced high-rate treatment” facility (EHRT), the last step in the massive, $1 billion Akron sewer project.

“We have been able to successfully model to the Ohio EPA that we can and will meet our water quality standards due to the significant amount of work our Akron Waterways Renewed team has put into overhauling our system,” Mayor Shammas Malik said in a press release.

The city’s plan has not been approved by the state yet, but the state’s top environmental body has issued a draft change to the city’s National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) that allows public review and comment for 30 days.

The consent decree mandate has forced the city to almost totally redesign its wastewater facilities and processes to upgrade its 100-year-old sewer system, once notorious for dumping massive volumes of sewage into the Cuyahoga River during heavy rains. The new system has cost the city and taxpayers more than $1 billion, which is largely paid by ratepayers and long-term, low-interest loans.

This year, the city faced outcry about a planned $15 monthly rate hike, which will be implemented in 2028. If the city’s plan to eliminate the last stage of the sewer project is approved by the federal district court overseeing the consent decree, that rate hike would likely go away.

How far along is Akron in meeting the requirements of the consent decree?

Akron has made substantial progress in meeting the consent decree requirements, completing 24 of 26 mandated projects, with the Northside Interceptor Tunnel slated to be in use by the end of 2026. The $265 million treatment plant is the final project, which Akron has been trying to remove from the decree for years.

If the plan is approved, the city will save hundreds of millions of dollars in the process.

“We are hopeful that this potential change to our Permit will be the next step in eliminating the EHRT from our consent decree,” Malik said in the release. “At the conclusion of these projects, we expect to be capturing and treating 99% of all wet weather flows and annually keeping approximately 2.4 billion gallons of untreated wastewater out of our waterways.”

Since Mongabay-India’s inception, we have been reporting about green jobs.
But, fewer than one in five people in the age group have a full understanding of the different career paths for breaking into green jobs, and what a green job can be, says the Global Green Skills Report 2024.
One of the unexpected places where we found green jobs was in the film and entertainment industry.
Awareness about green jobs is also uneven, and many aspirants don’t know what opportunities exist or how to prepare for them.","Green jobs are not new, but what counts as a green job is evolving. Typically tied to renewable energy or sustainability roles, the term now captures a broad spectrum of roles that contribute to environmental protection, restoration, or adaptation.

According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), green jobs are “decent jobs that contribute to preserve or restore the environment”, whether in established industries such as manufacturing and construction or emerging ones such as renewable energy and energy efficiency.

In today’s context, this definition encompasses everything from solar technicians and electric vehicle specialists to environmental engineers and jobs in climate finance, ESG reporting, and nature-based solutions. It also includes roles that may not seem traditionally “green”, such as community environmental workers or disaster management personnel, but are linked to climate resilience.

Since Mongabay-India’s inception, we have been reporting about green jobs. In 2017 we wrote about how India’s push for renewable energy will generate more jobs, particularly in villages. In the following years, we analysed whether the renewable energy sector would be able to provide the capacity of jobs needed for the transition away from fossil fuel jobs, we looked at the scale of solar energy needed to accommodate the shift from coal mining jobs and at how jobs in the decentralise renewable energy sector are projected to increase.

Almost a decade later, we are still talking about green jobs to document their evolution and the aspirations of the new entrants into the workforce.

By 2030, Gen Z (born between 1997 and 2012) will be a third of the workforce. But, fewer than one in five people in the age group have a full understanding of the different career paths for breaking into green jobs, and what a green job can be, says the Global Green Skills Report 2024.

In the mini-series we launched in 2025, we examined how green jobs are expanding and are not limited to the energy sector or to the discourse around transitions.

Green jobs now encompass a wide spectrum of roles from high-tech sectors to grassroots work and community engagement, ranging from highly technical to creative roles. With climate mitigation being one of the major trends reshaping businesses in the next five years, demand for relevant roles is likely to go up. Young people entering the workforce are also looking at this sector for financial promise and long-term job security.

While the aim for this series was to inform, we also wanted to inspire action and reflection. ‘Green jobs’ are more than a buzzword now; they are part of India’s climate response and future workforce strategy.

Finding green jobs in unexpected locations

In our story on how people are navigating the green labour market, we found that young aspirants are often inspired by climate goals but struggle to find clear pathways into meaningful work. Organisations are still figuring out how to define and advertise new roles, and training programmes have yet to align fully with hiring needs. Yet, there are pockets of support mushrooming to clear the pathways into this sector.

Going further into this series, we picked up certain areas of work that are not traditionally seen as “green” sectors such as renewable energy but are closely linked to disruptions in the environment and climate change. Our piece on an evolving workforce around disaster management showed how disaster response and resilience roles, typically a part of public administration or humanitarian work, are increasingly connected to environmental change and climate risk. These roles stretch from early warning systems and AI-based risk mapping to community counselling and long-term recovery. This story reminded us that green jobs can be both technical and human-centred.

One of the unexpected places where we found green jobs was in the film and entertainment industry. In an industry that is far from being ‘green’, a small community of people are working to scale the sustainability mountain. Former film professionals, engineers, and designers are turning entrepreneurs to mitigate the industry’s growing impact on the climate.

In the article on how reel and real stories create impact, we highlighted how professionals are carving out roles as sustainability consultants, renewable-energy advisors and circular-economy entrepreneurs on film sets. These jobs barely existed a few years ago and may not yet be part of formal hiring pipelines, but people are taking small, determined steps to reduce diesel use, reuse sets, and cut waste, effectively creating opportunities where none previously existed.

Who is being left behind?

The stories also touched upon access and motivation with regards to green jobs. In the renewable energy sector, for example, while there’s a lot of talk about new job creation, studies show a gap between the demand for workers, the available supply, and who actually gets the jobs. Awareness about green jobs is also uneven, and many aspirants don’t know what opportunities exist or how to prepare for them.

Gender differences also emerge when talking about what drives someone to a green job – men are more likely to cite the sector’s growth and rising investments as key motivators, finds a report on women in climate careers in India. Women, on the other hand, more often highlight concern for the planet, future generations, health, and personal experiences with climate change.

As this series continues to explore the various aspects of green jobs and their evolving nature, we hope it offers food for thought for new entrants to the workforce as well as people making a career switch, with a starting point to dig deeper and find their place in a greener, more resilient future.",https://imgs.mongabay.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2025/12/29170926/AP25275619529125.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 01:58:20.098527

By Max Khabur | The solar industry’s rapid evolution is a story of innovation, fierce competition, and dramatic exits. As countries move toward decarbonization and grow the share of renewable energy in the total energy mix, the commercial solar panel sector has seen both meteoric rises and sudden declines among its most prominent brands. The major implication? The replacing the discontinued solar panel brands, when they near the end of their useful life, supports the growth of today’s solar aftermarket.

“I’d put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don’t have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that.” – Thomas Edison.

Solar light to electricity conversion

The sunlight that hits a square foot of any surface carries 127 W of energy. The ideal solar panel would convert 100% of this energy into electricity.

The history of commercial use of solar energy began in the mid-20th century, when Bell Labs introduced the first practical silicon PV cell, boasting a then-revolutionary 6% efficiency. By the late 1950s, companies like Hoffman Electronics had pushed efficiencies to 14%, sparking commercial interest and laying the groundwork for the solar industry’s future.

In 2025, solar panel efficiency continues to break new ground. LONGi has launched a solar panel with a remarkable 24.8% efficiency and a maximum power output of 670 W. These efficiency gains not only demonstrated the technical feasibility of solar power but also ignited commercial and governmental interest, setting the stage for the industry’s rapid historical development.

From pioneering innovation to global expansion

The 1970s energy crisis marked a turning point. Governments and corporations, eager for alternatives to fossil fuels, accelerated solar R&D. ARCO Solar emerged as a trailblazer, becoming the first company to produce 1 MW of PV modules in a single year by 1980. Meanwhile, Japanese firms such as Sharp and Kyocera established themselves as global leaders, driving advancements in efficiency and reliability.

The 1990s saw a surge in investment, with brands like SolarWorld facilitating the adoption of crystalline silicon panels across Europe. In the United States, initiatives like the “One Million Solar Roofs” program further fueled demand for commercial solar solutions.

Market shifts and the fall of industry icons

The 2000s ushered in a new era of innovation, with thin-film technologies and high-efficiency modules from companies like First Solar and SunPower. This period also saw the rise of Chinese manufacturing, which dramatically lowered costs and intensified global competition.

By the 2010s, many established brands struggled to adapt. BP Solar, a committed player since the 1980s, exited the market in 2011. Solyndra, once celebrated for its unique cylindrical panels, filed for bankruptcy the same year amid unsustainable production costs. Other notable departures included Evergreen Solar, Schott Solar, and SolarWorld, each leaving a legacy of technological advancement and market expansion.

Remembering the brands that shaped the industry

Despite their market exits, these discontinued brands made significant contributions to the solar industry. BP Solar was instrumental in advancing crystalline silicon technology and helped establish early commercial markets. Solyndra’s innovative cylindrical solar panels, though commercially unsuccessful, demonstrated the potential for alternative PV designs. Evergreen Solar contributed to cost reduction initiatives and manufacturing process improvements.

The list of discontinued solar panel brands is long and storied, featuring names such as Uni-Solar, HelioVolt, and Abound Solar, etc. Their stories offer valuable lessons on the importance of innovation, adaptability, and strategic foresight in a rapidly changing market.

Bluewater, a leading USA second-life solar equipment player, posted the full list of discontinued solar panel brands and their timelines.

The exit of these major players created both challenges and opportunities in the solar industry.

The aftermarket opportunity: A new chapter for solar

As more legacy panels reach the end of their service lives, the need to replace discontinued brands is supporting the aftermarket for solar components and services. Custom-sourcing matching solar panels ensures the continued performance of existing solar installations. The services of companies such as Bluewater improve the longevity and sustainability of installed solar plants, while also driving further adoption of solar energy by making upgrades and replacements more accessible.

L&F's shares slumped early Tuesday after the South Korean battery-material maker sharply reduced the value of its previous contract with electric-vehicle giant Tesla.

The company's stock fell as much as 12% to 92,700 won, equivalent to $64.57, in Seoul trading, on course for its sharpest daily decline in two months. The benchmark Kospi was last down 0.5%.

L&F said after Monday's market close that the value of a 2023 multiyear contract with Tesla had shrunk to just $7,386 from $2.91 billion due to a change in supply volume.

Under the deal, L&F had agreed to supply high-nickel cathode materials to Tesla and its affiliates from early 2024 through late 2025.

L&F's drastic write-down of the deal value occurred amid Tesla's slower-than-expected sales of Cybertruck EVs and its struggles to boost EV battery production after the Trump administration ended U.S. tax credits for new EV purchases.

South Korea's battery sector has been hurt by sluggish demand from EV makers and battery cell manufacturers.

Earlier this month, South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solution said that its previous multibillion-dollar contracts with Ford Motor and Freudenberg Battery Power Systems had been canceled.

Another Korean battery supplier, SK On, also said it had ended its joint venture with Ford in the U.S. this month.

Released this month, the biennial report, known as a greenhouse gas inventory, is the first to estimate the effects of the recent federal rollbacks on Colorado’s climate action plan.
“In terms of our GHG emissions trajectory, the impact is not as large as I feared it might be,” Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, said in an interview.
Its trajectory towards the next target, a 50 percent cut by 2030, is similarly about two years behind schedule, at least for now.
While the rate of growth has slowed, annual carbon emissions have continued to rise globally, reaching another all-time high in 2024.","When Colorado Democrats took full control of state government nearly seven years ago, one of the party’s top priorities in the General Assembly was the passage of a climate action plan that would commit the state to the ambitious cuts to greenhouse gas emissions recommended by climate scientists.

House Bill 19-1261, signed by Governor Jared Polis in 2019, marked the first time Colorado had codified greenhouse gas targets in state law — and the end of calendar year 2025 is the deadline to meet the first of the goals, a 26 percent reduction in statewide emissions compared to 2005 levels.

Colorado will fall short of that goal.

That outcome has been all but certain for the last few years, as the state struggled to achieve the needed cuts, especially when it came to vehicle emissions, and state officials have previously acknowledged their efforts to meet the 2025 goal were at least a year behind schedule. The target slipped further out of reach this year as President Donald Trump’s administration and Republicans in Congress rolled back an array of clean energy incentives, including tax credits for electric cars and home heating upgrades.

Still, Colorado’s top energy official said he was “pleasantly surprised” by the findings of the state’s latest comprehensive emissions report. Released this month, the biennial report, known as a greenhouse gas inventory, is the first to estimate the effects of the recent federal rollbacks on Colorado’s climate action plan.

“In terms of our GHG emissions trajectory, the impact is not as large as I feared it might be,” Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, said in an interview. “What the latest inventory shows is that it basically pushes us back (another) year.”

That means the state now expects to meet its 2025 target — about 103 million tons of carbon emissions, a 26 percent cut from about 140 million tons two decades ago — in 2027. Its trajectory towards the next target, a 50 percent cut by 2030, is similarly about two years behind schedule, at least for now.

“There’s a lot of uncertainty about what the federal government is going to do in the future,” Toor cautioned. “There is a lot more work that we’re going to need to do to make sure that we are accurately capturing the effects of all of the attacks on clean energy … from the Trump administration.”

Colorado’s approach

Climate scientists have warned that to avert the most catastrophic impacts of global warming, governments around the world must cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by midcentury.

The world is badly off track to meet those targets. While the rate of growth has slowed, annual carbon emissions have continued to rise globally, reaching another all-time high in 2024.

Colorado’s emissions peaked around 2010 and had declined by about 16 percent from 2005 levels as of 2023, the latest year for which historical estimates are available, according to the new inventory.

Polis’ administration has embraced what it describes as a “whole-of-government approach” to climate action, pursuing a wide range of policies across different emissions sectors and regulatory bodies, including the Public Utilities Commission, the Department of Transportation, the Air Quality Control Commission and the Energy and Carbon Management Commission.

That approach hasn’t been without its critics among climate and environmental advocates, who warned as early as 2020that the state wasn’t doing enough to meet its 2025 and 2030 goals. Advocates have been repeatedly left frustrated by the scope and ambition of the Polis administration’s climate regulations, especially at the AQCC.

U.S. Senator Michael Bennet, a Democratic candidate for governor in 2026, on Dec. 9 announced a climate plan centered on a “cap-and-invest” program, reviving a proposal that some influential advocacy groups had hoped to enact through the AQCC after HB-1261’s passage seven years ago.

A separate report released this month by a coalition of Colorado environmental groups emphasized the need for the state to make “strategic near-term capital investments” to get back on track with its emissions goals.

“Coloradans see the impacts of climate change firsthand, in the form of more intense drought, more frequent wildfires and longer hotter summers,” Stacy Tellinghuisen, deputy director of policy development with Western Resource Advocates, said in a briefing on the new report. “Those impacts translate into real costs, but taking action — enacting forward looking policies to address climate pollution — has benefits for equity, for affordability and for air quality.”",https://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2025-12-29 19:57:16.256495

Michigan saw $3 billion worth of disinvestment this year as companies scrapped planned EV factories or closed existing ones, according to the Atlas analysis.
Timelines and ambitions for numerous other EV and battery factory projects in Michigan have shifted amid the changing policies and market forces.
GM, for instance, sold its stake in a planned EV battery factory near Lansing to LG Energy Solution and the plant's planned opening has been delayed from 2025 to 2026.
And Ford has scaled back plans for an EV battery plant near Marshall, now slated to open in 2026.","At this time in 2024, Michigan was expecting a windfall of federal funds to fuel a transition to clean energy, along with billions of dollars' worth of green manufacturing projects subsidized by the Biden administration's signature climate spending bills.

But since President Donald Trump began his second term in January and began scrapping federal climate programs he refers to collectively as ""the green new scam,"" Michigan has seen a wave of project and grant cancellations, along with renewed investment in fossil fuel-based manufacturing and power generation.

Roughly $540 million in climate-related grants to Michigan have been canceled or held up since Inauguration Day, according to a national database compiled by Atlas Public Policy, while shifting market forces and the end of federal tax credits for electric vehicles have caused clean manufacturing investments in Michigan to whipsaw from billions annually in recent years to $3 billion in canceled investments this year.

""It certainly mirrors what we're seeing nationally,"" said Annabelle Rosser, a research analyst with the national firm.

Instead, Michigan automakers are scaling back and refocusing on gas and hybrid vehicle production — a trend emblemized by Ford's and General Motors' recent decisions to scrap EV production plans at Michigan plants and retool to produce gas-powered vehicles.

""That's just the way the market is shaking out right now,"" said Glenn Stevens, executive director of MichAuto, an affiliate of the Detroit Regional Chamber.

It's a trend likely to continue into 2026, as Trump administration officials continue their efforts to downplay climate change, deemphasize renewable energy and embrace fossil fuels.

Here's where things stand in Michigan as the year draws to a close:

Michigan has seen $540 million in canceled funding, with the biggest chunk coming from the Solar for All Program, a $7 billion US Environmental Protection Agency fund meant to expand solar energy in disadvantaged communities.

Michigan had been slated to receive a $156 million grant through that fund, while Native American tribes in the state were expecting part of a $62 million grant shared with other Great Lakes tribes.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has sued over the grant cancellations, joining 22 other states to argue the administration ""unilaterally and illegally terminated"" the program, overstepping checks and balances to cancel congressionally approved funding.

Beyond the solar program, the federal government has canceled or proposed to cancel more than 20 Michigan grants ranging from $31.7 million to help LuxWall Inc. build an energy-efficient window glass factory in Detroit to $14,000 for a west Michigan climate resilience project.

Other canceled grants include:

1. $28.2 million for TS Conductor to build a high-capacity power line plant in Erie

2. $20.4 million for Ecoworks, a Detroit nonprofit that planned to convert houses of worship into climate resilience hubs

3. $20 million for the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan toimprove energy efficiency in tribal homes

4. $20 million for the Southwestern Michigan Planning Commission to build two resilience hubs in Benton Harbor, upgrade energy efficiency in low-income housing and support a workforce development initiative

Smaller grants would have funded energy efficient housing in Kalamazoo, a climate change and resilience plan for the city of Flint and wild rice bed restoration in Michigan waterways.

The Trump administration has also frozen a $20 billion federal ""green bank"" network that had been expected to send hundreds of millions of dollars to Michigan to build and rehab housing across the state, insulate old homes and boost energy efficiency in factories.

Trump officials have signaled that more cancellations could be coming as they review tens of billions of dollars in clean energy funds awarded by the previous administration.

Michigan utilities, for example, are awaiting word on the status of $15 billion in clean energy-related loans announced days before Trump took office. And the Trump administration is reevaluating a grant program that awarded $500 million to retool a Lansing GM factory for electrified vehicles.

An exception to the administration's shift of resources away from Biden-era energy policies: It has continued making disbursements from a $1.5 billion loan authorized in 2024 to support the reopening of the Palisades nuclear power plant and in December announced another $400 million to develop two new reactors at the site.

""President Trump has made clear that America is going to build more energy, not less, and nuclear is central to that mission,"" US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a statement accompanying the grant announcement.

Spurred along by federal and state subsidies and regulations that encouraged automakers to build EVs and consumers to buy them, Michigan manufacturers announced a collective $23.8 billion in new investments tied to the energy transition between 2022 and 2024, mostly related to battery or EV plants.

Fast-forward to 2025, and the trendline has reversed. Michigan saw $3 billion worth of disinvestment this year as companies scrapped planned EV factories or closed existing ones, according to the Atlas analysis.

Spokespeople for the US Department of Energy, which has overseen efforts to reprioritize fossil fuels by shifting federal resources and loosening vehicle emissions regulations, did not respond to requests for comment from Bridge Michigan.

But Trump has routinely cast EVs as a costly ""scam"" while downplaying the effects of climate change caused by burning fossil fuels like gasoline. During a December announcement that his administration would loosen fuel economy standards applying to new vehicles, Trump cast his pro-gas policies as a win for consumers that would ""protect American jobs"" and shave ""at least $1,000 off the price of a new car.""

The biggest EV-related cancellation is the Gotion project, a once-planned $2.4 billion electric vehicle battery plant near Big Rapids that spent years embroiled in controversy before state officials declared the project dead this fall.

In that case, Rosser, the Atlas analyst, said, shifting federal policies weren't the only factor.

""The rollback of the (Inflation Reduction Act) clean energy tax credits, softening demand for electric vehicles, and concerns about the company's foreign ownership are all likely factors,"" Rosser said.

This fall, battery maker XALT Energy announced plans to close its Midland headquarters and an Auburn Hills facility just two years after announcing plans to spend a ""double digit million sum"" expanding the facility.

Automotive supplier Dana Inc., which had vowed to invest $54.2 million at an Auburn Hills EV battery plant by the end of 2024, instead announced this fall that it would close the plant amid an ""unexpected and immediate reduction in customer orders driven by lower demand for electric vehicles.""

Fortescue canceled an under-construction $210 million EV charger, battery and hydrogen generator plant at the former Fisher Body site in Detroit, citing shifting US markets and policies including the loss of ""critical tax credits.""

Other losses included the closure of an Akasol electric vehicle battery factory in Warren and canceled plans to build a TS Conductor high-voltage direct current conductor plant in Erie using a since-canceled $28 million federal grant.

TS Conductor is still building the plant, but switched locations to South Carolina after receiving what company CEO Jason Huang described as a ""very generous incentive package.""

Timelines and ambitions for numerous other EV and battery factory projects in Michigan have shifted amid the changing policies and market forces. GM, for instance, sold its stake in a planned EV battery factory near Lansing to LG Energy Solution and the plant's planned opening has been delayed from 2025 to 2026. And Ford has scaled back plans for an EV battery plant near Marshall, now slated to open in 2026.

Stevens said he expects the EV market to grow in 2026, but ""it's not going to be at the acceleration curve that a lot of people projected, and certainly the previous administration was pushing.""

(Reuters) — U.S. natural gas futures extended gains on Dec. 29 to hit a three-week high, after federal data showed storage levels in line with forecasts, as colder weather outlooks and record liquefied natural gas export flows boosted demand expectations.

Front-month gas futures for January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 6.7%, to $4.65 per million British thermal units, as of 12:32 PM ET, after hitting its highest level since December 10 earlier in the session.

Gas futures for February, which will soon be the front-month, were up about 3.1% to around $3.99 per MMBtu.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said energy firms pulled 166 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of gas out of storage during the week ended Dec. 19.

That was in line with the 168-bcf withdrawal analysts forecast in a Reuters poll and compares with a decline of 98 Bcf during the same week last year and an average withdrawal of 110 Bcf over the past five years (2020-2024).

""There is overall demand and if we continue to get cold weather, we could see those inventories drop even further. I think it's also reflective of the fact that we're getting cold weather and we're seeing record demand for exports,"" said Phil Flynn, senior analyst for Price Futures Group.

Meteorologists forecast a slight drop in temperatures nationwide through January 12, with Heating Degree Days rising from 398 on Friday to 412 on Monday, exceeding the near-normal level of 394.

Adding to bullish sentiment, average gas flows to the eight large U.S. liquefied natural gas export plants have risen to 18.5 billion cubic feet per day so far this month, up from a monthly record high of 18.2 billion cubic feet per day in November.

On a daily basis, LNG feedgas was set to reach a three-week high of 18.8 billion cubic feet per day on Monday driven primarily by increased flows to Cheniere Energy's 4.5-billion cubic feet per day Sabine Pass plant in Louisiana, which rose to about 5.1 billion cubic feet per day from an average of 4.9 billion cubic feet per day over the prior seven days, according to LSEG data.

Financial firm LSEG projected average gas demand in the lower 48 states, including exports, would fall slightly from 138.4 billion cubic feet per day this week to 135.8 billion cubic feet per day over the next week. The forecast for this week was higher than LSEG's outlook on Friday.

LSEG said average natural gas output in the lower 48 U.S. states climbed to a record high of 110.1 billion cubic feet per day in December, surpassing November's monthly record of 109.6 billion cubic feet per day.

California's ability to require the sale of EVs: gone. Federal rules about emissions and fuel economy — being rewritten. Federal penalties for car companies that sell too many gas guzzlers: zeroed out. The $7,500 federal tax credit? Kaput.

Meanwhile, automakers delayed or canceled a host of unprofitable EV plans.

The all-electric Ram 1500 REV was canceled before a single one was built. The all-electric Ford Lightning was discontinued despite some glowing reviews. (Both pickups will be replaced with extended-range electric vehicles, which come with both a big battery and a backup gas tank.)

The buzzy Volkswagen Buzz is still available in other countries, but no longer in the U.S. The GM Brightdrop van is no more. The list goes on.

As for sales? ""It's a roller-coaster ride,"" says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, who monitors EVs for the data and services company Cox Automotive.

Sales spiked in August and September, during the last weeks that the federal tax credit was available, as buyers rushed to take advantage of the expiring opportunity. Cox estimated EVs hit an all-time high of 11.6% of the new vehicle market in September. Then sales crashed by 50% in October.

But here's a twist.

""Among U.S. shoppers who are in [the] market for new vehicles, the interest in electric vehicles actually ticked up a bit after the tax credit went away,"" says Brent Gruber, who runs the EV practice at consumer insights company J.D. Power.

It's the EV story you might not have heard this year: Despite the political and product planning whiplash, consumer appetite for EVs has been on a very smooth ride.

Overall, about 25% of new car shoppers are very interested in buying an EV, according to J.D. Power surveys. And with minor fluctuations, ""it's held pretty consistent,"" Gruber says, despite what he calls the ""turbulence"" of this year.

""There's still a tremendous amount of interest,"" he says. ""And from an EV owner perspective, we continue to see high levels of satisfaction once people do get into those products."" In fact, EV owners are 94% likely to repurchase another EV for their next vehicle, he says.

BJ Birtwell runs the Electrify Expo, a traveling festival dedicated to EVs. He says EVs have suffered from being politicized, with a lot of right-of-center Americans rejecting them out of hand.

""There's still a cloud of skepticism around EVs across some parts of the country,"" he says. But put a skeptic behind the wheel of a new EV, he says, ""and I'll tell you what I see: Smiles for miles."" Test drives reveal the cars are fun to drive, he says, and a little research can show that charging at home is easier and cheaper than they thought.

An American slowdown

Still, while Americans remain interested in EVs, it's undeniable that battery-powered vehicles are taking off more slowly than industry execs expected a few years ago. That's not just because of the policy reversal; it's also because of market realities. For example, while charging might be easy at home, it's a hassle for apartment dwellers who don't have that option. Meanwhile, vehicle prices — a challenge for the entire auto market — are even higher for EVs. Lower fuel and maintenance costs can't always overcome that up-front sticker shock, even for people who are hypothetically interested in buying.

This slowdown will have global consequences for the environment and for human beings: It locks in higher carbon emissions and air pollution for years to come.

The legacy automakers, of course, have lost billions of dollars on the EV designs they've canceled or postponed. But the delay hurts more than just the big-name auto brands. A whole network of suppliers sell parts to the automakers, and they also bear the burden when plans change.

Ken O'Trakoun of RPM Partners works with auto suppliers in distress. ""The whiplash,"" he says, ""between demand going up and demand receding, it has impacted a number of suppliers."" They made investments in factories to supply automakers for vehicles that either aren't being made, or are being made at much lower volumes. ""It's pretty disruptive.""

The ""ripple effect"" from those suppliers ""creates impacts on jobs,"" Valdez-Streaty notes.

Automakers, too, have laid off or reassigned employees away from battery plants and EV production lines as part of their adjusted timelines.

A clear global trend

But while automakers are slowing their EV plans down significantly, they're not giving up on them, either.

Partly that's because of the enduring consumer interest; as long as there's a market, the automakers want to serve it. And partly that's because the automakers are all global companies. They want to be able to sell to the rest of the world, too.

""On a global scale, internal combustion engine cars already peaked back, like, eight or nine years ago,"" says Huiling Zhou, U.S. EV analyst for the research group BloombergNEF.

About one in four cars sold worldwide this year was electric, Zhou says — driven by China's remarkably fast embrace of those vehicles. And China, increasingly, is exporting cars around the world.

That means that the global market for cars that run on gas or diesel is shrinking, while the market for battery-powered cars is expanding — and China is dominating it.

If automakers want to compete around the world, they simply can't afford to get off the EV roller coaster.

The Rose Parade is right around the corner, and thousands of people are already preparing to flock to Pasadena for the New Year’s Day festivities.

In its 137th year, the parade theme is “The Magic in Teamwork,” with Laker icon Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson as the Grand Marshal. It kicks off at 8 a.m.

Whether you’ll be camping out the night before, or heading over with blankets in tow in the early morning hours, keep in mind that the weather is currently forecast to be rainy. Yes, that's rare. If it does pour on the parade it will be the first time in 20 years and before that it had been 50 years since the last rainy parade day.

Here’s what you need to know this year.

Parade details and closures

The Rose Parade route lasts two hours, with its 5.5-mile journey starting at Green Street and Orange Grove Boulevard.

The floats, bands, and horses will head north along Orange Grove at a slow but steady 2.5 mph pace before turning east onto Colorado Boulevard for a majority of the show. It’ll then head north onto Sierra Madre Boulevard, wrapping up at Villa Street.

Police and city officials will start closing off part of the route to cars as early as 6 p.m. Wednesday, Dec. 31, through 2 p.m. Thursday, Jan. 1.

That includes Colorado Boulevard from Orange Grove Boulevard to Sierra Madre Boulevard, and Sierra Madre Boulevard to Paloma Street. So if you’ll be hosting viewing parties or are overdue for a delivery, Tournament of Roses officials recommend telling everyone to arrive before the closures kick in Wednesday night.

If you’ll need to drive to or through the downtown Pasadena area, you can use:

Walnut Street or the 210 Freeway for east-west travel north of Colorado Boulevard

Del Mar Boulevard or Cordova Street for east-west travel south of Colorado Boulevard

There will be limited crossing for north-south travel during the closure (see map for details)

Please note: There will be a 5K race at midnight to celebrate the New Year from Pasadena Avenue to Hill Street. Several intersections will close to cross traffic at 11 p.m. Dec. 31 and re-open at the end of the race event at about 2 a.m., including Pasadena, Fair Oaks, and Marengo avenues (see full list on map.)

Tickets

You can still snag grandstand tickets — we found ones from $80 to $130, depending on where you want to sit. You’ll need to have your ticket handy.

The parade is scheduled to begin promptly at 8 a.m. Organizers recommend that ticketholders aim to be seated by 7 a.m. In order to do that, you should plan to arrive in the area by at least 6 a.m. to give yourself plenty of time to work through the crowds and traffic.

Note that there is a ""clear bags only"" policy in place for grandstand seating at the Rose Parade, the Rose Bowl game and several other events. You can find details here.

Curbside seating and camping

Curbside seating is free, and lots of people will set up shop and camp overnight, which is only allowed on Dec. 31. If you’ll be bringing your kids or teens along, they need to be with an adult during the overnight hours.

You can grab your sidewalk spot starting at noon Dec. 31, but all your blankets and chairs have to stay on the curb until 11 p.m., at which point you’ll be able to move up a bit closer to the blue “honor-line.” Tents, sofas, unoccupied chairs, and boxes that can be used as stools or seats are not allowed along the route.

You can warm up with a small elevated barbecue, but it needs to be away from buildings and you have to have a fire extinguisher available. Bonfires and fireworks are banned, period.

Most importantly, don’t forget to drink water and dress for cool temps and the possibility of rain. (You can always sit on that extra jacket).

Given the weather conditions, it's important to note that the rules call for no umbrellas. The City of Pasadena advisers parade goers to use rain jackets and ponchos, which they optimistically describe as ""a great alternative so everyone can enjoy the show!""

LAist's Sharon McNary, a longtime Pasadena resident who has offered great tips on making the most of the parade in the past, points out this might be a very popular year for what she calls ""The People’s Grandstand.”

That said, Sharon notes ""it’s kind of a locals-only institution. Fans create their own little wooden seats that fit nicely into the notches in the stones lining the sloped wall of the 210 Freeway overpass over Sierra Madre Blvd. In the rare rainy year, they have shelter, and in the more typical warm years, they have shade. And they get to view the spectacle of the taller floats folding themselves down to fit under the overpass and opening back up on the other side.""

Parking

There is no parking allowed on the parade route, but you can purchase reserved spots. Pasadena recommendations include Sharp Seating, the city itself, and LAZ Parking. Parking at Metro rail stations are another option you can check on before you head out.

Authorities urge that you pay for parking in advance to guarantee your spot. Otherwise, parking is on a first-come, first-served basis and of course that supply is limited.

Once again: Arriving extra early is your best bet so you can avoid the traffic hassles and any unintended GPS glitches. Authorities warn: ""Please do not rely upon your GPS as road closures will be in effect and may not reflect on the GPS application.""

All parking meters are free and time limits will not be enforced on New Year’s Day, and overnight parking restrictions will not be enforced until 2 a.m. Jan. 4, according to the city. But keep an eye out for red curbs, “No Parking” signs, fire hydrants, and driveways, as the usual restrictions still apply. You don't want to risk getting your vehicle towed.

Public transportation

Where possible, public transit might be your easiest way to go, and Metrolink will be offering special early morning hours on the San Bernardino, Antelope Valley, Orange County, Ventura County, and 91 Perris Valley lines for the parade. (Note that Metrolink’s Riverside County Line is not running on New Year’s Day.)

From the Metro website: ""On New Year’s Eve and early New Year’s Day (Dec. 31 to Jan. 1), we’ll be running service all night on the A, B, D and E Lines with additional early morning service to help get you to Pasadena on time for the parade, which begins at 8 a.m. sharp."" Metro will also have buses traveling to areas near the route and Rose Bowl game.

You can find more information here.

These are the A Line stations in Pasadena that closest to the parade:

Del Mar Station (walk .3 miles north to the parade route)

Memorial Park Station (walk .2 miles south)

Lake Station (walk .4 miles south)

Allen Station (walk .4 miles south)

Metro will also have buses traveling to areas near the route and Rose Bowl game, which you can find more information on here

Metro is offering free fares on buses, trains, Metro Bike Share and Metro Micro from 4 a.m. Dec. 31 until 3 a.m. Jan. 1. For Metro Bike Share, use code 123125 on New Year’s Eve. For Metro Micro riders, use promo code RING26.

Accessible viewing

Three street-level viewing areas are reserved for people with disabilities and up to four of their guests.

Each of those areas along the parade route will have a section with audio descriptions for visually impaired people and another with sign language interpreters.

Tickets to all these viewing areas are free! But to request space, you’ll need to complete a form. The 2026 form is already marked closed, but for future planning, here is the Jan. 1, 2027 form.

Please note: no seats are provided, so you’ll need to bring your own arrangements.

There’s also limited wheelchair accessible grandstand seating sold through Sharp Seating.

Rose Bowl game

The Rose Bowl game, the oldest of bowls dating back to 1902, immediately follows the parade. The Rose Bowl Stadium parking lot opens at 4 a.m. Jan. 1 and the stadium gates open at 10:30 a.m. The game starts at 1 p.m.

A quick scan turned up tickets that are still available for the Indiana vs. Alabama matchup for a little as $130.90 and as much as $2,683.13.

General parking is available in certain lots at the stadium, with spots going for $69 that you buy it in advance.

For public transportation, you can take the Metro A line and exit at the Memorial Park station. You can find more information here about getting to the stadium.

Please note: the stadium has a clear-bag policy, which means backpacks, purses, and camera cases are not allowed.

A Medford-based solar power company blamed federal cutbacks from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act when it notified the state that it was closing as of Dec. 26 and laying off 109 employees.

Purelight Power CEO JD Beck filed a notification to the state as part of the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act on Dec. 23.

He said that 84 of the workers were based out of the company’s Medford location and another 25 worked remotely. He said 96 of the employees were laid off on Dec. 23 and the rest were laid off Dec. 26.

Beck said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, also known as House Resolution 1, cut solar energy tax credits when it was signed into law on July 4.

“Before the enactment of the OBBB, the company had benefited from the Inflation Reduction Act, which had promised to boost federal tax incentives for solar energy for at least a decade,” Beck wrote.

Beck said the OBBB ""dramatically cut solar energy tax credits and significantly restricted the use of such credits.""

He also said the company had been facing challenges related to a prior merger, rising interest rates and increasing advertising costs.

Purelight Power said that it pursued selling the company and had three offers to buy it, but those weren’t accepted by the company’s lender. That lender placed the company in default.

The company said it is shutting down operations nationwide and will be filing for Chapter 7 liquidation. Purelight also operated in Washington, Idaho, Montana, Minnesota, Iowa, Indiana and Kentucky.","https://www.statesmanjournal.com/gcdn/presto/2020/02/23/PSAL/0b5ffdd3-ef45-4a2a-8e3f-bfa4d1671e16-2_MAC_Solar_panels_B55A9867.jpg?crop=3510,1975,x0,y1579&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-29 19:57:32.150371

Portland’s new City Council started grappling with the city’s climate issues as soon as councilors took office at the beginning of this year. One of the Council’s first acts of business in January was to establish eight policy committees—including one focused on environmental and land use issues. The Council was able to spotlight some underdiscussed environmental issues—like Portland’s relationship with biofuels and “renewable” natural gas—through this committee, though it’s unclear what, if any, changes will result from such conversations.

Zenith under the microscope

Zenith Energy was another major topic of conversation in Portland this year. Many of the new councilors came into office concerned about Zenith and other fuel companies based at Portland’s Critical Energy Infrastructure (CEI) hub on the Willamette River, which pose environmental risks to the city. Early in the year, former City Administrator Michael Jordan granted Zenith a new Land Use Compatibility Statement (LUCS), allowing the company to continue its operations in compliance with state mandates. The decision came at roughly the same time as several councilors began making moves to investigate Zenith and the city’s dealings with the company, displaying the limits of the new Council’s authority over Portland’s administrative branch.

Fighting for Forest Park

The city also wrestled with Portland General Electric’s (PGE) plan to construct a major utility project in Forest Park. The plan, which would require removing around 400 trees from Portland’s largest park, was hated by many climate advocates, who said PGE didn’t attempt to find alternative solutions before proposing a Forest Park clearcut. After a city hearings officer sided with PGE to greenlight the project, opponents appealed. In the end, Portland City Council unanimously voted against the utility company’s plan—a relatively rare show of unity among councilors who don’t always agree, and a win for tree lovers dubious of PGE’s proposal. (Environmental advocates say it was also a win for species who live in the park, including Northern red-legged frogs. Portland’s frogs—real and inflatable—came into the national spotlight this year in other ways, too.)

River love

Portlanders gathered at the Willamette River en masse this summer, with weekly river parties demonstrating how excited people are to embrace a clean, swimmable river. After a hot stretch, the river saw a toxic algae bloom, making it briefly unsafe for summer frolicking—the climate crisis in action, folks. Luckily, a summer rainstorm disrupted the algae bloom, but advocates continue to emphasize the need to take action to mitigate the effects of climate change on Portland’s river.

PCEF continues funding climate action (even as Trump seeks to destroy the earth)

The Trump administration has done serious damage to climate action since taking office at the beginning of the year. Between clawing back funds for clean energy projects, firing federal climate researchers, and installing climate change deniers throughout every sector of government, these lunatics are really doing everything to hasten humanity’s demise. It won’t be enough to solve everything, but Portland’s clean energy fund offers a potential roadmap for taking action in the age of Trump. The Portland Clean Energy Community Benefits Fund (PCEF) just allocated more than $60 million toward dozens of local climate projects, ranging from electric bike incentives to energy-efficient home retrofits.

According to Silver Institute research, ""silver demand is forecast to expand across key technology sectors, with solar photovoltaics leading industrial consumption growth through 2030.""
Investment Implications: Portfolio Positioning for Silver Demand Growth The convergence of solar EVs data centers drive silver demand creates diverse investment opportunities across mining equities, technology sector exposure, and direct commodity investment.
Technology Sector Correlation: Silver-Dependent Industries Performance Technology sector investments in solar, electric vehicle, and data center industries provide indirect silver exposure while benefiting from end-market demand growth.
Technology Substitution Threats: Alternative Materials Development Research into alternative conductive materials poses the most significant long-term threat to silver demand growth.","How Will Three Technological Megatrends Reshape Silver Markets by 2030?

The convergence of renewable energy deployment, transportation electrification, and digital infrastructure expansion represents the most significant industrial transformation since the advent of mass manufacturing. As solar EVs data centers drive silver demand through unprecedented technological adoption rates, these three megatrends operate independently yet create multiplicative demand pressures on critical materials, with silver positioned at the intersection of all three technological revolutions.

The Convergence of Energy Transition, Electrification, and Digital Infrastructure

Global renewable energy capacity is projected to expand by 2,700 GW between 2024-2029, with solar and wind technologies accounting for approximately 90% of this unprecedented growth. This expansion coincides with transportation electrification accelerating beyond traditional forecasts, as electric vehicle adoption curves steepen across major markets. Simultaneously, artificial intelligence workloads are driving data center construction at rates exceeding 50% per decade in key regions.

The simultaneity of these trends creates what analysts describe as overlapping demand acceleration. Unlike previous commodity cycles driven by single-sector expansion, the 2025-2030 period features synchronized growth across three independent demand drivers, each requiring silver-intensive manufacturing processes and infrastructure components.

Furthermore, the silver market squeeze demonstrates how supply constraints amplify price volatility during periods of accelerated industrial consumption.

Strategic Scenario Framework for Silver Demand Analysis

Strategic scenario modelling reveals three distinct pathways for silver demand evolution through 2030:

• Base Case Scenario: Moderate policy continuity with existing renewable energy targets maintained, EV adoption following current market trajectories reaching 50% of new vehicle sales by 2030 in developed markets, and data center expansion aligned with AI deployment forecasts

• Accelerated Scenario: Enhanced policy support for renewable energy, accelerated EV adoption exceeding 60% market share by 2030, and rapid AI workload migration to cloud infrastructure

• Constrained Scenario: Policy reversals, subsidy elimination, supply chain disruptions, and technology substitution pressures reducing silver demand growth rates by 30-40%

Each scenario incorporates distinct geographic distribution patterns, regulatory environments, and technological adoption rates that influence silver consumption across industrial applications. Moreover, effective silver squeeze strategies can help investors navigate these varying market conditions.

Market Structure Transformation Timeline

The transformation timeline reveals critical inflection points across all three megatrends. Solar photovoltaic installations are projected to reach 1,735 GW global capacity by 2028, representing a 13% compound annual growth rate. Electric vehicle production is expected to transition from current levels of 12 million units annually to 35 million units by 2031. Data center electricity consumption approaches 1,000 TWh annually by 2026, representing 3-5% of global electricity demand.

These inflection points create temporal clustering of silver demand acceleration, with peak consumption periods potentially coinciding across sectors during 2027-2029, generating supply-demand imbalances that traditional mining production cycles may struggle to accommodate.

What Makes Silver the Critical Metal for Next-Generation Technologies?

Silver's position as the premier electrical conductor among all metals creates an irreplaceable foundation for next-generation technological applications. With electrical conductivity of 63.0 MS/m and thermal conductivity of 429 W/m·K, silver outperforms all alternative materials in scenarios where energy efficiency and thermal management determine system performance and longevity.

Electrical Conductivity Requirements in Advanced Applications

The superiority of silver in electrical applications stems from its atomic structure, which provides minimal resistance to electron flow. Silver exhibits 5.8% higher electrical conductivity than copper and 39.4% higher thermal conductivity than gold, creating measurable performance advantages in high-current and high-frequency applications.

In solar photovoltaic systems, even marginal resistance increases reduce cell efficiency by 0.1-0.2% per unit of resistance increase. This sensitivity makes silver's conductivity premium economically justifiable despite cost differentials. Modern photovoltaic cells incorporate sophisticated contact architectures utilising 85-95% silver content pastes, applied through precision screen printing and sintered at 750-850°C to achieve optimal conductivity characteristics.

Electric vehicle battery management systems operate at 400-800 volts with peak currents exceeding 500 amperes, necessitating ultra-low-resistance connections where silver's conductivity provides measurable safety and efficiency advantages. Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y battery architectures specifically incorporate silver-based connectors to manage charging currents exceeding 200 amperes while maintaining voltage losses below 50 millivolts.

Thermal Management Properties for High-Performance Systems

Silver's thermal conductivity properties become particularly critical in high-density computing environments where server processors operate at 200+ watts per unit. Silver-based thermal interface materials and solder formulations provide superior heat dissipation compared to copper-based alternatives, directly enabling higher processing speeds and reduced cooling requirements.

The relationship between thermal management and system performance creates a direct correlation between silver content and computational capability. Data centers utilising silver-enhanced thermal management systems achieve 15-20% improvements in processing density while reducing cooling energy consumption by similar margins.

Industrial Substitution Challenges and Cost-Benefit Analysis

Despite silver's cost premium, substitution barriers remain substantial across critical applications. Alternative materials face fundamental limitations:

• Copper: 5.8% lower electrical conductivity, higher corrosion susceptibility, increased thickness requirements

• Gold: Superior corrosion resistance but 39.4% lower thermal conductivity, significantly higher cost per unit

• Aluminium: 40% lower electrical conductivity, structural integrity limitations in high-current applications

• Graphene-based conductors: Promising theoretical properties but manufacturing scalability challenges and cost uncertainties

The cost-performance analysis reveals silver justification thresholds where efficiency gains exceed material cost premiums. In solar applications, silver represents 8-10% of total module cost despite comprising only 0.05-0.08% of module mass, demonstrating performance-driven value creation.

Table: Silver's Technical Properties vs. Alternative Conductors

Property Silver Copper Gold Aluminium Electrical Conductivity (MS/m) 63.0 59.6 45.2 37.8 Thermal Conductivity (W/m·K) 429 401 318 237 Corrosion Resistance High Medium Highest Low Cost per kg (USD) $800-900 $9-10 $65,000 $2-3

Solar Photovoltaic Sector: The Primary Industrial Demand Driver

The solar photovoltaic sector's evolution represents the most dramatic shift in silver demand patterns over the past decade. From representing 11% of industrial silver consumption in 2014, solar applications now account for 29% of total demand, creating the largest single driver of industrial silver consumption globally.

Evolution of Silver Consumption in PV Technology (2014-2024)

The transformation of silver usage in photovoltaic technology reflects competing forces: technological advancement reducing per-unit consumption while installation volume growth drives total demand acceleration. Silver content per photovoltaic cell decreased from 521 mg in 2014 to 111 mg in 2024, representing a 78.7% reduction over the decade.

This reduction resulted from three distinct technological pathways:

• Geometry Optimisation: Advanced computer modelling improved contact finger spacing and width, reducing silver usage by approximately 30% while maintaining electrical performance

• Silver Paste Innovation: Next-generation nanopastes and composite materials require 25-35% less silver by volume to achieve equivalent conductivity through nanostructure architecture

• Contact Design Evolution: Transition from simple grid structures to sophisticated designs including selective emitters and split busbars, improving current collection efficiency with narrower conductors

Technological Efficiency Gains vs. Installation Volume Growth

Despite remarkable per-unit silver reduction, total silver consumption continues accelerating due to installation volume growth rates exceeding technological reduction rates. The mathematical relationship demonstrates this dynamic:

Total Silver Demand = Installation Volume × Silver Content per Unit

When installation growth of 20-27% compound annual growth rate exceeds technical reduction rates of approximately 3-4% annually, total demand accelerates despite per-unit efficiency improvements. This creates a structural demand floor that cannot be significantly reduced through further miniaturisation without compromising electrical performance.

Regional Solar Capacity Expansion Scenarios Through 2030

Global solar deployment targets reveal the scale of upcoming installation requirements across major markets:

• European Union: 260 GW (2025) targeting 700 GW (2030) representing 169% expansion

At the same time, CPV also completed its third solar tax equity financing deal with U.S. Bank. Marathon Capital served as the advisor, highlighting the project’s strong structure and CPV’s continued leadership in large-scale renewable development.

CPV Backbone Solar is built on land that was once a coal mine but has since been reclaimed and repurposed. The project includes 324,000 solar panels capable of generating enough electricity to power approximately 30,000 homes. By converting a former industrial site into a productive clean energy facility, the project demonstrates how brownfield redevelopment can support both environmental and economic goals.

Sherman Knight, CEO of CPV, described the project as an example of responsible energy transition. He noted that turning an exhausted coal site into a modern solar plant shows how engineering innovation and strong partnerships can overcome site challenges and deliver new clean power for Maryland. Mike Resca, Executive Vice President of CPV Renewable Power, added that Garrett County offered the right conditions for the project and that CPV is committed to supporting communities where it can make a meaningful impact. He highlighted that the project will contribute significant tax revenue to the county.

Carolyn Arida, Senior Managing Director of Infrastructure at Harrison Street Asset Management, said the project demonstrates how utility-scale renewable infrastructure can meet rising electricity demand. She expressed confidence in CPV as a long-term partner as Harrison Street continues to expand its renewable project portfolio nationwide.

The project was constructed by Vanguard Energy Partners, a well-known solar engineering, procurement, and construction firm. Geoffrey Fairclough, President of Vanguard, noted that despite the site’s complexity, the teams worked with focus and resilience to deliver a high-quality facility safely and efficiently.

Local leaders have also welcomed the project. Senator Michael McKay called the project an important step for economic development and job creation in Maryland. Delegate Jim Hinebaugh, Jr. highlighted that it brings new power to the grid while returning previously mined land to productive use and boosting the local tax base. Paul Edwards, Chairman of the Garrett County Board, said the project supports both environmental preservation and local economic value, benefitting residents and the region.

CPV Backbone Solar began development in 2020, with CPV working closely with community stakeholders throughout the process. As part of its commitment to local and environmental stewardship, the company is contributing $100,000 over four years to the Deep Creek Watershed Foundation to support long-term conservation efforts. Bob Hoffmann, President of the Foundation, expressed appreciation for CPV’s support and commitment to protecting the area’s natural resources.

The project now joins CPV’s broader renewable energy portfolio, which includes four operating wind and solar facilities and a development pipeline of 4.8 GW. Construction has already begun on a planned second phase of the Backbone project, which is expected to increase the site’s capacity to 175 MW once completed.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/23-2.png,N,,2025-12-29 17:58:28.340249

A Monday statement from Environment America and the Public Interest Network highlighted a number of new laws aimed at curbing corporate polluters and enhancing consumer welfare.

First, the groups highlighted ""Right to Repair"" laws set to take effect in Washington, Nevada, Oregon, and Colorado, which give people the right to repair their own appliances and electronics without burdensome costs or barriers.

The groups lavished particular praise on Colorado's ""Right to Repair"" laws that they said provide ""the broadest repair protections in the country,"" with new regulations that will give businesses in the state ""access to what they and independent repair providers need to fix their electronics themselves.""

Illinois, meanwhile, will fully phase out the sale of fluorescent lightbulbs, which will be replaced by energy-efficient LED bulbs. The groups estimate that eliminating the fluorescent bulbs will collectively save Illinois households more than $1.5 billion on their utility bills by 2050, while also reducing energy waste and mercury pollution.

Illinois also drew praise for enacting a ban on polystyrene foam foodware that will take effect on January 1.

The groups also highlighted the work being done in Oregon to protect consumers with legislation mandating price transparency to eliminate surprise junk fees on purchases; prohibiting ambulance companies from socking out-of-network patients with massive fees for rides to nearby hospitals; and placing new restrictions on the ability of medical debt to negatively impact a person's credit score.

California also got a mention in the groups' release for closing a loophole that allowed supermarkets to continue using plastic bags and for creating a new privacy tool for consumers allowing them to request that online data brokers delete all of the personal information they have gathered on them over the years.

Whistleblowers from several government agencies have bravely stepped forward to expose fraud and abuse. From whistleblower clients receiving awards, activism on Capitol Hill, and fighting back against government abuse of authority, Government Accountability Project has remained dedicated and steadfast to the mission of protecting whistleblowers.

1. Bombshell Whistleblower Exposes Justice Department Lies

In June, Government Accountability Project whistleblower client Erez Reuveni exposed high-level defiance of court orders in the Department of Justice (DOJ) and faced retaliation. Reuveni was the Acting Deputy Director of DOJ's Office of Immigration Litigation when he made his disclosure exposing concerning details of misconduct and abuse of authority at DOJ. He detailed senior DOJ staff defying federal court rulings in immigration enforcement, knowingly violating court injunctions, directing attorneys to mislead courts, and retaliating against employees like Mr. Reuveni for refusing to carry out illegal orders. Reuveni was a 15-year DOJ veteran working under both Democratic and Republican administrations and was terminated for refusing to comply with orders from his supervisor that would have violated court order and his oath as an attorney. His story of protecting the rule of law has been shared around the world, and Erez Reuveni was hand-selected to receive the Pillar Award for his whistleblowing and bravery.

2. Preserving Voice of America, Again

In March, Government Accountability Project filed a lawsuit against Special Adviser Kari Lake and U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) Acting Director Victor Morales for the unlawful suspension of Voice of America (VOA). Less than two weeks after the lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York, the judge temporarily halted mass layoffs at VOA. The three named plaintiffs—Patsy Widakuswara, Jessica Jerreat, and Kate Neeper—expressed concerns of a ""genuine constitutional crisis"" in reaction to the agency closure. In late April, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction, reaffirming legal protection for VOA operations in the U.S. and around the world, and employees and contractors were notified they were to return to work the following week. Less than a day later, a federal appeals panel with two Trump-appointed judges issued a temporary stay of the lower court's order. The stay paused parts of the ruling that required employees to be reinstated and operations to be fully restored but did not overturn the case itself. Two weeks later, on May 16, roughly 500 contractors, roughly one-third of the agency, were fired from VOA. Over the spring and summer, the case bounced between courts, leaving VOA's future uncertain until a new ruling in September stabilized operations. Judge Royce Lamberth ordered that the agency continue operating as it had been since the spring, blocking USAGM leadership from carrying out another round of planned layoffs while the case continues.

3. Whistleblower Exposes DOGE Access to American's Social Security

In August, Americans learned that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) put their social security information at risk. Charles Borges, then-Chief Data Officer at the Social Security Administration (SSA), blew the whistle on the creation of a live copy of American's social security information in an unsecure cloud environment that lacks oversight. Since DOGE's establishment in January 2025, its officials have been attempting to access SSA's data to address reports of fraud. However, a lawsuit resulted in a temporary restraining order from March 20 to June 6 stating they could not take this step during this timeframe. In that time, Borges' disclosure described multiple instances of DOGE wrongdoing at SSA by circumventing this court order. As the Chief Data Officer, Borges required full visibility into data access, exchange, and cloud-based environments. According to Borges, DOGE employees kept him in the dark and told his employees not to say anything to Borges. In August, Borges made internal disclosures to his superiors on the abuse of authority and gross mismanagement that posed a serious risk to public safety. In response, one of his superiors noted the possibility that SSA may have to re-issue social security numbers to every American if there was such a security breach. The day after his disclosure, Borges involuntarily resigned from his position at SSA, citing ""concerns on questionable activities"" and that the ""silence from leadership, and anxiety and fear over potential illegal actions resulting in the loss of citizen data, is more than a reasonable employee could bear.""

4. Continuing the Fight for East Palestine, Ohio

September marked two years of Government Accountability Project's investigation into the mismanagement and effects of the February 2023 Norfolk Southern train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. Our team has worked around the clock talking with whistleblowers and residents, reviewing evidence, filing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, and more. In February, Legal Director, Tom Devine, published an op-ed in the Washington Examiner calling for collaboration between Congress and former-Ohio Senator Vice President JD Vance to assist the community that many believe was abandoned by the previous administration. This past spring delivered documents following a lawsuit against the Federal Emergency Management Agency relating to an unreleased unmet needs report, where an official was ordered not to engage with the local community despite this being the purpose of this position. The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Inspector General also published its findings on whistleblower Dr. Robert Kroutil's 2024 disclosure about the mismanagement of the Airborne Spectral Photometric Environmental Technology (ASPECT) plane. In its findings, EPA's OIG acknowledged the lack of clarity and miscommunication on ASPECT's capabilities but failed to address why the sensors were turned off during its flight to collect data. In July, on Whistleblower Appreciation Day, Dr. Kroutil was also selected to receive the Pillar Award for his whistleblowing and bravery.

5. Whistleblower Protections Climb on Capitol Hill

The push for better whistleblower protections on Capitol Hill has been strong this year. Coincidentally, on Whistleblower Appreciation Day, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs unanimously voted to advance the Expanding Whistleblower Protections for Contractors Act that would strengthen protections for federal contractors. Each year, trillions of taxpayer dollars go to contracts, making it critical for those employees to expose fraud, waste, and abuse of those funds. This bipartisan legislation fixes the loopholes in current whistleblower protection laws. Government contractors aren't the only ones getting more whistleblower protections. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) introduced the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2025, which is cosponsored by Senator Gary Peters (D-MI). This bipartisan piece of legislation would grant FBI employees access to the Merit System Protection Board. The current legislative gaps leave FBI employees vulnerable to retaliation for blowing the whistle on fraud, waste, and abuse, and the new bill will close some of the biggest gaps in protections in the system.

One year ago, Executive Director and CEO, Louis Clark, said ""We are here for you if you are instructed to carry out an illegal order or if you observe gross mismanagement, waste, a specific health and safety threat, abuse of authority, or illegality. Let's sit down together and work out an effective plan of action to address the wrongdoing once we have verified your concerns."" His statement still holds true. Government Accountability Project is here through the good and bad times, the natural ebb and flow of politics. Thank you for your continued support and allyship this year and beyond.",https://whistleblower.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-in-Review-X.png,N,,2025-12-29 16:57:58.582727

In contrast, 80% of the 10 states with the lowest electricity prices are reliably red.
New York is a prime blue state example, where electricity prices were 58% higher than the national average during the same period.
Ultimately, it’s up to the states to prioritize reliable, affordable, dispatchable generation and drive down electricity prices.
Tom Pyle is President of the Institute for Energy Research, a nonprofit energy research organization.","Americans are anxious about their utility bills – and with good reason. Three quarters of U.S. residents are concerned about their electricity and gas bills rising this year, and 80% feel powerless over how much they are charged for utilities. For nearly two-thirds of U.S. billpayers, simply keeping the lights on has become a growing source of financial stress.

Those concerns are grounded in reality. U.S. electricity prices rose 27% during the Biden administration and another 11% between January and September 2025. Yet despite a national narrative eager to blame President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), the real drivers of high electricity prices are far closer to home.

Electricity affordability is shaped primarily by state policy choices, and states choosing the most expensive path are overwhelmingly blue. So, blue-state residents are experiencing the pain much more than those in red states.

A new report from Always On Energy Research and the Institute for Energy Research finds that 86% of states with electricity prices above the national average voted for Democratic presidential candidates in 2020 and 2024. In contrast, 80% of the 10 states with the lowest electricity prices are reliably red. That’s not a coincidence. Those high prices reflect a consistent pattern of state-level energy policies that dictate emissions reduction targets at the expense of affordability, reliability, and physics.

States have the exclusive power to decide which resources supply their grids under the Federal Power Act. Governors, legislatures, and public utility commissions – not the White House – decide whether to impose renewable portfolio standards (RPS), enforce Net-Zero mandates, or prematurely retire reliable power plants. Those decisions directly determine how much families and businesses pay for electricity.

Today, 28 states enforce an RPS, requiring a certain percentage of retail electricity sales to come from renewable sources, and 16 states have 100% clean energy standards (CES) or carbon-free mandates. Many of these policies compel utilities to overbuild intermittent generation, such as wind and solar, thereby requiring significant investments in transmission, grid-scale storage, and backup generation to maintain reliability. The result is a higher total system cost, which is passed onto ratepayers in the form of higher electricity rates.

Consider that the U.S. average electricity price between January 2025 and August 2025 was 13.54 cents per kilowatt-hour. Each of the five most expensive states mandates 100% of their electricity come from renewable or carbon-free sources in the coming decades. Eight of the 10 states with the lowest electricity prices voted for the Republican presidential candidate in 2020 and 2024, and seven of the 10 don’t have renewable or carbon-free mandates.

New York is a prime blue state example, where electricity prices were 58% higher than the national average during the same period. The Progressive Policy Institute (PPI) found that New York experienced the second-fastest increase in electricity prices nationwide, with residential customers suffering a 36% increase between 2019 and 2024. PPI points to “the immense capital investment required to transform the grid and specific policy choices that increase the cost of energy production,” as well as the closure of the Indian Point nuclear plant.

It’s clear that Governor Kathy Hochul knows exactly which policy choices are driving up electricity costs — because she’s scrambling to roll them back. Ms. Hochul has delayed implementation of the state’s cap-and-tax mandates under the 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), which includes a substantial renewable energy mandate requiring 70% renewable energy by 2030 and 100% carbon-free energy by 2040.

The state’s Department of Environmental Conservation defended the delay, arguing in court that the regulations would impose “extraordinary and damaging costs upon New Yorkers.” Ms. Hochul has approved two major natural gas pipelines and delayed implementation of the state’s ban on gas stoves in new buildings – a tacit admission that reliability and affordability still matter in New York.

California, however, remains committed to the most expensive path in the country with the fastest rate increase, now double the national average. For years, Governor Gavin Newsom and the California legislature have imposed on ratepayers a carbon-emissions reduction mandate, renewable mandates, solar cost-shifting through net metering, nuclear reactor closures, and EV charging subsidies.

For all of his climate-friendly posturing, Mr. Newsom signed a bill to ramp up oil drilling in Kern County, and his Energy Commission has delayed its plan to penalize refinery profits for five years. These reversals underscore a central truth: ideology will take a back seat to cost and reliability.

There’s a silver lining, however. While states can choose to raise electricity costs for their residents through bad policies, they can also choose to lower costs through good policies. For instance, Florida is the second-largest electricity producer in the country, behind only Texas. Residents require air conditioning for its hot, humid summers and heating in its mild winters. However, Florida delivers electricity at prices 2% below the U.S. average—mainly because it generates 75% of its power from imported natural gas. It has avoided aggressive climate mandates and delivers below-average electricity prices despite frequent hurricanes that require ongoing investment in the grid.

Louisiana and Kentucky have also invested in wise policies. Louisiana posted the third-lowest electricity rates in the U.S. in 2025, and Kentucky had the lowest rates east of the Mississippi River. Nearly three-quarters of Louisiana’s electricity is generated from natural gas, leveraging its abundant natural gas production and robust pipeline network. Kentucky, similarly, leverages its coal resources to generate 67% of the state’s electricity, with another 26% by natural gas. Neither has pursued aggressive carbon emissions reduction or renewable energy mandates.

Pinning the blame on the federal government and President Trump, as Democrats have been eager to do, ignores the vital role that states play in delivering affordable, reliable electricity. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright recognizes the same, stating on Fox News that “Electricity prices have risen very fast in blue states with restrictive renewable portfolio standards.”

The Department of Energy and President Trump can set the tone, but they don’t dictate the composition of state grids or the bills consumers receive each month. Those decisions rest squarely with governors, legislators, and regulators. Ultimately, it’s up to the states to prioritize reliable, affordable, dispatchable generation and drive down electricity prices.

High electricity rates aren’t an unavoidable consequence of modern life or federal policy. They are the predictable outcome of state-level choices that ignore reliability, undervalue dispatchable generation, and impose rigid mandates regardless of cost. Americans deserve leaders who recognize that keeping the lights on at a modest price isn’t optional. The states keeping electricity affordable today offer a roadmap for those willing to learn.

Tools that power artificial intelligence devour energy. But attempts to shield regular Californians from footing the bill in 2025 ended with a law requiring regulators to write a report about the issue by 2027.

If that sounds pretty watered down, it is. Efforts to regulate the energy usage of data centers — the beating heart of AI — ran headlong into Big Tech, business groups and the governor.

That’s not surprising given that California is increasingly dependent on big tech for state revenue: A handful of companies pay upwards of $5 billion just on income tax withholding.

The law mandating the report is the lone survivor of last year’s push to rein in the data-center industry. Its deadline means the findings won’t likely be ready in time for lawmakers to use in 2026. The measure began as a plan to give data centers their own electricity rate, shielding households and small businesses from higher bills.

It amounts to a “toothless” measure, directing the utility regulator to study an issue it already has the authority to investigate, said Matthew Freedman, a staff attorney with the Utility Reform Network, a ratepayer advocate.

Data centers’ enormous electricity demand has pushed them to the center of California’s energy debate, and that’s why lawmakers and consumer advocates say new regulations matter.

For instance, the sheer amount of energy requested by data centers in California is prompting questions about costly grid upgrades even as speculative projects and fast-shifting AI loads make long-term planning uncertain. Developers have requested 18.7 gigawatts of service capacity for data centers, more than enough to serve every household in the state, according to the California Energy Commission.

But the report could help shape future debates as lawmakers revisit tougher rules and the CPUC considers new policies on what data centers pay for power — a discussion gaining urgency as scrutiny of their rising electricity costs grows, he said.

“It could be that the report helps the Legislature to understand the magnitude of the problem and potential solutions,” Freedman said. “It could also inform the CPUC’s own review of the reasonableness of rates for data center customers, which they are likely to investigate.”

State Sen. Steve Padilla, a Democrat from Chula Vista, says that the final version of his law “was not the one we would have preferred,” agreeing that it may seem “obvious” the CPUC can study data center cost impacts. The measure could help frame future debates and at least “says unequivocally that the CPUC has the authority to study these impacts” as demand from data centers accelerates, Padilla added.

Data centers ""consume huge amounts of energy, huge amounts of resources, and at least in the near future, we're not going to see that change,” he said.

Earlier drafts of Padilla’s measure went further, requiring data centers to install large batteries to support the grid during peak demand and pushing utilities to supply them with 100% carbon-free electricity by 2030 — years ahead of the state’s own mandate. Those provisions were ultimately stripped out.

How California’s first push to regulate data centers slipped away

California’s bid to bring more oversight to data centers unraveled earlier this year under industry pressure, ending with Gov. Gavin Newsom’s veto of a bill requiring operators to report their water use. Concerns over the bills reflected fears that data-center developers could shift projects to other states and take valuable jobs with them.

A September Stanford report on powering California data centers said the state risks losing property-tax revenue, union construction jobs and “valuable AI talent” if data-center construction moves out of state.

The idea that increased regulation could lead to businesses or dollars in some form leaving California is an argument that has been brought up across industries for decades. It often does not hold up to more careful or long-term scrutiny.

In the face of this opposition, two key proposals stalled in the Legislature’s procedural churn. Early in the session, Padilla put a separate clean-power incentives proposal for data centers on hold until 2026. Later in the year, an Assembly bill requiring data centers to disclose their electricity use was placed in the Senate’s suspense file — where appropriations committees often quietly halt measures.

Newsom, who has often spoken of California’s AI dominance, echoed the industry’s competitiveness worries in his veto message of the water-use reporting requirement. The governor said he was reluctant to impose requirements on data centers, “without understanding the full impact on businesses and the consumers of their technology.”

Despite last year’s defeats, some lawmakers say they will attempt to tackle the issue again.

Padilla plans to try again with a bill that would add new rules on who pays for data centers’ long-term grid costs in California, while Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan — a Democrat from San Ramon — will revisit her electricity-disclosure bill.

Big Tech warns of job losses but one advocate sees an opening

After blocking most measures — and watering down the lone energy-costs bill — Big Tech groups say they’ll revive arguments that new efforts to regulate data centers could cost California jobs.

At a CalMatters event in November, Silicon Valley Leadership Group CEO Ahmad Thomas argued that California must compete to attract investments like the $40 billion data-center project Texas secured with Google. Any policy making deals like that tougher would provoke conflict, he added.

“When we get to the details of what our regulatory regime looks like versus other states, or how we can make California more competitive ... that's where sometimes we struggle to find that happy medium,” he said.

Despite having more regulations than some states, California continues to toggle between the 4th and 5th largest economy in the world and has for some time, suggesting that the Golden State is very competitive.

Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy for the Data Center Coalition, another industry lobbying group, said new requirements on data centers should apply to all other large electricity users.

“To single out one industry is not something that we think would set a helpful precedent, ” Diorio said. “We've been very consistent with that throughout the country.”

Critics say job loss fears are overblown, noting California built its AI sector without the massive hyperscale facilities that typically gravitate to states with ample, cheaper land and streamlined permitting.

Data-center locations — driven by energy prices, land and local rules — have little to do with where AI researchers live, said Shaolei Ren, an AI researcher at UC Riverside.

“These two things are sort of separate, they’re decoupled,” he said.

Freedman, of TURN, said lawmakers may have a bargaining chip: If developers cared about cheaper power, they wouldn’t be proposing facilities in a state with high electric rates. That means speed and certainty may be the priority, giving lawmakers the space to potentially offer quicker approvals in exchange for developers covering more grid costs.

“There's so much money in this business that the energy bills — even though large — are kind of like rounding errors for these guys,” Freedman said. “If that's true, then maybe they shouldn't care about having to pay a little bit more to ensure that costs aren't being shifted to other customers.”

It wasn't until a couple of years ago that Keri Rodrigues began to worry about how her kids might be using chatbots. She learned her youngest son was interacting with the chatbot in his Bible app — he was asking it some deep moral questions, about sin for instance.

That's the kind of conversation that she had hoped her son would have with her and not a computer. ""Not everything in life is black and white,"" she says. ""There are grays. And it's my job as his mom to help him navigate that and walk through it, right?""

Rodrigues has also been hearing from parents across the country who are concerned about AI chatbots' influence on their children. She is the president of the National Parents Union, which advocates for children and families. Many parents, she says, are watching chatbots claim to be their kids' best friends, encouraging children to tell them everything.

Psychologists and online safety advocates say parents are right to be worried. Extended chatbot interactions may affect kids' social development and mental health, they say. And the technology is changing so fast that few safeguards are in place.

The impacts can be serious. According to their parents' testimonies at a recent Senate hearing, two teens died by suicide after prolonged interactions with chatbots that encouraged their suicide plans.

If you or someone you know may be considering suicide or be in crisis, call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.

But generative AI chatbots are a growing part of life for American teens. A survey by the Pew Research Center found that 64% of adolescents are using chatbots, with 3 in 10 saying they use them daily.

""It's a very new technology,"" says Dr. Jason Nagata, a pediatrician and researcher of adolescent digital media use at the University of California San Francisco. ""It's ever-changing and there's not really best practices for youth yet. So, I think there are more opportunities now for risks because we're still kind of guinea pigs in the whole process.""

And teenagers are particularly vulnerable to the risks of chatbots, he adds, because adolescence is a time of rapid brain development, which is shaped by experiences. ""It is a period when teens are more vulnerable to lots of different exposures, whether it's peers or computers.""

But parents can minimize those risks, say pediatricians and psychologists. Here are some ways to help teens navigate the technology safely.

1. Be aware of the risks

A new report from the online safety company, Aura, shows that 42% of adolescents using AI chatbots use them for companionship. Aura gathered data from the daily device use of 3,000 teens as well as surveys of families.

That includes some disturbing conversations involving violence and sex, says psychologist Scott Kollins, chief medical officer at Aura, who leads the company's research on teen interactions with generative AI.

""It is role play that is [an] interaction about harming somebody else, physically hurting them, torturing them,"" he says.

He says it's normal for kids to be curious about sex, but learning about sexual interactions from a chatbot instead of a trusted adult is problematic.

And chatbots are designed to agree with users, says pediatrician Nagata. So if your child starts a query about sex or violence, ""the default of the AI is to engage with it and to reinforce it.""

He says spending a lot of time with chatbots — having extended conversations — also prevents teenagers from learning important social skills, like empathy, reading body language and negotiating differences.

""When you're only or exclusively interacting with computers who are agreeing with you, then you don't get to develop those skills,"" he says.

And there are mental health risks. According to a recent study by researchers at the nonprofit research organization RAND, Harvard and Brown universities, 1 in 8 adolescents and young adults use chatbots for mental health advice.

But there have been numerous reports of individuals experiencing delusions, or what's being referred to as AI psychosis, after prolonged interactions with chatbots. This, as well as the concern over risks of suicide, has led psychologists to warn that AI chatbots pose serious risks to the mental health and safety of teens as well as vulnerable adults.

""We see that when people interact with [chatbots] over long periods of time, that things start to degrade, that the chatbots do things that they're not intended to do,"" says psychologist Ursula Whiteside, CEO of a mental health nonprofit called Now Matters Now. For example, she says, chatbots ""give advice about lethal means, things that it's not supposed to do but does happen over time with repeated queries.""

2. Stay engaged with kids' online lives

Keep an open dialogue going with your child, says Nagata.

""Parents don't need to be AI experts,"" he says. ""They just need to be curious about their children's lives and ask them about what kind of technology they're using and why.""

And have those conversations early and often, says psychologist Kollins of Aura.

""We need to have frequent and candid but nonjudgmental conversations with our kids about what this content looks like,"" says Kollins, who's also a father to two teenagers. ""And we're going to have to continue to do that.""

He often asks his teens about what platforms they are on. When he hears about new chatbots through his own research at Aura, he also asks his kids if they have heard of those or used them.

""Don't blame the child for expressing or taking advantage of something that's out there to satisfy their natural curiosity and exploration,"" he says.

And make sure to keep the conversations open-ended, says Nagata: ""I do think that that allows for your teenager or child to open up about problems that they've encountered.""

3. Develop digital literacy

It's also important to talk to kids about the benefits and pitfalls of generative AI. And if parents don't understand all the risks and benefits, parents and kids can research that together, suggests psychologist Jacqueline Nesi at Brown University, who was involved in the American Psychological Association's recent health advisory on AI and adolescent health.

""A certain amount of digital literacy and literacy does need to happen at home,"" she says.

It's important for parents and teens to understand that while chatbots can help with research, they also make errors, says Nagata. And it is important for users to be skeptical and fact-check.

""Part of this education process for children is to help them to understand that this is not the final say,"" explains Nagata. ""You yourself can process this information and try to assess, what's real or not. And if you're not sure, then try to verify with other people or other sources.""

4. Parental controls only work if kids set up their own accounts

If a child is using AI chatbots, it may be better for them to set up their own account on the platforms, says Nesi, instead of using chatbots anonymously.

""Many of the more popular platforms now have parental controls in place,"" she says. ""But in order for those parental controls to be in effect, a child does need to have their own account.""

But be aware, there are dozens of different AI chatbots that kids could be using. ""We identified 88 different AI platforms that kids were interacting with,"" says Kollins.

This underscores the importance of having an open dialogue with your child to stay aware of what they're using.

5. Set time limits

Nagata also advises setting boundaries around when kids use digital technology, especially at nighttime.

""One potential aspect of generative AI that can also lead to mental health and physical health impacts are [when] kids are chatting all night long and it's really disrupting their sleep,"" says Nagata. ""Because they're very personalized conversations, they're very engaging. Kids are more likely to continue to engage and have more and more use.""

And if a child is veering toward overuse and misuse of generative AI, Nagata recommends that parents set time limits or limit certain kinds of content on chatbots.

6. Seek help for more vulnerable teens

Kids who are already struggling with their mental health or social skills are more likely to be vulnerable to the risks of chatbots, says Nesi.

""So if they're already lonely, if they're already isolated, then I think there's a bigger risk that maybe a chatbot could then exacerbate those issues,"" she says.

And it's also important to keep an eye on potential warning signs of poor mental health, she notes.

Those warning signs involve sudden and persistent changes in mood, isolation or changes in how engaged they are at school.

""Parents should be as much as possible trying to pay attention to the whole picture of the child,"" says Nesi. ""How are they doing in school? How are they doing with friends? How are they doing at home if they are starting to withdraw?""

If a teen is withdrawing from friends and family and restricting their social interactions to just the chatbot, that too is a warning sign, she says. ""Are they going to the chatbot instead of a friend or instead of a therapist or instead of responsible adults about serious issues?

Also look for signs of dependence or addiction to a chatbot, she adds. ""Are they having difficulty controlling how much they are using a chatbot? Like, is it starting to feel like it's controlling them? They kind of can't stop,"" she says.

And if they see those signs, parents should reach out to a professional for help, says Nesi.

""Speaking to a child's pediatrician is always a good first step,"" she says. ""But in most cases, getting a mental health professional involved is probably going to make sense.""

7. The government has a role to play

But, she acknowledges that the job of keeping children and teens safe from this technology shouldn't just fall upon parents.

""There's a responsibility, you know, from lawmakers, from the companies themselves to make these products safe for teens.""

Lawmakers in Congress recently introduced bipartisan legislation to ban tech companies from offering companion apps for minors and to hold companies accountable for making available to minors companion apps that produce or solicit sexual content.

Most bills in the California Legislature are barely talked about in public before lawmakers take action, often after secret negotiations with lobbyists.

But a handful of controversial proposals broke through the usual rushed process, drawing hours of testimony and intense public lobbying from some of the state’s most powerful organizations that spend millions of dollars to get their way, according to an analysis of CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database, which tracks every word spoken in the Legislature.

That’s compared to the overall 2025 average, which showed lawmakers and advocates spent just 32 minutes publicly talking about each of the 1,657 bills that were discussed in at least one hearing.

These were the 10 most debated bills of the 2025 regular legislative session, according to Digital Democracy.

(Note: Advocacy groups listed below may have changed their positions as the bills were amended.)

Divide over antisemitism bill

Bill: Assembly Bill 715

Lead author: Democratic assemblymembers Dawn Addis of San Luis Obispo and Rick Zbur of Los Angeles.

Time discussed: 15 hours

Approximate number of speakers: 486

Why it was a talker: California’s Jewish lawmakers made countering antisemitism in schools their top priority this year, but opposing the bill was a coalition of education groups, unions, civil rights advocates and Muslim community organizations who feared censorship of pro-Palestinian voices and infringement on academic freedom. The groups turned out in droves to testify.

Number of groups in support: At least 68, including the Jewish Community Action, the Los Angeles County Business Federation and the Simon Wiesenthal Center.

Number of groups opposed: At least 92, including the California Federation of Teachers, the California Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the California School Boards Association.

Status: Signed into law.

Local governments balk at transit-oriented housing

Bill: Senate Bill 79

Lead author: Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco

Time discussed: 6 hours, 40 minutes

Approximate number of speakers: 198

Why it was a talker: Local governments balked at a new state mandate allowing developers to build midrise apartment buildings within walking distance of many major train, light-rail, subway and high-frequency rapid bus stations — even if local zoning restrictions would otherwise ban such dense development.

Number of groups in support: At least 49, including pro home-building groups and the California Apartment Association.

Number of groups opposed: At least 76, including, at one point, the building trades unions, the California Association of Realtors and dozens of municipalities.

Status: Signed into law.

Charter schools oppose new restrictions

Bill: Assembly Bill 84

Lead authors: Democratic assemblymembers Robert Garcia of Rancho Cucamonga and Al Muratsuchi of Torrance.

Time discussed: 6 hours, 32 minutes

Approximate number of speakers: 491

Why it was a talker: This was the latest legislative effort by California’s powerful teachers unions and their allies to add restrictions and oversight to charter schools. Homeschool families and charter schools opposed the measure, introduced in response to high-profile charter school fraud scandals, saying it would strip millions of dollars in state funding from their programs. The bill added auditing requirements and new fees as well as a proposed new Office of Inspector General inside the Department of Education.

Number of groups in support: At least six, almost all influential unions.

Number of groups opposed: More than 200, many of them charter schools or home school groups.

Status: Failed in the Senate.

Uproar over teen sexual solicitation

Bill: Assembly Bill 379

Lead author: Democratic Assemblymember Stephanie Nguyen of Elk Grove

Time discussed: 5 hours, 28 minutes

Approximate number of speakers: 149

Why it was a talker: This bill, originally written by Democratic Assemblywoman Maggy Krell, a former state prosecutor, sought to increase penalties for soliciting teen sex. But the legislation sparked difficult discussions between progressive and moderate members of the Democratic caucus about how hard to crack down on those accused of soliciting sex from minors, based on whether the victims were younger or older teenagers.

Number of groups in support: At least 48, including law enforcement unions and some Native American tribes.

Number of groups opposed: At least 25, including ACLU and various advocates for progressive criminal justice reforms.

Status: Signed into law.

Lots to say about ICE agent masks

Bill: Senate Bill 627

Lead authors: Democratic Sen. Jessie Arreguín of Berkeley and three other senators

Time discussed: 5 hours

Approximate number of speakers: 100

Why it was a talker: Members of California’s Democratic legislative supermajority aren’t shy about speaking their minds on President Donald Trump and his controversial immigration policies, so it’s no surprise that there was a lot of discussion over California’s first-in-the nation measure to prohibit federal immigration officers and local police from wearing masks in California.

Number of groups in support: At least 45, including non-police unions, public defenders, the ACLU and immigrant rights groups.

Number of groups opposed: At least 16, almost all of them police unions.

Status: Signed into law

Democrats pitch gerrymander to counter Texas

Bill: Assembly Bill 604

Lead author: Democratic Assemblymember Cecilia Aguiar-Curry of Davis and Sen. Lena Gonzalez of Long Beach

Time discussed: 4 hours, 58 minutes

Approximate number of speakers: 76

Why it was a talker: There were plenty of heated discussions after California Democrats put forward their own gerrymandering plan after Trump pressured Texas to change its congressional maps to make new Republican districts.

Number of groups in support: At least 54, including labor unions and progressive groups.

Number of groups opposed: At least 19, including California Common Cause, Govern for California and conservative groups.

Status: Signed into law, approved by voters

Energy bill gets lengthy debate

Bill: Senate Bill 254

Lead authors: Democratic Sen. Josh Becker of Menlo Park and two other lawmakers

Time discussed: 4 hours, 55 minutes

Approximate number of speakers: 119

Why it was a talker: This energy bill created a new public financing system for electric transmission projects and extended a controversial program that shields utilities from some wildfire liability costs, but critics warned it could ultimately drive consumer bills higher. It was part of a package of energy and climate measures the Legislature passed this year.

Number of groups in support: At least 55, including trades unions, the California Democratic Party, the California Chamber of Commerce, environmental groups and the California Municipal Utilities Association.

Number of groups opposed: At least seven, including the California Farm Bureau Federation, Rural County Representatives of California and the California State Association of Counties.

Status: Signed into law.

Fees for veterans’ benefits draws testimony

Bill: Senate Bill 694

Lead author: Democratic Sens. Bob Archuleta of Norwalk and Sabrina Cervantes of Riverside

Time discussed: 4 hours, 39 minutes

Approximate number of speakers: 99

Why it was a talker: For years, veterans advocates have wanted a state law preventing companies from charging exorbitant fees to help veterans file federal disability benefits claims, something they can do for free through the government and certain veterans’ organizations. But the Legislature has repeatedly balked, as companies claim they provide an important service to help veterans get the benefits they need.

Number of groups in support: At least 25, including the California State Association of Counties and the American Legion.

Number of groups opposed: At least nine, including Veterans Guardian, one of the companies that files claims.

Status: The bill did not pass the Senate, although lawmakers announced they had a deal on the legislation and would vote on it in January.

Should AT&T opt out of landlines?

Bill: Assembly Bill 470

Lead author: Democratic Assemblymember Tina McKinnor of Inglewood

Time discussed: 4 hours, 13 minutes

Approximate number of speakers: 209

Why it was a talker: AT&T has spent millions in lobbying as it tried unsuccessfully to bow out of its legal requirement to provide copper landlines in much of the state. Rural communities and others pushed back, leading to some of the lengthiest discussions in the Legislature this year.

Number of groups in support: At least 145, including AT&T, some tribes and other groups aligned with the telecommunications company.

Number of groups opposed: At least 96, including rural counties, some unions and AARP.

Status: Failed in the Senate

Banning junk food at schools causes a stir

Bill: Assembly Bill 1264

Lead author: Democratic Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel of Encino

Imagine topping off your gas tank while flying down a stretch of highway equipped with futuristic gas pumps. Well, dream on, Klingon. Gassing up at 70 mph is not going to happen any time soon. In the meantime, though, the dream of wireless EV charging-on-the-go is getting closer to reality. Somewhat ironically, two deep red states — Florida and Indiana — are among the those leading the charge.

Florida To Michigan: Hold My Beer

The idea of an “electric highway” did seem rather futuristic when it surfaced on the CleanTechnica radar back in 2013, but by 2021 Michigan was ready to announce plans for the first wireless charging infrastructure on a public road in the US. Installation was completed in November of 2023, with the in-road infrastructure provided by the Israeli startup Electreon and the EVs provided by Ford’s E-Transit electric delivery van branch.

In November of 2024, Michigan also engaged Electreon in a new partnership with the EV startup Xos, aimed at bringing in-road wireless charging to more commercial delivery vehicles. By October of this year, plans were also in the works to install charging infrastructure in additional roadways.

In the meantime, Florida has been hatching plans of its own. The Florida project recently made the news after local station WFTV provided its viewers with an exclusive sneak peek at the work in progress, but the wheels were set in motion more than three years ago when the Central Florida Expressway Authority (CFX) teased word of an in-motion EV charging pilot project to be showcased in the new State Road 516 in Lake and Orange County.

State Road 516 is not just any old new road. Inspired by a living mobility test bed called “The Ray” in Georgia, the new 4.4-mile highway is designed as a showcase for new mobility technologies along with solar power and a more sustainable approach to highway landscaping. CFX launched plans for the new road in 2022 and CleanTechnica’s Carolyn Fortuna picked up the thread in June of 2024, taking note of a wildlife underpass, recreational trail, and native plantings along with technical details on the in-road charging system.

How Does It Work?

Futuristic as it seems, the technology pieces for in-road EV charging have been in place for some time. As CFX points out, if you have a wirelessly rechargeable electric toothbrush or smart phone, or for that matter, an induction stovetop, you have living proof that wireless inductive power transfer is a real thing. The same principle has already scaled up into stationary wireless charging for EVs, and the next step is to make it work on the fly.

For the State Road 516 project, the agency selected the US wireless charging firm ENRX (formerly IPT Technology). “Energy flows from the pre-assembled ground winding coils to a receiver pad under the vehicle through electromagnetic induction,” CFX explains.

“The technology can detect an electric vehicle is directly above it, making the lane safe for all other drivers to use, as well as the surrounding environment,” they add.

“The ENRX Charge 200 kW Electrified Roadway Technology will be able to power all vehicle classes using the roadway: passenger cars, medium-duty delivery vans, and heavy-duty trucks and buses,” CFX elaborated.

If all goes according to plan, ENRX will install its technology on approximately one mile of the new road, from Route 27 to Cork Road, but don’t get too excited just yet. It will only be available to drivers participating in the pilot project with specially equipped EVs.

Wireless EV Charging In Indiana

Each in its own way, Michigan and Florida are both ripe environments for in-road EV charging. Michigan is practically a no-brainer considering its pivotal role in automotive innovation, and Florida happens to be one of the nation’s top three leaders in EV sales, jockeying with Texas for the #2 slot behind California.

Into the mix jumps Indiana, which barely registered a blip in EV sales as of 2024, according to a state-by-state breakdown posted by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in December of 2025. Still, it’s not for lack of trying.

“Despite its former reputation as one of the nation’s top 10 coal producing states and its ongoing status as host of the iconic gas-guzzling Indy 500 auto racing event, Indiana emerged as an early promoter of vehicle electrification back in 2010,” CleanTechnica observed in 2023, taking note of an in-road charging project deploying technology developed by a team of engineers at Purdue University.

Purdue celebrated a test of the new system on December 3 of this year, calling it the first ever in-road wireless EV charging to be demonstrated on a heavy duty truck at highway speeds. The electrified road, constructed by the Indiana Department of Transportation, is located on a 1/4-mile segment of US Highway 52/231 in West Lafayette. For the record, the electric semi was provided by Cummins.

Purdue notes that dynamically charging an electric truck at highway speeds is a next-level challenge compared to charging delivery trucks on local roads. “A few other states and countries have also begun testing roads designed to enable dynamic wireless power transfer. But making this possible for highways — and particularly for semis and other heavy-duty vehicles — is a unique challenge,” the school explains. “Because vehicles travel so much faster on highways than city roads, they need to be charged at higher power levels.”

“The Purdue-designed wireless charging system works at power levels much higher than what has been demonstrated in the U.S. so far,” the school elaborated, citing the delivery of 190 kilowatts to a heavy duty electric truck going 65 miles per hour. Purdue also emphasized that the same infrastructure will also support dynamic charging for smaller vehicles with lower power needs.

EV Charging & The War On EVs

Part of the enthusiasm over dynamic charging is the convenience factor. Another significant factor is the potential for reducing the size, weight, and cost of batteries needed for a typical EV. That’s particularly important for commercial EVs, which can save precious cargo space by reducing the area set aside for battery packs.

The forward momentum on dynamic charging is yet another demonstration of the staying power of the vehicle electrification movement in the US. Despite the recent, sharp downslide in EV sales following the premature expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit on September 30, activity among conventional charging station stakeholders is continuing at breakneck pace as convenience stores, quick-serve restaurants and other travel-friendly retailers compete for traffic.

In addition, domestic startups including Slate, Telo Trucks, and Faraday Future are moving ahead with plans to introduce new EVs to the US market in 2026 or shortly after. The Scout Motors branch of Volkswagen is also following through on its EV plans, though so far most of its reservations are for hybrid vehicles with on-board gasoline generators to supplement the battery.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/electric-highway-ev-charging-purdue.png,N,,2025-12-29 15:59:23.394057

Digital infrastructure developer Hut 8 is heading to West Feliciana Parish in southeast Louisiana with plans to deliver an up to 1,000-megawatt (MW) data center campus over the next two years. The future River Bend campus has already moved into phase one of its construction, which is estimated to cost upwards of $10 billion alone. Software company Fluidstack is set to become a tenant at the site, a move financially backed by Google who will cover the lease and related pass-through obligations at the campus.

A $135 million investment has been announced with a focus on the company’s Automated Pouch Operations, which produce nicotine and caffeine oral pouches. Growing demand for smokeless products led to the decision to expand Swisher’s 101-year-old site in Springfield, which will create up to 240 new jobs in the region. Project details include the construction of a new 120,000 sq. ft. manufacturing facility at the Historic Springfield site, featuring advanced manufacturing equipment to support production needs. Swisher International anticipates the new facility will become operational by 2028. The Jacksonville City Council is supporting the expansion investment with a five year, 50% Recapture Enhanced Value Grant on ad valorem tax revenue for up to $3.5 million.

From the impact of federal legislation and regulations to useful resources and beyond, explore the topics that mattered the most to you over the last year.

1. Local Impacts from Congress’ One, Big, Beautiful Bill

On July 3, the House passed the Senate’s version of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (H.R. 1) in a vote of 218-214, and President Trump signed the bill into law on July 4.

Our most popular CitiesSpeak blog post of 2025 explored the key provisions from the final bill and its impact to local governments, including support, areas of concern and topics for awareness.

2. Act Now if You’re Behind on ARPA SLFRF: Non-Compliance Explained

The State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) program under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) was a historic, first-of-its-kind direct investment in cities, towns and villages of all sizes. The SLFRF program was specifically established to help communities manage and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. For many local governments, this was the first time they had received a direct federal grant, and understandably, the reporting requirements and compliance obligations have come with a learning curve.

With the reporting portal officially closing at the end of March, our blog post answered common questions from cities on how to stay compliant with SLFRF.

3. Data Centers and Local Environmental Considerations

Data centers are physical sites that host the hardware, such as computer servers and telecommunications equipment, required for on-site or cloud data storage, as well as artificial intelligence (AI) computing.

Our blog post, which explores how the use of AI and data centers impacts local communities, covers key takeaways from a joint session of NLC’s Energy Environment and Natural Resources (EENR) and Information Technology and Communications (ITC) Federal Advocacy committees at the 2025 Congressional City Conference. During the session, elected officials shared several issues they consider when faced with data center development.

4. FEMA Act of 2025: What Local Leaders Need to Know

The Fixing Emergency Management for Americans (FEMA) Act of 2025 (H.R. 4669) represents one of the most significant updates to federal disaster management law in decades. It reorganizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), modernizes disaster assistance programs and changes how aid is delivered to communities.

For cities, towns and villages, the Act introduces reforms that affect how quickly funding arrives, how rules are applied and how residents access support. Our blog post covered the FEMA essentials that local leaders need to know.

5. Make the Pledge to House Homeless Veterans

No veteran should be homeless in the country they swore an oath to defend. A guest post by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) detailed the Mayor’s Pledge, a national initiative encouraging mayors to engage landlords within their communities to offer their available rental units to veterans participating in the VA’s homeless programs.

6. Real Stories, Real Needs: What Comes Next for Shutdown-Affected Communities

In the midst of the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history, our blog post highlighted the response of several communities, including how they’ve kept essential services running and communicated openly with their residents.

7. Where Does the Opioid Crisis Stand Today in Local Communities?

Sixty-one percent of municipal leaders indicate the opioid crisis is one of the top issues — or the top issue — impacting their community. Our blog post highlighted the need for attention to the opioid crisis, particularly as many cities, towns and villages report having inadequate resources to respond.

8. Drones Above Your City — How Cities Engage with Federal Officials on Drones

Spotting a drone in the sky is becoming more normal in the U.S. Our blog post explored how local leaders can report unsafe drone flights, as well as understand the improvements needed in federal drone policy.

9. A Comprehensive Guide for Local Leaders on Managing PFAS Waste

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are of concern because they are found in common household items such as non-stick cookware, certain garments and fabrics and personal care products. When exposed to these chemicals, studies indicate that they can harm human health in a myriad of ways, including delaying development for children, inhibiting fertility in women and a deterioration of immune functions.

Our blog post directed local leaders on steps to take for PFAS, from understanding the extent of exposure in their community to managing mitigation efforts.

10. Update on Elective Pay Tax Credits: What Cities Need to Know

The Elective Pay (also called Direct Pay) program — established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) — is designed to provide clean energy tax credits directly to eligible entities, including local governments. This program is a game-changer for cities, towns and villages looking to advance clean energy projects without relying on traditional tax equity financing. Recent updates offer key insights for local governments seeking to capitalize on these incentives.",https://www.nlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2219881058-1280x853-1-edited.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 17:58:37.387674

Bechman,,,,,https://www.farmprogress.com/technology/don-t-let-technology-get-in-the-way-of-farming,"Jesse Williams uses precision technology from planting through harvest on his 1,000-acre farm in Polk County, Neb.
Precision technology tools and techniques help do it more effectively, Williams said.
“A professor of mine, Randy Shoemaker, said: ‘Don’t let the technology get in the way of science,’” Charlson said.
“I tweaked the saying: ‘Don’t let technology get in the way of farming.’ Precision technology helps us be more efficient.
“We have more control over management, like seeding rates, applying fertilizer correctly and utilizing variable-rate technology.","Jesse Williams uses precision technology from planting through harvest on his 1,000-acre farm in Polk County, Neb. From grid soil sampling to variable-rate nitrogen application, he uses state-of-the-art technology to provide the information he needs to make decisions. Then he relies on technology to help execute practices like variable-rate applications in the field.

Yet in everything Williams does, the goal is obvious. He is after maximum profitability. Precision technology tools and techniques help do it more effectively, Williams said.

Dirk Charlson, Extension educator specializing in digital agriculture at the University of Nebraska, views precision agriculture as tools to help people farm better, and not as the be-all and end-all, by itself.

“A professor of mine, Randy Shoemaker, said: ‘Don’t let the technology get in the way of science,’” Charlson said. “His point was remembering what was most important — the science of what you were studying, not the technology.

“I tweaked the saying: ‘Don’t let technology get in the way of farming.’ Precision technology helps us be more efficient. But we aren’t buying it just to have technology. We invest in it to solve problems and manage our farms better.”

Managing variability

The goal of farming is profitability, even if it is also a way of life, Charlson said. Variability is a major obstacle.

“Variability consists of inconsistent yields over years and space, and variability leads to uncertainty, including whether farming will be profitable,” Charlson said. “That is why risk management is important.”

Precision agriculture offers options that can reduce risk, he noted. Ag economists developed a systems framework to illustrate how precision tools can help, called GEMS. These factors interact together:

“Genetics is hybrid or variety choice, but it is more than that too,” Charlson said. “It is also about biology and change that comes with cover crops. We have least control over environment, which starts with weather patterns and includes interactions related to soil type, pests and nonbiological stresses.

“We have more control over management, like seeding rates, applying fertilizer correctly and utilizing variable-rate technology. Socioeconomic centers on risk management. How much risk are you willing to take? How does equipment cost factor in?”

Simple example

The goal is to use precision ag tools to manage GEMS interactions and achieve profitability, Charlson said. Identify sources of variation and yield-limiting factors, either natural or man-made. Start with analyzing yield maps. Then apply the GEMS concept to determine variation you can reduce.

Suppose there are two soil types in a field: a loam and a sandy soil. The sandy soil is drought-prone. Use GEMS to reach possible solutions:

Genetics. Select corn hybrids with drought-tolerance on the sandy soil.

Environment. If it’s available, increase irrigation on the sandy soil.

Management. Lower seeding rates on the sandy soil, increase them on the loam, and consider placing hybrids by soil type with a multi-hybrid planter.

Socioeconomics. Factor in cost of a variable-rate and/or multi-hybrid planter, and cost of variable-rate irrigation. These adjustments with precision tools are possible today — but will they pay?

“You don’t have to make all changes in one year,” Charlson concluded. “It could be a multiyear plan implemented over time.”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/bltc7e8d3cbf3449101/6942d07492e6d6e5897c0827/1229M1-5750-1800x1012.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-29 15:13:31.483047

At this time in 2024, Michigan was expecting a windfall of federal funds to fuel a transition to clean energy, along with billions of dollars’ worth of green manufacturing projects subsidized by the Biden administration’s signature climate spending bills.

But since President Donald Trump began his second term in January and began scrapping federal climate programs he refers to collectively as “the green new scam,” Michigan has seen a wave of project and grant cancellations, along with renewed investment in fossil fuel-based manufacturing and power generation.

Roughly $540 million in climate-related grants to Michigan have been canceled or held up since Inauguration Day, according to a national database compiled by Atlas Public Policy, while shifting market forces and the end of federal tax credits for electric vehicles have caused clean manufacturing investments in Michigan to whipsaw from billions annually in recent years to $3 billion in canceled investments this year.

“It certainly mirrors what we’re seeing nationally,” said Annabelle Rosser, a research analyst with the national firm.

Instead, Michigan automakers are scaling back and refocusing on gas and hybrid vehicle production — a trend emblemized by Ford’s and General Motors’ recent decisions to scrap EV production plans at Michigan plants and retool to produce gas-powered vehicles.

“That’s just the way the market is shaking out right now,” said Glenn Stevens, executive director of MichAuto, an affiliate of the Detroit Regional Chamber.

It’s a trend likely to continue into 2026, as Trump administration officials continue their efforts to downplay climate change, deemphasize renewable energy and embrace fossil fuels.

Here’s where things stand in Michigan as the year draws to a close:

$540 million in canceled funding

Michigan has seen $540 million in canceled funding, with the biggest chunk coming from the Solar for All Program, a $7 billion US Environmental Protection Agency fund meant to expand solar energy in disadvantaged communities.

Michigan had been slated to receive a $156 million grant through that fund, while Native American tribes in the state were expecting part of a $62 million grant shared with other Great Lakes tribes.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has sued over the grant cancellations, joining 22 other states to argue the administration “unilaterally and illegally terminated” the program, overstepping checks and balances to cancel congressionally approved funding.

Beyond the solar program, the federal government has canceled or proposed to cancel more than 20 Michigan grants ranging from $31.7 million to help LuxWall Inc. build an energy-efficient window glass factory in Detroit to $14,000 for a west Michigan climate resilience project.

Other canceled grants include:

1. $28.2 million for TS Conductor to build a high-capacity power line plant in Erie

2. $20.4 million for Ecoworks, a Detroit nonprofit that planned to convert houses of worship into climate resilience hubs

3. $20 million for the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan toimprove energy efficiency in tribal homes

4. $20 million for the Southwestern Michigan Planning Commission to build two resilience hubs in Benton Harbor, upgrade energy efficiency in low-income housing and support a workforce development initiative

Smaller grants would have funded energy efficient housing in Kalamazoo, a climate change and resilience plan for the city of Flint and wild rice bed restoration in Michigan waterways.

The Trump administration has also frozen a $20 billion federal “green bank” network that had been expected to send hundreds of millions of dollars to Michigan to build and rehab housing across the state, insulate old homes and boost energy efficiency in factories.

Trump officials have signaled that more cancellations could be coming as they review tens of billions of dollars in clean energy funds awarded by the previous administration.

Michigan utilities, for example, are awaiting word on the status of $15 billion in clean energy-related loans announced days before Trump took office. And the Trump administration is reevaluating a grant program that awarded $500 million to retool a Lansing GM factory for electrified vehicles.

An exception to the administration’s shift of resources away from Biden-era energy policies: It has continued making disbursements from a $1.5 billion loan authorized in 2024 to support the reopening of the Palisades nuclear power plant and in December announced another $400 million to develop two new reactors at the site.

“President Trump has made clear that America is going to build more energy, not less, and nuclear is central to that mission,” US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a statement accompanying the grant announcement.

$3 billion in canceled projects

Spurred along by federal and state subsidies and regulations that encouraged automakers to build EVs and consumers to buy them, Michigan manufacturers announced a collective $23.8 billion in new investments tied to the energy transition between 2022 and 2024, mostly related to battery or EV plants.

Fast-forward to 2025, and the trendline has reversed. Michigan saw $3 billion worth of disinvestment this year as companies scrapped planned EV factories or closed existing ones, according to the Atlas analysis.

Spokespeople for the US Department of Energy, which has overseen efforts to reprioritize fossil fuels by shifting federal resources and loosening vehicle emissions regulations, did not respond to requests for comment from Bridge Michigan.

But Trump has routinely cast EVs as a costly “scam” while downplaying the effects of climate change caused by burning fossil fuels like gasoline. During a December announcement that his administration would loosen fuel economy standards applying to new vehicles, Trump cast his pro-gas policies as a win for consumers that would “protect American jobs” and shave “at least $1,000 off the price of a new car.”

The biggest EV-related cancellation is the Gotion project, a once-planned $2.4 billion electric vehicle battery plant near Big Rapids that spent years embroiled in controversy before state officials declared the project dead this fall.

In that case, Rosser, the Atlas analyst, said, shifting federal policies weren’t the only factor.

“The rollback of the (Inflation Reduction Act) clean energy tax credits, softening demand for electric vehicles, and concerns about the company’s foreign ownership are all likely factors,” Rosser said.

This fall, battery maker XALT Energy announced plans to close its Midland headquarters and an Auburn Hills facility just two years after announcing plans to spend a “double digit million sum” expanding the facility.

Automotive supplier Dana Inc., which had vowed to invest $54.2 million at an Auburn Hills EV battery plant by the end of 2024, instead announced this fall that it would close the plant amid an “unexpected and immediate reduction in customer orders driven by lower demand for electric vehicles.”

Fortescue canceled an under-construction $210 million EV charger, battery and hydrogen generator plant at the former Fisher Body site in Detroit, citing shifting US markets and policies including the loss of “critical tax credits.”

Other losses included the closure of an Akasol electric vehicle battery factory in Warren and canceled plans to build a TS Conductor high-voltage direct current conductor plant in Erie using a since-canceled $28 million federal grant.

TS Conductor is still building the plant, but switched locations to South Carolina after receiving what company CEO Jason Huang described as a “very generous incentive package.”

Timelines and ambitions for numerous other EV and battery factory projects in Michigan have shifted amid the changing policies and market forces. GM, for instance, sold its stake in a planned EV battery factory near Lansing to LG Energy Solution and the plant’s planned opening has been delayed from 2025 to 2026. And Ford has scaled back plans for an EV battery plant near Marshall, now slated to open in 2026.

Stevens said he expects the EV market to grow in 2026, but “it’s not going to be at the acceleration curve that a lot of people projected, and certainly the previous administration was pushing.”

This fall, battery maker XALT Energy announced plans to close its Midland headquarters and an Auburn Hills facility just two years after announcing plans to spend a “double digit million sum” expanding the facility.

Automotive supplier Dana Inc., which had vowed to invest $54.2 million at an Auburn Hills EV battery plant by the end of 2024, instead announced this fall that it would close the plant amid an “unexpected and immediate reduction in customer orders driven by lower demand for electric vehicles.”

Fortescue canceled an under-construction $210 million EV charger, battery and hydrogen generator plant at the former Fisher Body site in Detroit, citing shifting US markets and policies including the loss of “critical tax credits.”

Other losses included the closure of an Akasol electric vehicle battery factory in Warren and canceled plans to build a TS Conductor high-voltage direct current conductor plant in Erie using a since-canceled $28 million federal grant.

TS Conductor is still building the plant, but switched locations to South Carolina after receiving what company CEO Jason Huang described as a “very generous incentive package.”

Timelines and ambitions for numerous other EV and battery factory projects in Michigan have shifted amid the changing policies and market forces. GM, for instance, sold its stake in a planned EV battery factory near Lansing to LG Energy Solution and the plant’s planned opening has been delayed from 2025 to 2026.

And Ford has scaled back plans for an EV battery plant near Marshall, now slated to open in 2026.","What a difference a year (and a political leadership change) makes.

At this time in 2024, Michigan was expecting a windfall of federal funds to fuel a transition to clean energy, along with billions of dollars’ worth of green manufacturing projects subsidized by the Biden administration’s signature climate spending bills.

But since President Donald Trump began his second term in January and began scrapping federal climate programs he refers to collectively as “the green new scam,” Michigan has seen a wave of project and grant cancellations, along with renewed investment in fossil fuel-based manufacturing and power generation.

Roughly $540 million in climate-related grants to Michigan have been canceled or held up since Inauguration Day, according to a national database compiled by Atlas Public Policy, while shifting market forces and the end of federal tax credits for electric vehicles have caused clean manufacturing investments in Michigan to whipsaw from billions annually in recent years to $3 billion in canceled investments this year.

“It certainly mirrors what we’re seeing nationally,” said Annabelle Rosser, a research analyst with the national firm.

Instead, Michigan automakers are scaling back and refocusing on gas and hybrid vehicle production — a trend emblemized by Ford’s and General Motors’ recent decisions to scrap EV production plans at Michigan plants and retool to produce gas-powered vehicles.

“That’s just the way the market is shaking out right now,” said Glenn Stevens, executive director of MichAuto, an affiliate of the Detroit Regional Chamber.

It’s a trend likely to continue into 2026, as Trump administration officials continue their efforts to downplay climate change, deemphasize renewable energy and embrace fossil fuels.

Here’s where things stand in Michigan as the year draws to a close:

$540 million in canceled funding

Michigan has seen $540 million in canceled funding, with the biggest chunk coming from the Solar for All Program, a $7 billion US Environmental Protection Agency fund meant to expand solar energy in disadvantaged communities.

Michigan had been slated to receive a $156 million grant through that fund, while Native American tribes in the state were expecting part of a $62 million grant shared with other Great Lakes tribes.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has sued over the grant cancellations, joining 22 other states to argue the administration “unilaterally and illegally terminated” the program, overstepping checks and balances to cancel congressionally approved funding.

Beyond the solar program, the federal government has canceled or proposed to cancel more than 20 Michigan grants ranging from $31.7 million to help LuxWall Inc. build an energy-efficient window glass factory in Detroit to $14,000 for a west Michigan climate resilience project.

Other canceled grants include:

1. $28.2 million for TS Conductor to build a high-capacity power line plant in Erie

2. $20.4 million for Ecoworks, a Detroit nonprofit that planned to convert houses of worship into climate resilience hubs

3. $20 million for the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan toimprove energy efficiency in tribal homes

4. $20 million for the Southwestern Michigan Planning Commission to build two resilience hubs in Benton Harbor, upgrade energy efficiency in low-income housing and support a workforce development initiative

Smaller grants would have funded energy efficient housing in Kalamazoo, a climate change and resilience plan for the city of Flint and wild rice bed restoration in Michigan waterways.

The Trump administration has also frozen a $20 billion federal “green bank” network that had been expected to send hundreds of millions of dollars to Michigan to build and rehab housing across the state, insulate old homes and boost energy efficiency in factories.

Trump officials have signaled that more cancellations could be coming as they review tens of billions of dollars in clean energy funds awarded by the previous administration.

Michigan utilities, for example, are awaiting word on the status of $15 billion in clean energy-related loans announced days before Trump took office. And the Trump administration is reevaluating a grant program that awarded $500 million to retool a Lansing GM factory for electrified vehicles.

An exception to the administration’s shift of resources away from Biden-era energy policies: It has continued making disbursements from a $1.5 billion loan authorized in 2024 to support the reopening of the Palisades nuclear power plant and in December announced another $400 million to develop two new reactors at the site.

“President Trump has made clear that America is going to build more energy, not less, and nuclear is central to that mission,” US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a statement accompanying the grant announcement.

$3 billion in canceled projects

Spurred along by federal and state subsidies and regulations that encouraged automakers to build EVs and consumers to buy them, Michigan manufacturers announced a collective $23.8 billion in new investments tied to the energy transition between 2022 and 2024, mostly related to battery or EV plants.

Fast-forward to 2025, and the trendline has reversed. Michigan saw $3 billion worth of disinvestment this year as companies scrapped planned EV factories or closed existing ones, according to the Atlas analysis.

Spokespeople for the US Department of Energy, which has overseen efforts to reprioritize fossil fuels by shifting federal resources and loosening vehicle emissions regulations, did not respond to requests for comment from Bridge Michigan.

But Trump has routinely cast EVs as a costly “scam” while downplaying the effects of climate change caused by burning fossil fuels like gasoline. During a December announcement that his administration would loosen fuel economy standards applying to new vehicles, Trump cast his pro-gas policies as a win for consumers that would “protect American jobs” and shave “at least $1,000 off the price of a new car.”

The biggest EV-related cancellation is the Gotion project, a once-planned $2.4 billion electric vehicle battery plant near Big Rapids that spent years embroiled in controversy before state officials declared the project dead this fall.

In that case, Rosser, the Atlas analyst, said, shifting federal policies weren’t the only factor.

“The rollback of the (Inflation Reduction Act) clean energy tax credits, softening demand for electric vehicles, and concerns about the company’s foreign ownership are all likely factors,” Rosser said.

This fall, battery maker XALT Energy announced plans to close its Midland headquarters and an Auburn Hills facility just two years after announcing plans to spend a “double digit million sum” expanding the facility.

Windrose has released an updated U.S. zero-emissions trucking map detailing current coverage in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Texas for its Class 8 R700 battery-electric semi truck.

The map, pictured below, displays ""all of the routes we cover today, including I-5, I-10, I-15 and I-35,"" states Windrose founder, chairman, and CEO Wen Han in a LinkedIn post.

""Happy holidays and buckle up for a series of collaborations that we will announce with charging partners to help reduce (or eliminate) the cost of EV truck charging to help customers get started,"" Han continued.

The bulk of Windrose's U.S. operations, for now, clearly remain in the Southwest though this is expected to change.

Windrose's big plans

Windrose confirmed nearly a year ago it received the certificate of conformity from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), meaning the R700 has met the government agency's fuel economy and emissions requirements.

Knowing that, what about a production start and delivery dates?

Speaking to Clean Trucking at ACT 2025, Mr. Han stated that production was set to get underway in Q3 of this year in California, but this has clearly been delayed, which is not surprising nor unexpected for a young company.

[Related: Windrose CEO Wen Han's bold U.S. market plan is underway]

As a global manufacturer, Windrose, founded in 2022, has a production site in Antwerp, Belgium for EU-bound semis. Final assembly for the Asian and Oceania markets takes place in those regions.

Mr. Han added that the company is ""looking to build a bigger site in France and then a bigger site in the U.S. We're down to a small number of sections or a small number of states, [including] Canada. Now it's just a matter of which one we find to be the best match.""

Major components, including the chassis, e-axles, batteries, and suspension are expected to be manufactured in China.

Windrose vs Tesla

The Windrose R700 is equipped with a 729 kWh battery, an 800V high-voltage platform capable of megawatt-level dual-inlet charging, and a loaded autonomous range of around 420 miles with a gross weight of 98,000 lbs. A base price of around $250,000 is expected.

To compare, the Tesla Semi, due to begin series production in 2026, boasts a choice of two battery sizes (500 and 800 kWh), a 1,000V powertrain charging system, a maximum 500-mile range, and a gross weight of 82,000 lbs. Tesla has not announced final pricing.

Windrose R700 hits the road

Earlier this year Windrose joined forces with Phoenix, Ariz.-based JoyRide Logistics and EO Charging, resulting in the release of real-world performance results that are no doubt impressive.

The truck had previously demonstrated very impressive capabilities, achieving an estimated 420-mile range on a single charge and completing a 2,800-mile U.S. cross-country trip using only public charging stations.

It also successfully completed a full-route validation covering 578 miles round trip (289 miles one way), from Colton, California, to Buckeye, Arizona.

During the NACFE Run on Less event, held from September 8 to 30, 2025, live telematics data showed that the R700 spent most of its time driving (65.9%), with smaller portions inactive (25.3%), idling (7.05%), and charging (1.77%), highlighting efficient utilization.

It successfully used both a Megawatt Charging System (MCS) and Combined Charging System (CCS) chargers, reaching charging speeds of up to 738 kW at Greenlane sites. Despite its advanced electric systems, the truck maintained Class 8 performance with a curb weight under 26,000 pounds—some reports noting it below 24,000 pounds—allowing it to carry competitive payloads.

Windrose R700 reservations are open

Windrose is currently accepting U.S. reservations for its long-range R700 semi (670 km/416 miles) through its official website. A $15,000 deposit per truck is required, excluding taxes.

Designed for flexibility, it can be embedded in power electronics, installed on a distribution line or even plugged into a wall outlet.
Utilities in places like Hawaii and Texas are using the device to understand how concentrations of power electronics interact with the grid.","Researchers at the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory partnered with the University of Tennessee to develop a secure, affordable sensing device that delivers unprecedented real-time insight into electric grid behavior. The innovation, called a Universal GridEdge Analyzer, recently won an R&D 100 Award as one of the world’s top inventions.

The compact analyzer records the smallest changes in electrical voltage and current as waveforms, then almost instantly compresses, encrypts and streams the data to centralized servers. Processing 60,000 measurements per second – 500 times more than the previous technology – it can capture split-second reactions from power electronics that help run today’s grid.

“Unlike traditional centralized power plants, data centers and distributed energy plants with batteries use power electronics to connect to the grids. Those power electronics can switch very quickly,” said Yilu Liu, lead researcher and UT-ORNL Governor’s Chair for Power Electronics. “Their fast-acting nature can impact the stability of the entire grid, so monitoring these dynamics helps us improve future grid operations, keeping the lights on for everyone.”

The technology builds on UT’s long-running grid frequency monitoring network called FNET/GridEye. That network’s 200 sensors across the U.S. and about 100 more worldwide collect and transmit aggregated data for a broad overview of grid activity. The new device delivers more detailed information at faster speeds, capturing incidents that earlier technology would have missed. Designed for flexibility, it can be embedded in power electronics, installed on a distribution line or even plugged into a wall outlet.

Utilities in places like Hawaii and Texas are using the device to understand how concentrations of power electronics interact with the grid. For example, at AI data centers, even minor voltage fluctuations can trigger a switch to backup power, requiring immediate action to control the energy load. The analyzer can help operators anticipate and navigate these episodes to maintain stable operations.

If one does that, the company’s core EV business does look weak.
Now the world’s third-largest EV maker by total volume (two Chinese companies are now leading the way), Tesla’s global market share has dwindled.
I do think Tesla stock will ultimately be a barometer for how the overall U.S. stock market does next year.
In my view, this stock is still a sell (or maybe a hold for those who bought Tesla stock at a much lower price, and don’t want the tax hit right now).","Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is undoubtedly one of the most divisive stocks in the market. The company’s CEO has made sure of that, with Elon Musk’s outspoken behavior and foray in the the world of politics turning this company into a love-it or hate-it type of entity.

Certainly, Elon Musk isn’t the first CEO to wade into political waters. Plenty of other companies have leaders who look for special favors from incoming administrations, and in that regard, one could argue that Musk has worked relatively well with both sides of the aisle.

That said, with very divergent views on where the largest EV company in the U.S. (now third-largest in the world, giving up its pole position to two companies in China which are dominating this race today), let’s dive into a bull and bear case on Tesla and where this stock may be headed next year.

The Bull Case

The bull case around Tesla’s ability to grow much faster than the overall market, and many of its Magnificent 7 peers, really centers around the idea that the company’s autonomous driving, robotics and AI divisions will be able to grow much faster than the company’s core electric vehicle (EV) business.

I think there are certainly catalysts that could bring about such a future. For one, CEO Elon Musk’s new $1 trillion pay package is heavily tied to the company hitting some aggressive growth numbers on these key business segments. If the company can outperform, and deliver even more growth from these business lines which could be extremely profitable, then the market is indeed pricing this company as more of a tech/AI play than an automobile maker.

The company’s ability to vertically integrate with its already-robust AI offerings, and the potential for deliveries to climb once again in a key market like China, could propel Tesla higher in 2026 as investors look for size and growth potential in the auto sector.

Indeed, if Optimus does in fact become a meaningful business (with Musk’s Master Plan IV signaling this business could be 80% of Tesla’s current sales), that’s a big potential jump in the years to come. I suppose it all comes down to investors’ collective credence in Elon Musk’s ability to turn his vision into reality. Thus far, at least, investors have been punished by the markets for going short any of his ideas.

The Bear Case

Tesla’s bear case really comes down to focusing on Tesla as an automobile maker. If one does that, the company’s core EV business does look weak. Overall, this sector is facing a range of headwinds, from EV tax credits that have now expired, to slumping sales in key global markets such as China (with competition in that market picking up considerably).

Now the world’s third-largest EV maker by total volume (two Chinese companies are now leading the way), Tesla’s global market share has dwindled. And even within the U.S. market, only 40% of new EV sales are coming Tesla’s way. That’s a far cry from the early pandemic days, when consumers really only had one reliable option to choose from.

Given this highly competitive backdrop, Tesla’s growth forecasts have turned negative, the company’s margins continue to be under pressure and erode, and a relatively stale lineup with no meaningful refreshes in years has some Tesla buyers looking for more attractive options.

That’s to say nothing to the political controversies that have come as a result of Musk’s foray into the political sphere. No matter what an investor thinks about Tesla’s brand, this company’s overall global cachet has diminished meaningfully in recent years, and that point really isn’t up for debate.

The Verdict

Most readers are well-aware that I’m generally bullish on Tesla, with my perspective mostly siding with much of the bearish narrative around Tesla’s valuation relative to its core automotive business.

That said, I can also understand the perspective ultra-bulls on Tesla have, with respect to the ability of the company’s CEO to find ways to pivot into the most profitable areas of tech many of us thought may take more time to commercialize.

I do think Tesla stock will ultimately be a barometer for how the overall U.S. stock market does next year. And on that front, I’m expecting some bigger headwinds in the year to come than most in the financial media.

As such, I’m taking a skeptical and cautious approach to highly-valued companies like Tesla right now. In my view, this stock is still a sell (or maybe a hold for those who bought Tesla stock at a much lower price, and don’t want the tax hit right now).",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/imageforentry25-w2h.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 15:58:29.737195

Today, we are looking at renewable energy stocks, starting with SolarEdge (NASDAQ:SEDG).

Renewable energy companies are buoyed by the secular trend of green energy that is upending traditional power generation. Those who innovate and evolve with this dynamic market can win share while those who continue to rely on legacy technologies can see diminishing demand, which includes headwinds from increasing regulation against “dirty” energy. Additionally, these companies are at the whim of economic cycles, as interest rates can impact the willingness to invest in renewable energy projects.

The 17 renewable energy stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 5.8% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was in line.

Amidst this news, share prices of the companies have had a rough stretch. On average, they are down 7.6% since the latest earnings results.

SolarEdge (NASDAQ:SEDG)

Established in 2006, SolarEdge (NASDAQ: SEDG) creates advanced systems to improve the efficiency of solar panels.

SolarEdge reported revenues of $340.2 million, up 44.5% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 1.7%. Despite the top-line beat, it was still a slower quarter for the company with a significant miss of analysts’ adjusted operating income and EBITDA estimates.

“We’re making steady progress in our turnaround, with three consecutive quarters of revenue growth and improving margins, and we’re not done yet,” said Shuki Nir, CEO of SolarEdge.

Unsurprisingly, the stock is down 4.2% since reporting and currently trades at $30.49.

Market Update

Thanks to the Fed’s rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has been on a steady path downward, easing back toward that 2% sweet spot. Fortunately (miraculously to some), all this tightening didn’t send the economy tumbling into a recession, so here we are, cautiously celebrating a soft landing. The cherry on top? Recent rate cuts (half a point in September 2024, a quarter in November) have propped up markets, especially after Trump’s November win lit a fire under major indices and sent them to all-time highs. However, there’s still plenty to ponder — tariffs, corporate tax cuts, and what 2025 might hold for the economy.

Like most of the clean energy industry, the beginning of the Trump administration brought uncertainty to the storage sector.
The tariffs bit both China and other countries where U.S. battery factories sourced components, including both Japan and Korea.
This win for storage appears to be linked to load growth, and especially to the needs of data centers.
It plans to invest roughly $2 billion “to capture the large demand for battery energy storage from data centers and infrastructure to support the electric grid,” the company said.","For the U.S. energy storage market, 2025 can be divided into pre-OBBB and post-OBBB.

Like most of the clean energy industry, the beginning of the Trump administration brought uncertainty to the storage sector. Storage had a relatively good 2024 — with installations up 33% over the previous year, to 12.3 gigawatts — but a new president who had been actively hostile to renewables and particularly solar and wind introduced a new variable.

President Trump’s trade policies were a problem from the outset. In his first week in office, research suggested that the platform he proposed as a candidate, including increasing existing Section 301 tariffs against Chinese imports to 60%, could drive up costs for battery storage systems by more than 35%.

The tariffs bit both China and other countries where U.S. battery factories sourced components, including both Japan and Korea. And as Sam Jaffe, principal at 1019 Technologies, told Latitude Media at the time, Trump’s new import taxes came into effect at a particularly unfortunate time for the domestic battery makers who have slowly been building up capacity in recent years; the administration’s decision, he said, “really disrupts the entire mechanism that’s been slowly grinding forward to create U.S.-made batteries.”

Many of those manufacturers ran up against high costs, even before the Trump changes set in. In the first months of the year, both Kore Power and Freyr Battery canceled plans for greenfield factories in the U.S., citing high costs and interest rates.

These companies, which both were to lithium-ion phosphate batteries, initially made plans in light of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which offered storage- and clean energy manufacturing-specific credits. That legislation spurred hope in the industry, Jaffe said, that “there would be a U.S. LFP manufacturing buildout.” But under Trump 2.0, he said, “all of that is in question.”

Trade policy uncertainty also hit storage integrators like Powin, which shut down over the summer, laying off nearly 250 employees and citing “unforeseen circumstances” in the market. Powin told Latitude at the time that the company’s “challenges have been compounded by recent tariff developments that have added cost and complexity to the company’s operations and ongoing uncertainty surrounding the investment tax credit.”

But then, some unexpected good news. In July, Congress passed its long-anticipated budget bill, ending the months of uncertainty with a surprise win for storage: The GOP’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” kept the sector’s federal incentives largely intact.

While both wind and solar tax credits saw an accelerated phase-out, storage projects can continue to qualify for both the 48E investment tax credit and the 45Y production tax credit under the original IRA timeline. (That said, the bill phased out the 45X manufacturing credit that battery makers have relied upon one year sooner than the IRA had.)

This win for storage appears to be linked to load growth, and especially to the needs of data centers. Load growth projections are still accelerating; one estimate quadrupled in just two years, to 166 GW of peak load growth by 2030. Against that backdrop, an important tool for making the most of the capacity we have already, no matter the source of generation, is storage.

Data centers especially are contributing to the new demand. And that includes both novel forms of long duration storage — Google signed a deal with the carbon dioxide battery startup Energy Dome, while meanwhile 100-hour battery company Form is scaling up manufacturing to meet the needs of data centers — and the more strategic deployment of distributed storage.

Distributed storage to bolster the grid

It’s not just utility-scale batteries that are seeing momentum. Data centers are beginning, slowly, to embrace behind-the-meter batteries for onsite power. In an October note to clients, the investment firm Jefferies said that “hyperscalers present a 20 GW opportunity” for BESS through 2035. “With hyperscalers increasingly embracing some permutation of grid-connection and BTM backup generation, we see BESS as a complementary resource to enable flexible load management, accelerate speed to interconnection, and provide backup capacity in a redundant form factor,” the note read.

Around the same time, Aligned Data Centers announced a deal for a 31-megawatt, 62-megawatt-hour battery alongside a data center in the Pacific Northwest — sized to allow it to get interconnected “years earlier than would be possible with traditional utility upgrades.” The project relies on two-hour batteries developed by energy storage company Calibrant Energy, and is planned to be operational next year.

These batteries are also seeing strategic deployment on the distribution grid. In October, the utility Xcel Energy proposed a first-of-a-kind approach to distributed capacity procurement (also known as DCP), which it will deploy in Minnesota between now and 2028. The program will install up to 200 megawatts of utility-owned and operated battery storage “at strategic locations on the grid” — generally local businesses and commercial and industrial sites, who would be paid for the privilege — to host much-needed capacity. The idea is that the batteries can boost overall grid health by preventing transformer overload and otherwise avoiding the need for costly upgrades.

Meanwhile, in Texas, Base Power is demonstrating that residential batteries can also be used for grid health and that doing so can be valuable to investors. The vertically integrated company manufactures, installs, owns, and operates residential batteries in Texas, providing customers backup power while simultaneously employing them for grid services. The company, which also acts as an electricity retailer, announced a $1 billion Series C this fall.

The EVs-to-storage battery switch

Against this market backdrop, major companies are beginning to reallocate resources: away from producing batteries for electric vehicles, which saw their tax credits stripped in the OBBB, and toward making them for storage.

Data centers, of course, are a huge part of this new demand.

Even before the OBBB passed, AI infrastructure developer Crusoe was quietly building a data center in the Nevada desert to test whether second-life EV batteries could be used to power AI workloads. In June, it unveiled its off-grid modular data center, powered by a new energy storage offering from the battery recycling company Redwood Materials. The company’s new business line, dubbed Redwood Energy, launched with plans to repurpose EV battery packs in a microgrid to firm up cheap renewable energy, specifically for a cheaper solution to powering data centers.

For more on Redwood Materials’ decision to start repurposing EV batteries for grid storage, listen to CTO Colin Campbell’s interview on the Catalyst podcast:

Then, automaker GM got involved. In August, the company announced an agreement with Redwood Materials to develop grid-scale energy storage, using new and repurposed batteries that were initially intended for EVs. Key to its rationale was the fact that the company — weathering the post-OBBB slow-down — found itself with far more battery cell production capacity than demand for electric vehicles.

This shift also revealed the tough conditions for the battery recycling sector. For years, it has struggled to truly scale, in part because there haven’t been enough used batteries in circulation. And the EV sector’s downswing has complicated things further. Demand for critical minerals has surged in 2025 as the U.S. race with China has intensified, but extracting valuable materials from batteries and other used equipment is incredibly challenging: logistically, chemically, and economically. Over the summer, the battery recycler Li-Cycle went bankrupt, facing a severe feedstock shortage.

Just this month, Ford followed GM’s lead — with a twist. The company said it plans to change over its EV battery capacity at a Kentucky plant to manufacture storage systems instead, which it hopes to start bringing online in 2027. It plans to invest roughly $2 billion “to capture the large demand for battery energy storage from data centers and infrastructure to support the electric grid,” the company said. In so doing, Ford joins a growing group of manufacturers, including LG Energy and SK On who have begun to do the same.",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-12-29T120543.806.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 13:00:08.574293

Trump is attacking renewables as power demand surges For now, at least, clean energy is still booming in the U.S.
And the Interior Department limited who at the agency can issue permits for renewable energy projects on public lands.","Over the past year, the Trump administration and Congressional Republicans have waged a sweeping campaign against renewable energy, throwing a fast-growing industry into turmoil.

The administration has used federal agencies to try to slow or stop the development of wind and solar projects. And this summer, the GOP-controlled Congress voted to get rid of tax credits for renewable energy, threatening to drive up the cost of projects.

As a result of those moves, the United States is forecast to add a lot less power from renewables in the coming years than analysts previously expected, according to the International Energy Agency.

All this is occurring as electricity demand is rising faster than it has in decades. Some experts warn that limiting new power supplies could have broad economic consequences, including higher electricity costs and slower business growth. So far, it’s unclear what the Trump campaign against renewables will mean for consumers or grid reliability.

The Trump administration “may not love renewable technologies, but they’re going to need them to meet the data center demand [and] also maintain energy affordability for all consumers,” says Pavan Venkatakrishnan, policy advisor at The Foundation for American Innovation, a technology-focused research group.

A White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, said in a statement that renewables drive up power prices. President Trump is trying to boost resources like natural gas, coal and nuclear power, Rogers said, in order to “lower energy prices, increase grid efficiency, and win the AI race.” In a study this fall, researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory said wind and solar projects, on their own, do not in general raise power prices.

With the Administration pushing to rein in renewables amid growing power demand, natural gas will likely be the big economic winner. Already the biggest source of U.S. electricity, natural gas generation is poised for dramatic growth by the end of the decade. Its continued dominance comes at a time when climate scientists have urged nations to sharply cut fossil fuel use to reduce climate pollution.

Trump is attacking renewables as power demand surges

For now, at least, clean energy is still booming in the U.S. The amount of electricity the country produces from big solar plants is projected to grow by about a third this year and by almost 20% in 2026, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a recent report. All told, the country is on track to add a record amount of power capacity this year from solar, wind and battery plants, according to American Clean Power, a trade group.

“It is not climate goals or imperatives primarily driving the need to build out renewables,” Venkatakrishnan says. “It is literally, ‘What are you able to get on the grid as quickly as possible?'”

The Trump administration has moved to derail the renewables industry using a multipronged attack across the federal government.

The Environmental Protection Agency has tried to terminate billions in grant funding to help low-income households and communities install solar. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has targeted offshore wind projects with stop-work orders and legal maneuvers to strip companies of construction permits. And the Interior Department limited who at the agency can issue permits for renewable energy projects on public lands.

In a letter to Congressional leaders in December, nearly 150 solar companies said the Interior Department has created “a nearly complete moratorium” on project permitting.

“We feel it’s good policy for government agencies to be supporting power generation of every stripe that wants to come online, as long as it’s not damaging something,” says Dan Shugar, chief executive of Nextpower, one of the solar companies that signed the letter.

The attacks on renewables are happening at a time when U.S. electricity demand is surging, in large part because power-hungry data centers are being built around the country. Electricity usage is expected to increase by an average of 5.7% annually over the next five years, according to Grid Strategies, a consulting firm. Over the past two decades, demand grew by less than 1% per year.

Renewables and batteries are critical to meet rising power demand, according to industry executives and analysts, because the projects can be built quickly and produce electricity that’s relatively cheap. While wind industry growth has slowed in recent years due to problems ranging from inflation to local pushback on siting projects, solar has taken off.

“There can be talk about nuclear or other technologies. Those take years to build,” Andrés Gluski, chief executive of The AES Corporation, told Wall Street analysts in November. AES owns both clean-energy and fossil-fuel plants. “So what is going to meet the majority of the demand? Well, this year, it is probably going to be 90% as [renewable energy] and batteries. It very likely will be next year, as well.”

The Trump administration’s attacks risk further weakening a renewables industry that may already be headed for a slowdown as power companies boost spending on natural gas.

‘The golden age of power demand’

Big battery projects have been flooding U.S. energy markets in recent years, allowing companies to store electricity from renewables projects and deliver the power when it’s needed most — like after sunset.

But with data centers increasing demand for around-the-clock electricity, power companies are ramping up investment in a resource they’ve worked with for decades: natural gas.

“We may still have a year or two where [renewables and batteries] are going to be the majority of additions” to U.S. electric grids, says Sophie Karp, managing director of utilities and alternative energy at KeyBanc Capital Markets. “But that’s not because we don’t need gas in this timeframe. It’s just because it takes longer for this momentum to pick up and for major gas generation [projects] to come on the grid.”

Orders for gas turbines have been accelerating since 2023 and are on pace to triple this year compared to 2024, according to Steve Piper, director of energy research at S&P Global Energy. As companies add more gas generation, growth in the country’s renewable energy industry is expected to slow, Piper said in a recent presentation.

That doesn’t mean power companies will walk away from renewables and batteries, industry executives and analysts say.

“The golden age of power demand is creating the need for all forms of generation,” Michael Dunne, the chief financial officer at the power company NextEra Energy, said on a December call with Wall Street analysts.

It’s still unclear how much families and businesses will have to pay to meet that growing demand. The loss of federal tax incentives could increase costs for wind and solar projects, and some state renewable energy mandates have been linked to rising power prices. Meanwhile, increased exports of liquified natural gas are expected to push up domestic gas prices, the Energy Information Administration said this summer.

ICF, a consulting firm, has said it expects residential retail power prices to increase between 15% and 40% by 2030.

“The biggest thing, both at kind of the local grid level but also at the national level, is how much transmission we’re building, which is not very much,” says Alex Trembath, deputy director of The Breakthrough Institute, a technology-focused research group. Transmission lines are the backbone of the electric grid, connecting power plants to local distribution systems that deliver power to homes and businesses. “That constrains the ability to get electrons around — to get electrons from where they’re being generated to where they’re needed,” Trembath says.

How the country’s power system evolves in the coming years could also have big implications for climate change. In a recent report, the United Nations said average global temperatures are on track to rise by about 5 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century, compared to the pre-industrial temperatures of the mid-1800s. With that amount of warming, climate change impacts like more-extreme rainfall, hurricanes and heatwaves become much more damaging.

While natural gas creates less heat-trapping pollution than coal when it’s burned, producing and transporting gas can release huge amounts of methane, a potent climate pollutant. So, a dramatic increase in gas generation to meet rising power demand could fuel a lot more warming.

However, Trembath says the scramble for electricity may also pave the way for cleaner technologies, like nuclear and geothermal, that could help drive down emissions.

“Not over the next five years,” Trembath says, “but over the next 50 years.”",https://cdn.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/29105458/ap25168671048385-1500x1000.webp,N,,2025-12-29 15:13:21.599739

Chinese automakers exported a ton of EVs, and the biggest importer might surprise you if you haven’t been to Texas recently. And, speaking of surprises, it looks like Detroit is going to have two separate newspapers again.

Hybrids Are The New Normal

If I’ve learned anything over the last few years, it’s that moving the Overton Window has been less about slowly appealing to people in the middle and more about trying to normalize an extreme point until enough people shift halfway in that direction. This is often far from ideal, from a little-d “democracy” standpoint, but it’s just the way it works right now.

As someone who cares about the environment and drives enough electric cars to know that they’d work for a lot more people than currently own one, I’m a little troubled by the likely flattening of EV demand next year. Some of this is a price thing, as automakers prioritized the wrong vehicles. Some of this is infrastructure. Some of it, sadly, is the politicization of electric cars.

If there’s one positive outcome of this, it’s that hybrids, once looked down upon as an emasculating toy for the Larry Davids of the world, are now just normal. [Ed Note: It helps that plentiful and affordable hybrid offerings these days don’t look like jellybeans, they’re big enough for the US consumer, and they offer a really nice driving experience. -DT]. I’ve been writing about the year/decade of the hybrid for a while, and a lot of that was based on the idea that people will make logical decisions and that, for many people, a hybrid is the most logical route.

There’s a fun read in Bloomberg this week that’s basically making the point that hybrids are just another car for people, and many of them don’t even give it a second thought:

It’s also increasingly difficult to discern a hybrid from a solely gas-powered model, said Scott Hardman, assistant director of the Electric Vehicle Research Center at the University of California at Davis. Carmakers today often don’t even label a hybrid as such. Consider Toyota’s RAV4, one of the best-selling vehicles in America. The 2026 version of the SUV comes in six different variants, all of which include an electric motor and a gas tank.

“A hybrid is just a regular car now,” Hardman said. “You can buy one by accident.”

Kunes, the Midwest dealer, said most of his customers don’t pay much attention to how the vehicle propels itself; they’re just looking for the most affordable option. “People don’t necessarily come in looking for a hybrid vehicle,” he explained, “but they don’t mind taking one.”

Because vehicles like the Sienna and Camry are now hybrid-only, the technology is now reaching parity with purely gas-powered cars on average, although vehicle-to-vehicle hybrids tend to be slightly more expensive.

This is a great outcome for hybrids and for the environment. Are environmentalists celebrating this? Some are, probably, although the loudest people (primarily on BlueSky) are now suddenly anti-hybrid, because politics makes people insane.

Tesla Cuts Order From $2.9 Billion To Just $7k

If you think you’re having a bad day, imagine being the person who negotiated the deal between South Korean battery supplier L&F and Tesla for nearly $3 billion in high-nickel cathode material. That $3 billion deal is now, according to a recent filing, just $7,400.

These materials were supposed to be used for Tesla’s supposedly inexpensive 4680 cell. So what happened? This Reuters article floats a couple of theories:

Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled a plan in 2020 to mass-produce the 4680, a less expensive battery that he said would help it make a small, compelling $25,000 electric car that was fully autonomous within about three years from then.

However, as EV demand slowed and Tesla struggled to ramp up production and development of the 4680 cells, the company ultimately did not need as much cathode material from L&F as initially anticipated, analysts said.

The postponement (or cancellation?) of the $25,000 Tesla is a big reason, but the more immediate cause might be the market failure of the Cybertruck, which is the only vehicle using the cells. The Cybercab was also supposed to use 4680 cells, so I’m not sure what this means for Tesla’s expectations for that vehicle.

Mexico Was China’s Biggest EV Export Market In November

The renegotiation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is going to be the most pivotal test of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum’s leadership, at least as it relates to the car market.

So far, Mexico has done well in dealing with a sometimes difficult-to-read White House. It’s also managed to use the tension between the United States and China to its advantage.

Currently, it makes cars and parts for the United States, while also being able to import cheap Chinese cars and EVs. According to this Bloomberg article, Mexico was actually the biggest importer of Chinese-made EVs in November.

China’s EV exports to Mexico in November rose 2,367% y/y to 19,344, the highest among all nations or territories, according to data from China Customs.

Obviously, this isn’t usual, as most Chinese EVs go to other Asian countries and Europe. I haven’t been able to find good reporting on why this happened, so I’m open to an explanation. China has huge overcapacity issues, but I think this might be a weird quirk of delivery.

Currently, the BYD Explorer No.1 RoRo ship, with a capacity of 7,000 vehicles, is in port in Mexico, and the BYD Shenzen, which can carry 9,000 vehicles, just left.

The Detroit Free Press And The Detroit News Are Two Papers Again

There aren’t many cities in America that have two flagship papers these days. I remember growing up with the Houston Post and the Houston Chronicle. Detroit is one of those cities, although a Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) for the last four decades has seen the papers operating thanks to a lot of shared resources.

That agreement is done, now, and so Detroit will have two independently operating newspapers in the new year. Did the JOA work? Here’s a Detroit News article on it, arguing that it did:

Bitterly contested in court when it was first proposed in 1986, the Detroit joint operating agreement remains a subject of debate over whether it was a success, although its primary stated goal — preserving two editorial voices — was fulfilled.

“Ultimately, what it intended to do was to keep two papers in Detroit,” said the Poynter Institute’s Kelly McBride, who advises news organizations on best practices. “So yeah, I guess that means it was successful. Clearly, I don’t think Detroit would have two papers now if the (joint operating agreement) had not existed.”

But McBride and former editors of both papers said it’s difficult to separate the role of business partnerships in the survival or death of newspapers compared to the existential loss of funding widely blamed on digital advertising.

If you live in Detroit and have been missing a Sunday edition of the Detroit Free Press, get excited.

State Credit Changes Over the past year, several states have enacted or revised legislation related to research and development tax credits.","The following article was first posted in the Blog/Articles section of Mahoney Sabol’s website. It is reposted here with permission.

With all the challenges facing private companies this year, they must leverage every available tax benefit.

Fortunately, lawmakers have packed the federal tax code with credits and incentives to reward taxpayers for specific activities and investments.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act made significant revisions to energy credits, imposing new restrictions and phasing out many of the credits early.

Despite the changes, there is still considerable runway for many projects, and both the tax equity financing and credit transfer markets should remain robust over the next several years.

In addition, the OBBBA enhanced existing incentives, offering new opportunities for tax-efficient structuring.

Energy Provisions

The OBBBA has reshaped the energy credit landscape. Several credits were extended or enhanced, while many others are subject to new sourcing and investment requirements or are phasing out early.

The legislation does not affect the ability to transfer or claim refundable payments for specified credits.

Consumer Credits: The OBBBA repeals several energy-related tax credits directed to consumers, each with distinct effective dates:

Section 25E—Previously Owned Clean Vehicle Credit: Repealed for vehicles acquired after Sept. 30, 2025.

Section 30D—Clean Vehicle Credit: Repealed for vehicles acquired after Sept. 30, 2025.

Section 45W—Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit: Repealed for vehicles acquired after Sept. 30, 2025.

Section 30C—Alternative Fuel Refueling Property Credit: Repealed for property placed in service after June 30, 2026.

Section 25C—Energy-Efficient Home Improvement Credit: Repealed for property placed in service after Dec. 31, 2025.

Section 25D—Residential Clean Energy Credit: Repealed for expenditures made after Dec. 31, 2025.

Section 45L—New Energy-Efficient Home Credit: Repealed for property acquired after June 30, 2026.

Depreciation: The bill eliminates the five-year depreciable life for qualified energy property, and the Section 179D deduction is repealed for construction beginning after June 30, 2026.

Investment, Production Tax Credits

The OBBBA accelerates the phaseout of the investment tax credit under Section 48E and the production tax credit under Section 45Y.

Projects that begin construction after 2033 will generally no longer qualify for these credits, with solar and wind facilities facing even earlier deadlines. To remain eligible, solar and wind projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026, must be placed in service by the end of 2027.

The legislation also introduces new restrictions related to prohibited foreign entities. Facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2025, may not receive material assistance from such entities.

Material assistance is determined based on a cost ratio tied to the sourcing of eligible components. In addition, Section 48E now includes stricter domestic sourcing requirements to obtain the 10% bonus credit, reflecting a broader policy shift toward supply chain security and energy independence.

Importantly, the IRS has tightened the rules for establishing that construction has begun for purposes of the July 4, 2026, deadline for solar and wind facilities.

Under Notice 2025-43, the 5% safe harbor method is available only if taxpayers can use it to establish that construction began by Sept. 1, 2025.

Starting Sept. 2, the physical work test is the sole method for establishing the beginning of construction for wind and solar projects for purposes of the July 4, 2026, deadline.

This change applies to the credit phaseouts under the OBBBA, but not to the foreign entity of concern rules.

For FEOC exemption purposes, facilities may still use the 5% safe harbor to establish that construction began by Dec. 31, 2025.

Additionally, low-output solar facilities (≤1.5 MW AC) may continue to use the 5% safe harbor beyond that date. The four-year continuity safe harbor remains in place for projects that meet BOC requirements.

Historically, taxpayers could rely on either the physical work test or the 5% safe harbor. Notice 2025-42 now limits this to the physical work test, which requires significant physical work related to the energy property, either on-site or off-site, under a binding contract. Preliminary activities, such as design or site clearing, do not qualify.

To maintain credit eligibility, taxpayers must also meet the continuity requirement, which is satisfied if the facility is placed in service within four years of the BOC year.

Advanced Manufacturing Credit

The advanced manufacturing credit under Section 45X has been modified significantly.

While the credit is repealed for wind energy components sold after 2027, it remains available for other eligible components before a phasedown begins in 2031.

Components sold in 2031 will qualify for a 75% credit, decreasing to 50% in 2032 and 25% in 2033.

The credit is fully repealed for sales occurring in 2034 or later. Notably, the scope of the credit has been expanded to include metallurgical coal.

As with other energy provisions, the material assistance restrictions for prohibited foreign entities apply to all qualifying components.

Clean Fuel Production Credit

Under the OBBBA, the clean fuel production credit under Section 45Z has been extended through 2031.

The bill also reinstates the small agri-biodiesel credit under Section 40A, which can now be stacked with the 45Z credit.

A new geographic restriction has been added, disallowing the credit unless the feedstock is produced or grown in Canada, Mexico, or the U.S.

Additionally, the methodology for calculating greenhouse gas emissions has been revised to exclude indirect land use changes.

Prohibited foreign entity rules have also been extended to apply to clean fuel production facilities.

Planning considerations: Facilities must establish BOC by Dec. 31, 2025, to avoid FEOC restrictions beginning in 2026, and can continue to rely on the 5% safe harbor specifically to meet this deadline through the end of 2025.

Solar and wind projects beginning construction more than 12 months after the OBBBA enactment must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to qualify for Section 48E or 45Y credits.

Facilities that establish BOC by the deadline can rely on the four-year continuity safe harbor to place in service and preserve credit eligibility.

Other Energy Provisions

The clean hydrogen production credit under Section 45V is repealed for construction beginning after 2027—two years later than previously proposed.

Section 45Q credit rates for carbon capture used as a tertiary injectant or for productive use are increased to match those for permanent geologic storage, subject to new foreign-entity restrictions.

Publicly traded partnership rules now include income from carbon capture; nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal energy projects, as well as the transport or storage of sustainable aviation fuel or hydrogen.

The nuclear production credit under Section 45U is also subject to foreign entity restrictions.

Planning considerations: Taxpayers should assess project timelines and sourcing strategies in light of phaseouts and new restrictions. For Sections 45Y and 48E, construction must begin within eligibility windows—especially for solar and wind projects facing a 2027 placed-in-service deadline.

Supply chain planning is critical to avoid disqualification under foreign entity rules. Manufacturers of wind property eligible for Section 45X should consider accelerating production before the phaseout in 2027.

Clean fuel producers must ensure feedstock sourcing complies with geographic limits and updated emissions rules.

Entities pursuing carbon capture, hydrogen, or nuclear projects should factor in expanded PTP eligibility and foreign entity restrictions when structuring financing and partnerships.

Early action can help preserve credit eligibility and provide long-term benefits.

State Tax Credit Transfers

Following the enactment of the OBBBA, many states have expanded or introduced transferable tax credit programs, particularly in clean energy, affordable housing, and infrastructure.

These programs allow taxpayers to sell unused credits to third parties, creating liquidity and broader access to state-level incentives.

Transfer mechanisms vary by state, with some requiring pre-approval, certification, or registration, while others impose annual caps or limits on transfer volume.

The trend mirrors federal credit transferability under Section 6418 and reflects growing interest in flexible credit monetization strategies.

States are also beginning to adopt market infrastructure—such as broker platforms and insurance products—to support credit transfers and mitigate buyer risk.

As more jurisdictions adopt these frameworks, taxpayers with multistate operations should monitor developments closely to identify new opportunities.

Planning considerations: Taxpayers should assess eligibility and timing for generating transferable credits, especially in states with strict certification or sourcing requirements.

Early coordination with legal and tax advisors is essential to confirm compliance with documentation and reporting rules. Buyers should conduct due diligence on project qualification, transfer terms, and potential recapture risks.

Engaging with credit brokers or marketplaces may help improve pricing and identify reliable counterparties.

Additionally, taxpayers should consider how state credit transfers interact with federal incentives, particularly in structuring financing and partnership arrangements.

Strategic planning now can help enhance credit value and avoid missed opportunities as state programs continue to evolve.

New Markets Tax Credit Program Permanent

The New Markets Tax Credit program supports capital investments in low-income communities by offering tax credit-subsidized loans to eligible businesses for use toward eligible costs (e.g., real estate and furniture, fixtures, and equipment).

These loans often feature interest-only terms, below-market rates, and principal forgiveness after seven years, providing businesses with a permanent cash benefit.

Previously set to expire at the end of 2025, the NMTC program was made permanent by the OBBBA, with a continued annual allocation authority of $5 billion.

Eligible businesses—both for-profit and nonprofit—can apply for NMTC financing for capital expenditure projects in qualifying census tracts.

The program supports a wide range of sectors, including manufacturing, healthcare, education, renewable energy, and retail, though it excludes farming and residential rental activities.

Each year, certified Community Development Entities apply to the CDFI Fund for NMTC allocations.

If awarded an allocation, CDEs raise equity from tax credit investors and deploy capital to eligible businesses (otherwise known as Qualified Active Low-Income Community Businesses) based on community impact and strategic priorities, which may vary by geography or industry.

Planning considerations: The NMTC program remains highly competitive. Early engagement with CDEs and timely application are critical to securing financing.

Businesses should prepare detailed project plans that demonstrate substantial community impact and align with CDE priorities.

Acting early improves the likelihood of receiving funding and may unlock additional benefits.

Work Opportunity Tax Credit Set to Expire

The OBBBA did not extend the work opportunity tax credit, which is now set to expire for any individuals who begin work after Dec. 31, 2025.

The WOTC provides a valuable incentive for employers who often hire workers from specific targeted populations, including veterans, people with disabilities, people on food assistance, certain youth employees, and ex-felons.

Employers who frequently screen for qualified individuals as part of their hiring process should monitor the legislative process for a potential extension of the credit.

Pass-Through Deduction

The OBBBA makes permanent the 20% deduction for qualified business income under Section 199A and favorably adjusts the phaseout of the deduction for taxpayers who do not meet the wage expense and capital investment requirements or who participate in a “specified service trade or business.”

Planning considerations: The permanence of this provision provides welcome certainty for private companies engaged in qualifying activities.

The deduction is not available for a range of specified service businesses. There may be opportunities to segregate activities and to increase or allow deductions.

The safe harbor for rental activity to qualify as a Section 199A trade or business under Rev. Proc. 2019-38 remains in effect.

R&D Credit Opportunities

The research credit remains one of the most powerful incentives in the tax code, and the IRS continues to receive a high volume of claims, straining examination resources.

To improve administration and reduce improper claims, the IRS recently made several changes to Form 6765, clarifying documentation requirements for claiming the credit.

The revised Form 6765 was partially finalized for tax year 2025, with the IRS making the mandatory reporting of qualified research expenses by business component optional in Section G.

When Section G becomes mandatory for the 2026 tax year, taxpayers will be required to disclose the top 80% of QREs, with controlled group members required to attach detailed entity-level breakdowns.

Section E is currently mandatory and includes new questions related to officer wages, acquisitions, and use of the ASC 730 directive.

These updates reflect the IRS’s ongoing efforts to enhance transparency and strengthen audit readiness.

In response to ongoing compliance concerns, the IRS has increased scrutiny of research credit filings, including more frequent audits.

However, due to temporary resource constraints, some IRS Exam functions are operating at reduced capacity, which may delay enforcement actions.

Taxpayers should confirm that they are properly documenting claims and exploring state credit opportunities.

State Credit Changes

Over the past year, several states have enacted or revised legislation related to research and development tax credits. These changes reflect a growing trend to incentivize innovation and attract high-tech investment.

These states include:

Arizona: Arizona now permits the use of the alternative simplified credit (ASC) method for computing its credit for increased research activities. This provides greater flexibility and may lead to greater benefits. Refundable credits are available for small businesses with fewer than 150 employees, subject to pre-approval from the Arizona Commerce Authority.

Arkansas: Arkansas expanded its credit options, offering up to 33% for strategic research areas and university partnerships. Credits are nonrefundable but can offset 100% of state tax liability and be carried forward for up to nine years.

Connecticut: Connecticut expanded its R&D and R&E credits under H.B. 7287. Single-member LLCs may now qualify if they meet specific criteria. Refundability increased to 90% for small biotech firms and 65% for other small businesses, capped at $1.5 million per company annually.

Iowa: Iowa enacted Senate File 657, replacing its research activities credit with a targeted R&D tax credit program effective Jan. 1, 2026. Eligibility is limited to sectors such as advanced manufacturing, bioscience, finance, insurance, and technology. Credits are capped at $40 million annually and require CPA-verified QREs and a competitive application process through the Iowa Economic Development Authority.

Massachusetts: Massachusetts increased the maximum allowable credit for certain industries and introduced new documentation requirements for software development and AI-related R&D.

Michigan: Effective Jan. 1, 2025, Michigan reintroduced its R&D tax credit. Large businesses may claim 3% of qualifying expenses up to a base amount and 10% above it, capped at $2 million. Small businesses may claim 15% above the base amount, capped at $250,000. An additional 5% credit is available for university collaborations, capped at $200,000. The credit is refundable and subject to an annual cap of $100 million.

Minnesota: Minnesota introduced partial refundability for its R&D credit: 19.2% for 2025, increasing to 25% for 2026–2027.

Oklahoma: Oklahoma revised its R&D credit to align more closely with federal QRE definitions and introduced a new pre-approval application process.

Texas: Texas enhanced its franchise tax R&D credit via SB 2206 and repealed the R&D equipment sales tax exemption effective Jan. 1, 2026.

Planning considerations: Navigating the R&D credit has become more complex amid heightened review, evolving case law, and new compliance measures.

Taxpayers should make sure claims are well-supported and consistent with updated guidance to reduce audit risk and avoid delays.

Taxpayers should carefully assess eligibility for both federal and state research credits, maintain contemporaneous documentation, and prepare to defend claims under examination.

Strategic planning is essential to leveraging available incentives, especially given the complexity and variability of state-level programs.

Using a trusted tax advisor can help taxpayers maintain compliance with IRS and state regulations and effectively substantiate research credit claims.

Rules Changed for Qualified Small Business Stock

The OBBBA significantly enhances a tax-efficient structuring option for private companies. Qualified small business stock under Section 1202 offers tax-free appreciation and has been increasingly used by private equity in recent years.

Enacted in 1993, Section 1202 generally allows a non-corporate taxpayer to exclude a percentage of the gain from the sale or exchange of QSBS held for more than five years.

The eligible gain exclusion percentage is based on the date the stock is issued.

For stock issued before July 5, 2025, the maximum amount of gain on QSBS that can be excluded for any tax year by each taxpayer with respect to each issuing C corporation is generally limited to the greater of: (i) $10 million, minus the amount of gain excluded by that taxpayer in prior years with respect to the same issuing corporation; or (ii) 10 times the taxpayer’s aggregate adjusted basis in the QSBS sold during the tax year.

For stock issued after July 4, 2025, the OBBBA increases the $10 million limit to $15 million and adjusts this limit for inflation beginning in 2027. In addition, the OBBBA creates new 50% and 75% gain exclusion categories for QSBS held for at least three and four years, respectively.

The various QSBS exclusion percentages, exclusion limits, and required holding periods by stock issuance date are set out in the table below.

The OBBBA also increases the limit on aggregate gross assets to satisfy the qualified small business test for purposes of Section 1202. These thresholds are now as follows:

At all times through the date of issuance, the corporation’s aggregate gross assets must not have exceeded $50 million for issuances before July 5, 2025, or $75 million for issuances after July 4, 2025; and

Immediately after the date of issuance (and after considering amounts the corporation received in the issuance), the aggregate gross assets of the corporation must not exceed $50 million or $75 million for issuances before July 5, 2025, or after July 4, 2025, respectively. Aggregate gross assets are defined as cash plus the aggregate adjusted tax basis of the corporation’s other assets.

Planning considerations: After an issuance is deemed to be QSBS under Section 1202, the corporation’s gross assets can exceed the applicable threshold (either $50 million or $75 million) at a later date without prohibiting the previously issued stock from receiving Section 1202 treatment.

By increasing the threshold, the OBBBA renews an existing corporation’s ability to issue QSBS if their aggregate gross assets have exceeded $50 million in the past but have never exceeded $75 million.

This higher threshold also expands the potential QSBS benefits for private equity firms when acquiring target businesses with enterprise values of up to $75 million.

Opportunity Zone Extension

The OBBBA made the qualified opportunity zone program permanent, preserving one of the most generous tax incentives ever offered by Congress.

The provision can offer benefits to investors looking for tax-efficient returns, individual private companies investing in specific geographies, or asset managers setting up funds.

The OBBBA not only makes the program permanent, but it also changes the rules in essential ways. Funds and investors should consider the implications for their planning strategies.

The changes could affect the timing of gain transactions and capital contributions, the location of investments, and the compliance burdens for funds.

The current QOZ designations will expire at the end of 2026. New zones will be designated in rolling 10-year designation periods under new criteria that are expected to shrink the number of qualifying zones.

Under the current program, taxpayers can defer capital gains by investing in a qualified opportunity fund.

For investments made after 2026, taxpayers will be required to recognize the deferred gain five years after investing, but will receive a 10% increase in basis for holding the investment for five years. For QOFs operating in a new category of rural opportunity zones, this basis increase is 30%.

Taxpayers who make investments before the end of 2026 must still recognize the deferred gain at the end of 2026.

The more powerful tax benefit may be the tax-free appreciation on the underlying investment itself. Taxpayers will still receive a full basis step-up to fair market value for property held 10 years, but the OBBBA added a rule freezing the basis step-up to the FMV at 30 years after the date of the investment.

The operational rules for QOFs and qualified opportunity zone businesses are generally unchanged, except for property held in a rural opportunity zone.

The threshold for establishing the substantial improvement of qualifying property in a rural opportunity zone will be 50% of the basis rather than 100%, effective for any determinations after July 4, 2025.

QOFs and QOZBs will both be subject to increased reporting requirements.

Companies looking for new tax-efficient investing opportunities and gain deferral strategies should reassess their investment options, paying particular attention to which geographies are likely to qualify in 2027.

Planning considerations: The timing of capital gains transactions will be important. Delaying a capital gain transaction could allow taxpayers to make a deferral election in 2027 and defer recognizing the gain until well after the current 2026 recognition date.

Conversely, taxpayers planning investments in geographic areas that are unlikely to be redesignated may need to make the investments before the end of 2026.

Existing QOFs and QOZBs should consider their long-term capital needs because it is not clear whether any “grandfathering” relief will allow additional qualified investments in funds operating in QOZs that are not redesignated.

The new reporting rules will apply to both new and existing QOZs and QOZBs for tax years beginning after the date of enactment, and those entities will need to collect and report substantial new information that has never before been required.

REIT Structuring, Real Estate Benefits

The real estate investment tax structure remains an effective way to structure certain real estate activities with only one layer of tax.

The OBBBA raises from 20% to 25% the portion of the gross asset value of a REIT that may be attributable to equity and debt securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries, effective for tax years beginning after 2025. The change should provide added flexibility.

In addition, the OBBBA allows the completed contract method of accounting for many residential condominium, construction, and sale projects, effective for contracts entered into after July 4, 2025.

For residential developers that meet the average annual gross receipts test under Section 448 ($31 million in 2025), the maximum estimated contract length is increased from two to three years to qualify for the exception from the UNICAP rules under Section 263A.

Planning considerations: This provision provides much-needed tax relief to condo developers who had to report income under the percentage-of-completion method, which often required reporting income before receiving payment.

Allowing the use of the completed contract method of accounting allows better matching of reporting taxable income with the receipt of cash by the developer.

Unfortunately, the relief is provided only prospectively for contracts entered into after the July 4, 2025, enactment date.

Therefore, taxpayers with contracts entered into before the enactment date will continue to be subject to the old rules.

Moreover, reporting income for projects begun in prior years may be bound to the prior method of accounting.",https://www.cbia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Tax-Analysis_092518.png,N,,2025-12-29 11:58:57.160395

And these procedural changes are being made in a way that itself lacks transparency and public input.","The Trump Administration is at war with transparency and public input.

A striking pattern has emerged from the Administration’s paring back of NEPA. These efforts persistently target requirements for transparency and public input That applies to the administration’s permitting reforms. It also applies to the process that is generating those permitting reforms. In both situations, agencies are fleeing the light of day.

Until the Trump Administration, the process of environmental review involved ample opportunities for public review. To take just one example, agencies were required to make their draft impact statements public and receive public comment. Even when the agency was conducting an environmental assessment to decide whether an impact statement was needed, there was input into the process. Moreover, these requirements were contained in regulations by the Council for Environmental Quality (CEQ) that were formally published by the government. From the Carter Administration through the Biden Administration, the CEQ regulations were the product of extensive public notice and comments.

In his first term in office, Trump followed this same process. But in his second term, he overturned the executive order by Jimmy Carter directing agencies to follow the CEQ regulations and directed CEQ to rescind the regulations. CCEQ repealed the regulations immediately with a token opportunity for after-the-fact public comment. That’s basically the “sentence first, trial after” procedure embraced by the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland. The Administration has used it in many regulatory proceedings.

Trump also ordered agencies to adopt their own NEPA procedures with CEQ guidance. The resulting procedures are quite varied. Some of them are supposed to be binding rules. Others are guidelines, or even just handbooks of agency practice. Public input was not a factor. And many reserve the right to make further changes without public notice of any kind. The upshot is that instead of having publicly available, uniform rules across the executive branch, we now have an opaque hodgepodge of agency statements.

Many of the new agency procedures rollback previous opportunities for public input in the environmental review process. NEPA requires public notice at one point: when the agency has already decided to do an environmental impact statement, it must publish a notice of intent and obtain public feedback. That notice may not tell the public much about what impacts or alternative actions or mitigation measures that agency plans to consider. More importantly, that notice will only be given in the small sliver of cases where the agency’s already decided to do an impact statement. In the vast majority of cases, there may be no public notice at all.

In short, the Administration has attacked transparency and public input at two levels. Agencies are adopting procedures that could largely eliminate meaningful public participation. And these procedural changes are being made in a way that itself lacks transparency and public input.

These changes limit the potential for public oversight of government actions that, taken alone or as a group, will have major environmental impacts – notably, oil production, coal mining, nuclear reactors, and pipelines. Congress will also have less visibility into these important decisions. People are often impatient about procedures that slow decision making, sometimes properly so. But the solution is not a secretive decision-making process. If it’s true that democracy dies in darkness, it’s also true that ugly things rawl out of the woodwork when the lights are off.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/NEPA3.png,N,,2025-12-29 12:12:34.730325

The company is studying the ways that its EVs can support the electric grid better, especially during emergencies.

While Toyota does not yet offer EVs with bidirectional charging, it says the technology has immense potential to ""transform the broader energy ecosystem.""

Blame AI data centers, or an outdated power grid, or extreme temperatures, or all of the above. However, one thing is clear as we head into 2026: the United States is on track for unprecedented electricity demand.

That might sound like an argument against electric vehicles. After all, why unleash an entire fleet of cars on this country that could further drain our already shaky electric grid? But that's only because most people don't know about bidirectional charging: an EV's ability to charge other devices using its battery, or power entire homes, or even put energy back into the grid.

Several EVs already offer this capability, and it's increasingly becoming a standard feature for these cars. Meanwhile, many automakers are working with electric utilities on vehicle-to-grid (V2G) pilot programs that could more directly support local power networks using energy from EV batteries.

The latest one to step up is Toyota. The automaker recently announced that it's entering a new phase of a longstanding V2G pilot program at its North American headquarters in Plano, Texas. Working with Oncor, a huge energy utility in the Lone Star State, and using Fermata Energy's bidirectional EV charger, a Japanese-spec bZ4X test vehicle is currently putting energy back into the grid. The charger ""enables bidirectional energy flow by analyzing price signals and grid conditions to determine the optimal times to charge the vehicle and discharge stored energy back to the grid,"" the automaker said.

Toyota is also running similar pilot programs with other utilities across the country, including San Diego Gas & Electric and Pepco in Maryland. In doing so, the company is monitoring what those local energy markets' needs actually are, and what customers will need as well.

Generally, with V2G programs, EV drivers hook their cars up to a special charger like this one that is designed to send energy back into the grid. The local electric utility itself must also be set up to do this. When deemed necessary, energy from a car will be transmitted into the grid to support area power, and drivers often get a credit for helping out—and they can opt out or unplug at any time.

It would be a sea change for power in the U.S. if every EV were to be V2G-enabled, and if every electric grid was set up to work with them in this way. But Toyota offered a startling statistic about the potential of this technology: ""Currently, more than 4 million battery electric vehicles are on U.S. roads. If all were equipped with bidirectional charging, they could collectively contribute approximately 40,000 megawatts to the grid—a power output similar to that of 40 nuclear power reactors,"" the automaker said.

While gasoline-powered cars can only send energy in one direction—into the wheels of the car itself—an EV's ability to share power could be a huge boon to the grid as energy demand rises and costs rise along with it. According to the Wall Street Journal, the U.S. Energy Department expects the average residential electricity rate to jump 4% next year, even after a 4.9% increase in 2025.

Clearly, EVs alone can't solve that problem. And Toyota itself does not currently offer any EVs with V2G or V2L capability, unlike Hyundai, Nissan, Ford, General Motors and others. But it seems inevitable that Toyota will jump in eventually.

And as this scales, it could be more beneficial than many people realize. “By enabling bidirectional charging, we’re exploring how we can help customers potentially save money while also reducing carbon emissions from the grid,"" Christopher Yang, senior vice president of Enterprise Strategy & Solutions at Toyota Motor North America, said in a statement. And that, he said, is ""a win-win for drivers and the environment.”
