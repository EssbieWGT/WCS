Japanese automakers, including Nissan, have had to reassess parts of their strategy in the region as new U.S. trade rules, the expiration of EV tax credits, and reduced demand have created challenges.

The two midsize electric SUVs — one for Nissan and the other for luxury brand Infiniti — were expected to begin production at the automaker’s plant in Mississippi in 2028.

However, the timeline has now been delayed to late 2028 or early 2029, Nikkei reported.

The company had initially planned to launch five electric vehicles in the U.S., but has since canceled development of a small SUV and a sedan, reducing its pipeline to three EV models.

The shift comes after the Trump administration’s ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ eliminated EV tax credits effective September 30. The Biden-era incentives, worth up to $7,500, were initially aimed at boosting sales of North American-made EVs.

A 2023 revision under the Biden administration expanded eligibility to include leased vehicles made overseas, which lifted EV lease penetration from 10% in early 2023 to 66% by March 2025, according to Cox Automotive.

Japanese and South Korean automakers lacking U.S. EV production facilities depended on leasing provisions to maintain their competitive edge.

EV demand faces additional pressure from incentive elimination while also struggling with high vehicle costs, insufficient charging stations, and widespread preference for gasoline SUVs. Currently, EVs account for just 7% of new vehicle sales in the U.S.

In April, EV incentives averaged 14.5% of sticker prices — double that of gasoline cars — but demand remains sluggish.

Meanwhile, Nissan’s battery supplier, AESC, has suspended construction of a plant in South Carolina. If EV demand continues to stagnate, U.S. battery production capacity could become excessive, Nikkei reported, citing a finance industry source.

Separately, Nissan reportedly halted production in May of three Canada-bound models — the Pathfinder and Murano SUVs, built in Tennessee, and the Frontier pickup, produced in Mississippi — following the Trump administration’s decision in April to impose a 25% tariff on auto imports.

Mazda also paused Canada-bound production at its Alabama plant and is shifting output to the U.S. market, the company said.

Other Japanese automakers are also adjusting. Toyota has postponed EV production in Indiana by two years and is increasing the output of hybrid and gasoline versions of the Grand Highlander SUV. Honda has halted the development of a large electric SUV it had positioned as a key product for the U.S. market.

On Stocktwits, retail sentiment for Nissan was ‘bullish’ amid ‘extremely high’ message volume by late Tuesday.

Nissan’s U.S. shares have declined 26.8% so far this year.

The deficit-boosting bill President Donald Trump signed into law last Friday included provisions that will undermine US clean energy development. Indeed, a team led by Princeton energy expert Jesse Jenkins estimates that it will reduce US solar and wind output by at least 300 gigawatts by 2035—enough to power some 225 million homes.

But some Republicans still thought the bill didn’t go far enough. After a failed last-minute bid to add further subsidy cuts and an industry-killing renewables tax to the bill, Republicans agreed to vote yes after Trump promised to take matters into his own hands.

He delivered on Monday with an executive order titled “Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable Foreign Controlled Energy Sources.”

The order basically instructs the Treasury Department to deny a developer’s application for soon-to-disappear clean energy subsidies “unless a substantial portion” of their project is already built. It also directs the Department of the Interior to revise policies favoring renewables. “While many executive orders have limited effectiveness, this one might actually have some bite,” says Yale energy economist Kenneth Gillingham.

“The Trump administration is taking every opportunity it can find to assert its authority not to spend money on things with which it disagrees,” says Don Kettl, a professor emeritus and former dean at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. “The implications here are enormous.”

Because of the time it takes to permit and site US projects, Gillingham says, the order’s stringent interpretation of the statutory language will have “the effect of quashing the market sooner than would have happened otherwise.”

Bob Keefe, executive director of E2, a national organization of business leaders advocating for smarter climate policies, isn’t too pleased with the order. “Just in case last week’s legislative sledgehammer didn’t do enough damage to our economy, our environment, and the pocketbooks of anybody who pays an electricity bill, the Trump administration is taking yet another swing,” he said.

Trump’s decree asserts that renewables threaten “the fiscal health of the Nation,” a claim Gillingham deems entirely false. “Renewables cost something, but they create jobs and generate clean energy.”

“Our workforce is growing, businesses are expanding, and communities are saving money with consistent, reliable energy,” explains Bill Johnson, the owner of Brilliant Harvest, a Florida solar company, but the legislation and subsequent order put that progress at risk, he says.

The order, Keefe told me, suggests that the administration “either doesn’t understand or doesn’t care that solar, wind, and batteries are the cheapest, quickest, made-in-America energy we can deploy.”

And although Trump questions the reliability of renewables, Gillingham insists that “at the levels of renewable energy we have today, we have nothing to worry about.” He adds, “If anything, adding more renewable capacity could help us meet additional electricity demand.”

As for the notion that the renewable energy market is “dependent on supply chains controlled by foreign adversaries,” well, sure, China dominates the sector, but that’s the result of supportive policies, Gillingham says—and the policies Trump is targeting were enacted to help US firms compete: “We would have to support our clean energy industries if we wanted to increase our share of clean energy manufacturing.”

Solar company stocks took a hit after the order was released. Gillingham says “the combination of high tariffs and removing the tax credits is a one-two punch that will greatly suppress the market for renewable energy.”

Johnson, the renewable energy businessman, concurs: “These federal policies create uncertainty [which] threatens to stall projects already in the pipeline and make it harder to keep building here at home.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25189618341984.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-07-08 22:04:01.540664

Trump’s EO Ends Support for “Unreliable” Green Energy

Trump’s administration labeled these renewable sources as unreliable, expensive, and overly dependent on foreign supply chains. According to Trump, clean energy policies threaten U.S. national security, disrupt the electric grid, and harm the natural environment.

This executive order marks a major reversal from the direction set by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, passed by Democrats, which offered strong incentives for clean energy projects.

Now, Trump’s energy policy shifts back to conventional energy sources like coal, natural gas, and nuclear—those he calls “reliable and dispatchable.” His administration argues that green energy has received unfair advantages and is weakening the nation’s energy system.

Tax Breaks for Renewables Face the Axe

As part of the executive order, the Treasury Department is now required to end tax credits for wind and solar production. It must also apply stricter rules concerning foreign-controlled companies involved in renewable energy supply chains.

In addition, the Interior Department must revise current policies that have so far favored renewables, such as streamlined permitting and lease arrangements. Both agencies have 45 days to submit detailed reports of their actions to the White House.

Moreover, the order freezes new permits and approvals for wind energy projects, especially offshore developments. Until a full government review is completed, federal agencies are barred from issuing new loans or contracts for wind projects. This decision creates immediate uncertainty in a sector that has been growing rapidly due to both state and federal commitments.

Wind Power at Risk: What’s at Stake

As per EIA, currently, wind energy plays a vital role in the U.S. electricity mix, contributing about 10% of the nation’s power, making it the largest single source of renewable energy. In states like Iowa and South Dakota, wind supplies more than half of all electricity.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, over 131,000 Americans are employed in wind energy-related jobs. These workers now face an uncertain future as federal support for their industry is scaled back.

Under the new law, developers will only be able to claim tax benefits for wind and solar projects if construction begins before the end of 2026. Furthermore, these projects must be completed and placed in service by the end of 2027.

Previously, developers could rely on tax incentives through 2032 under the 30% tax credit program. The shorter timeline could discourage companies from launching new renewable projects due to the higher financial risks and increased upfront costs.

Offshore Wind Goals in Limbo for States

This dramatic shift in policy could most severely impact states with ambitious climate targets. For instance, New York aims to install nine gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2035, enough to power roughly six million homes. The state has already invested heavily in infrastructure and workforce development to support this target.

Similarly, New Jersey plans to develop 11 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2040 and transition to a 100% clean energy power sector by 2050.

Offshore wind was a central pillar in both states’ strategies. Now, with federal support in question, these states may be forced to revise their energy roadmaps or find alternative funding solutions. Several state officials have already expressed concerns that their clean energy timelines may slip, which could push critical emissions targets further into the future.

Solar Slowdown: Cheap Power Faces New Roadblocks

The clean energy sector, especially solar, has made remarkable progress in lowering costs. Today, solar energy is one of the cheapest sources of new electricity in the United States. However, despite falling prices, large-scale projects still rely heavily on financial incentives to offset their high upfront expenses.

According to Wood Mackenzie, the U.S. solar industry installed 10.8 gigawatts (GWdc) of new capacity in Q1 2025. This was a 7% drop compared to Q1 2024 and a 43% decrease from Q4 2024.

If these federal benefits are removed, it could significantly slow the pace of new solar developments. It may also discourage private investors at a time when international competition in green energy is heating up.

What’s Next for U.S. Energy Policy Under Trump?

Supporters of the move believe that Trump’s new policy will help restore American energy independence and reduce unnecessary government spending. His energy policy puts the spotlight back on fossil fuels and nuclear power. On his first day back, he declared a “National Energy Emergency” aimed at eliminating what he calls bureaucratic barriers to energy production.

Fossil Fuels Back in the Spotlight

So, as part of this plan, he established the National Energy Dominance Council, which will focus on increasing fossil fuel production, attracting private investment, and accelerating domestic energy production.

According to Trump, returning to traditional energy sources will strengthen the economy, create well-paying jobs, reduce trade deficits, and improve the U.S. position on the global stage.

A Major Clean Energy Setback

Countries across Europe and Asia are increasing their investments in renewables, treating green energy as both an environmental and economic priority.

According to the IEA’s World Energy Investment 2025 report, global energy investment is projected to reach $3.3 trillion in 2025.

Out of this, approximately $2.2 trillion will go toward clean energy sources like renewables, nuclear, power grids, storage, low-emission fuels, energy efficiency, and electrification. That’s twice the amount, around $1.1 trillion, allocated to fossil fuels like oil, gas, and coal.

So if the U.S. steps back from clean energy leadership, it could fall behind in both technology development and global market share.

Thus, critics warn that this approach overlooks the long-term risks of continued reliance on fossil fuels, especially in a world already experiencing the impact of climate change.

Many cities, companies, and even Republican-led states have embraced renewables, not just for environmental reasons but also for economic growth. Pulling back federal support now, they say, risks stalling progress and undermining years of clean energy investment.

The Bottom Line: U.S. Climate Goals at Crossroads

In the near term, this executive order is expected to cause major uncertainty across the wind and solar industries. Projects currently in the pipeline could be delayed or canceled entirely.

Developers who had planned on receiving federal tax credits now face stricter deadlines and higher costs. Meanwhile, states will need to reevaluate their clean energy goals and consider alternative funding methods to stay on track.

Over the next several months, federal agencies will begin to implement the executive order. Their decisions and the public and state-level responses will shape the future of U.S. energy policy. Whether this move marks a new era of energy dominance or a costly detour from climate leadership remains to be seen.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2551753511.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 22:04:30.918212

Stronger storms often lead to more damage and higher insurance rates.

The aerodynamic shape of Tener's home is built to reduce wind pressure by 30%. Inside, trusses fan out like spokes on a bicycle wheel, distributing storm forces to help keep the roof in place.

""You worry about the wind blowing off the roof,"" Tener said of the main concerns for any home during a hurricane. ""You worry about the rain. And you worry about flooding.""

Anchored deep into the ground, the home also includes flood vents to relieve water pressure and protect the foundation. With these features, the house is rated to withstand 190-mile-per-hour winds — a very strong Category 5 hurricane.

""The inspector, when he came and inspected, he says, 'If we have a hurricane, I'm coming here,'"" Tener said.

A different kind of builder

Tener's home was built by Deltec Homes, a family-run company based in Asheville, North Carolina. The company has built more than 5,000 homes around the world, many designed specifically for resilience in extreme weather.

""We're taking that great shape and we're pairing it with amazing materials,"" said Matt Oblinsky, Deltec's lead engineer. The company estimates its homes cost about 10% more than traditional construction, but they often fare far better in storms. ""We're 99% successful,"" Oblinsky said of the homes' performance in past hurricanes. But he adds a note of caution: ""There's no such thing as a hurricane-proof home. We're very careful to say these are hurricane-resistant.""

Testing the limits

At the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) in South Carolina, engineers are working to make both new and existing homes more resilient. Using a massive wall of over 100 fans, the institute can simulate a Category 3 hurricane to test how well homes hold up under intense conditions.

In essence, IBHS builds homes and then destroys them.

And we do it all in the name of science,"" said Sarah Dillingham, senior meteorologist at IBHS.

The tests often reveal the vulnerabilities that can lead to catastrophic damage.

""Your roof is your first line of defense,"" Dillingham said. ""And it is what helps hold everything together in your home.""

She recommends storm-ready upgrades like high-impact windows, reinforced doors, and — crucially — wind-rated garage doors. ""Your garage door is your biggest opening of your home,"" she said. ""Because when wind gets in, it will find the weakest link.""

Longterm savings

For Tener, investing in a storm-resilient home has paid off financially as well. He even canceled his optional flood insurance saving him $12,000 per year.

""You put a little more money into it and it lasts forever,"" he said. ""It pays off in the long run.""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/07/08/dc5b9fb7-3111-4ba3-b18a-4e8715751b4a/thumbnail/1200x630/d9e98a4e0dc4cfc3bf7cc663eadc7c60/f5-hurricane-homes-transfer-frame-2013.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 00:01:23.543838

The up to 11 gigawatt (GW) facility in Amarillo powered by nuclear, natural gas, and renewable energy, is planned near the Department of Energy's Pantex nuclear weapons plant and in partnership with Texas Tech University.

Fermi said in its application at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which the regulator made public on July 8, that it is engaging in talks with many Big Tech companies, known as ""hyperscalers,"" on letters of intent and term sheets, or preliminary documents that are usually non-binding.

The application said that the hyperscalers would be tenants, apparently meaning they would not own part of the plants. Fermi did not immediately answer questions about financial arrangements being discussed with Big Tech companies or which or how many hyperscalers it is in talks with.

The last two reactors built in the U.S. were AP1000, completed in Vogtle, Georgia. They cost a total of more than $30 billion, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Those plants were delayed by years and came in billions of dollars above projected costs. But nuclear backers say lessons learned should cut construction time and final costs of the next AP1000 reactors.

Fermi said in the application that the nuclear complex, which it calls the Donald J. Trump Generating Plant, will be eligible for financing from the Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office. The only time the president tapped the LPO in his first term was for the Vogtle plants.

The company said other plans to finance construction and operation include equity capital contributions from institutional infrastructure and real estate investors, structured bond offerings, and clean energy tax credits.

Berlin, 9 July — Europe’s electricity mix is getting cleaner, and with it, the climate advantage of electric cars is growing.
“Battery electric cars in Europe are getting cleaner faster than we expected and outperform all other technologies, including hybrids and plug-in hybrids,” said Dr. Marta Negri, Researcher at the ICCT.
Since cars sold today typically remain on the road for about 20 years, continued improvement of the electricity mix will only widen the climate benefits of battery electric cars.
The study also accounts for other powertrain and fuel options such as hydrogen fuel cell electric cars.","A new study by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) estimates that battery electric cars sold today in Europe emit nearly 4 times less greenhouse gases over their lifetime than gasoline cars.

Berlin, 9 July — Europe’s electricity mix is getting cleaner, and with it, the climate advantage of electric cars is growing. According to new ICCT research, battery electric cars sold today produce 73% less life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions than their gasoline counterparts — even when factoring in production. That’s a 24% improvement over our 2021 estimates. In contrast, other powertrains, including hybrids and plug-in hybrids, show only marginal or no progress in reducing their climate impacts.

The study, a comprehensive life-cycle analysis of all major powertrain types, reinforces earlier findings: only battery electric cars can deliver the large-scale emission cuts needed to address Europe’s most polluting transport mode. Passenger cars account for nearly three-quarters of the sector’s emissions.

“Battery electric cars in Europe are getting cleaner faster than we expected and outperform all other technologies, including hybrids and plug-in hybrids,” said Dr. Marta Negri, Researcher at the ICCT. “This progress is largely due to the fast deployment of renewable electricity across the continent and the greater energy efficiency of battery electric cars.”

By 2025, renewable energy sources are expected to account for 56% of electricity generation in Europe, an 18-point increase compared with 2020. The EU’s Joint Research Centre projects this share will increase further in the next decade, to 86% by 2045. Since cars sold today typically remain on the road for about 20 years, continued improvement of the electricity mix will only widen the climate benefits of battery electric cars. In contrast, the fuels mix used by internal combustion engine cars will continue to mainly rely on fossil fuels, as the availability and price of alternative fuels remains uncertain.

Other technologies continue to lag behind battery electric vehicles in terms of life-cycle emission reductions. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid cars offer only 20% and 30% lower lifetime emissions than gasoline, respectively. This is also because plug-in hybrids are found to be driven less on electricity than previously assumed. While hybridization offers some benefits, these reductions are relatively small when compared with the emissions savings of battery electric cars—and they are not sufficient to meet the long-term climate targets.

The study also accounts for other powertrain and fuel options such as hydrogen fuel cell electric cars. This pathway can also offer significant emissions reduction (79%) compared with gasoline cars—but only when using renewable electricity-based hydrogen, which is currently not produced and available at scale in Europe. In contrast, fuel cell electric cars run on hydrogen produced from natural gas, which corresponds to almost the entirety of hydrogen available today, allowing only a 26% reduction of life-cycle emissions compared with gasoline cars.

Addressing misuse of data in the EV debate

Misinformation and selective use of data have generated confusion regarding the climate credentials of electric vehicles. The ICCT analysis provides transparency on the impact of a selection of flawed assumptions, such as not accounting for the development of the grid during the lifetime of vehicles and using non-representative data on vehicle fuel consumption and lifetime.

One common claim is that electric vehicles have higher emissions associated with battery manufacturing. While manufacturing emissions for battery electric cars are roughly 40% higher than for gasoline cars, the ICCT’s research shows that this initial “emissions debt” is typically offset after around 17,000 kilometers of driving, usually within the first one to two years of use in Europe.

“We hope this study brings clarity to the public conversation, so that policymakers and industry leaders can make informed decisions,” said Dr. Georg Bieker, ICCT Senior Researcher. “We’ve recently seen auto industry leaders misrepresenting the emissions math on hybrids. But life-cycle analysis is not a choose-your-own-adventure exercise. Our study accounts for the most representative use cases and is grounded in real-world data. Consumers deserve accurate, science-backed information.”

The ICCT analysis covers the greenhouse gas emissions from vehicle and battery production and recycling, fuel and electricity production, fuel consumption, and maintenance. Its methodology also accounts for the development of the electricity mix along the lifetime of vehicles, as well as real-world usage rather than official test values to estimate fuel and electricity consumption, which is key to assessing plug-in hybrid emissions.

Solar Stocks Renewables and several other energy stocks trended lower Tuesday following the order.","Solar stocks retreated Tuesday after President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Monday ending subsidies for green energy sources. The Department of Energy released a corresponding report the same day warning of a major spike in blackouts by 2030 due to the retirement of coal-fired plants.

The White House on Monday released the new executive order that eliminates subsidies for ""unreliable"" green energy sources, like wind and solar. The order claims that such projects displace ""affordable, reliable"" dispatchable domestic energy sources, which ""compromises our electric grid."" Dispatchable energy sources include conventional energy sources like fossil fuels. President Trump's announcement claims that reliance on green subsidies threatens national security by making the U.S. dependent on supply chains controlled by foreign adversaries.

Energy Executive Order

""Ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts to unreliable energy sources is vital to energy dominance, national security, economic growth and the fiscal health of the Nation,"" the order reads.

The executive order aims to eliminate taxpayer-funded green energy as well as support for green energy sources and supply chains built in or controlled by ""foreign adversaries."" The EO also builds on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by strengthening repeals and modifications to wind, solar and green energy tax cuts.

The Secretary Of Treasury has been ordered to within 45 days terminate clean electricity production and investment tax credits for wind and solar facilities as part of the Internal Revenue Code. There are some additional ""beginning of construction"" revisions, including restricting safe harbor provisions unless a ""substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.""

During that time period, the Department of the Interior will determine if wind and solar facilities have been given any preferential treatment compared to dispatchable energy sources. The Secretary of the Interior will then revise any regulations or policies to eliminate any such preferences for wind and solar.

The Treasury and Interior departments will submit their findings to the president after the 45 day period in order to plan for the next steps.

Need For New Energy

Meanwhile, the Department of Energy released a report on Monday warning that blackouts in the U.S. could increase 100x by 2030 ""if the U.S. continues to shutter reliable power sources and fails to add additional firm capacity."" Firm capacity refers to natural gas plants, coal-fired plants and nuclear power plants, which do not rely on variable sources like wind and sunlight.

The department warned that the status quo is ""unsustainable"" with growing electricity demand from AI and data centers. The U.S. currently plans for 104 gigawatts (GW) of power generation plant retirements, to be replaced by 209 GW of new energy generation by 2030. But only 22 of those new GW come from what the DOE deems firm generation sources.

The DOE wrote this could lead to significant outages when weather conditions do not accommodate wind and solar generation. Wind and solar facilities increasingly use batteries and other energy storage strategies in order to save their generated power supply and extend availability.

The DOE's model predicts annual outage hours could increase from ""single digits today to more than 800 hours per year."" Even without retirements, the model found outage risks in ""several regions"" would rise more than 30-fold during the forecast period, meaning ""the queue alone cannot close the dependable-capacity deficit.""

Solar Stocks

Morgan Stanley in a Tuesday research note wrote that energy companies AES (AES) and NextEra Energy (NEE) may be the most affected by the executive order, The Fly reported. The firm noted that the EO directs agencies to adjust construction guidelines for tax credit eligibility, implement FEOC restrictions and remove preferential policies for renewables from the Department of Interior. The order targets clean tech, solar stocks and other renewable developers the most, primarily AES and NextEra. It looks ""less meaningful"" for the likes of GE Vernova (GEV), Bloom Energy (BE), Plug Power (PLUG), First Solar (FSLR) and Fluence Energy (FLNC).

RBC Capital analyst Shelby Tucker noted that the plan to curtail renewables does not come as a surprise following commentary from members of the House Freedom Caucus last week, according to The Fly. Tucker expects more pressure on the sector as the order leaves the solar industry in another state of limbo while awaiting the Treasury interpretation. Meanwhile, it is still unclear how the Trump administration plans to redefine the ""beginning of construction.""

Solar Stocks

Renewables and several other energy stocks trended lower Tuesday following the order.

AES stock fell nearly 4%. First Solar and Array Technologies (ARRY) both tumbled almost 7%.

NextEra slid 3%.

SolarEdge (SEDG) pared its Tuesday declines to around 1%, while GE Vernova eased slightly.

“The 18 proposed rules also identify as an additional significant new use, manufacturing or processing of the chemical substances using feedstocks that contain any amount of contaminants listed in the proposed rules,” the proposal added.

And in the past year or so, several industry groups have added nuance to their positions on chemical recycling.
More stories about chemical recycling","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has withdrawn rules first proposed by the Biden administration that addressed chemical recycling and had attracted significant industry opposition.

In a document set to publish July 9, the current Trump administration-led EPA said it is withdrawing “significant new use rules,” or SNURs, proposed in June 2023 under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). These rules would have required companies that intend to “process any of 18 specific chemical substances derived from plastic waste for an activity that is proposed as a significant new use by this rule to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing that activity” to allow the agency to assess risks and regulate the significant new use if needed.

“The 18 proposed rules also identify as an additional significant new use, manufacturing or processing of the chemical substances using feedstocks that contain any amount of contaminants listed in the proposed rules,” the proposal added.

During the extended public comment period for the 2023 proposal, chemical recycling firm Brightmark suggested additional time for stakeholders to consider “a number of key terms and potential effects of the proposed rule which would merit additional clarification.”

In its comments at the time, Freepoint Eco-Systems, which has been involved in several chemical recycling projects, said the rules put undue administrative burdens on industry, and asserted there were inconsistencies between the policy and the EPA’s mission, including that:

Imposing regulatory obstacles for realistic recycling scenarios runs counter to EPA’s stated objective of developing a circular economy for plastics.

Focusing on feedstock purity deviates from EPA’s approach to regulating chemicals under TSCA.

Michigan-based Dow cited in its comments the lack of a de minimis level for impurities, which “makes analytical testing and quantification impractical.” The company recommended EPA specify the chemicals of concern and identify a content threshold, among other suggestions for increasing clarity.

Ironically, the 2023 proposal purported to be addressing a lack of clarity surrounding pyrolysis, the most common method of chemical recycling: “As a result of recent market trends, especially with respect to the increased processing of waste plastics, the EPA received several inquiries about OSWI (other solid waste incineration) units and the applicability of OSWI regulations to pyrolysis/combustion units for a variety of process and feedstock type,” the proposal stated. “Based on these requests and the absence of a statutory definition of pyrolysis in the CAA (Clean Air Act), the Agency believed that there was considerable confusion in the regulated community regarding the applicability of OSWI to pyrolysis/combustion units. Moreover, the term ‘pyrolysis/combustion’ is not defined in the current OSWI regulation, nor is it included in the definition of ‘Institutional waste incineration unit.'”

In comparison, no official company comments were submitted during the public comment period for a 2020 proposal from the Trump EPA that, among other issues, sought to remove the reference to “pyrolysis/combustion units” from the OSWI definition of ‘‘municipal waste combustion unit.” However, the agency “received significant adverse comments on that revision,” largely from environmental and tribal groups, the agency said in its own withdrawal in 2023.

Plastics makers applaud withdrawal

In a statement, Ross Eisenberg, president of America’s Plastic Makers, said the rules “imposed unnecessary burdens and hindered investments in the advanced recycling industry.”

Eisenberg went on to say the SNURs lacked the required scientific basis required under TSCA, exceeded EPA’s authority by attempting to regulate feedstock impurities, and “failed to recognize the thermal and chemical transformation processes — such as pyrolysis — that can remove these impurities during the advanced recycling process.”

In a February 2025 blog post, Eisenberg lauded the first Trump administration for its “great progress on updating and clarifying federal policy to treat the re-manufacture of plastic (and other materials) like similar manufacturing processes.” He urged the current EPA to re-introduce its proposed regulations from 2020, adding that “companies need regulatory certainty if they’re going to invest in technologies and facilities designed to last for decades” and “there are few more surefire paths to stifle innovation than ambiguous regulations.”

Recycling industry stakeholders have expressed similar concerns about inconsistency and uncertainty in how chemical recycling will be handled amid federal administration changes and state-level initiatives that are creating a patchwork of regulations.

For example, as California works to finalize regulations for its extended producer responsibility law for packaging, proposed procedures for handling new and emerging technologies — including chemical recycling — have drawn debate, especially from environmental groups. One recent draft placed the responsibility on the requesting facility to prove a new technology meets state requirements.

Recycling stakeholders in both Europe and the U.S. have struggled to advance chemical recycling projects, citing legislative hurdles along with high capital expenditures among the headwinds they face.

And in the past year or so, several industry groups have added nuance to their positions on chemical recycling.

THE “ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL” CUTS DOWN THE YEARS SOLAR AND WIND COMPANIES HAVE TO QUALIFY FOR TAX INCENTIVES.","The renewable energy industry faces a new series of hurdles after President Donald Trump signed the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ into law on July 4. The law quickly phases out tax incentives for wind and solar power, which some experts warn could lead to project cancellations, job losses and higher electricity prices as well as power shortages.

The changes are a significant shift in policy as the Trump administration looks to end taxpayer support for renewable energy. In the lead-up to the bill’s passage, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright called incentives for wind and solar “wasteful and counterproductive.”

“The more we load our grid with intermittent generation, the worse the grid performs during times of maximum stress and demand,” Wright wrote in an op-ed for the New York Post. Wright referenced a January winter storm in which the mid-Atlantic’s regional grid received only 4% of its power from renewables when electricity demand was high.

Opponents of the policy change, however, argue that it will slow renewable energy development at a time when the U.S. grid needs additional power generation to feed power-hungry data centers. In addition to causing project cancellations and job losses, renewable energy groups and industry analysts argue the new deadlines will limit new supply, forcing prices up and making the grid less reliable, especially during hot summers.

“This bill on the whole is negative for energy development in the United States, for manufacturing, and for just everyday families and consumers,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director focused on federal policy at the advocacy group Advanced Energy United.

How did the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ change renewable energy incentives?

The tax credits allow companies to earn a small reward — typically less than 1 cent per kilowatt-hour — for power generated by renewable energy sources. Once a new wind or solar installation begins providing electricity to the grid, the companies can claim the tax credits for the next 10 years.

Under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, companies that began construction by 2033 would qualify for 10 years of credits once they started operating. The new law shortens the deadline and adds a requirement for the project to begin providing power to the grid. Now, projects that begin construction within the next 12 months have until 2030 to begin operations. Any projects that start construction after July 4, 2026, or those already under construction, need to be operational by the end of 2027 to qualify for tax credits.

How will the deadlines affect renewable energy?

Godfrey said project development usually takes two to four years before construction of new wind or solar projects begin. In that time, projects can be held up by local or federal permitting processes and lawsuits.

As a result, Godfrey said there are projects “in active development right now that are not going to be able to commence construction here in the next year.” The new deadlines threaten to “cut those projects off at the knees,” he said.

Construction can take as little as six months for some solar projects or several years for large offshore wind, Godfrey said. Even once construction is finished, Godfrey added that projects must be connected to the grid before being deemed truly operational. That lengthy process, called interconnection, is controlled not by the renewable energy companies but by regional grid operators.

“The vast majority of these project developers are looking to outside capital in order to go about financing their projects,” Godfrey said. Without certainty that the projects will qualify for tax credits, he expects a significant number of financers will pull out of projects already underway.

Will the grid become less reliable?

Michael Keyser is the CEO of the National Renewables Cooperative Organization, where he helps local electric cooperatives around the country adopt renewable energy and other emerging technologies. In an interview with Straight Arrow News, Keyser said he is skeptical about dire predictions of cost increases and grid reliability issues.

While he acknowledged that some ongoing projects may not qualify for tax credits, he said that changing the long-term incentives away from wind and solar is a “shift that we needed.”

The Big Beautiful Bill keeps the window to qualify for tax credits open longer for clean energy sources like nuclear, hydropower, geothermal and batteries, which are not dependent on weather conditions. Keyser said electric co-ops are increasingly leaning toward these technologies — especially batteries — and other “dispatchable” resources that provide power to the grid whenever it’s needed.

“It’s time for [wind and solar] to stand on their own two feet,” Keyser said.

Doug Lewin, an energy expert and author of the Texas Energy and Power Newsletter, agreed that the grid needs clean dispatchable power, but he sees a danger in “hamstringing” renewables.

In an interview with Straight Arrow News, Lewin noted that dispatchable technologies, such as natural gas and nuclear, have even longer planning and construction timelines than wind and solar. In the immediate future, the grid needs more power, and solar is the fastest-growing energy source.

The new law, Lewin said, lacks “any sort of logical, sensible vision for how we’re going to grow power.”

Another source of uncertainty for renewable energy comes from the “foreign entities of concern” rule, a part of the law that places limits on the number of components companies can source from China, Russia, Iran and a few other nations. The exact guidelines have not yet been written, but on Monday, July 7, President Trump issued an executive order, giving the Treasury Department 45 days to finalize a rule.

Lewin said the policies amount to “choking out supply,” which he said could have dire consequences. “

“Higher prices and a whole lot more conservation alerts, energy emergencies, and the occasional rolling outage. That’s what we’re looking at over the next few years,” he said.

WITH THE SWEEP OF A PEN, PRESIDENT TRUMP PUT THE RENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRY ON NOTICE.

THE “ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL” CUTS DOWN THE YEARS SOLAR AND WIND COMPANIES HAVE TO QUALIFY FOR TAX INCENTIVES.

AND A NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER DEMANDS AGENCIES “RAPIDLY ELIMINATE THE MARKET DISTORTIONS,” TRUMP SAYS THESE SUBSIDIES CAUSE.

ENERGY SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT HAS CALLED THESE TAXPAYER INCENTIVES “WASTEFUL AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.”

BUT THOSE FOR INCENTIVES SAY THE START AND STOP FOR THE INDUSTRY IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, TOO.

BACK IN 2022, LAWMAKERS EXTENDED THE DECADES-OLD SUBSIDIES FOR SOLAR AND WIND WITH THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT.

UNDER THAT LAW, ENERGY COMPANIES HAD THROUGH 2032 TO START CONSTRUCTION TO QUALIFY FOR TAX INCENTIVES. ONCE A QUALIFIED SOLAR OR WIND FARM WAS GENERATING POWER, THE COMPANY COULD CLAIM A TAX CREDIT ON THAT RENEWABLE POWER FOR THE NEXT 10 YEARS.

THE “ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL,” NOW LAW, SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTENS THAT TIME FRAME.

CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT BEGIN WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS HAVE UNTIL 2030 TO GET ONLINE.

EVERYONE ELSE MUST BE GENERATING POWER BY THE END OF 2027 TO CASH IN.

ADVANCED ENERGY UNITED’S HARRY GODFREY SAYS THE TIMELINE WILL PUT SOME PROJECTS IN A TOUGH SPOT. THAT’S BECAUSE IT CAN TAKE TWO TO FOUR YEARS OF PLANNING BEFORE CONSTRUCTION EVEN STARTS.

“You could have projects that are in active development right now, that are not going to be able to commence construction here in the next year,” said Godfrey. “The passage and enactment of this law did mean that those projects got cut off at the knees.”

BUT MICHAEL KEYSER FROM THE NATIONAL RENEWABLES COOPERATIVE ORGANIZATION SAYS SOLAR AND WIND HAVE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH HELP FROM TAXPAYERS.

“These technologies have had 20 years’ worth of subsidies and it’s time for them to stand on their own two feet if they’re going to exist,” he said.

KEYSER SAYS HE’D PREFER TO SEE FEDERAL INVESTMENT SHIFT TO POWER SOURCES THAT CAN PROVIDE ELECTRICITY AROUND THE CLOCK.

In 1977, President Carter issued an Executive Order4 (Carter EO) directing CEQ to “[i]ssue regulations to Federal agencies for the implementation of the procedural provisions of [NEPA]” and stipulated some of the requirements to be incorporated therein. On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued EO 141545 rescinding the Carter EO and directing CEQ “to issue guidance on implementing NEPA and to propose rescinding the NEPA implementing regulations.”6 At this direction, CEQ rescinded its regulations implementing NEPA, concluding that “it may lack authority to issue binding rules on agencies in the absence of the now-rescinded” Carter EO.7

Grid Faces Urgent Reliability Challenges Amid AI-Driven Load Growth and Plant Retirements","A new report by the U.S. Department of Energy provides a comprehensive assessment of the adequacy and reliability of the U.S. electric grid and warns that without urgent reforms and investment, the U.S. electric grid will be unable to support the nation’s economic ambitions, particularly in artificial intelligence (“AI”) and digital infrastructure. The report responds to recent executive orders emphasizing the need for a uniform, data-driven approach to evaluating grid reliability, particularly in the face of accelerating power plant retirements and surging electricity demand from data centers and AI applications.

Key findings include:

Grid Reliability at a Crossroads: The report finds that the current trajectory of plant retirements, coupled with insufficient additions of firm, dispatchable generation, places the S. grid at significant risk of widespread outages by 2030. This risk is compounded by rapid load growth, especially from data centers supporting AI and digital infrastructure.

AI and Data Center Load Growth: Electricity demand from data centers represents a major new source of load. This growth is concentrated in key regions such as PJM, ERCOT, and the West and cannot be met with existing approaches to load addition and grid management.

Retirements Outpacing Reliable Additions: By 2030, 104 GW of generation (primarily coal and natural gas power plants) is slated for retirement, while only 22 GW of new firm baseload generation is expected to be added. The majority of new generation will come from intermittent sources (solar and wind), which do not provide the same reliability benefits as traditional baseload plants.

Risk of Outages Increases Dramatically: Under a scenario where all announced retirements occur, the report projects a 100-fold increase in annual hours of lost load, with some regions facing the possibility of losing up to 43% of hourly load during extreme events. Even if retirements are avoided, reliability risks remain elevated in several regions.

Regional Vulnerabilities: The analysis highlights that PJM, SPP, ERCOT, and SERC are particularly exposed to reliability shortfalls, especially during winter peaks. In contrast, regions such as ISO-NE and NYISO, which are not projected to see significant AI/data center load growth, remain relatively robust.

Modernization and Data Sharing Needed: The report underscores the inadequacy of traditional resource adequacy metrics and calls for modernized, granular approaches that account for the frequency, magnitude, and duration of outages. Enhanced regional collaboration and data exchange are identified as critical to effective grid planning and risk mitigation.

Solar power is reaching ever higher shares in some of the world’s largest power systems, but batteries promise to take this to the next level. Advances in technology and price reductions for both batteries and solar mean that solar power is no longer constrained to the daytime, but can deliver power 24 hours a day across the whole year. One of my favourite pieces published in June was an investigation into how 24/365 solar can already be a reality with today’s technology.

Ember also reported on the need for more ambitious grid planning if countries in Europe want to compete in the growing race for AI data centers – a topical issue right now. Another favourite June report described how electrification — the process of moving from fossil fuels to electricity — can fundamentally change the game and move us faster towards a clean energy future. It’s a brilliant read!

My pick for June’s chart of the month is taken from our analysis of the EU’s final National Energy and Climate Plans. One of Ember’s data viz experts, Reynaldo Dizon, took inspiration from the circular layout of the EU Council’s meeting room in Brussels and its vibrant carpet (designed to give equal visual weight to all 27 Member States) to provide a fitting visual metaphor presenting national target data on common ground.

The graphic reveals that most EU countries still lack adequate or complete data for critical aspects of the energy transition. Many targets are missing entirely or rely on outdated scenarios, limiting the EU’s ability to coordinate effectively and deliver on its climate goals.

You can see more of Ember’s best graphics from June in Datawrapper’s recent Data Viz Dispatch blog, which showcases some of the best data visualizations produced by newsrooms and other organisations from around the world.

China reached a major milestone in April with more than a quarter of its electricity coming from wind and solar – a level that was maintained in May, according to the latest data. China installed 93 GW of solar in May, which is roughly equivalent to the total solar capacity that Germany — the world’s sixth largest solar generator — has ever installed.

So far this year, China’s increase in clean power has been large enough to meet and exceed demand growth, resulting in a fall in fossil generation of 2.6% in January to May compared to the same period in 2024.

Scientists are worried what comes next,"Andrew Freedman, Ella Nilsen",,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/08/climate/doe-climate-contrarians-trump,"The Trump administration has hired three prominent researchers who over the course of their careers have questioned and even rejected the scientific consensus on human-caused climate change.
He, along with others, pushed for a public “red team” debate on climate science findings during the first Trump administration, but was overruled by political advisors in the White House at the time.
CNN has reached out to Koonin, Christy and Spencer individually for comment on their work at DOE.
Climate scientist Zeke Hausfather noted where Koonin and Christy’s views, for example, fall in the broader climate science community.
“While Koonin and Christy are among the more reasonable climate contrarians, they represent a tiny minority view representing perhaps 1% or less of climate scientists,” he told CNN.","The Trump administration has hired three prominent researchers who over the course of their careers have questioned and even rejected the scientific consensus on human-caused climate change. Each were given positions in the Energy Department, which is led by Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil and gas fracking executive.

The researchers are John Christy and Roy Spencer, both of whom are research scientists at the University of Alabama at Huntsville, and Steven E. Koonin of Stanford University’s Hoover Institution.

Koonin previously served at DOE during the Obama administration, and earlier was a scientist for the oil and gas giant BP. He, along with others, pushed for a public “red team” debate on climate science findings during the first Trump administration, but was overruled by political advisors in the White House at the time.

The hirings were first reported by the New York Times and confirmed by CNN.

In the Energy Department’s internal employee directory, Koonin is listed as a “special government employee,” Christy is listed as “expert” and Spencer a “consultant,” according to an agency source familiar with the matter. All three are listed as being under the office of Energy Secretary Wright, the source confirmed.

The Energy Department did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment on the hires of the three men, as well as questions on what they were working on at DOE and how long they would be there.

CNN has reached out to Koonin, Christy and Spencer individually for comment on their work at DOE. Christy told CNN in an emailed response that he was not on the Energy Department’s payroll and was “just here to help as needed.”

Koonin, a theoretical physicist, served as the undersecretary for science at DOE under the Obama administration. He is the author of the 2021 book, “Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn’t, and Why It Matters.”

The Trump administration is currently working on overturning a 2009 federal scientific finding that planet-warming pollution poses a threat to public welfare, which underpins many regulations designed to curb the nation’s pollution. That effort is being led by the Environmental Protection Agency, but is likely to involve other agencies, including the Department of Energy.

In addition, the second Trump administration has taken a hatchet to public spending on climate science research, proposing to eliminate the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s research activities altogether while making cuts at other agencies as well.

The Energy Department employs numerous climate scientists and houses some of the world’s most powerful supercomputers, which are used in part for modeling future global warming and its impacts.

Christy and Spencer have long maintained that satellite data does not show the same trends and extent of global warming as surface weather data and have used that to poke holes in the mainstream scientific data.

The Trump administration recently let go of hundreds of scientists who were beginning to work on the next iteration of the congressionally mandated National Climate Assessment, which includes input from all climate-related federal agencies.

In recent weeks, the administration took down past iterations of these climate assessments, which are the most authoritative reports on how climate change will affect the US. It also shut down the educational website, climate.gov, and laid off its staff.

While the scope of their work is currently unclear, some prominent climate scientists are concerned Christy, Spencer and Koonin will be working on an alternative version of the next National Climate Assessment, which would be far more slanted to fringe views on the causes and consequences of global warming.

Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University, told CNN the hires signal an effort by DOE to arrive at a predetermined result.

“Hiring Koonin, Spencer, and Christy is not just irregular, it’s a recognition that none of the normal channels would not give them the answer they want,” Dessler said. “This seems to be a thread running through this administration. They don’t seek out legitimate expert opinion; instead, they find people to give them the answer they want.”

Christy suggested in his email to CNN that he wasn’t involved with either the national climate assessment or efforts to overturn the 2009 endangerment finding.

“I don’t know what is happening with the National Climate Assessment or the Endangerment Finding,” he wrote.

Dessler noted that Koonin, Christy and Spencer are well-known for making value judgements in their supposedly scientific assessments as well as cherry picking data, and the language they use tends to be in the personal-opinion space, rather than the science space.

“There’s also a lot of ‘I’m not convinced’ on areas that everyone else in the field is convinced by (‘I’m not convinced climate models are any good’). That’s not really a scientific argument,” Dessler said.

Climate scientist Zeke Hausfather noted where Koonin and Christy’s views, for example, fall in the broader climate science community.

“While Koonin and Christy are among the more reasonable climate contrarians, they represent a tiny minority view representing perhaps 1% or less of climate scientists,” he told CNN. “While it’s useful to assess a variety of views, specifically seeking out and elevating fringe views that are not supported by the vast majority of the scientific research on a subject is deeply problematic.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20250708-koonin-christy-spencer.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-07-08 19:15:21.015247

July 8 (Reuters) – U.S. power consumption will hit record highs in 2025 and 2026, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its short-term energy outlook on Tuesday.

The EIA projected power demand will rise to 4,189 billion kilowatt hours in 2025 and 4,278 billion kWh in 2026, up from a record 4,097 billion kWh in 2024.

Those demand increases come in part from data centers dedicated to artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, and as homes and businesses use more electricity and less fossil fuels for heat and transportation.

The EIA forecast 2025 power sales will rise to 1,517 billion kWh for residential consumers, 1,474 billion kWh for commercial customers and 1,052 billion kWh for industrial customers.

Those forecasts compare to all-time highs of 1,509 billion kWh for residential consumers in 2022, 1,434 billion kWh in 2024 for commercial customers and 1,064 billion kWh in 2000 for industrial customers.

The EIA said natural gas’ share of power generation would slide from 42% in 2024 to 40% in 2025 and 2026. Coal’s share will rise from 16% in 2024 to 17% in 2025 before sliding to 15% in 2026 as renewable output rises.

The percentage of renewable generation will rise from 23% in 2024 to 25% in 2025 and 26% in 2026, while nuclear power’s share will slide from 19% in 2024 to 18% in 2025 and 2026, according to the outlook.

The EIA projected gas sales in 2025 would rise to 13.1 billion cubic feet per day for residential consumers, 9.8 bcfd for commercial customers and 23.5 bcfd for industrial customers, but fall to 35.8 bcfd for power generation.

That compares with all-time highs of 14.3 bcfd in 1996 for residential consumers, 9.6 bcfd in 2019 for commercial customers, 23.8 bcfd in 1973 for industrial customers and 36.9 bcfd in 2024 for power generation.

Trump signed an executive order Monday that calls for the Treasury Department to strictly enforce the end of the tax credits for clean energy projects.
But on his long-running hostility to green energy, Trump has remained constant.
The decision lifts a lower court’s injunction that had blocked 21 agencies from complying with Trump’s order.
The Trump administration had told the weather service to hire 126 meteorologists and other specialists more than a month ago.","President Donald Trump is wasting no time hastening the demise of green energy tax credits — in keeping with the big, beautiful bargain he made with conservative Republicans.

The deal with Republican holdouts to end incentives for wind and solar power paved the way for passage of Trump’s mega-tax-and-spending bill. Trump’s July 4 signature on the bill completed the legislative assault on the Inflation Reduction Act’s subsidies for renewable energy.

But just how quickly the White House turned a handshake deal with House hard-liners into a presidential order — almost overnight — is notable, Christa Marshall reports.

Trump signed an executive order Monday that calls for the Treasury Department to strictly enforce the end of the tax credits for clean energy projects. It directs Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to look for ways in which wind and solar are getting preferential treatment. And it gives Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent 45 days to implement provisions in the law aimed at preventing projects from partnering with “foreign entities of concern.”

That means primarily China, the globe’s dominant source of solar and battery technology.

The deadlines are tight. Wind and solar projects receive tax credits as long as they start construction by mid-2026, while projects that start later would need to be placed into service by 2027. In comparison, nuclear and geothermal resources have until 2033 to obtain tax credits.

Promises made, promises kept

Trump’s eagerness to make good on his promise to Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) and other budget hawks fits neatly with his disdain for Biden-era climate policy. Trump has rebuked the previous administration’s goal of shutting down coal plants in favor of carbon-free wind and solar generation, which he recently called “windmills, and the rest of this ‘JUNK.’”

Monday’s order to Treasury and Interior is also striking for another reason: The famously transactional president isn’t always known for holding his ground on big policy announcements.

Wall Street investors started using the term TACO (“Trump Always Chickens Out”) after Trump repeatedly backed away from threats and deadlines for slapping high tariffs on U.S. trading partners. The president is walking back a pause on the delivery of U.S. weapons to Ukraine in the war against Russia.

And last month’s bombing of Iran — raising the possibility of deeper U.S. involvement in a Middle East war — came despite the president’s boasts of keeping Americans out of foreign entanglements.

After last weekend’s tragic rains and floods in Texas, which took the lives of more than 100 people, including 27 kids at a Christian summer camp for girls, the seriousness of the administration’s on-again, off-again talk of abolishing the Federal Emergency Management Agency faces a real-world test, as do Trump’s cuts at the National Weather Service.

But on his long-running hostility to green energy, Trump has remained constant.

Supreme Court says Trump can order mass firings

The Supreme Court gave Trump the go-ahead today to launch his plan to fire thousands of federal workers, write Josh Gerstein and Hassan Ali Kanu.

The high court’s unsigned order grants the administration’s emergency appeal to enforce a February executive order that instructed agencies to carry out “reductions in force.” The justices said they were not assessing the legality of agency layoff plans, and litigation over the downsizing efforts is sure to continue.

The decision lifts a lower court’s injunction that had blocked 21 agencies from complying with Trump’s order.

Help wanted

The National Weather Service still hasn’t posted job ads for vacant positions in depleted forecast offices around the country, Daniel Cusick writes.

The agency has lost nearly 600 employees in recent months, as the administration fired probationary employees and made early retirement or buyout offers. Those vacancies are now in the spotlight after catastrophic floods in Texas killed more than 100 people, including dozens of children.

The Trump administration had told the weather service to hire 126 meteorologists and other specialists more than a month ago. A spokesperson for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the weather service, said the process to post job ads “is currently underway.”

Meanwhile, experts are warning that Trump’s upcoming cuts to weather and disaster spending — including warning systems and flood projects — could mean new risks for areas around the country, write Scott Waldman and Chelsea Harvey.

“Lives are going to be lost, property is going to be damaged,” said Rick Spinrad, who served as NOAA administrator under former President Joe Biden.

Emergency coal for AI?

The Department of Energy released a report Monday that lays the groundwork for keeping open coal and gas plants slated for closure, Peter Behr writes.

The analysis details the worst-case scenarios if the energy needs of artificial intelligence expand beyond the grid’s capacity — including weeks of power outages in some states by 2030. The report is widely seen as setting the stage for Trump to use an emergency provision of the Federal Power Act, written for wartime use, to order fossil fuel plants to keep running.

“Absent intervention, it is impossible for the nation’s bulk power system to meet the AI growth requirements while maintaining a reliable power grid and keeping energy costs low for our citizens,” said the report.

It could mark a serious win for the automaker, as it prepares to launch multiple next-generation affordable EVs, developed by its ""skunkworks"" teams.

The LFP supply chain has long been dominated by China. But American manufacturing of automotive-grade LFP cells marks a pivotal moment for the industry.

Ford’s upcoming electric vehicle battery plant in Michigan should still qualify for production credits under the Trump administration’s newly enacted legislation, the automaker said on Tuesday. If that happens, it could mark a major win and a turning point for the Dearborn automaker’s EV plans. The federal funding could help offset manufacturing costs for Ford’s next-generation affordable EVs.

“Ford is committed to making the best, most cost-effective batteries for the next generation of electric vehicles in the United States,” Ford said in a statement. “The BlueOval Battery Park Michigan is on track to qualify for the production tax credit—a win for our customers and a win for American competitiveness,” the automaker added. Reuters reported the news first.

The $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park Michigan is already 60% complete and slated to begin producing lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries next year. These batteries, which are cheaper and more durable than traditional lithium-ion packs (but less power-dense), will power Ford’s upcoming affordable EVs. The Marshall, Michigan, facility is the first in the U.S. to make automotive LFP batteries.

The LFP supply chain has for years been dominated by China. But LFP tech is now going global. Auto executives increasingly see it as key to making affordable, mass-market EVs.

""This is an opportunity for Ford to lead in this space and bring the technology back to the U.S.,"" Lisa Drake, Ford’s vice president of Technology Platform Programs and EV Systems, told InsideEVs in an interview in June during a tour of the BlueOval Battery Park Michigan.

The Trump administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” now signed into law, dramatically undercuts federal support for clean energy. The clean vehicle tax credit is being phased out far earlier than expected, fuel economy rules have been rolled back and the Environmental Protection Agency is reportedly preparing to loosen its Multi Pollutant Emissions Criteria—again.

Still, incentives for domestic battery manufacturing remain intact, at least in some capacity. The rules are now stricter, requiring a higher share of raw materials to be sourced from within the U.S. But projects that were already under construction by the end of 2024, such as Ford’s LFP plant, are not affected under Section 45X of the advanced manufacturing credit, and therefore do not need to meet the tougher requirements.

Ford broke ground on the LFP plant back in 2023 and seems relatively shielded from the new restrictions under the newly passed spending bill. That's a relief for the company, as the plant has drawn scrutiny from Republican lawmakers over Ford’s licensing agreement with Chinese battery giant CATL, which some have alleged has ties to forced labor over in China.

But the automaker said the plant is key to bringing affordable EVs to the masses and to bring back LFP tech—which was invented at the University of Texas at Austin—to the U.S. It will support 1,700 manufacturing jobs when complete.

Plus, Ford has long maintained that the new battery plant is “Ford-owned” and “Ford-operated.” The CATL collaboration is merely a “legal fact” because of who owns the patents and the licensing deal which will allow for the technology to truly proliferate in the U.S.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/rKqbWE/s1/ford-blueoval-battery-park-michigan.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 19:13:37.026455

In the Chicago area and around the country, dealership owners are preparing for the cuts to go into effect in just a couple of months. The owners said they are already seeing changes in the market.

The federal tax credits, which are meant to get drivers behind the wheel of electric cars, end Sept. 30. The credits cut up to $7,500 off the price of a new electric car, and up to $4,000 off to a used car.

""The $7,500 incentive is fully 20% the price of this vehicle,"" said John Crane, who runs Hawk Auto Group, as he pointed out a Fiat 500E for sale on one of his lots.

The end of the federal tax credits for electric car purchases is a consequence of the massive tax and spending cut bill passed last week. Crane said the electric vehicles currently in stock will sell out, and then dealerships after that will only get supply to the tune of a handful a month.

""We're not going to order as many as we currently have in stock,"" he said.

Crane added that a $7,500 credit going away also amounts to a cost of about $200 more a month for the average consumer.

He said the result of all this is sure to be that a lot of people just won't buy electric cars anymore.

""The barrier to entry is going to be higher, and less people will be willing to take a chance,"" he said.

Hawk Auto Group, which has dealerships across Illinois, said the end of the tax credit will mean changes for them too.

""The $7,500 credit is beyond the scope of what a dealership could afford to make up,"" Crane said.

Meanwhile, the change is already making waves in the auto industry — to the point where some manufacturers aren't making as many electric cars.

""Nissan has pushed out production for some of their electric vehicles,"" Crane said, ""and you know, even at the high end, Maserati was planning on going all-electric, and now they're not going to do that at all.""

It is not just a couple of automakers reassessing plans for electric vehicles.

""Nearly all automakers have reassessed their product portfolio and are pushing their new entrants into electric vehicle segments further out, so they have more time to adjust what the real market is going to end up being without the incentive,"" said Crane.

John Truckenbrod is founder of Chicago-based EV Energy Group. He offered some perspective on the situation.

""Globally this year, one out of four cars sold will be electric,"" Truckenbrod said. ""Now, the United States isn't necessarily the leader in electric vehicles.""

The EV Energy Group installs different types of chargers — residential and commercial. He said the end to the tax credit may slow down electric vehicle purchases, but interest is not going anywhere.

""It will probably slow the market down, but it's not going to end the market,"" Truckenbrod said.

But what does the end to the tax credit mean for those who are shopping for a car. Regardless of whether interest is maintained, consumers may indeed see fewer all-electric vehicles on dealership lots.

""If price goes up, we expect sales to go down. It's very simple,"" said Crane. ""So that means we would have to stock a few less, and we'll probably be working more off an order-based system for electric vehicles in the future.""
