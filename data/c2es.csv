For years, South of the Border included a casino because video poker was legal in South Carolina but illegal in North Carolina.","Part of the South of the Border roadside attraction — on Interstate 95 on the line between North and South Carolina — has been put up for sale.

The owners are selling 30 acres that include the Pedroland amusement park, the ""SOB Convention Center,"" a motel building, a mini-golf course, vacant land and a former casino. The price is listed at $2.85 million.

Those parts of the attraction have closed, but South of the Border is keeping its unusual sombrero observation tower, reptile lagoon, souvenir stores and restaurants. The main motel and campground are also still in operation.

Real-estate agent Ken Jackson says he anticipates the buyer will redevelop the site to take advantage of I-95 traffic. The only condition is that the new owner can't sell fireworks, because that's already part of South of the Border.

""We've had a lot of interest from people wanting to do that, but that's the only thing that wouldn't be allowed,"" he told WUNC.

Jackson says the property for sale could be redeveloped as a hotel or other travel-oriented business. He says while South of the Border has new competition from a Buc-ee's truck stop a few exits deeper into South Carolina near Florence, the location still gets heavy traffic.

""Buc-ee's is the new shiny toy, and it is attractive to travelers as well, but there are plenty of people traveling up and down the interstate, and enough for both businesses,"" Jackson said.

But he says it's unlikely the new owner would reopen the amusement park. ""I'm not sure there's much demand for amusement parks of that size anymore, but it's a great opportunity for someone to go in and build a modern hotel,"" Jackson said. ""It'd be a great place for RV sales or RV service center — anything travel-related, logistics-related.""

According to the real-estate listing, the old carousel that remains on the amusement park site won't be included in the sale.

South of the Border has been a quirky stop for travelers since the 1950s, but it's faced criticism in recent years for its cartoon depiction of a Mexican man in its many billboard ads. They include slogans like ""You never sausage a place! You're always a weiner at Pedro's!""

As anthropogenic climate change and pollution rapidly increase, pressures are placed on bee colonies throughout the country.
Here’s the question: If the EPA knows that certain pesticides are harmful to bee colonies, why are we still using them?
Protecting the honey bee is as essential as protecting our democracy and the industry on which our country was founded.
To be better, accountability and action need to be taken at the root cause of the decline in bee colonies.","From the agrarian ideals of Thomas Jefferson to the emergence of the military-industrial complex of post-World War II, the bee has remained an essential figure of American progress and democracy.

As our country expanded westward and established our government, the honey bee has long been a marker of the past, present and future of the United States of America. Yet today, the downfall of the honey bee at the expense of American progress has raised concerns about the future of our nation.

Arriving to the American colonies during the early 17th century, the honey bee quickly became acclimated to the ecosystems of North America. Although the modern species of Apis melliferia is native to Europe, an extinct species of honey bees once pollinated the landscapes of North America 14 million years ago.

Bees, native and nonnative, have become an essential part of American ecosystems, agriculture and biodiversity. As major pollinators, bees boost the food crops of the United States and work to reduce the impacts of climate change across the globe.

Yet today, the modern bee faces the same threat it once faced 14 million years ago in North America: extinction. As anthropogenic climate change and pollution rapidly increase, pressures are placed on bee colonies throughout the country.

Regardless of origin, species of bees and pollinators are threatened today under American lifestyles, consumption and policy, facing up to a 70% colony loss in 2025, the highest in U.S. history. Bees pollinate 75% of U.S. food and agricultural crops, contributing $15 billion to the U.S. economy every year.

The urgency hasn’t been placed on reducing bee habitat fragmentation or curbing the use of agricultural pesticides that have sparked a huge loss in colonies. Instead, the United States has taken a technological approach to curb pollinator losses and avoid changing lifestyle habits altogether.

An insulting mark of bees as infrastructure and replaceable technology has shifted the importance of bees from one of ensuring food security to agricultural profit, underscoring the profit-driven mindset amid an environmental crisis.

This leads us to question whether potential solutions exist to protect bees for pollination or to ensure monopolies have cheap, ready-to-use pesticides at their disposal. As the Environmental Protection Agency reports, “certain pesticides are harmful to bees,” further stating their measures and guidelines for “protecting bees” on product labels.

Here’s the question: If the EPA knows that certain pesticides are harmful to bee colonies, why are we still using them?

Here’s my answer: profit and influence.

As agribusiness attempts to maximize yields while cutting costs, cheap pesticides will continue to be used alongside monetary incentives towards the EPA to turn a blind eye to the scope of the problem. Under the current presidential administration, we see a reversal of any progress made when deregulation is placed in their hands.

Recently, institutions and research labs, in attempts to address growing colony losses, have begun developing artificial pollinator technologies to tackle the growing strain on pollination.

Under the status quo, can we expect the needed changes to occur? Here’s the short answer: no. As development and research ramp up through robot bees and artificial replacements to native pollinators, we are going in the wrong direction.

What this does is move the use and importance of bees away from their environmental importance, crucial during a time when more emphasis on environmental protection is needed.

What is so appalling about the development of pollinator technologies is the lack of actual credibility or accountability towards anthropogenic causes of bee habitat losses and colony decline. Instead of changing consumption patterns, the United States has encouraged technological advancements that have no long-term stability.

The effectiveness of artificial intelligence replacements or modified bees is dependent on specific environmental conditions and infrastructure. Natural bees are far more efficient and effective in saving and preventing gaps in pollination. In simple terms, protecting bee habitats or changing pesticide usage is far easier than developing and pouring countless dollars into artificial replacements.

To achieve true environmental sustainability and ecological solvency, actual bees need to be prioritized, and all parties must be held accountable for degrading actions. The solvency of the American agricultural industry and food security across the globe rely on the pollination of bees.

A reality that most farmers can not afford new technologies only furthers the dominance of agricultural monopolies, creating inequalities that could be avoided by simply preserving natural resources and bee populations.

To protect our crops from the impacts of anthropogenic climate change and consumption, the U.S. needs to prioritize the ecosystems of pollinators over human demands to avoid the same fate as 14 million years ago.

Without the honey bee, our democracy and values shift from one of the American dream of freedom and prosperity, to a reality of scarcity, degradation and denial.

Protecting the honey bee is as essential as protecting our democracy and the industry on which our country was founded. To be better, accountability and action need to be taken at the root cause of the decline in bee colonies.

As the first year of working under this new strategy wraps up, growers may still have questions about how these changes will affect their operations. Here is an update and overview to help growers prepare for 2026.

Strategy Overview

The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been in place since the 1970s; but in April 2022, the EPA began outlining its plan to meet ESA requirements. The primary focus has been on managing spray drift and runoff to reduce the risk of exposure to endangered species. The draft Herbicide Strategy was released in 2023 and finalized in 2024.

The new ESA language must now be included on labels beginning with new active ingredients and as actives are re-registered.

According to the EPA, the final strategy uses the most updated information and processes to determine whether an herbicide will impact a listed species and identify protections to address any impacts. Over time, all crop protection products will carry this language. The Insecticide Strategy was finalized this spring, and the Fungicide Strategy is still in development.

WinField® United has worked closely with industry associations, scientific organizations and our retail partners to advocate that the EPA’s decisions were grounded in sound science and that practical, workable solutions made it to the field.

Impacts on Growers

While there may be implications, this isn’t a fire drill. Not all product labels are immediately subject to the ESA or have the ESA language. It’s an ongoing integration process tied to new products and re-registration.

There are only a couple of labels that currently show the ESA language; and more than likely, it is not going to be a one-size-fits-all solution. Depending on the risk bucket and the characteristics of the product, growers may see different mitigations for drift and runoff as well as varying buffer lengths. How it is executed on each label may also be a little bit different.

As new products come out, growers should make sure to read the label and familiarize themselves with the new language ahead of the growing season.

Growers also may have to implement additional mitigation measures, such as spray buffers or conservation practices, to minimize environmental impact. They can get ahead of this by characterizing fields and identifying any existing practices that qualify as mitigations. We assume, for many growers, their fields may already check most of the boxes for the points needed.

A Simple Solution to Help Boost Herbicide Performance

If growers need a drift mitigation option for herbicides affected by the ESA, the new SuperLock™ adjuvant from WinField United fits the bill. This novel, single formulation combines a high surfactant crop oil concentrate with proprietary drift reduction technology. It is one of the only products on the market with this combination.

One of our goals was to provide another product that meets label requirements while effectively tackling the challenge of drift management. From an ESA standpoint, SuperLock adjuvant fits in the oil emulsion category, which is a drift-reducing adjuvant category currently approved under the Herbicide Strategy. This makes it a valuable tank-mix tool to help manage drift for many growers.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt55544e1947d08b8e/690c47f6b95521970fd20835/25-WIN-1273_CP-SuperLock-13_FEATURE_1920x1080.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-01 09:00:55.525336

As the demand for renewable energy solutions continues to surge, the industry is battling a widening skills gap that must be addressed quickly to meet global carbon emission goals.

In this blog, we delve into the pressing issue of talent shortages within the renewable energy sector, examining the causes, implications, and viable solutions to ensure companies and stakeholders are well-equipped to thrive in this rapidly changing industry.

The Energy Transition

The energy transition refers to the global shift from traditional, carbon-intensive energy sources to sustainable and renewable alternatives such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal. Governments, businesses, and communities are pushing this shift to cut emissions and fight climate change. As a result, the energy landscape is undergoing a significant transformation, as the diversification of energy sources calls for rapid industry growth.

This increased focus on renewable energy has created a surge in demand for skilled professionals with expertise in areas such as solar panel installation, wind turbine maintenance, energy storage systems, and grid integration. There’s a growing need for specialised talent to design, build, operate, and maintain renewable energy infrastructure. As a result, traditional energy companies, as well as new entrants in the renewable sector, are aggressively competing for a limited pool of qualified candidates.

The growth rate in the energy transition also outpaces the learning and development of candidates who lack the necessary skills and expertise. The evolution of technologies and regulations in the renewable energy space is forcing the industry to adapt quickly, often leaving a gap for professionals with up-to-date knowledge and qualifications. Equally, the retirement of experienced workers from the conventional energy sector and the inadequate pipeline of new talent entering the renewable energy workforce have made the shortage of skilled labour much more significant.

Advancing Technologies and Innovation

Advancing technologies and innovation in renewable energy have undoubtedly revolutionised the industry, but have also created a significant skills gap and talent shortage. Renewable technologies like solar, wind, and storage are evolving fast - faster than the workforce can keep up. capable of implementing, maintaining, and advancing these technologies. As a result, companies in the renewable energy sector are facing a shortage of qualified professionals with the necessary expertise to drive these innovations forward.

Traditional educational programmes and workforce development initiatives have struggled to keep pace with these changes, leading to a shortage of professionals with the right skills and knowledge.

Equally, the increasing complexity of renewable energy systems requires a multidisciplinary approach, combining expertise in engineering, data analytics, cybersecurity, and project management. This demand for a diverse skill set further exacerbates the talent shortage as companies struggle to find individuals with the necessary combination of technical, analytical, and strategic capabilities.

Navigating Talent Shortages to Ensure Secure Renewable Pipelines

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, the world will need to create 14 million new renewable energy jobs by 2030 and move another 16 million workers to renewable energy roles. To grow sustainably, companies need to tackle the talent shortage head-on. . As the demand for renewable jobs continues to outpace the supply of skilled professionals, companies must focus on attracting, developing, and retaining top talent.

Investing and Nurturing Talent

Investing in specialised training programmes, partnerships with educational institutions, and apprenticeship initiatives can help build a pipeline of skilled workers equipped to meet the industry's evolving needs. Additionally, fostering a culture of continuous learning and professional development within the organisation can empower existing employees to upskill and adapt to the changing technological landscape.

Not only does this train any new recruits into the industry, but it also offers those in different sectors with a wealth of experience the chance to diversify from other energy industries and bring the skills and knowledge they already have to the renewable sector.

Time and cost are real concerns - but the sooner companies invest in training, the faster they’ll build a strong talent pipeline.. One of the key offerings that companies can provide is specialised technical training. Courses on solar power systems, wind turbine technology, energy storage solutions, and other renewable energy technologies equip individuals with in-depth knowledge. With this expertise, they can effectively contribute to the design, installation, and maintenance of renewable energy systems.

Learning and development can provide access to up-to-date information on industry standards, policies, and best practices, ensuring that talent is well-informed and compliant with industry requirements.

Mentorship and coaching programmes can also be invaluable for talent development. Companies can facilitate mentorship opportunities with seasoned professionals in the renewable energy sector, providing guidance and insight to support the career growth of less-experienced individuals.

Defining Company Culture

Defining a compelling employer brand and nurturing a distinct company culture can be the difference between attracting top-tier talent and falling behind the competition.

Renewable energy talent is drawn to organisations that cultivate a positive, inclusive, and supportive work environment. A company's mission, vision, and values should not just be words on paper but resonate authentically in every interaction and initiative.

Culture shapes every part of the employee experience—from hiring to retention. Prioritising cultural fit is paramount when it comes to renewable energy recruitment. During any talent acquisition efforts, companies should emphasise the importance of their culture and align it alongside the skills and experience they require to attract their ideal candidates.

EVP

An employer value proposition (EVP) encapsulates the unique rewards and benefits that differentiate a company from its competitors. By pinpointing organisational strengths, such as distinctive benefits, an inclusive company culture, unparalleled career growth avenues, or flexible work structures, companies can craft a compelling EVP that delivers an authentic look at what working life will be like for the next new employee.

EVP pairs closely with the employer brand. A robust employer brand celebrates diversity, champions innovation, and prioritises employee well-being. To attract top talent and potential hires, companies should prominently spotlight these attributes on their websites, social media, job descriptions, and throughout the interview process.

Note: An EVP is only as impactful as its reach. Ensure EVP permeates all company touchpoints, from job postings and websites to social media channels. An EVP that stands out can significantly amplify talent attraction strategy.

Authentic employer branding begins with the current workforce. Employees naturally evolve into brand ambassadors when they feel valued, engaged, and genuinely content in their roles. Their enthusiasm and pride amplify an employer brand, which will help companies build a reputation as a go-to employer within the industry.

One study found that around 70% of prospective employees would turn down job opportunities if the company offering the position had a bad reputation—even if they were out of work. This emphasises the need to invest in and uphold a stellar employer brand rooted in genuine employee experiences and organisational values.

Benefits also play a key role. These could include a competitive salary, bonuses, annual leave, health insurance, hybrid working, and more.

Streamlining Talent Acquisition Strategies

As competition for attracting top talent in the renewable energy recruitment space grows, streamlining the talent acquisition strategy is another step towards increasing your chances of hiring the people you require, whether permanent or contract.

Speed matters. In today’s market, delays can cost you the best candidates. By refining and accelerating the recruitment process, companies can swiftly identify, engage with, and onboard the best talent before competitors get there first.

Analysing the existing process and identifying any bottlenecks is key to speeding up the process. This could be the time it takes to get back to a candidate to offer them a position, potentially taking too long to post job specs or review candidate CVs. Once it’s been determined what could be costing the most time and resources, companies should optimise these without compromising the integrity of their hiring standards.

First impressions matter: As part of the strategy for attracting talent, it's crucial to remember that this is a candidate's first interaction with an organisation - and first impressions count. An efficient, organised, and transparent hiring process instils confidence in candidates and bolsters an organisation's reputation in the talent market.

Thinking about first impressions isn't just referring to the interview stage, where a company meets the candidate for the first time in person or through a virtual call. Their first impression could come at any moment, from renewable energy job specs, social posts, websites or through word of mouth. Ensuring a brand gives off the right impression across all channels is vital, as you never know when a candidate could be interacting with the company and gaining a first impression.

The Job Listing Experience

Streamlining the application process demonstrates respect for candidates' time and enhances their overall experience with the organisation. For in-demand talent, a seamless job process can be a decisive factor in choosing one employer over another.

Transparent job advertisements are crucial for attracting qualified candidates and building trust with potential employees.

By clearly outlining the job responsibilities, requirements, and company culture, transparent job adverts set realistic expectations and ensure that candidates understand what the role entails. This transparency not only helps attract candidates whose skills and values align with the position but also reduces the likelihood of mismatches and turnover, which in turn causes further delays in securing the best talent.

While job boards remain crucial to talent acquisition, the sheer volume can be overwhelming for active and passive candidates. Strategically selecting platforms that align with the renewable industry nuances and the specific roles being targeted will lead to a more robust talent pool better fitted to the required roles.

In today's digital age, leveraging social media also amplifies the reach of job posts. Platforms like LinkedIn, X, and industry-specific forums can serve as excellent channels to showcase job vacancies, reaching passive and active job seekers alike.

Attracting top talent is about being clear, specific, and compelling - right from the job post. . A well-articulated job description can be the first step in forging meaningful connections with potential hires, setting the stage for successful collaborations in the renewable energy industry.

Finding the Right Partner

For a company, getting talent acquisition right can be an impossible task. The specialised nature of roles within the renewable energy sector often demands candidates with a unique blend of technical expertise, industry-specific knowledge, and a deep understanding of sustainability practices. This requires a rigorous talent acquisition process, which many companies don’t have the time or expertise for.

A high-performing hiring team is instrumental in attracting top talent. Therefore, companies need to ensure their HR and recruitment teams are equipped with the necessary tools, training, and resources to execute their roles effectively.

Many organisations turn to recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) as a partner to support with talent acquisition. These organisations can offer their vast expertise to ensure these technical roles are filled quickly and compliantly. Often, they also have an extensive talent pool already.

A staffing provider can offer invaluable support to a company grappling with talent demands in several ways:

Specialised Recruitment Expertise: RPO providers are equipped with specialised knowledge and expertise in identifying and attracting top talent in various fields, including renewable energy. They can efficiently source, screen, and present qualified candidates, saving the company time and resources in the hiring process.

Access to a Diverse Talent Pool: These providers often have access to a vast network of professionals, including those with specialised skills in renewable energy technologies and sustainability. This can significantly expand the company's options and increase the likelihood of finding the right fit for their specific talent needs quickly.

Flexibility and Scalability: They can offer flexible staffing solutions to help companies manage fluctuating talent demands. Whether the need is for short-term project-based roles or long-term strategic positions, staffing providers can tailor their services to meet the company's evolving requirements.

Industry Insights: A reputable staffing provider with experience in the renewable energy sector can offer valuable industry insights, including salary trends, in-demand skills, and talent market dynamics. This information can guide the company in making informed decisions about its talent acquisition and retention strategies.

Copper also plays an inextricable role in nearly all forms of renewable energy. The EPA's aggressive and unprecedented use of a regulatory veto comes just as the world prepares for a global shortage of copper and other minerals due to the surging demands of digitalization and electrification. While the United States has one of the world's greatest mineral repositories, the ability to get those minerals into the supply chain to help meet America's needs is threatened by crippling regulatory uncertainty, including the overly broad nature of EPA's asserted authority.

The misuse of EPA's veto authority casts a cloud over mining projects in Alaska and beyond. Regulatory obstacles to mineral development harm not only the U.S. mining industry, but also domestic manufacturing, innovation, and security… Amici and their members need certainty in the federal regulatory landscape governing mining operations and urge the Court to hold EPA to its statutory mandate and to prior interpretations and practice.""

Major arguments in the Chamber's brief include:

""…EPA vetoed a permit that is a crucial prerequisite for construction of the Pebble Mine...without considering the significant financial consequences of that veto for the project proponents, the State, and the national economy...""

""…Congress' instruction to EPA in Section 404(c)-that the agency evaluate whether effects are ""unacceptable"" before exercising backstop authority-is a paradigmatic demand that regulation proceed only after a reasoned consideration of costs. The statutory term ""unacceptable"" rivals those adjectives that the Supreme Court has already determined to ""naturally"" embrace a consideration of costs before an agency chooses to regulate…""

""…EPA ignored these principles by straining to read the word ""unacceptable"" out of Section 404(c). But the sheer ingenuity of the agency's reading underscores that it cannot be the ""best"" interpretation of Section 404(c) and therefore cannot justify EPA's decision…""

""…EPA's approach would turn the principles of reasoned decision-making inside out. It would encourage agencies not only to view the consequences of their actions through a keyhole-ignoring even sizeable costs of those actions-but also to shield that evaluation behind the Potemkin rationale of an ""alternative basis."" The upshot would be bad regulation badly explained. Nobody is well served when EPA erases a project of Pebble's magnitude and importance after (at most) feigning to check the price tag, and project developers, in particular, are likely to confront a chilled investment climate and other injuries to their reliance interests if the agency's approach is upheld…""

""...The Court should set aside EPA's veto and emphasize the importance of considering costs to determinations made under Section 404(c)…""

Fusion energy is the same sort that powers the sun. And, as the International Atomic Energy Agency has explained, nuclear fusion occurs when two light atoms combine to form a heavier atom, releasing a lot of energy.

If we could harness this reaction, we might be able to generate more of the energy we need while transitioning away from less sustainable sources. But there have been obstacles standing in the way of problem-free fusion development. For example, even the tiniest wisp of air can stop a fusion reaction, as experts noted in Power Magazine.

Now, Commonwealth Fusion Systems in Massachusetts says it is creating a container to keep a fusion reaction entirely airtight. The company has called this a ""vacuum vessel,"" describing the 48-ton steel container as ""instrumental,"" as CFS works toward ""large-scale commercial fusion energy."" As of late October, the first half of the vessel had been delivered.

""This is a really exciting time,"" said Brandon Sorbom, a CFS co-founder and its chief science officer, in a news release. ""It's a big moment for us because we have a big piece of hardware showing up, but it's also just a really big moment for the industry.""

While furthering fusion energy is an exciting prospect for many, researchers don't have all the kinks worked out just yet. There are still major obstacles to address in terms of sustaining and containing a fusion reaction that puts out more energy than it takes in — and doing so cost-effectively.

Nuclear fusion could one day create tremendous amounts of carbon-pollution-free electricity without the dangerous, long-lasting radioactive waste of today's nuclear fission reactors. But the technology to make a commercially viable fusion plant does not exist yet.

Still, if developers can effectively address these concerns, we could be looking at a more diverse and resilient energy mix down the line, with the potential to lower utility bills and mitigate the heat-trapping pollution that impacts air quality and drives rising global temperatures.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YCxgJUclKNTooauw49c78w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/109cafbf95cb2cf96d8a034fc6f38eb0,N,,2025-12-01 08:01:10.633941

Driver: Rapid digital substation deployment in accordance with IEC 61850 standards

The quick implementation of digital substations in accordance with IEC 61850 standards will lead to a major boost in the merging unit market globally. Since utilities and grid operators move digital substations, the demand for merging units, which collect and digitize analog signals of traditional instrument transformers, will drastically rise. Its growth is supported by the implementation of IEC 61850 Edition 2.1 that suggests the introduction of enhanced interoperability, real-time monitoring, and enhanced cybersecurity measures in mixed-vendor settings. Main solutions such as PCM600 and IET600 of Hitachi Energy are certified under this new edition, which simplifies the engineering and configuration of the digital substations, which enhances integration of merging units and its project implementation is quicker. Moreover, digital substations can provide high cost savings, safety improvement, and asset management. The shift to process bus architectures and virtualized protection and control systems continue to enhance the pace of merging unit implementation in upgrades and new projects in the brownfield. Other recent implementations have shown decreases in engineering labor, cabling downsizing, and increased reliability, which has enabled transition to the concept of unmanned substations and remote diagnostics. All in all, the increased pace of digitalization and greater IEC 61850 compliance is turning the merging units into the necessity of the present-day power grids.

Restraint: Limited technical expertise to support digital protection systems

One of the limitations on the integration of the unit market is the lack of qualified specialists familiar with the IEC 61850-based protection, sampling and substation automation. Most utilities, particularly in developing areas, do not have engineers who have been trained on the configuration, commissioning and maintenance of the sample-value systems. These skills cut short down the speed of digital substation projects, drives up commissioning expenses, and extends project schedules. Consequently, areas with untrained engineers might be reluctant to install digital substations in units of merging format, which restricts expansion in the market. In the case of merging units, this shortage of skilled workforce poses major obstacles. The misalignment between MU output and protection IED logic, the incorrect configuration of SV streams or poor time synchronization (PTP/IEEE 1588), as well as improper time synchronization between the volumetric signal and the protective relay itself may endanger the reliability of the system. Reports at utilities have been made at the Digital Substation forums, which have reported incidences of commissioning delays due to the lack of expertise in dealing with MU interoperability among vendors. This adds costs to the projects, protracts commissioning schedules, and reduces the level of trust in digital substitution adoption.

Opportunity: Massive retrofit potential in aging transmission & distribution infrastructure

The aging transmission and distribution (T&D) infrastructure worldwide presents a massive retrofit opportunity for the merging unit market. Many existing substations are based on legacy analog technology, which is costly to maintain, less reliable, and lacks the flexibility required for modern grid demands. Retrofitting these substations with digital elements such as merging units enables utilities to extend the life of their assets while modernizing essential functions without complete replacement. Merging units are critical in this retrofit trend by bridging the gap between conventional instrument transformers and the digital protection and control IEDs compliant with IEC 61850 standards. They convert analog signals from existing transformers into digital data streams transmitted over optical fiber or Ethernet-based process buses. This approach allows utilities to retain primary equipment while gaining the substantial benefits of digital substations, including enhanced safety, reduced wiring complexity, smaller physical footprint, and improved data accuracy for protection and monitoring. The retrofit potential is underscored by the urgency of upgrading aging grids to accommodate increasing renewable energy integration, decentralized generation, and smart grid functionalities. A fully digital or hybrid substation architecture increases system resilience, operational efficiency, and cybersecurity, and critical aspects as grids become more complex.

Challenge: Stringent cybersecurity requirements to protect merging units as critical interfaces in digital substations

Stringent cybersecurity requirements have become a major challenge for the merging unit market as digital substations increasingly rely on Ethernet based communication for protection and control. Merging units transmit high speed sampled value data and GOOSE messages, making them critical points in the substation’s communication chain. Research highlights that IEC 61850 communication, while efficient, was not originally designed with strong built in security. This creates vulnerabilities where attackers could spoof or manipulate sampled values or protection messages, potentially causing false trips, relay mis operations, or blocking protection functions. IEC 62351 provides guidelines for securing these communications through authentication and encryption, but many existing IEDs and merging units still lack full compliance, especially in real time environments where even milliseconds of delay can compromise system performance. Implementing cybersecurity in process bus networks adds further complexity for utilities and vendors. Adding cryptographic protection can introduce latency, requiring merging units to balance security with the strict timing needs of protection systems. In addition, utilities must deploy certificate management systems, secure key handling processes, and continuous monitoring to protect multivendor IEC 61850 systems. This significantly increases cost and engineering effort, particularly in regions where OT cybersecurity expertise is limited. As a result, the need to meet rigorous cybersecurity demands slows down merging unit adoption and complicates digital substation deployment.

Climate change requires coordinated international responses. Between 2021 and 2023, weather- and climate-related disasters cost an estimated $182.7 billion in the U.S. and $162 billion in the EU. Yet political divisions continue to impede transatlantic climate adaptation, particularly as U.S. federal engagement has stalled and climate change policy grows increasingly contested. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency’s core functions—regulating pollution, conducting environmental research, enforcing compliance, supporting state programs, responding to environmental hazards, and protecting public and environmental health—have been sharply curtailed under the new administration. At the 2025 United Nations General Assembly in September, President Trump called climate change policy “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.” With such open rejection of scientific evidence and the international climate consensus, federal-level transatlantic cooperation appears unlikely.

However, subnational diplomacy has proven remarkably resilient. At the same UN General Assembly, California Governor Gavin Newsom met with numerous international officials, including EU Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra, to reaffirm state-level climate commitments and explore deeper transatlantic cooperation. This outreach illustrates how subnational actors can sustain climate progress even when federal leadership falters. This article therefore proposes a new framework to harness and enhance such collaboration.

A New Framework for Collaboration

In an era of political uncertainty, subnational partnerships between U.S. states and the EU offer a promising alternative channel for climate cooperation. This article introduces the Transatlantic Subnational Resilience Framework (TSRF), a novel approach aimed at strengthening climate adaptation efforts and delivering tangible benefits even in periods of U.S. federal inaction. Subnational actors are already engaging European partners, often with meaningful, if uneven, results that demonstrate both the promise and the limits of decentralized climate diplomacy. A compelling example is the cooperation between California and the European Union during the first Trump administration. In 2018, the European Commission and California signed a Memorandum of Understanding on emissions trading and clean energy, which led to regular technical exchanges, joint workshops on carbon markets, and continued alignment on vehicle emissions standards even as U.S. federal policy moved in the opposite direction. This partnership not only preserved transatlantic policy learning during a period of federal retrenchment but also helped stabilize global confidence in subnational climate leadership. Beyond this case, numerous other initiatives illustrate the emerging architecture of subnational engagement: California’s recent partnership with Denmark on green economy resilience; coalitions such as We Are Still In and the U.S. Climate Alliance; EU-backed initiatives such as the Global Covenant of Mayors and the International Urban Cooperation (IUC), and global networks that include US and EU actors such as the Under2Coalition or the Coalition for High Ambition Multilevel Partnerships (CHAMP) for Climate Action.

Yet these efforts often remain fragmented, underfunded, and institutionally fragile. Entrenched partisan polarization makes consistent federal climate leadership increasingly unlikely. A shift toward “diagonal cooperation”—collaboration between subnational U.S. actors and European regional or supranational entities—is therefore crucial. Backed by the EU and driven by U.S. states, regions and cities, the TSRF could synchronize existing networks such as the Transatlantic Climate Alliance and elevate overlooked initiatives like wildfire prevention and flood control. Subnational diplomacy, which means linking U.S. states, cities, private actors, and EU partners, offers a viable path forward. The TSRF would institutionalize and scale these efforts through a permanent governance anchor capable of tracking commitments, coordinating partnerships, and sustaining innovation across the Atlantic. Before outlining such an institutional backbone, the article turns to sectoral examples that illustrate foundational components of the TSRF.

Sectoral Examples Illustrating TSRF’s Potential

Flood Control and Coastal Protection: Learning from the Dutch Dialogues

Flooding endangers coastal and riverine communities across the Atlantic, yet subnational partnerships have already shown how local actors can connect global expertise to local needs. The Netherlands—renowned for its ability to hold back the North Sea—has become a global leader in water management, and has exported its expertise to flood-vulnerable U.S. states.

After Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005, disproportionately affecting lower-income communities and communities of color, Dutch officials invited Louisianan leaders to tour the Netherlands’ flood management systems to prevent future devastation. This exchange laid the foundation for the Dutch Dialogues: workshops between Dutch engineers and U.S. city planners that reimagined New Orleans’ relationship with water management and strengthened the resilience of at-risk communities. These workshops generated green infrastructure ideas such as wetland restoration and expanded drainage basins, which now shape New Orleans’ current resilience strategy. Similar approaches have since been adopted in Charleston, South Carolina, and Virginia’s Hampton Roads region.

These exchanges show the value of subnational partnerships. Cities like Charleston can collaborate directly with Dutch water authorities and U.S. academics without awaiting federal action. A TSRF would provide sustained support through structured coordination, funding opportunities, and formal governance to ensure durable cooperation beyond shifting political landscapes. A standing Transatlantic Resilience Advisory Committee, composed of regional U.S. officials and EU diplomats, could meet regularly to evaluate pilot proposals, oversee city-to-city partnerships and maintain ongoing transatlantic dialogue. By embedding coordination within an institutionalized forum rather than relying on one-off exchanges, the TSRF would shift collaboration from episodic inspiration to sustained resilience-building.

To support this, the TSRF would create a central coordination mechanism—potentially hosted by EU member states or the European External Action Service. The hub would not impose top-down rules; rather, it would identify shared risks, pool knowledge, and support joint adaptation strategies. U.S. municipalities seeking Dutch-style flood management tools could access EU technical expertise, apply for co-funding from EU adaptation instruments, and obtain logistical support for workshops or site visits. By offering continuity even as U.S. federal priorities shift, the TSRF would sustain long-term, resilient partnerships.

Wildfire Resilience: Shared Strategies from California to the Mediterranean

Wildfires offer another striking example of how the TSRF could enhance cooperation. Both North America and Europe now face increasingly severe fire seasons fueled by climate change. In 2020, California wildfires emitted smoke plumes that crossed the Atlantic; in 2022, 20 EU member states recorded above-average burned areas, including significant fires in Germany, the Czech Republic, and beyond.

Despite these shared challenges, transatlantic wildfire collaboration remains fragmented. The TSRF could facilitate subnational partnerships between wildfire-prone states such as California and European counterparts like Spain, Greece, and Portugal. These partnerships could focus on early warning systems, data exchange, forest management, and firefighting techniques. For example, the EU’s Copernicus Emergency Management Service generates satellite wildfire maps on demand; under the TSRF, U.S. state wildfire agencies could access these during major fire events. Likewise, California’s ALERT California camera network—an AI-enabled early detection tool—could be shared with European civil protection agencies. Sector-specific transatlantic working groups could link California’s Cal Fire with Greece’s fire service to exchange best practices in real time. Such peer-to-peer cooperation would save lives and property, while strengthening public support for climate partnerships despite national political tensions. A governance hub within the TSRF would ensure these partnerships become institutionalized and consistent rather than dependent on individual administrations or crises.

Building Institutional Backbone: An EU-Coordinated Governance Hub

For the TSRF to endure, it must be supported by sustained coordination that can weather fluctuations in U.S. federal policy. A governance hub housed within the European External Action service could serve as this backbone, centralizing progress in two ways.

First, it could track subnational commitments through a publicly accessible registry of climate-resilience pledges by city, state, and region. Beyond simple self-reporting, this system would integrate progress indicators, timelines, and metrics drawn from existing EU adaptation frameworks, enabling more meaningful dialogue with subnational U.S. actors about implementation gaps and opportunities. This effort could incorporate existing networks such as the Climate Alliance and America Is All In, giving subnational initiatives stronger international institutional connections and implementation capacity.

Second, the hub would facilitate structured exchanges and serve as a clearinghouse for technical expertise, partnership matching, and knowledge transfer. It would link wildfire agencies, coastal resilience offices, emergency-response teams, and local disaster-management units across the Atlantic. This structure would move cooperation from informal networking to institutionalized exchange.

Scaling Peer-to-Peer Cooperation: Transatlantic Innovation Exchanges

The TSRF could formalize “climate resilience twinning” arrangements, modeled on sister cities but focused on adaptation rather than cultural exchange. Pairing EU cities or regions with U.S. counterparts that face similar climate risks, such as matching a flood-vulnerable U.S. coastal community with a European city pioneering nature-based flood defenses, would create sustained channels for peer learning and policy transfer. Fellowships, staff exchanges, and recurring Resilience Dialogues would bring stakeholders together to share data, test approaches, and co-develop solutions. These connections would help cooperation persist beyond electoral cycles and enable long-term planning despite federal uncertainty.

Financing Action: A Joint Resilience Investment Fund

To convert plans into action, the TSRF should be backed by a Joint Resilience Investment Fund designed to attract private capital. The recent Clean Investment Monitor Update estimates that U.S. clean energy and transportation investment reached $68 billion in the second quarter of 2025, holding steady relative to 2024 and accounting for 4.8% of total private investment in structures, equipment, and durable goods—indicating substantial private investment capacity.

The fund could mobilize additional private capital from both sides of the Atlantic and support climate-resilience startups and public-private pilot programs. This would provide financial continuity less vulnerable to shifts in federal funding and further embed transatlantic economic collaboration within the TSRF.

Conclusion

In today’s volatile political environment, transatlantic climate resilience requires innovative cooperation beyond traditional U.S.-EU diplomacy. As the climate crisis accelerates, cooperation must adapt and evolve accordingly. Local and regional actors have demonstrated that they can sustain collaboration in politically unstable times. The Transatlantic Subnational Resilience Framework offers a way to institutionalize this momentum by connecting cities, states, and private actors across the Atlantic through a durable framework that shares goals, builds knowledge, and mobilizes resources.

This alliance is not only feasible, it is already emerging in sectoral pockets. What is missing is the connective institutional tissue to coordinate and deepen these partnerships to align them into a more integrated transatlantic resilience agenda, which could spill over into other areas of climate change policy. The TSRF can transform fragmented initiatives into a cohesive resilience strategy, reinvigorating the U.S.-EU relationship and linking communities in a shared mission to confront a profound challenge of our time.

The sectoral index has risen by just 25% in the past year.

Owners become billionaires

In fact, since releasing its quarterly financials, Doral added almost NIS 1 billion to its market cap in two sessions, to reach NIS 5.5 billion. The big gainers are of course the founders, chairperson Doron (Dori) Davidovitz and Alon Kesel, each of whom holds 19% of the company. The recent jump in the share price added about NIS 200 million to the value of each of their holdings, bringing them close to being shekel billionaires, on paper.

What impressed investors so much in Doral’s financials? Although the company still posts losses, it presents more than 50% growth in revenue. But two pieces of positive news encouraged the market. The first is to do with taxation, the second with guidance, and both are connected to the question whether Doral has had the luck to be in the right place at the right time.

Right place: the US. The scope of Doral’s projects there is huge, and already amounts to 7.7 gigawatts. For the sake of comparison, that is just over half the power consumption of the entire State of Israel at the peak of the winter season. In addition, projects that could yield another 2.5 gigawatts are expected to start construction in the coming year and to be connected to the grid in by the end of 2027. All this is in the red-hot US market, where demand for energy, particularly solar energy, is expected to be dramatic in the coming years.

Right time: Doral is expected to complete these projects just before the expiration of the tax breaks for renewable energy developments in the US. Leader Capital Markets analyst Gilad Ben-Zvi says, ""In the previous financials they reported only 2.5 gigawatts that they were certain would qualify for the tax breaks, and following recent developments they are now able to provide another level of certainty for investors on the large scope of mature projects that they will manage to connect.

""There’s a very strong environment at present in the US energy market, because of the considerable rise in demand for power in the coming years from new server farms and the substantial consumption of electricity for artificial intelligence.""

Doral is considered to be in a good position in relation to US companies as well, since it is expected to manage to connect new projects, and apply the tax breaks to them, while its competitors are still standing in line to connect to the grid.

""They’ll need a lot of money to meet the guidance""

RELATED ARTICLES

The combination of the tax breaks, the acceleration of projects, and the company’s unique positioning, have led Doral to issue optimistic guidance. The projects in the US will yield EBITDA of over $850 million a year from 2029, which compares with $61 million in the first nine months of 2025, and just $10 million in 2024. But what are the chances of meeting this fantastic guidance?

In order to maximize profits, Doral increased its position in US subsidiary Doral Renewables LLC by buying 10% of its shares from US partner/CEO Nick Cohen for $67 million. Doral thus increased its stake in the US company to 36%, with an option to buy a further 5% later. Incidentally, former Mossad chief Yossi Cohen serves as a director on Doral’s behalf in the US company, and holds options on its shares estimated in the past to be worth tens of millions of shekels.

There are, however, several question marks over Doral’s optimistic forecast. ""There is still uncertainty about the company’s ultimate value,"" says Leaders Ben-Zvi, adding ""we are still waiting for the next offering.""

Doral, he says, is still a company short of cash, and in order to finance its wave of construction ""they will need a lot more money, which will come from raising capital or even an IPO in the US. But the current deal gives a floor to the company’s value, and that’s what provided a following wind for the stock.""

Of course it remains to be seen whether the positive investor sentiment is maintained, and whether Doral will abide by its dramatic promises in the US market.

Electric vehicles now account for nearly 90% of lithium demand, up from 64% in 2020, with global EV sales expected to exceed 20 million units in 2025. The energy sector accounted for 85% of total battery metals demand growth over this period.

Indonesia accounted for over half of nickel mining in 2023, while China is responsible for 80% of graphite mining and over 90% of refining. The average market share of the top three refining nations for key energy minerals rose from around 82% in 2020 to 86% in 2024, creating vulnerabilities that Western governments are addressing through diversification initiatives and domestic production incentives.

Indonesia's share of mined nickel production has risen from 16% in 2017 to around 50% in 2023, with Indonesia's total nickel pig iron production reaching approximately 1.85 million tonnes in 2024 and expected to reach around 2 million tonnes by 2025, accounting for 53.5% of global primary nickel production. This dominance creates both supply security concerns and pricing power dynamics.

Recent market action demonstrates ongoing volatility, with lithium carbonate futures in China experiencing dramatic swings. Exchange regulatory measures imposing stricter trading rules and supply-side signals from production restarts contributed to a 9% single-session drop to ¥91,020/tonne after peaking at ¥102,500/tonne. Despite near-term corrections, underlying demand tied to electrification remains robust as battery gigafactory construction accelerates globally.

Western governments are prioritizing supply chain diversification through comprehensive policy frameworks. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, Canada's Critical Minerals Strategy, and Australia's Modern Manufacturing Initiative provide tax credits, loan guarantees, and offtake support for domestic battery metal production, reducing project financing risk and creating government-backed demand for Tier-1 jurisdictional assets.

The Battery Metals Imperative

The global transition to electrified transportation and renewable energy storage is creating structural demand for critical minerals essential to battery production. Nickel, lithium, graphite, copper, and tin have emerged as foundational commodities enabling the shift away from fossil fuels, positioned at the intersection of climate policy, technological innovation, and supply chain security. The investment thesis for battery metals rests on fundamentals distinct from traditional commodity cycles. Policy-driven demand supported by government mandates and emissions regulations provides visibility extending through 2030, while supply responses remain constrained by permitting timelines, capital intensity, and geopolitical concentration.

Global Trends Driving Battery Metals Demand

The electrification of transportation represents the primary demand catalyst for battery metals, with penetration rates exceeding forecasts. EV sales surged past 7 million units in the first half of 2025, a 28% year-over-year increase, with the International Energy Agency projecting full-year sales could approach 20 million units. Major automotive markets have established regulatory timelines phasing out internal combustion engines by 2035, creating policy certainty driving massive capital investment across automotive supply chains.

Battery chemistry evolution reshapes demand profiles for individual metals. Nickel-rich cathode chemistries maximize energy density and vehicle range, driving nickel intensity per vehicle upward. Batteries, the heart of every electric vehicle, rely heavily on lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and graphite as key cathode and anode materials. Each EV requires approximately 50-100 kilograms of graphite depending on battery size, while copper content increases dramatically versus combustion vehicles due to electric motors, battery systems, and charging infrastructure.

Energy Storage & Grid Applications

Grid-scale energy storage is emerging as a complementary demand driver, with battery installations required to manage intermittency from renewable generation. Battery energy storage system installations are set to increase from 205 GWh in 2024 to 520-700 GWh by 2030, a 2.5-3.5x increase. Residential and commercial storage applications add another demand layer, with home battery systems gaining adoption in markets with high electricity costs or time-of-use pricing. These distributed storage applications utilize similar lithium-ion chemistries to EVs, competing for the same battery metal supply.

Supply Chain Reshoring Imperatives

Geopolitical tensions have elevated supply security to strategic priority for Western governments and automakers. In 2023, Australia, Chile and China mined about 85% of global lithium, with almost 65% refined in China and another 25% in Chile. Indonesia accounted for over half of nickel mining, while the Democratic Republic of Congo was home to almost two-thirds of the world's cobalt mining. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act's domestic content requirements for EV tax credits, Canada's Critical Minerals Strategy, and the European Union's Critical Raw Materials Act all prioritize domestic or allied-nation sourcing, creating structural demand for battery metal projects in stable jurisdictions at premium prices.

Supply Challenges: Commodity-Specific Constraints

The nickel market is experiencing supply transformation as Indonesian production dominates global output. In 2023, Indonesia accounted for 53.1% of the global nickel supply and was projected to reach 2.1 million metric tons by the end of 2024. However, this creates market vulnerabilities. The global primary nickel market is expected to remain oversupplied in 2025, with production from Indonesia forecast to expand further despite challenges like tight nickel ore availability and potential royalty rate hikes.

Battery sector dynamics add complexity, as the battery sector saw a shift in preferences from nickel-rich nickel-manganese-cobalt batteries toward nickel-free lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, driven by price competitiveness. Despite this, the battery sector is expected to increase nickel consumption to 543,000 tonnes in 2025, making up 15.2% of global consumption. Nickel sulphide deposits in stable jurisdictions command premiums as automakers seek long-term, low-carbon supply agreements outside concentrated Asian supply chains.

Lithium: Price Volatility Masking Structural Growth

Lithium markets navigate the aftermath of speculative excess. Recent price action illustrates ongoing volatility, with lithium carbonate futures experiencing dramatic swings following exchange regulatory measures and production restart announcements. A major mine with potential output of approximately 46,000 tonnes per year, roughly 3% of projected global supply, exemplifies how quickly brownfield supply can respond to price signals.

Despite near-term volatility, lithium prices dropped nearly 20% in 2024, reaching similar prices to late 2015 levels, despite lithium demand in 2024 being about six times bigger than in 2015. The IEA warns that low prices could discourage future investments and might cause supply shortages for lithium and nickel by 2030. Greenfield lithium projects face extended permitting timelines and infrastructure development requirements, meaning supply responses to sustained higher prices will lag by years.

Graphite and Other Critical Minerals

Graphite supply is even more concentrated, with China responsible for 80% of mining and over 90% of refining. Natural flake graphite must undergo purification, spheronization, and coating processes to meet battery anode specifications, requiring specialized facilities and technical expertise concentrated in China. Western graphite projects must demonstrate integrated processing capability to produce battery-qualified material, adding capital intensity and technical risk beyond conventional mining operations.

Company Case Studies

Canada Nickel's Zero-Carbon Nickel Production (TSXV:CNC)

Canada Nickel is advancing the Crawford Nickel Sulphide Project in Ontario's Timmins region, positioning the asset as potentially one of the world's first zero-carbon nickel mines. The company recently secured an oversubscribed financing to advance engineering, permitting, and development activities.

As CEO Mark Selby stated their offering options:

""The Offering is oversubscribed. The Underwriters intend to fully exercise the Over-Allotment Option… If the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, the gross proceeds of the Offering will be C$15.0 million.""

The proceeds support steps toward a construction decision targeted for 2026.

Crawford ranks as the world's second-largest nickel reserve and is expected to become the third-largest nickel sulphide operation globally based on feasibility study production rates. The deposit contains over 1.7 billion tonnes of reserves supporting a 41-year mine life, with life-of-mine cash costs of US$0.39/lb positioning Crawford in the first quartile globally. Updated FEED optimization improved after-tax NPV to US$2.8 billion with IRR exceeding 17%.

The decarbonization strategy through carbon sequestration, demonstrating 1.5 million tonnes CO₂ storage annually through IPT carbonation with potential scaling to 10-15 million tonnes via NetCarb Alliance, could position Crawford as a supplier of zero-carbon nickel to automakers with stringent emissions requirements. The broader Timmins Nickel District encompasses 42 km² with multiple discoveries including high-grade intercepts at Bannockburn showing 3.95% nickel over 4 metres, suggesting district-scale growth potential beyond Crawford alone.

Sovereign Metals (AIM:SVML) : Rutile-Graphite By-Product Economics

Sovereign Metals is developing what it describes as the world's largest known rutile resource and second-largest known flake graphite resource in southeastern Africa. As the company notes:

""Kasiya holds 17.9 Mt of contained rutile (world's largest) and 24.4 Mt of contained graphite (world's second-largest).""

The unique aspect is that graphite emerges as a natural by-product of rutile mining, creating economics distinct from standalone graphite projects.

The Optimised Pre-Feasibility Study demonstrates pre-tax NPV of US$2.32 billion with 27% IRR, supporting steady-state production of 246,000 tonnes per annum rutile and 265,000 tonnes per annum graphite. Processing advantages stem from soft saprolite ore enabling simpler methods than hard-rock graphite peers, producing higher carbon concentrate at 96-98% versus typical 94-95%, while achieving up to 57% large-jumbo flake commanding premium prices.

The by-product economics create competitive advantages, with incremental graphite production cost of US$241/tonne sitting below Chinese weighted average cost of US$257/tonne, positioning Sovereign in the lowest-cost quartile on global cost curves. A successful 6-month pilot operation mining 170,000 cubic meters validated the full production chain, informing feasibility parameters and de-risking execution. With Definitive Feasibility Study expected in Q4 2025, Sovereign is advancing toward financing and construction decisions.

Fitzroy Minerals (TSXV:FTZ): Dual-Track Copper Strategy

Fitzroy Minerals pursues a dual-track copper strategy in Chile's premier copper belt, combining fast-track oxide development for near-term cash flow with deeper sulphide exploration for long-term scale. The company recently appointed a technical advisor who emphasized the strategic value of this approach.

As President and CEO Merlin Marr-Johnson stated their management:

""I am also delighted that Fitzroy management has outlined a fast-track route to non-operated copper production at Buen Retiro, which could give the Company sufficient cash flow to self-fund exploration in future years.""

The company holds approximately C$11M in cash supporting an ~C$8M exploration budget. The oxide project spans over 1.4 km of continuous copper mineralization with predominantly leachable minerals enabling low-cost heap leach processing. Brownfields status provides permitting advantages, while nearby hydrometallurgical infrastructure offers potential toll-processing solutions reducing capital intensity. Preliminary Economic Assessment is underway.

The sulphide project targets a large-scale copper-molybdenum-gold-rhenium porphyry system with initial drilling confirming 200 metres at 0.46% copper with higher-grade sub-zones. Multiple kilometre-long geophysical and geochemical anomalies across the 18,000 hectare land package suggest substantial exploration upside. By-product metals including rhenium, a scarce element used in superalloys, could materially enhance project economics. Strategic positioning between two major producing districts in a region with established infrastructure provides development advantages.

Rome Resources (LSE:RMR): High-Grade Tin Discovery

Rome Resources advances high-grade tin-copper-zinc-silver discoveries in the Democratic Republic of Congo's eastern region, located 8 km from one of the world's highest-grade producing tin mines. The company recently announced a £200,000 placement to fund additional drilling related to ongoing tin discoveries, highlighting continued support for exploration of critical minerals in a district with demonstrated world-class grades.

The asset portfolio centers on two prospects: a tin-copper-zinc-silver system at Mont Agoma and a high-grade tin-only system at Kalayi. Over 5,000 metres across 26 holes have been drilled by mid-2025 with first resource models initiated for both targets. Mont Agoma hosts polymetallic mineralization with geochemical and drill data indicating large undrilled deeper zones representing expansion potential, while Kalayi features high-grade plunging tin shoots across a 2-km-long soil anomaly.

Tin's supply-demand fundamentals support the exploration thesis, with the metal identified as highly leveraged to electrification through solar panel manufacturing, electronics, and specialized battery applications. Global tin demand is forecast to grow up to 40% by 2030 driven by technology adoption. Rome operates three drill rigs with on-site core logging and XRF facilities, plus approximately 1,000 kg of metallurgical samples shipped for beneficiation testwork to understand multi-metal recovery potential. With continued drilling momentum and resource modeling underway, Rome represents early-stage exposure to high-grade tin discovery in a district with demonstrated production history.

The Investment Thesis for Battery Metals

Supply chain security premiums favor projects in Canada, Australia, and stable jurisdictions over lower-cost but geopolitically risky alternatives. Western automakers and governments increasingly prioritize supply reliability and ESG credentials over marginal cost advantages, supporting valuation premiums for Tier-1 assets even with higher operating costs.

Battery metal developments advancing with automaker offtake agreements, government loan guarantees, or critical minerals program participation demonstrate external validation and reduced financing risk. Projects lacking strategic alignment face higher hurdles securing project finance and may trade at discounts despite strong technical fundamentals.

Nickel, lithium, graphite, copper, and tin each face distinct supply-demand dynamics and price cycles. Portfolio allocation across multiple commodities provides downside protection when individual metals experience corrections while maintaining upside exposure to electrification's broad-based critical mineral demand.

Advanced-stage projects with completed feasibility studies and near-term construction decisions offer less execution risk but potentially lower return multiples, while earlier-stage exploration and resource definition plays provide higher risk-adjusted returns for patient capital willing to accept development timeline uncertainty and permitting risk.

As automakers face increasing pressure to reduce Scope 3 emissions across supply chains, battery metals produced with renewable energy and carbon sequestration capabilities command premiums. Projects demonstrating low-carbon production pathways gain competitive advantages in customer qualification processes beyond pure cost competitiveness.

Given China's dominance in processing and its significant role in mining certain battery metals, policy shifts around production quotas, export restrictions, or environmental enforcement can rapidly tighten supply and drive price movements. Regulatory developments in Indonesia for nickel and China's domestic lithium market interventions create asymmetric risk-reward scenarios.

The battery metals investment case rests on secular electrification trends creating durable demand growth across nickel, lithium, graphite, copper, and tin, while supply responses remain constrained by permitting timelines, capital intensity, and geopolitical concentration. This supply-demand imbalance, amplified by Western governments' strategic prioritization of supply chain security, creates a favorable multi-year environment for projects in stable jurisdictions even if near-term prices experience volatility. Policy support through tax credits, loan guarantees, and domestic content requirements materially de-risks project financing for advanced-stage assets aligned with government critical minerals strategies.

Investor approaches should emphasize jurisdictional quality and strategic positioning over pure resource metrics. Projects in Canada, Australia, and other Tier-1 jurisdictions benefit from nearshoring premiums as automakers prioritize supply security, while developments with automaker partnerships or government backing demonstrate external validation reducing execution risk. Portfolio construction across multiple battery metals provides diversification, as individual commodities experience distinct price cycles. Lithium's recent volatility contrasts with nickel's structural deficit and graphite's processing bottlenecks, suggesting uncorrelated return profiles.

The four case study companies exemplify different risk-reward profiles within battery metals: Canada Nickel offers large-scale nickel sulphide development with zero-carbon differentiation and district growth potential; Sovereign Metals provides unique rutile-graphite by-product economics with near-term DFS completion; Fitzroy Minerals balances near-term oxide cash flow against sulphide exploration upside in established copper districts; and Rome Resources represents early-stage high-grade tin discovery with resource growth potential but elevated jurisdictional and exploration risk. For investors seeking exposure to the energy transition through tangible supply-demand fundamentals and reduced geopolitical vulnerability, battery metals in quality jurisdictions present compelling opportunities as electrification transitions from policy aspiration to physical infrastructure reality.

TL;DR

Battery metals present compelling investment opportunities as electric vehicle adoption and energy storage drive structural demand growth across nickel, lithium, graphite, and copper. Supply constraints persist from geopolitical concentration with Indonesia controlling over 50% of nickel and China dominating graphite processing, while Western governments prioritize supply chain diversification through reshoring incentives. Canada Nickel advances zero-carbon nickel production with district-scale potential, Sovereign Metals offers unique rutile-graphite by-product economics, Fitzroy Minerals balances copper oxide development with sulphide exploration in Chile, and Rome Resources pursues high-grade tin discovery in the DRC. Projects in Tier-1 jurisdictions with strategic partnerships command premiums as automakers secure long-term supply, creating favorable outlook for quality battery metal assets despite price volatility.

PlanOS also enables scenario-based planning, giving utilities the ability to explore multiple potential futures and stress-test investments under different load growth, policy, and technology conditions.","For a decade and a half, the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) forecast of electricity consumption was predictable — and predictably flat. Indeed, between 2005 and 2020 load growth averaged about 0.1%, pushed slightly upward by population and economic growth while also held down by improved efficiency.

The rest of the world has also seen relatively modest growth in electricity demand. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global electricity demand grew by an average of 2.6% between 2015 and 2023.

Today, however, we have entered the era of load growth, which is witnessing a generational shift on how energy is generated, transmitted and consumed. The demand as it used to be, in terms of predictability and density, has transformed itself into patterns that are complex to predict and extremely high density, thanks to greater demand from electric transportation, manufacturing and, of course, the boom in electricity-thirsty data centers. The U.S. Department of Energy has forecasted that data centers could consume as much as 580 TWh annually in 2028, equal to about 123 GW and representing up to 12% of total US electricity consumption. Across the globe, electricity demand is forecasted to rise by 3.3% in 2025 and 3.7% in 2026 – with China and India growing significantly faster.

Reliable supplies of increasing amounts of electricity are an economic and societal imperative, which is why utilities are making historic investments in grid infrastructure and assets. According to the International Energy Agency’s 2025 World Energy Investment report, capital investment in the energy sector is set to rise by $3.3 trillion, a 2% increase from 2024. $2.2 trillion of that investment includes funds earmarked for grid optimization.

The German utility E.ON announced plans to invest 34 billion Euros on grid infrastructure between 2024 and 2028. The Indian government says the country needs to invest over $500 billion USD by 2032 to provide the power the growing country requires. The ASEAN Infrastructure Fund has committed over $500 million and disbursed more than $460 million to 15 projects across six ASEAN countries. The fund provides loans to finance infrastructure investment projects such as renewable energy plants and transmission and power grid development.

But the challenge remains: Not all investments are created equal in terms of ensuring the reliability of a grid buffeted by rapidly growing demand, extreme weather, a proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs), and aging equipment. Utilities, regulators, grid operators, and developers all need to direct their investments efficiently and effectively, simultaneously meeting demand while also improving reliability and containing costs.

The integrated system planning imperative

Put simply, utility planners are faced with a challenging task. Making their task even more daunting is the reality that the tools and processes planners have long relied on were built for a very different power system than we have now. Transmission, distribution and generation planners have traditionally worked to manage and orchestrate a centralized generation with unidirectional flows of electricity. Planning departments have traditionally been structured vertically, creating divides between functions that solve for economics, physics and system adequacy.

When load growth was modest and electricity flowed in one direction from large power plants to consumers, that approach worked well. But in today’s high load growth environment, where a larger share of renewable generation and distributed energy resources (DERs) are being integrated and extreme weather threatens system reliability, a more holistic approach to planning is critical. When different planning teams use their own complicated models with various tools and data, working together becomes difficult and time-consuming. Today’s grid planning needs to bring these different approaches together to make the process faster, more accurate, more adaptable, and more collaborative.

Integrated system planning (ISP) acknowledges the pressures of load growth and the complexity and interdependencies of the quickly evolving power system and provides a pathway for the collaboration and coordination needed in planning today. It serves as the backbone for maintaining system adequacy by implementing comprehensive planning for the future grid and delivering a path for a reliable, sustainable and affordable power system.

The value of ISP:

Comprehensive analysis for making faster planning decisions that drive investment signals, operational efficiency, and stakeholder collaboration.

Maximizing the efficiency of investments that drive prioritization while accounting for rapidly changing demand and interconnection requests.

Improving system reliability by fully anticipating how renewables and DERs affect the whole power system.

Accelerating planning cycles to better meet the needs of customers who require electricity as fast as possible.

Improving regulatory outcomes by providing transparency around the need for capital investments.

Powering ISP with PlanOS

ISP requires more than a desire for traditionally siloed planning operations to work together. It demands actual tools to enable seamless, efficient, and valuable collaboration.

GE Vernova’s PlanOS was built to provide a platform that unifies planning data and models capacity expansion, resource adequacy, production cost, and power flow analysis. Instead of running these vital planning studies separately and hoping to reconcile results later, PlanOS integrates them in real time. The result: insights from one planning domain immediately inform others, improving speed and reducing the potential for errors.

A unified data model is the foundation of the PlanOS platform, ensuring all planners work from the same assumptions. Updates flow across the system, eliminating the time-consuming and error-prone process of manually reconciling disparate spreadsheets and models.

PlanOS also enables scenario-based planning, giving utilities the ability to explore multiple potential futures and stress-test investments under different load growth, policy, and technology conditions. Collaboration features like version control and distributed access enable diverse teams to work together seamlessly without losing the specialized tools they need.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/x8jR5LJi2JNqDZNfz53ufHGUi8eo5xofSBDKt6nPOXw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMjk5OTQ3ODQzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-12-01 08:01:20.101270

Asking project developers or transmission operators to provide their own oversight is problematic: conflicting motivations and incentives, a lack of resources and unspecialized expertise.
In our ideal world for highest grid reliability, every IBR site receives third-party verification To put it bluntly, we can’t currently rely on our IBR facilities to the degree that we need.
That’s why we feel so strongly that independent verification is necessary for us all to truly be confident in the reliability, safety and performance of IBRs.
Just like a home inspection puts buyers at ease, third-party verification can do the same for grid operators, providing assurance that the resources they’re integrating will perform as predicted.","We rely on the objectivity and trustworthiness of third parties to stay informed and make better decisions throughout our lives. Before purchasing a house, home inspectors help us identify issues we may overlook. In business, external auditors assess financial statements for accuracy and compliance.

But at a time of rapidly rising demand for electricity and other threats to the reliable supply of power, inverter-based resources (IBRs) are interconnecting to the grid without any comparable level of evaluation — without confirmation that they align with their interconnection agreements and without assurance that the models used by transmission operators reflect what’s on the ground.

And when models don’t reflect what’s on the ground, and when what’s on the ground doesn’t conform to requirements, the consequences can be severe. That’s where third-party verification comes in.

But how did we get here?

Getting IBRs online requires a different approach than we’re used to

Synchronous sources of generation — the backbone of our grid for more than a century — have traditionally been built and maintained by the entities also responsible for ensuring the reliability of the bulk power system: utilities.

With IBRs, those responsibilities are more commonly dispersed, with project developers and generator owners building facilities with an emphasis on cost and speed, and transmission operators tasked with maintaining grid stability.

Not only that, but IBRs, as a technology, differ significantly from synchronous generation. They’re based on software that controls the instantaneous output of power electronics, with no spinning inertial mass to provide a guaranteed stability buffer during times of regional grid instability. Inverters can provide excellent grid stability support, too — but only when their hundreds of adjustable functions and parameters are correctly set.

This new landscape calls for new strategies for keeping the grid running as smoothly and dependably as we’ve come to expect in the U.S.

A lack of verification can have real consequences

Although grid operators may have interconnection agreements based on industry standards and guidelines, such as IEEE 2800, without verification that those standards and guidelines are actually being followed, we can’t be confident that they’re doing any good.

Through the North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s (NERC’s) disturbance reports and alerts on reliability risks, we know that IBR plants are often configured incorrectly, putting the grid at risk due to unexpected and unnecessary tripping events — like what happened in Odessa in 2021 and 2022 and in the Iberian Peninsula earlier this year.

We’ve witnessed as much in our own on-site inspections of 300+ distribution- and transmission-connected IBRs. We continue to find inverters programmed with protection-related settings that deviate from known requirements and power plant controller (PPC) settings misaligned with the facility’s voltage schedule requirements specified by the transmission operator.

In fact, nearly every site we’ve visited since our work in this space began in 2017 has had deficiencies and discrepancies that have needed addressing.

Third-party verification is the solution the industry needs right now

Having a third party commission and verify IBRs — review site documentation and installed inverter settings, conduct PPC demonstrations, update and reconcile facility models — bridges the gap between transmission and generator operators.

Ultimately, it’s quality assurance that reveals whether facilities comply with the appropriate standards and agreements and whether grid operators can trust that their sites will perform as expected.

Asking project developers or transmission operators to provide their own oversight is problematic: conflicting motivations and incentives, a lack of resources and unspecialized expertise. A neutral third party can develop the proficiency necessary to confront the unique complexity of IBRs.

In our ideal world for highest grid reliability, every IBR site receives third-party verification

To put it bluntly, we can’t currently rely on our IBR facilities to the degree that we need. That may not be apparent in monthly performance reports; it may only show up during major events. But those are what we’re trying to avoid.

Unfortunately, the compliance issues that we and others are finding are unlikely to resolve themselves, and that will only elevate risk as IBR penetration — and load growth from data centers, manufacturing and electrification — increases.

That’s why we feel so strongly that independent verification is necessary for us all to truly be confident in the reliability, safety and performance of IBRs. Even starting small, initiating a pilot program or updating documentation requirements, can make a big difference.

Just like a home inspection puts buyers at ease, third-party verification can do the same for grid operators, providing assurance that the resources they’re integrating will perform as predicted. It’s a smart investment in the future of our power system.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/IAeJb4vCx-DuczRLtIsiG-B7oKlvIQ3zLNxc8Y8a7eQ/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9BRV9IZWFkZXJfSW1hZ2UucG5n.webp,N,,2025-12-01 08:01:24.613564

In addition to the quantity of data centers, the speed at which they are being built is also causing a power problem.
""So I don't think that's going to be good for any of our energy bills.""","Data centers are fueling a race to develop artificial intelligence tools that have the potential to revolutionize almost every sector of society, and Big Tech is receiving bipartisan support at nearly every level of government to aid in this global competition for AI dominance.

But these building projects that have become a unifying force for politicians are also galvanizing communities that object to seeing one of these behemoth campuses of computer servers pop up in their backyards.

RELATED: Pa. and N.J. want data centers to guarantee their own power supply

Last month in Plymouth Township, the zoning board held a public hearing to discuss a proposal to build a 2 million square-foot data center at 900 Conshohocken Road, transforming 10 buildings at the former Cleveland-Cliffs steel mill that sits on 66 acres of land along the Schuylkill River into a high-tech network.

When Montgomery County residents learned about the plan to build this facility near their homes, they began fighting back – citing concerns over the project's potential impacts on the environment and their energy bills.

""This is like a David versus Goliath fight, and we're trying to get everyone mobilized and understand this,"" Patti Smith, who organized a petition that received over 1,000 signatures, said before the hearing.

Then on Nov. 18, residents packed the room to voice their opinions at the zoning hearing, only to find out that the developer had to withdraw the application over a legal issue because the agreement of sale of the property was not finalized. While this appears to be a victory for the community activists, they anticipate the developer will refile the application and are concerned this move only allows more time for an ordinance to be drafted that would give the company a stronger legal standing when the proposal is revisited.

In neighboring Chester County, another data center that's being proposed at the former Pennhurst State School and Hospital site is also receiving strong opposition from the community, with a petition that's racked up over 12,000 signatures. That proposal could also stall as opposition is pushing for an ordinance to tighten regulations.

While these neighbors are standing up against Big Tech, they are also realizing they're confronting resource-rich developers and a government that in many ways is working to ease restrictions as the country tries to meet the insatiable energy demands created by the growing use of AI platforms like ChatGPT.

In June, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) announced that Amazon will spend at least $20 billion to develop cloud computing and AI innovation campuses in the state. The investment, which the company says will create at least 1,250 tech jobs, will start by building facilities in Falls Township in Bucks County and Salem Township in Luzerne County before exploring other communities for future sites.

Shortly after that investment was touted by state officials, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to accelerate federal permitting of data center development.

Then last month, governors from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia (three Democrats and one Republican) submitted a joint proposal that would fast-track approvals for data center projects in which developers agree to build energy lines or substations and generate at least enough electricity to offset how much power the facility is expected use.

""Everybody wants to be the biggest and best adopter of AI technology and make the most money for their state, but it's very short-sighted,"" said Genevieve Boland, one of the organizers of the Cleveland-Cliffs petition. ""So the direction is coming from the federal government to essentially expedite data center approvals everywhere across the country and that has been trickled down to the state. Shapiro made a deal with Amazon and that was a huge deal. And then his mandate has trickled down to regional and local zoning boards to do whatever to approve these data centers.""

Impact on electric bills

While the AI boom is putting pressure on existing electricity grids and causing a nearly unquenchable thirst for more energy resources, it remains to be seen how these demands will affect the bills of residential customers.

The U.S. Department of Energy reported last year that data centers consumed about 4.4% of the total U.S. electricity in 2023, and it predicts that will rise to 12% by 2028.

And the increase in the number of these facilities has coincided with a rise in costs. In Pennsylvania, the average electric bill has gone from $134.85 in 2022 to $160.57 this year, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

But data centers might not be completely to blame for the higher bills, said Geoffrey Blanford, a principal technical executive at the Electric Power Research Institute, an independent nonprofit that does research for the nation's electric power industry.

""Most of the increase has been related to economy-wide inflation trends,"" he said. ""Where it's been faster than inflation has been in places like California, which had a really steep increase that's mostly related to wildfire impacts. ... Other places like New England, you've also seen higher prices. But again, that's more around (transmission and distribution) costs, grid modernization and resilience more so than data centers. So there are a lot of factors. Data centers are potentially one of them but really has not been the main one for what we've seen recently.""

Researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that the average retail price of electricity in Pennsylvania over the past six years has risen 7.4% faster than inflation, the New York Times reported. In New Jersey, it's up 6.1%. But it's actually down in other parts of the country — including much of the Southeast, Midwest and Mountain regions.

In addition to the quantity of data centers, the speed at which they are being built is also causing a power problem. Despite their size, these massive campuses can be built within a year or two in many cases. And the projects often require investments to improve the local grid, like adding new sources to generate energy or enhancing existing systems.

""They can be built pretty quickly, which means it puts a lot of pressure on the timeline for adding grid resources, which tend to be a little bit slower than how fast you can add a data center,"" Blanford said. ""So it's been a major issue for power system planning.""

Tech companies have now become both energy consumers and producers, and whether individuals and small businesses see a jump in their bills might be dependent on state regulators and lawmakers making sure those firms cover the expenses.

""In theory, there are potential benefits to the electric system from having a large load there,"" Blanford said. ""... It can help with reliability, and it's not necessarily something to take for granted that it's going to increase electricity prices. In fact, it could decrease electricity prices by having more energy to spread the fixed costs over.""

Another factor that could impact utility bills is the Trump administration's stand against renewable energy projects, said Sorelle Friedler, a professor of computer science at Haverford College who served as the assistant director for data and democracy under the Biden administration. The Interior Department's policies are causing permitting delays and the agency has been reviewing previously approved wind and solar farms.

""So we're actually, as a society right now, reducing the amount of energy that we could be generating while increasing the usage of it,"" Friedler said. ""So I don't think that's going to be good for any of our energy bills.""

To try to protect consumers, some politicians are stepping in. In New Jersey, Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill campaigned on halting rising utility costs, promising to freeze rates and declare a ""state of emergency on utility costs"" on her first day in office.

""My priority is relief to New Jersey consumers, and I will bring everyone to the table to deliver it,"" she said in a statement.

Environmental impact

The AI boom is only a few years old so grasping the environmental impact can be challenging, but a study by Cornell University researchers published last month in the journal Nature Sustainability set out to quantify the industry's ecological footprint – and their estimations are staggering.

Depending on the speed of AI growth, researchers said U.S. data centers could eventually consume as much as 10 million Americans and emit as much carbon dioxide as 10 million cars per year, which would be equivalent of the annual resource consumption of the entire state of New York.

The Cleveland-Cliffs project in Plymouth Township calls for electricity generated by use natural gas turbines, which is cleaner than burning coal but still emits pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxides, formaldehyde and benzene. The Environmental Protection Agency warns that exposure to these types of emissions can have serious health effects, even though power plants have made great strides in reducing them over the past couple decades.

""As soon as we heard natural gas turbines ... we became incredibly alarmed,"" said Smith, the organizer of the petition against the project. ""... My preferred exposure to formaldehyde is honestly zero per year.""

The cooling system needed to prevent servers from overheating also has an environmental impact. Google said in 2021 that its average data center consumed around 450,000 gallons of water per day, which it said was the ""same amount of water used to irrigate 17 acres of turf lawn grass once.""

In their study, the Cornell scientists recommend holding tech companies to similar standards put on vehicle manufacturers to mandate fuel efficiency – with tighter regulations, more transparency and benchmarks for energy usage.",https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/USATSI_27527015.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 09:01:22.284153

ENCK: Climate change has been front and center for a long time, and it is an overwhelming problem.","Judith Enck has spent her entire career working to protect public health and the environment.

Enck took the helm of New York’s oldest environmental organization, Environmental Advocates NY, soon after graduating college, then went on to hold senior leadership roles in state and federal government, including as deputy secretary for the environment in the New York Governor’s Office and a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator during Barack Obama’s two terms. Now, as a professor at Bennington College and president of the Vermont-based nonprofit Beyond Plastics, Enck is on a mission to “end plastic pollution everywhere.”

Toward that end, Enck, who describes herself as a “solid waste gal,” wrote a new book with journalist Adam Mahoney called “The Problem With Plastic.”

The main problem with plastic, the authors say, is that it’s ubiquitous, polluting the planet, driving climate change and making us sick.

Plastic production has increased exponentially, from about 2 million tons a year in 1950 to 450 million tons a year today, with no limit in sight. And because plastics are made from fossil fuels and thousands of toxic chemicals derived from oil and gas, they cause harm throughout their life cycle, from extraction of the fossil fuels they’re made of to their production, use and disposal. Low-income communities and people of color who live near plastic plants bear the brunt of the industry’s toxic emissions, Enck and Mahoney say. Yet we all inhale and consume hundreds of thousands of microplastics per year.

Plastics have become so pervasive that scientists have found them blowing in the wind, near the peak of Mt. Everest, in the snow of Antarctica, in the ocean’s deepest trenches, in placentas, breast milk, stool, blood, lungs and even in our brains.

Plastic was never designed to be recycled, Enck explains in the book. The only aspect of plastics actually being recycled is the myth that recycling will stop plastic pollution. Inside Climate News recently spoke with Enck about the extent of the plastic crisis, its role in the climate crisis and what it will take to move beyond plastic. This conversation has been edited for clarity and length.

LIZA GROSS: Was there a specific moment or event that made you decide that plastic pollution was the issue you wanted to devote your time and energy to?

JUDITH ENCK: Well, there are two moments. One is the moment I was born. My parents, the late Helen and Sonny Enck, named me after St. Jude, the patron saint of lost causes. But I don’t believe plastics is a lost cause. I just think it’s an uphill battle.

But seriously, I do remember a moment, though it’s not like I wasn’t following the issue.

I was sitting at my desk at EPA Region 2 in lower Manhattan, and I read an article about the massive amount of plastic loading into the ocean, and it stopped me in my tracks. I know how important the ocean is, a major source of protein for most of the world. And I read that about 80 percent of plastic in the ocean comes from the land. It’s roadside litter that goes down a storm drain, into a stream, into a river, into the ocean. Or it’s derelict fishing gear. And it is really damaging the ocean.

And I decided at that moment, when I left the EPA, I was going to work on plastics. I didn’t know how, I didn’t know where, but that’s what led to the launching of Beyond Plastics, and then eventually the writing of this book.

GROSS: People often talk about plastics breaking down, but I’ve heard you say that’s not the right way to think about it. Could you expand on that?

ENCK: Plastics are made from fossil fuels and chemicals, and they are not degradable. So they don’t break down, they become smaller pieces of plastic. And in many ways, those smaller pieces are a much greater risk. So five millimeters or less is a microplastic, the size of a grain of salt. And then even smaller than that is a nanoplastic, and that’s what we’re breathing in and swallowing and, and that’s what’s building up from the Himalayan Mountains to the bottom of the Mariana Trench and everything in between.

GROSS: One thing that people might be surprised to learn is that plastic recycling was actually a PR strategy. In the book, you say that’s been part of a strategy to shift responsibility from the producer onto the individual consumer, to obscure the fact that companies are producing huge volumes of materials that can’t be recycled. How did that strategy become so effective?

ENCK: Because we were all subjected to a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign by plastic companies deceiving us into thinking we can recycle most of our plastic, which just isn’t true. You can recycle an old aluminum can into a new can, newspaper into cardboard or other paper products. But with plastics, we’ve got 16,000 different chemicals, many different colors, many different plastic types, or polymers. Think of your own home. You may have a bright orange plastic soap detergent near your washing machine and a black plastic takeout container in your refrigerator and a plastic bag on your counter. None of them can be recycled together. You have to separate everything by color, by chemical and by polymer. The people who know this the best there are plastic manufacturers, and yet they chose to spend millions of dollars telling us, don’t worry about all of your single-use plastic packaging, for instance, just put it in your recycling bin. But it really messes up recycling programs.

So I want to be clear: People should keep recycling paper, cardboard, metal and glass, and compost your yard waste and your food waste. But plastic recycling has been an abysmal failure.

GROSS: I was surprised to learn that the industry intentionally created confusion around recycling symbols, conflating the chasing arrows symbol that indicates products were made out of recycled materials with the numbers used to indicate things that can be recycled. It’s amazing how those very simple symbols could be such a powerful tool of misinformation.

ENCK: Yes. On one hand, it’s great that people look for the symbol because they want to do their part. But it is a huge problem when it’s used deceptively. The [Federal Trade Commission] has a voluntary guide that tells you when you can and cannot say that something is recyclable and when you should and shouldn’t use the symbol. But it’s voluntary, so most of the companies ignore that.

And you know, when pressed, I do say keep recycling number one and number two plastic. You have a little bit of a fighting chance that they will get recycled. Most of the other plastic either gets littered in the environment or goes to landfills or to incinerators. And what’s really troubling is, unless plastic is burned at a garbage incinerator, which is fraught with air pollution and other pollution problems, every single piece of plastic ever created is still on the earth today.

GROSS: Even if we were able to recycle things, with all the chemicals that are in these plastics, wouldn’t recycling just be concentrating the chemicals? Do we need to worry about that with the items that actually can be recycled, the ones and twos, as well?

ENCK: A lot of these 16,000 chemicals are very toxic. We’re talking about PFAS chemicals, lead, mercury, cadmium, vinyl chloride, things that should not be touching our food. Beyond Plastics does not believe that recycled plastic should be used in any food packaging. We don’t want food or beverage packaging made from recycled plastic.

We’ve looked a little bit at the Food and Drug Administration process for companies to get approval to use recycled plastic in their consumer products. And the nicest thing I can say about it is it’s a very flimsy process itself. It’s self-reporting, and the FDA seems to have a giant rubber stamp out. They’re not looking out for our health and our well-being when they allow recycled-content plastic for food packaging.

GROSS: Speaking of all these toxic chemicals in plastics, scientists have been linking plastics increasingly to all sorts of non-communicable diseases. What are they learning about potential mechanisms of harm in what seems to be a relatively new yet ballooning research field?

ENCK: It is new, which is why the cuts in federal funding for public health research is so concerning. The first really comprehensive study I looked at was the presence of microplastics in the human placenta, which was done by Dr. Ragusa in Rome with some other Italian scientists. The baby is only in utero for seven, eight, nine months and is already being born pre-polluted, and there’s also microplastics in breast milk.

Microplastics have been found in virtually every part of the human body that scientists have looked at. We either inhale them or we swallow them, and microplastics have been found in our blood, our kidneys, our lungs, male testicles.

I think two of the most significant studies are one that was published by New England Journal of Medicine, looking at microplastics in the heart arteries, and they looked at plaque, and found if you had microplastics on the plaque, which many of the patients did, you had an increased risk of heart attack, stroke and premature death. And then another recent study looking at microplastics in the brain unfortunately documented that the microplastics, nanoplastics, cross the blood-brain barrier and increase risk of Alzheimer’s and other neurological diseases.

And recently there have been a couple articles about people asking, can you get it out of your body? It’s not like lead and chelation. You know, there’s no easy way to get this out of your body. So let’s redouble our efforts to prevent it from going into our bodies.

GROSS: What is the best way for people to keep this stuff out of our bodies?

ENCK: You can’t shop your way out of this problem. There are some steps you can take. The book has a section for people to do a home audit. Look at your kitchen. Get rid of that plastic cutting board. Do not put plastic in the microwave. Only buy cotton bed sheets because you’re spending, on a good day, seven hours in bed, so make sure your sheets and blankets are not made of plastic.

I know a lot of people who tell me the great lengths they go to avoid plastic, and if I’m close friends with them, I say, “That’s really good—could you spend half of that time calling your legislator and writing a letter to the editor?” We have to get systemic change. We have to mainstream alternatives to plastics.

Now here’s the good news: A lot of the alternatives are already here. Give me old-fashioned paper, cardboard, metal, glass, because it can be made from recycled material, and actually does get recycled. But I want to emphasize, by far the most important thing is reduction, reuse and refill. Building that refill-reuse infrastructure is crucial.

GROSS: There’s a lot of talk about stopping plastic pollution at its source. So just cap the production. More than 100 countries during the recent U.N. plastics treaty talks pushed for that to no avail. What do you think some of the most promising strategies are to really get a handle on this crisis?

ENCK: I think the action is at the state and local level. There are a lot of people—and we wrote the book for these very people who want to do something about the plastic crisis—and they can show up at their city council and say, “Let’s ban plastic bags.” They can show up at their county legislature and say, “Let’s provide funding to Meals on Wheels and restaurants to install dishwashing equipment so we’re not all eating our delicious food off of, you know, polystyrene plastic plates and forks.”

The way we’re going to win is with probably 1,000 different strategies, with tens of thousands of different people in the lead. This issue really calls out for local action.

And then you climb the ladder. In New York, for instance, New York City banned plastic bags, and then the state did. That one little thing of banning all plastic bags at retail stores has been immense, and it’s just one of many things that can happen.

“The way we’re going to win is with probably 1,000 different strategies, with tens of thousands of different people in the lead. This issue really calls out for local action.”

GROSS: There was a pretty striking stat in the book about plastic production emitting four times more greenhouse gases than the global aviation industry, which we think of as a massive contributor to the climate crisis. Why do you think the connection between climate and plastic is still unappreciated?

ENCK: Climate change has been front and center for a long time, and it is an overwhelming problem. Then you layer on plastics as a climate issue—it’s just a lot. But it’s actually not hard to document. Back in 2001 I wanted to figure out, because no one else had done it, what are the greenhouse gas emissions over the plastic life cycle?

We commissioned a report to look at greenhouse gas emissions from production, use and disposal, and what we found was pretty disturbing. We found that 232 million tons of greenhouse gases were emitted every year. That’s the equivalent of 116 coal-fired power plants. So we did this report, The New Coal: Plastics and Climate Change.

Beyond Plastics and the Center for International Environmental Law both identified plastics as a major climate issue. I just think the climate crisis is overwhelming, and people think about power production and transportation.

Now here’s the great irony: fossil fuel companies know they’re losing market share for transportation and power production. So their plan B is plastic production. The largest plastic producer in the U.S. today is ExxonMobil.

GROSS: You dedicated the book to the low-income communities of color living in the shadow of plastics facilities in the Gulf Coast and beyond. Are there any stories you heard from people living near these plants that really stuck with you?

ECNK: I was in Port Arthur, Texas, a couple years ago, and looking at this enormous petrochemical buildout, with local residents dependent upon the jobs, dependent upon this industry to keep Port Arthur alive, and yet Port Arthur is not doing well. I toured the Houston Ship Channel with a representative from Houston Air Alliance, and saw how close people’s homes are to these facilities. Same thing in Cancer Alley in Louisiana.

Our government has allowed the creation of sacrifice zones, and that is unethical. If people had resources, a lot of them would move. But they don’t have financial resources, nor should they move. These are their ancestral homes.

You hear Jo and Joy Banner with the Descendants Project talking about how we went from plantations to chemical plants. The through line is racism. So it means a lot to have, for instance, Dr. Robert Bullard endorse the book and the others, mostly women, happy to be profiled. They’re just doing extraordinary work, facing enormous odds, but they’re also winning.

Gross: Is there a final hopeful message you’d like to share?

ENCK: We wanted the book to be hopeful, which is hard to do on this issue. But we are hopeful, because while I don’t live in Cancer Alley or the Houston Ship Channel, I can work on policies to reduce the demand for plastics. That’s why we wrote the book. You can’t just leave it to people living in Cancer Alley to solve the problem.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2226334572-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 09:01:07.471384

The pandemic and geopolitical chaos have exposed the fragility of global supply chains, and the old model of chasing the lowest labor rates overseas is no longer viable. When the true costs emerge, delays, lost sales, and bloated inventory, the math favors inventory that is closer to the customer. When a container is delayed or a supplier in Asia is disrupted, empty shelves, stock-outs, and lost sales flood the P&L. Availability and next-day (or near-next-day) fulfilment matter far more to consumers than the country of origin. That shifts the advantage toward production and logistics closer to demand.

The Proof It’s Happening (and Not Just Rhetoric)

US Export-Import Bank Commits $100 Billion to Secure Supply Chains

This resurgence isn’t a talking point — it’s measurable.

Manufacturing and construction are at historic levels. As companies regionalize production, such as chips, batteries, and clean-energy components, spending on U.S. factory construction has surged to unprecedented highs, reaching a $223 billion seasonally adjusted annual rate in July 2025 (up from low double-digit billions less than a decade ago).

Reshoring is driving real employment growth. The nonprofit Reshoring Initiative reports that 244,000 jobs were announced in 2024, tied to reshoring and foreign direct investment, with a cumulative total of ~1.7 million jobs since 2010. Announcements aren’t the same as payrolls, but they do signal capital commitments, vendor build-outs, and logistics reconfiguration.

Companies are publicly committing to significant U.S. investments. For example, Texas Instruments announced plans to invest over $60 billion in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing (in Texas and Utah), creating some 60,000 jobs. Nvidia, TSMC, IBM, and Apple have all followed suit, publicly announcing investments in U.S. manufacturing capacity this year.

Collectively, these indicators point to a re-anchoring of critical production closer to end demand.

The Technology Stack Making “Made in America” Competitive

Ultimately, it’s not enough to bring the factory home. The new path to competitiveness is via digital + proximity. Ten years ago, domestic production was seen as a cost burden. Today, tech is turning it into a competitive advantage:

AI and advanced dispatch replace manual routing, compressing decision cycles from hours to seconds.

Digital twins enable companies to simulate thousands of “what-if” supply-chain scenarios (supplier shifts, demand swings, regional disruptions) before committing capex.

Automation and robotics reduce repetitive labor and human error across inbound, warehouse, and packaging operations.

End-to-end visibility at the SKU or carton level enables leaner inventories without sacrificing control.

Executives are leaning in: Deloitte’s 2025 smart-manufacturing research reveals that manufacturers are intensifying their digital initiatives to navigate complex transformations, mitigate operational risks, and mitigate labor scarcity. Broader Deloitte work finds the vast majority of manufacturers are already implementing advanced digital capabilities beyond pilots.

From Strategy to Execution: A New Playbook for the American Supply Chain

The new manufacturing boom isn’t just about bringing production back; it’s about moving smarter once it’s here. Modern supply chains are increasingly defined by:

Flexible fleets that shift seamlessly between middle-mile, LTL, and final-mile modes.

Dynamic cross-docks and forward deployments that position inventory closer to regional demand.

Software-orchestrated visibility that enables instant reconfiguration when disruptions occur.

Success metrics that matter to customers: on-time delivery, inventory turns, sell-through, cost-to-serve (which now includes dwell, touches and damage).

Here’s what that looks like in practice:

Start at the Customer Edge.Don’t “boil the network.” Begin with the customer promise and work backward. Identify where long lead times or stockouts are breaking the experience, and pilot near-market solutions that close the gap. Modular, tech-enabled cross-docks and forward-deployed inventory enable the repositioning of freight closer to demand, allowing for faster fulfillment without the need for permanent infrastructure.

Use Automation to Offset Labor Costs.The real savings aren’t in cutting labor, they’re in cutting waste. AI-driven routing, dynamic load planning, and real-time dispatch reduce empty miles and idle time across middle-mile and LTL operations. When every mile, pallet, and dock slot is optimized automatically, higher employee wages become a non-issue.

Design for Optionality, Not Rigidity.Volatility is permanent, so optionality must be too. Build networks that can flex between modes – dedicated, pool, LTL, or parcel injections – based on cost, demand, or disruption. Tech-orchestrated nodes and dynamic cross-docks enable you to shorten lanes, diversify port of entry points, and rebalance flows in hours, not weeks.

Choose Partners for Adaptability.Yesterday’s networks were built on legacy partnerships; tomorrow’s are built on APIs. Work with providers who can deliver bespoke solutions in weeks, integrate live data into your TMS, and adjust service levels dynamically. Transparency, automation, and speed of integration are now the true hallmarks of reliability.

Future-Proof Against Policy and Tariff Shocks.Geopolitics won’t stabilize anytime soon. Prepare for tariff or sourcing volatility with digital twins and scenario modeling that simulate the impact of cost, transit time, and service across different configurations. When border rules or input prices change overnight, your network shouldn’t stall; it should re-route itself.

The “American Supply Chain Renaissance” isn’t about waving flags. It’s a pragmatic response to customers who value “in-stock tomorrow” over theoretical landed-cost savings next quarter. Capex is flowing into U.S. factories at record levels; policy is accelerating strategic sectors; digital operations are collapsing time and risk. Companies that align proximity with intelligence and measure success the way customers actually feel it will set the pace in the decade ahead.

Industry Context & Drivers

What factors are driving the resurgence of “Made in America” in supply chains today? It’s simple: speed wins. Consumers don’t care where something is made—they care if it’s in their hands tomorrow. COVID and geopolitical chaos ripped the cover off fragile global supply chains, and the old model of chasing the lowest labor rate overseas doesn’t cut it anymore. When the true costs show up—delays, lost sales, bloated inventory—the math favors being close to the customer. That’s the shift.

How have global disruptions reshaped the cost-benefit analysis of nearshoring or reshoring? For decades, companies optimized for the lowest unit cost. That equation was broken the moment a container stuck offshore meant empty shelves and millions in lost sales. The smarter equation now is reliability times speed, divided by risk. Nearshoring and reshoring aren’t patriotic gestures—they’re risk-adjusted, customer-centric business decisions.

In what ways has technology made domestic manufacturing and logistics more viable compared to five or ten years ago? We’re not relying on nostalgia. We’re relying on new math powered by technology. AI dispatches trucks instantly, robotics strip out warehouse labor, digital visibility lets you run leaner without losing control. Ten years ago, U.S. production looked like a cost drag. Today, tech is what makes it a competitive weapon.

Technology’s Role

Which supply chain technologies are enabling companies to make U.S.-based production competitive? The breakthroughs are in AI, robotics, digital twins, and visibility. AI kills wasted human planning hours. Robotics remove repetitive labor. Digital twins let you test a thousand network scenarios before you spend a dollar. And SKU-level visibility puts you in control of inventory in ways legacy systems never could. This isn’t about keeping up—it’s about leapfrogging.

How are freight networks and logistics infrastructure evolving to support more regionalized supply chains? We’re breaking away from the monolithic mega-DC playbook. The future is modular and on-demand. Flexible fleets, dynamic cross-docks, forward deployments—it’s about configuring networks in real time around customer demand. That’s why we built Warp. Legacy LTL and pool providers are frozen in 1995. Shippers don’t need nostalgia, they need adaptability.

Do you see “Made in America” relying more on digital coordination than physical expansion? Absolutely. You don’t win by pouring concrete; you win by coordinating smarter. We don’t need ten times the warehouses—we need networks that operate like living systems, with software that flexes every asset at peak performance. The future of Made in America is built on digital intelligence, not brute force.

Investor & Policy Perspective

How are government incentives shaping decisions around domestic production and logistics? The CHIPS Act and IRA didn’t just hand out subsidies—they reprogrammed boardroom strategy. If the factory’s in the U.S., the logistics backbone has to be here too. Incentives are accelerants, but the underlying fire is customer demand for faster, more reliable supply chains.

What are investors looking for in logistics and supply chain tech companies tied to the Made in America trend? Investors are done with vanity metrics and “Uber for freight” slides. They’re asking: does your technology actually bend the cost curve and improve service? At Warp, the answer is yes—because we eliminate manual waste in freight networks. That means lower costs, faster delivery, and happier customers. That’s what investors want: defensible tech tied to customer outcomes.

Are U.S.-based logistics startups seeing a funding boost tied to this shift? Yes, but the bar is higher. Spray-and-pray money is dead. What’s left is disciplined capital chasing companies that align with policy, with economics, and with customer reality. If you can prove you’re making Made in America competitive by giving customers faster, cheaper, more reliable freight, there’s money for you.

Actionable Insights for Shippers

What are the first steps shippers should take if they want to rebalance supply chains toward U.S. sourcing or production? Start with the customer experience. Where are you failing them today—stockouts, long lead times, unreliable deliveries? Map those pain points, then rebuild lanes and sourcing strategies around fixing them first. Don’t boil the ocean. Prove it one customer problem at a time.

How can shippers use technology to identify cost savings that offset higher domestic labor costs? Focus on eliminating waste, not labor. Visibility down to the carton, automated routing, smarter packaging, dynamic cross-docks. When you cut out empty miles, extra touches, and bloated safety stock, you offset labor costs overnight. Tech isn’t just a cost saver—it’s a customer experience enhancer.

Which metrics or KPIs should shippers track to evaluate the success of reshoring or nearshoring moves? Measure what your customer feels. On-time pickup and delivery, inventory turns, sell-through rate, cost to serve, damage claims. If your shelves are full, your deliveries are predictable, and your product is moving faster, you’re winning. Anything else is noise.

What kinds of partnerships should shippers prioritize in a Made in America strategy? Only partner with tech-enabled providers who can build around your needs. You don’t need “relationships” and handshakes—you need innovators who can stand up bespoke solutions fast. That’s the difference between another vendor and a true competitive edge.

For companies hesitant about reshoring, what low-risk pilots or partial moves could they test? Pilot with the customer in mind. High-margin SKUs, seasonal launches, or key markets where delivery speed drives loyalty. Or consolidate inbound vendor freight domestically. Start small, but make sure the experiment ties directly to customer outcomes—faster shelves stocked, fewer delays, higher sales.",https://www.globaltrademag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_2635552345-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 05:58:09.741367

In some of Georgia’s reddest and most rural counties, Republicans crossed party lines this month and helped propel two Democrats, Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson, to landslide upsets, ousting the incumbent candidates on the Georgia Public Service Commission. No Democrat has served on the five-person commission, which regulates utilities and helps set climate and energy policy, since 2007.

Across the country, Democrats have seized on rising anxiety over electricity costs and data centers in what could be a template for the 2026 midterm elections.

In Virginia, Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger pledged during her campaign to lower energy bills and make data centers pay more. In the House of Delegates, one Democratic challenger unseated a Republican incumbent by focusing on curbing the proliferation of data centers in Loudoun County and the exurbs of the nation’s capital.

In New Jersey, Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill promised to declare a state of emergency on utility costs and freeze rates. And in Memphis, State Representative Justin J. Pearson, who is challenging Representative Steve Cohen in a high-profile Democratic primary next year, has vowed to fight a supercomputer by Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, that would be located in a predominantly Black neighborhood.

Strong opposition by citizens forced the Tucson City Council in August to pull the plug on an Amazon data center slated for that Arizona city, and then in September forced Google to call off one in Indianapolis.

“Electricity is the new price of eggs,” said Charles Hua, executive director of Powerlines, a nonpartisan organization which aims to modernize utility regulations and reduce power bills. “This is a defining moment for politicians of all stripes — what’s your answer to lowering utility bills? Because I think consumers and voters are looking for leadership on this.”

After meeting recently with Virginia legislators, Mr. Hua said he was struck by how “the nexus of data centers and utility bills actually came up very consistently.”

In 2022, a spike in natural gas prices following the Russian invasion of Ukraine fueled a rise in energy costs around the U.S. Utilities have also undertaken costly projects to modernize the power grid and improve the infrastructure to guard against extreme weather and absorb an anticipated surge in demand from data centers.

As the price of electricity has risen, more American customers have fallen behind on their utility bills, or have had their power cut off.

Georgia ranks 35th in energy affordability, in part because of cost overruns and delays associated with its new Plant Vogtle nuclear generators in Waynesboro, according to the American Legislative Exchange Council, an influential conservative policy group.

So it wasn’t a surprise when Attorney General Chris Carr and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger — candidates in the Republican primary to succeed term-limited Gov. Brian Kemp — called November’s results a referendum on affordability. “You’re a fool if you don’t recognize that,” Mr. Carr said.

Some Georgia Republicans have cautioned against reading too much into the 25-percentage-point losses suffered by the utility board incumbents, Tim Echols and Fitz Johnson.

This year’s elections stemmed from a 2020 federal lawsuit, which contended that the statewide elections for commission seats, which represent geographic districts, were unfair to Black voters. An appeals court eventually ruled against the plaintiffs, but the legal battle delayed the elections — setting the stage for November’s two races, the only statewide ones this year. (Two more utility seats will be contested in 2026.)

Democratic turnout was also boosted, Republicans said, by municipal elections in strongholds like Atlanta.

“I think it’s a complete anomaly,” State Senator Greg Dolezal said at a Republican event in Valdosta to tout his candidacy for lieutenant governor next year. Noting the comfortable margins racked up by President Trump in 2024 and Mr. Kemp in 2022, he added, “There’s no planet on which a 65-35 split is representative.”

One plaintiff in the lawsuit was Brionté McCorkle, executive director of Georgia Conservation Voters. She said the lawsuit enabled advocacy groups to develop a plan to help people “connect the dots” between the bills they were receiving and the commission’s role in approving six rate increases for Georgia Power, the state’s largest electric provider, over the last two years.

The group’s political action fund spent $2.3 million, sending half a million texts, plastering 92 billboards across the state and producing an anti-incumbent website.

That outreach made a difference, she said, pointing to Lowndes and Brooks counties on the Florida border. In previous races for federal and state offices going back to 2018, including the public service commission, Republicans won there by 20 points.

This year, Mr. Echols and Mr. Johnson each lost by 20 points.

At a weekly food pantry run by South Street Care House in Valdosta, Ga., where dozens of cars had lined up to receive a box full of fresh fruits, vegetables, breads and other staples, several people said they had heard about the election through texts and social media.

Barbara Lehman, 66, is typically a reliable Republican, but not this time, according to her daughter Angela and granddaughter Shelby, who were among those waiting for food.

“If the power companies want to expand their business, then that should be on them, not the consumer,” Ms. Lehman said in a text message. “Some people are just barely making it as it is.”

At the event attended by Mr. Dolezal and two other candidates for statewide offices, Gary McMillan, a former chair of the Lowndes County Republican Party, said that he, too, knew Republicans who bucked the party.

“They said my electric bills keep going up, and Republicans control the public service commission, and I’ve got a problem with that,” Mr. McMillan recounted. “I told all of them, elect a Democrat, and your bills will go up some more.”

Data centers have been a prominent issue in Atlanta’s rural exurbs. Mr. Trump wants to accelerate their growth in the battle for A.I. supremacy. At least 26 are under construction within 60 miles of Atlanta, and another 52 are planned.

But some Georgia Republicans — including Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is resigning her seat in January — have questioned the facilities’ use of resources. Some residents say local wells have been damaged, and the cost of municipal water has climbed.

Good Jobs First, a liberal group that tracks tax breaks for corporations, has said the state has done a poor job disclosing subsidies for data centers. The public service commission’s own staff has also warned that monthly residential bills could climb by $20 a month or more (a figure disputed by the utility) if the commission approves Georgia Power’s proposal to add almost 10,000 megawatts of power to accommodate data centers — the equivalent of nine nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle.

Only one-third of that proposal should be approved, the staff recommended.

In Troup County on the Alabama border, the victorious Democratic utility candidates whittled 24-point romps enjoyed by the Republican candidates in 2020 and 2018 down to 10, thanks to voters like the Paytons.

The Paytons had never been to a Hogansville City Council meeting before they heard about a proposal to build a data center on 437 acres next to their ranch, and across from their Georgia Untamed Zoo, which houses animals like sloths and capybaras and is popular with school field trips.

As a retiree on a fixed income, she is relieved that she’ll likely never have to buy another appliance, her energy bills are lower, and her home feels safer. ​“I don’t have to worry about gas blowing up or carbon monoxide, that kind of nonsense,” she said.

Gay-Robinson is among the hundreds of people who have benefited from a provision of Illinois’ 2021 clean-energy law that allows electric utilities to meet energy-conservation mandates in part by outfitting low-income households with electric appliances that reduce their bills — even though such overhauls actually increase, rather than decrease, electricity use.

Such policies are rare nationwide, but the approach could be a tool to help keep building decarbonization rolling as the Trump administration kills federal incentives for home electrification.

Modern electrical appliances — like induction stoves, electric dryers, and heat pumps that warm and cool spaces — are generally much more energy-efficient than their fossil-fueled counterparts. That means electrifying appliances cuts the amount of fossil fuels burned, even in places where gas and coal plants feed the power grid, said Nick Montoni, senior program director of policy and markets at the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center at North Carolina State University. As more renewable energy comes online, the emissions linked to electrical appliances decrease even further.

Plus, families breathe significantly cleaner indoor air when they change to an electric cooktop, due to the slew of health-harming pollutants emitted by gas stoves.

But replacing appliances is not cheap, and under the Trump administration’s budget law, federal tax credits to help households afford electric heat pumps and water heaters expire in December — seven years earlier than they were previously supposed to. Meanwhile, the future is uncertain for the federally funded Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR) program, an Inflation Reduction Act initiative that is administered by states and provides incentives for electric appliances. While some states have already launched their HEAR programs, the Trump administration put the remaining funds on ice earlier this year, and Illinois has not yet received its allotment.

Amid this federal upheaval, state policies that incentivize utilities to pick up the tab for electrification can be especially impactful.

“It’s expensive to electrify because it requires up-front cost,” said Montoni, who formerly served as deputy chief of staff at the Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. ​“You have to be able to afford a heat pump, an induction stove, an electric water heater — those aren’t inexpensive. That’s why there are rebates and incentives.”

Illinois utilities commit to electrification

Illinois law requires ComEd to cut electricity consumption each year by an amount equivalent to 2% of the utility’s annual sales in the early 2020s. The state’s other big electric utility, Ameren, faces similar rules in 2029 under a law passed this fall, though in the past it had lower savings mandates.

The 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act specifies that a portion of mandated energy savings — 5% since 2022, 10% starting next year, and 15% after 2029 — can come from electrification. The law also created a formula to convert the amount of energy used by a gas-powered appliance to electricity in kilowatt-hours, allowing an estimate of how much energy is saved by switching from gas to electric.

“So if a home gets partially or fully electrified through an electric energy-efficiency program, the utility claims the savings by calculating the difference between the gas therms in kilowatt-hour equivalents and the kilowatt[-hours] added via the electric measures,” explained Kari Ross, Midwest energy affordability advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Montoni called the policy ​“a pretty interesting mechanism — not unique, but very rare, from what I’ve seen.”

Michigan does have a similar policy, since a 2023 law allows electric and gas utilities to claim electrification as part of their mandatory energy-waste reduction. That legislation also includes a formula for determining the energy-efficiency gains from going electric.

Montoni said allowing electric utilities to count electrification toward their efficiency mandates is an important way to incentivize the shift off fossil fuels, especially in the more than a dozen states where different utilities provide electric and gas service.

When a utility provides both gas and electricity, electrification will typically show overall energy savings, Montoni explained. But when a utility provides only electricity, a formula similar to Illinois’ is needed for the utility to show that it is saving energy, even though a given customer’s electricity use actually increases after electrification.

In northern Illinois, ComEd is the primary electric utility, operating alongside two major gas utilities.

Through its whole-home energy-efficient electrification program, ComEd pays all up-front costs for electric appliances and heat pumps for households earning at or below 80% of the area median income. That initiative has electrified over 700 low-income households since it launched in 2022. The utility also offers rebates for customers of any income for purchasing electric appliances, including geothermal heat pumps.

ComEd’s energy-efficiency plan approved by state regulators says that a quarter of spending on electrification must be for low-income households, and the utility can undertake electrification only if it will save a customer money on their energy bills. Michigan’s law includes a similar provision.

“We carefully model each home to make sure proposed upgrades result in energy savings,” said Philip Roy, ComEd’s director of clean energy solutions. ​“Nationally, I’m pretty sure this is one of the more ambitious approaches to electrification, especially for income-eligible customers.”

Gay-Robinson said she has saved some money on her bills since her home’s overhaul last summer, and more importantly, she has reliable appliances to get through Chicago’s extreme weather.

She recommended the ComEd overhaul to a friend, who was suffering through hot summers in poor health and without air-conditioning. Gay-Robinson thinks the electric heating-cooling system her friend got at no cost may have saved her life.

Gay-Robinson said she still prefers cooking with gas, but she’s grateful ComEd provided new cookware along with her electric induction stove. ​“I thought it would be hard to even work the doggone stove. It looks like something out of the future,” she said. ​“But it wasn’t as hard as I thought.”

More retrofits like Gay-Robinson’s are on the way. In an agreement with stakeholder groups and regulators, ComEd has committed to spend a total of $162.3 million over the next four years on electrification and weatherization, which reduces the amount of power needed to heat and cool spaces.

In central and southern Illinois, Ameren provides both gas and electric service.

Ameren has not undertaken ambitious electrification programs like ComEd, and it had lower energy-efficiency mandates until the clean-energy law passed in October brought its targets into parity with ComEd’s. But Ameren will spend $5 million through 2029 helping customers switch from propane-fired heat, which is common in rural areas, to electric heat pumps.

Changing times

Home-electrification retrofits that lower energy bills may be harder to come by in Illinois and beyond in the future, as electricity prices spike due to the record-high cost of securing enough power-generating capacity for the PJM Interconnection regional grid, which spans 13 states.

Since ComEd is only allowed to offer customers new electrical appliances that will reduce their bills, high electricity prices mean some exchanges that worked in the past will no longer qualify; keeping a gas appliance may be cheaper.

“We are in a moment where further iteration is needed” on electrification policies, said Roy, also citing the impacts of President Donald Trump’s tariffs on appliance costs and the looming expiration of federal tax credits for energy-efficient equipment.

“We see a lot of momentum with these programs,” said Roy. ​“We think [electrification] will play a key role in not just energy-efficiency goals but broader energy policy. Combining all those elements — traditional energy efficiency, electrification, rooftop solar, battery storage — we have a lot of the tools, we just have to fine-tune the policy structures and incentives so we can accelerate the transition.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Water-heater-being-moved_GettyImages-2169894284.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=f619c14dad71f25dfc6335203aeadbc5,N,,2025-12-01 04:58:19.927393

The global rush toward green hydrogen presents itself as a win-win solution for climate action and economic development. European leaders paint an optimistic picture: South Africa possesses abundant renewable resources, critical minerals for electrolysers, and growing industrial capacity that could position it as a global clean hydrogen leader. South African President Ramaphosa echoes this enthusiasm, envisioning hydrogen as a way to marry Africa’s mineral wealth with renewable energy to decarbonise industries while creating jobs and stimulating investment.

While green hydrogen development is promoted as a climate necessity and force for sustainable development, the inequitable investment partnerships South Africa is making with foreign partners risk reproducing the same extractive relationships where African countries provide raw input while others reap the industrial and financial benefits.

In global trade relations, access to resources and production capacity has rarely translated into control or equitable benefit. Africa’s vast resource potential has historically been externally controlled, with limited domestic value capture. This pattern risks repeating itself in the emerging green hydrogen economy.

South Africa holds a critical role in the emerging hydrogen economy as a source of renewable energy and green hydrogen production. Yet, its position is increasingly shaped by structural and historical dynamics, reducing it to a resource extraction zone, serving the decarbonization and energy security goals of Global North partners.

While European nations secure high-value activities such as technology development, market leadership, financing, trade agreements, and certification schemes within their own borders, South Africa is relegated to low-value roles in production and supply.

Germany’s National Hydrogen Strategy, for example, positions the country as the “lead provider of hydrogen technologies by 2030” (e.g. fuel cell technology), while sourcing hydrogen from partner countries in the Global South. Partner countries are expected to supply raw materials and low-value hydrogen commodities, while Germany retains control over advanced technologies and market access. Similarly, the Netherlands positions itself as Europe’s “hydrogen gateway,” capturing lucrative trading, storage, and transport activities while externalising environmental and social costs to supplier nations.

South Africa’s own Green Hydrogen Commercialisation Strategy, though framed as nationally driven, emphasises export markets. It outlines a vision for over 100 GW of dedicated renewable energy capacity, primarily for export, requiring extensive infrastructure such as desalination plants, specialised transport networks, and dedicated export ports.

This export-first approach risks diverting renewable energy away from urgent domestic priorities like energy access, industrialisation, and job creation, reinforcing green extractivism; the appropriation of land, water, and other resources for renewable energy projects in ways that replicate the exploitative patterns of fossil fuel extraction rather than inclusive development.

Mechanisms of contemporary extraction

Green extractivism operates through sophisticated neoliberal mechanisms that legitimise resource appropriation as a climate necessity. Foreign direct investment and public-private partnerships establish corporate-led governance frameworks that prioritise investor returns over local benefits. Rather than supporting adaptation and mitigation for vulnerable populations, climate finance consolidates corporate control over resource governance and embedding neoliberal policy frameworks within national strategies.

South Africa has restructured its institutions and policies to create an investor-friendly ecosystem, offering tax incentives, subsidies, and tailored regulatory processes to attract foreign investment. The German KfW Development Bank’s allocation of $1.3 billion to support South Africa’s hydrogen sector comes with structural reform conditions mandating increased private sector participation in energy governance. Public funds are channelled through the blended finance platform SA-H2 Fund to de-risk investment in the Coega Green Ammonia project, led by UK-based Hive Energy.

Despite its strategic importance, the project’s value chain remains largely dominated by foreign entities. Its substantial output of one million tonnes of green ammonia annually is geared toward export markets in Asia and Europe. Financial risks are socialised through public funding, while profits are expected to flow primarily to international investors.

South Africa’s profound structural vulnerabilities, shared by many African economies, undermine its position in international energy and trade relationships. Economic fragility, driven by persistent unemployment, extreme inequality, currency depreciation, and Eskom’s debt crisis, intersects with critical infrastructure deficits across multiple sectors. The country faces a strained electricity grid, limited gas pipeline infrastructure, water scarcity in regions targeted for hydrogen production, and port facilities ranked among the world’s least efficient.

These vulnerabilities create conditions where any promise of development becomes difficult to refuse, regardless of its terms. While South Africa mobilises its renewable energy resources to serve European decarbonisation goals, millions of its citizens continue to experience energy insecurity through persistent load-shedding. Even green fertilisers produced from hydrogen remain unaffordable for smallholder farmers.

Renewable energy generation for hydrogen production requires vast territorial appropriations that bring industrial development into direct conflict with existing land uses. Hydrogen production is particularly water-intensive, exacerbating water scarcity in arid regions like the Northern Cape, where major projects are planned.

The transformation of strategic ‘Hydrogen Hubs’ treats these regions as abstract spaces for industrial development rather than lived environments sustaining cultural identity and economic security. Sasol’s Boegoebaai hydrogen cluster in the Northern Cape, spanning 60,000 hectares, risks dispossessing the indigenous Nama people of their ancestral lands.

Similarly, the deep-water port and desalination facility to support hydrogen production risks disrupting marine ecosystems due to brine discharge, increased salinity, and thermal pollution from desalination plants. The fishing community also face displacement and loss of livelihoods, especially in areas like Port Nolloth.

Mpumalanga, long devastated as a sacrifice zone for coal production, has suffered from severe air pollution, land degradation, and widespread health impacts. The province is now home to three major green hydrogen projects being developed on land leased from Eskom, near existing coal infrastructure: Sasol Hyshift in Secunda, Camden Green Hydrogen and Ammonia in Ermelo, and HDF Renewstable Mpumalanga in Standerton.

This new wave of industrial transformation risks further marginalising local communities by concentrating the burdens of both the old carbon economy and the emerging green economy.

Contested vision of just transition

Despite the policy rhetoric emphasising ‘just transition’ — the shift to a low-carbon economy that ensures fairness and inclusion for workers and communities affected by the transition – current arrangements demonstrate a significant disconnect between transformative aspirations and material realities.

The Just Energy Transition Investment Plan shows a striking imbalance between infrastructural spending on large-scale export projects and social investments in community benefits and addressing energy poverty. Of the 1.5 trillion rand total investment, only 60.4 billion rand specifically targets just transition initiatives in Mpumalanga, the province most affected by coal sector transitions.

European hydrogen strategies, including the EU Hydrogen Strategy and related initiatives like the European Hydrogen Backbone and Clean Hydrogen Partnership, focus on industrial competitiveness, infrastructure development, and decarbonisation targets, completely ignoring community consultation. This systematic exclusion occurs despite South Africa’s constitutional commitments to democratic governance and communities’ rights to clean water and land.

There is an urgent call for a justice-centred ‘post-extractivist transition’, one that envisions development beyond resource extraction, prioritising ecological sustainability, community autonomy, and equitable benefit-sharing across Africa. This approach should centre local control in global climate and energy debates. While some level of resource extraction may be necessary to support the energy transition, such activities must reinforce rather than erode community rights, environmental stewardship, and inclusive development.

A justice-centred post-extractivist transition should restructure international energy and trade relationships to centre genuine community participation in project design and ownership structures, recognising communities’ right to refuse projects that don’t serve their interests, regardless of broader climate justifications. Instead of treating consultation as a mere procedural requirement, it should embed community veto power into governance structures and ensure affected populations maintain meaningful control over decisions affecting their territories.

Projects should demonstrate direct contributions to addressing energy poverty and strengthening local economies through community ownership models, local manufacturing capacity, and revenue sharing that enhances rather than displaces existing economic activities. The land-intensive nature of renewable energy infrastructure makes territorial rights central, requiring integration of renewable development with existing land uses and community priorities.

South Africa faces conflicting development visions: one treating the continent as an extraction zone serving global markets, and another positioning renewable energy as a foundation for energy sovereignty, democratic participation, and equitable development.

Current policy trajectories lean heavily toward the former, but structural contradictions point to the need for alternative visions. Alternative visions must challenge the financial, trade, and governance frameworks that privilege Global North interests over Global South priorities.

South Africa could leverage its strategic position differently. Rather than competing to offer the most attractive investment incentives, it could coordinate with other African hydrogen producers to establish minimum standards for foreign investment, similar to how oil-producing nations have used collective bargaining. Regional cooperation could help resist the race-to-the-bottom dynamics that characterise current negotiations.

While the global energy transition shows signs of reproducing historical patterns of extraction, it also holds the potential to become a foundation for more equitable international trade relations. The direction ultimately depends on whose interests shape the transition’s terms and whose voices are centred in energy governance. A justice-centred post-extractivist transition must recognise the complementarity of climate action and decolonisation, and pursue these together.

The hydrogen economy is still emerging, and its final structure remains contested. Decisions made in the coming years about ownership models, governance frameworks, and benefit-sharing mechanisms will determine whether this transition strengthens or undermines the prospects for genuine sustainable development in South Africa — and whether it becomes an effective tool for global decarbonisation.

The message was clear—Africa holds the key to the global green transition.","UNITED NATIONS, December 1 (IPS) - Although Africa holds more than 30 per cent of the world’s critical green minerals—including cobalt, lithium, manganese, and rare earth elements vital for building batteries, wind turbines and solar panels— this has not translated into prosperity for the continent.

At the Africa Climate Summit 2025 held in Addis Ababa in September 2025, leaders and experts explored ways Africa can benefit more from its resources.

Under the theme “Accelerating renewable energy, nature-based solutions, e-mobility, and scaling up climate finance,” the Summit sought ways to build a resilient and prosperous future for Africa. The important question, however, was whether Africa would continue exporting its raw materials for others to reap the profit or seize this moment and drive the agenda of its transformation.

Speaking at the Summit, the Executive Secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), Claver Gatete, called for a united African front in order to leverage these resources strategically.

“We cannot afford to repeat the exploitative patterns of the past,” he said. “Africa must industrialise using its own resources, creating jobs and sustainable growth of our people.”

The current net-zero clean energy race has triggered surging global demand for minerals used in batteries, solar panels and wind turbines, of which Africa is a key supplier.

Mr. Gatete emphasised the need for African governments to invest in local processing, value addition, and stronger regional cooperation, and avoid exporting raw minerals.

Risks and opportunities

The Summit highlighted both opportunities and risks. On one hand, critical minerals could generate billions in revenue, accelerate clean industrialisation and help Africa achieve the SDGs.

On the other hand, unchecked extraction will not benefit Africans and would worsen inequality and environmental degradation.

Mr. Gatete called for building continental capacity to process, refine, and manufacture components like batteries within Africa. He cited the ECA—Afreximbank Battery and Electric Vehicle (BEV) value chain initiative, launched in the DRC and Zambia, to build special economic zones (SEZ) for producing electric vehicle battery precursor and components as a concrete example of this shift “from resource extraction to technological innovation and prioritisation of local value addition.”

To expand this further, participants emphasised the importance of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to develop integrated regional value chains, reduce external dependence, and unlock economies of scale. In the same breath, they called for continental unity to avoid fragmented national policies that could weaken Africa’s bargaining power.

To address this, ECA proposed the formation of African Critical Minerals Alliance—to harmonise regulations, negotiate better trade deals and promote intra-African collaborations.

“Unity is our strength,” Mr. Gatete reminded participants. “By working together, African countries can ensure that green minerals become a foundation for prosperity, not another lost opportunity.”

Africa’s financing gap for climate action was also discussed at the Summit, with leaders renewing their calls for increased international climate finance, debt relief and technology transfer. They also underscore the importance of the private sector investment aimed at strengthening regional value chains, building local processing capacity and expanding critical infrastructure.

The Africa Climate Summit 2025 ended with the adoption of the Addis Ababa Declaration, a renewed commitment to place sustainability, equity, and local development at the heart of mineral exploitation. The message was clear—Africa holds the key to the global green transition. The challenge now is how to turn that potential into lasting, inclusive prosperity for its people.

Financial advisor Winnie Sun published an article in Forbes that breaks down key trends in the solar industry and highlights the pros and cons of leasing versus buying panels. One of the main changes in the solar industry is the decrease in installation costs. Sun wrote that ""the cost to install solar has plummeted by more than half over the last decade.""

Installing a solar system for your home is one of the most effective ways to save on your utility bills while sheltering your home from rising energy prices. Whether you decide to lease or purchase panels for your home ultimately depends on your budget and long-term housing situation.

""It's worth leasing if the costs to do so are cheaper than your current electricity bill,"" Sun wrote. ""If you can afford it, it's generally better to buy, especially if you plan to stay in your home for at least seven years.""

Solar roofing delivers exactly this for heritage buildings.","Heritage buildings face a dilemma – how to embrace the future without erasing the past.

As clean technologies and renewable energy gain momentum across the UK and beyond, historic buildings face increasing pressure to reduce their carbon footprint. This is, in part, intensified by concerns around their typically poor energy efficiency, often a result of age, design and traditional construction materials.

Many sustainable retrofits – such as LED lighting, heat pumps, and improved insulation – have proven relatively straightforward to implement without compromising the integrity or appearance of heritage and listed buildings. The integration of solar technology, however, has not always been readily accepted or implemented.

Solar roofing: Preserving the past while powering the future

Solar is one of the fastest-growing renewable energy sources in the world, but both official heritage guidelines and public opinion have indicated concern about the visual impact of traditional rooftop solar panels on historic buildings. The core challenge lies in reconciling modern, often bulky, technology with the architectural integrity and charm of the past.

Rooftops are ideal for solar installations, thanks to their unobstructed access to sunlight and efficient use of space. However, traditional solar panels can be visually intrusive – especially on heritage and protected buildings.

This is where building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) solar roofs come in: seamlessly integrated into the roof structure, they enable protected buildings to adopt clean energy without compromising aesthetics.

Blending into the architecture, quality solar roofing is often described as “invisible”. BIPV technology has now advanced to support buildings with distinctively coloured roofs – such as green oxidised copper or terracotta tiles – by offering solar materials in matching shades, allowing discreet rooftop solar integration for the first time.

UK heritage guidance embraces solar, but adoption remains limited

As the UK Government rolls out its ambitious Clean Power 2030 Action Plan – targeting 45–47 GW of solar generation capacity by 2030 – heritage organisations have also become increasingly committed to integrating solar into their properties and guidance policies; albeit with caution to protect visual appearance.

For example, Historic England updated its guidance in July 2024 to clarify that – with the necessary permissions and careful visual planning – solar panels can be appropriately integrated into heritage buildings. Prior to this, installations were often hindered by inconsistent decision-making across local councils.

However, despite this policy progress, uptake remains low. A government-commissioned review found that 87% of heritage building owners perceive listed-building consent as a barrier, and 75% say it prevents energy efficiency upgrades. In practice, only a small fraction of heritage buildings currently feature solar installations, highlighting the failure of standard panels to win widespread acceptance.

York Minster: The exception that proves the rule

Leading the way among religious buildings, the Church of England (one of the UK’s largest heritage custodians) pledged net-zero carbon emissions across its buildings by 2030. A recent example of solar integration is the iconic York Minster, which activated 184 solar panels in January 2025. These panels, discreetly positioned on the South Quire roof, will generate around 70,000 kWh annually – roughly a third of the Minster’s electricity demand.

Yet the installation drew public criticism: “Fitting panels to a historic building like that seems absurd…” and “That seems wrong on a historic building. I’m pro solar panels, but I don’t think they’re appropriate everywhere” are just two of the comments made by local members of the public when the solar plans were announced. This underscores how traditional panels can still clash with heritage sensibilities and deter broader adoption.

Still, the emissions and cost-savings potential of solar for heritage buildings is hard to ignore.

Bath Abbey offers a compelling feasibility study on solar’s potential: modelling suggests 164 PV panels could generate around 45 MWh per year – 35% of its annual usage – saving 10 tonnes of CO₂ annually, with payback in 13 years and a projected profit of £139,000 over 25 years.

Gloucester Cathedral – which installed 150 solar panels on its nave roof in 2016 – has reduced its energy costs by over 25%. It is considered the oldest UK cathedral with a solar installation, but one of many historic religious buildings in the UK to make such a move.

BIPV: The solution for widespread adoption

Rather than relying on rare, high-profile exceptions, the heritage sector now needs a solution built for scale – BIPV solar roofing delivers this.

Instead of ‘clashing’ with history, integrated solar roofing:

Merges with the existing roofline, avoiding the ‘stuck-on’ look

Mimics traditional materials like slate, terracotta or oxidised copper with coloured options

Eliminates the most significant barriers – visual impact and public resistance – by remaining discreet.

As Sonia Dunlop, CEO of the Global Solar Council, puts it, “In some cases, BIPV could be appropriate” for historic buildings, highlighting that suitable technology already exists today to meet the needs of heritage custodians.

Mock-up images of Westminster Abbey (top) and Canterbury Cathedral (bottom) demonstrating how the buildings would look if retrofitted with BIPV solar roofing

Westminster Abbey and Canterbury Cathedral are two examples of iconic UK heritage buildings which have not yet adopted solar PV despite the Church of England initiatives. Their esteemed heritage status rightly calls for more careful scrutiny of how installations might impact aesthetics.

Solar roofing offers a solution. Instead of traditional panels that may jar with the fabric of these sites, mock-ups show how discreet BIPV roofing could be applied seamlessly – maintaining their tradition and style whilst generating clean, renewable energy to keep the buildings running. For custodians of these buildings, this is the first credible way to reconcile climate action with heritage protection.

Balancing preservation with progress

Renewable energy is the future – and soon, even the most exceptional buildings will need to adapt. The key is applying innovative, tailored solutions that support organisations in making the transition – with respect for their values and context. Solar roofing delivers exactly this for heritage buildings.

It’s a two-way street: if we're asking heritage organisations to commit to climate action, we must also respect their stewardship of historic fabric and place. That’s the difference between symbolic early adoption and genuine, scaled climate leadership.

Marrying the past with the future may not be straightforward – but it's essential. These treasured buildings will only endure if we protect both their history and the planet they stand on.

UK: National Grid has joined the Northern Powerhouse Partnership (NPP), strengthening its commitment to expanding clean-energy infrastructure, developing local skills, and supporting economic growth across the North of England. The move comes as part of The Great Grid Upgrade, the company’s wide-ranging investment programme designed to connect more affordable, home-grown renewable power to the national network.

The announcement was marked at the Eastern Green Link 2 (EGL2) converter station visitor centre in Wren Hall, recently opened by Keir Mather MP. The event brought together apprentices, industry leaders and regional partners, highlighting the collaboration behind the upgrade programme.

National Grid’s major projects in the North include Eastern Green Link 1 and 2, Yorkshire Green, and proposed developments such as the Cross Border Connection and North Humber to High Marnham. Collectively, the company’s network investment is expected to support up to 55,000 jobs across the UK by 2030, with a significant share in northern communities.

The economic impact is already visible. On EGL2 alone, construction partner BAM is creating around 200 roles, including apprenticeships and specialist engineering jobs. ‘Meet the buyer’ events for EGL1 and EGL2 have helped hundreds of northern SMEs access new opportunities in civil works, cabling, transport, environmental services and technical design. METLEN, delivering the EGL1 converter station, has so far awarded contracts worth around $225,000 (£170,000) to small and medium enterprises.

National Grid is also upgrading Grid Supply Points and replacing overhead line crossings, such as the River Tyne, with modern cable tunnel solutions to support regional transport, industry and long-term growth.

BACKGROUND The CWA applies to ""navigable waters,"" which is defined as ""the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas,"" but the CWA does not further define WOTUS.
EPA and the Corps would apply a two-prong test requiring both: (1) abutment of a jurisdictional water; and (2) having surface water at least during the wet season.
Eliminations The Proposed Rule would eliminate jurisdictional triggers for interstate waters that are disconnected from traditionally navigable waters.
However, the Proposed Rule is unexpectedly vague and deferential on many details for Agencies to define the limits of the rule.","On November 20, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Proposed Rule) in the Federal Register to update several regulatory definitions defining ""Waters of the United States"" (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act (CWA).

The Proposed Rule is a culmination of decades of agency and judicial process that at times narrowed and expanded the scope of federal jurisdiction over our nation's waters. Driven by the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency (Sackett), the Trump Administration is poised to change the definition of WOTUS to limit federal jurisdiction. These changes are intended to respect State and Tribal authority and promote regulatory certainty and clarity.

As further explained below, the Proposed Rule would clarify the definition of WOTUS by defining ""continuous surface connection,"" ""relatively permanent,"" and ""tributaries,"" and would clarify several exemptions under the CWA. Additionally, the Proposed Rule would add a new exemption for groundwater and would eliminate interstate waters that don't themselves independently qualify as WOTUS from federal jurisdiction.

EPA and the Corps are also inviting comments on alternative approaches and additional revisions to the WOTUS definition and its implementation. Comments must be received on or before January 5, 2026.

BACKGROUND

The CWA applies to ""navigable waters,"" which is defined as ""the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas,"" but the CWA does not further define WOTUS. This lack of statutory definition has resulted in ambiguity, protracted rulemaking, and decades of litigation over the breadth of WOTUS.

Most recently, the U.S. Supreme Court addressed the definition of WOTUS in Sackett. The Court adopted a narrow interpretation of WOTUS, holding that the CWA's use of ""waters"" encompasses ""only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water 'forming geographical features,'"" such as streams, oceans, rivers and lakes. Similarly, Sackett concluded that the Agencies' definition of ""adjacent,"" used to determine whether a wetland constituted a jurisdictional water under the CWA, was too broad, and affirmed that the ""continuous surface connection"" test is the appropriate standard. Shortly thereafter, the Corps and EPA under the Biden Administration promulgated regulations conforming the regulatory definition of WOTUS to the Sackett decision (Amended 2023 Rule). EPA and the Corps are now proposing to revise the definition again to address concerns raised by stakeholders about the Amended 2023 Rule, including assertions that the Amended 2023 Rule does not adequately comply with the Supreme Court's interpretation in Sackett of the scope of Federal jurisdiction and implementation-related issues.

For additional background and history of the WOTUS saga, refer to Van Ness Feldman's past alerts and notices.1

KEY CHANGES

Definitions:

The most significant proposed changes would revise the definitions of two terms that guide whether a water is a WOTUS or not: ""relatively permanent"" and ""continuous surface connection."" The rule also clarifies the definition of ""tributaries."" Each term plays an important role in determining whether a particular water qualifies as a WOTUS.

WOTUS includes (1) traditional navigable waters and the territorial seas; (2) most impoundments of ""waters of the United States;"" (3) relatively permanent tributaries of traditional navigable waters, the territorial seas, and impoundments; (4) wetlands adjacent (i.e., having a continuous surface connection) to traditional navigable waters, impoundments, and tributaries; and (5) lakes and ponds that are relatively permanent and have a continuous surface connection to a traditional navigable water, the territorial seas, or a tributary.

Relatively Permanent. The Proposed Rule would define ""relatively permanent"" to mean ""standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season."" The relatively permanent definition applies to tributaries, lakes and ponds, and adjacent wetlands.

With the addition of ""at least during the wet season,"" the Agencies propose to add a temporal element to the test. ""Wet season"" would be defined using existing agency tools, and quantitatively as the point at which ""precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration,"" and would vary by geographic region and ecotype. Significantly, water must stand or flow for the entirety of the wet season to qualify as ""relatively permanent;"" intermittent flow, or longer flow not occurring during the wet season do not qualify as relatively permanent waters. The Agencies are soliciting comments on alternative methods that could better define the wet season given site and region-specific factors.

Continuous surface connection. The Proposed Rule would define a continuous surface connection as one ""having surface water at least during the wet season and abutting (i.e., touching) a jurisdictional water.""

EPA and the Corps would apply a two-prong test requiring both: (1) abutment of a jurisdictional water; and (2) having surface water at least during the wet season. The Agencies explain that this is meant to limit the scope of jurisdictional wetlands by suggesting that even if a wetland is more broadly delineated, only those portions of the wetland that have surface water that abuts or touches a jurisdictional water during the wet season are under federal jurisdiction.

Tributaries. The Proposed Rule would redefine tributaries as ""bod[ies] of water with relatively permanent flow, and a bed and bank, that connects to a downstream traditional navigable water or the territorial seas, either directly or through one or more waters or features that convey relatively permanent flow.""

This definition expressly excludes ""a body of water that contributes surface water flow to a downstream jurisdictional water through [natural or artificial] feature[s]... if such feature does not convey relatively permanent flow."" However, tributaries do include natural, man-altered, and man-made waterbodies, such as rivers, streams, ditches, canals, lakes, ponds, and impoundments,"" as long as they connect to a downstream traditionally navigable water. Tributaries may connect through non-jurisdictional features, so long as those features convey relatively permanent flow.

Exclusions

The Proposed Rule would modify three existing jurisdictional exclusions for waste treatment systems, prior converted cropland, and ditches, and adds a new exclusion related to groundwater.

Waste water systems. The Proposed Rule would continue an existing exclusion for waste treatment systems, and define ""waste treatment systems"" as ""including all components of a waste treatment system designed to meet the requirements of the [CWA], including lagoons and treatment ponds (such as settling or cooling ponds), designed to either convey or retain, concentrate, settle, reduce, or remove pollutants, either actively or passively, from wastewater prior to discharge (or eliminating any such discharge).""

By adding this definition, the Proposed Rule appears to expand the scope of the exclusion to include all components of a waste treatment system. The Preamble of the Proposed Rule acknowledges that a cooling pond constructed within a WOTUS would be excluded from WOTUS jurisdiction provided it complies with CWA requirements.

Prior Converted Cropland. The Proposed Rule continues the long-standing exclusion of prior converted cropland, but clarifies that the exclusion does not apply to abandoned cropland. The Agencies propose that prior converted cropland is considered abandoned if it is not used for, or in support of, agricultural purposes at least once in the immediately preceding five years. The Proposed Rule also explains that agricultural uses can include myriad conservation and non-extractive uses, providing that the Agencies' new list of agricultural uses ""may not be obvious to Corps field staff,"" such that the Corps can rely on public or private documentation that the land is being used in accordance with the agricultural uses set forth in the rule.

Ditches. The Proposed Rule would clarify the types of ditches that are excluded from WOTUS jurisdiction, explaining that non navigable ditches that are constructed or excavated ""entirely in dry land"" are not WOTUS. The Proposed Rule explains that ditches that channel or relocate jurisdictional tributaries maintain their jurisdictional status if the tributary continues to meet the regulatory definition of a tributary.

New exception for groundwater. The Proposed Rule explains that groundwater has never been interpreted as WOTUS, explaining that groundwater is by nature not navigable. However, ""surface expressions of groundwater,"" like groundwater that emerges from the ground and becomes baseflow in a relatively permanent stream, are not subject to the exclusion and would continue to be subject to federal jurisdiction if they otherwise meet the requirements of a WOTUS.

Eliminations

The Proposed Rule would eliminate jurisdictional triggers for interstate waters that are disconnected from traditionally navigable waters. Eliminating these triggers would remove lakes and streams that straddle state borders, that do not themselves independently meet the regulatory definition of a WOTUS. The Agencies reason that this has been a consistent source of litigation, reads out ""navigable"" from the statute, and is ultimately not supported by Sackett or Rapanos v. United States (Rapanos). The Proposed Rule provides that nonjurisdictional interstate waters are appropriately regulated by the ""States and Tribes under their sovereign authorities.""

Additionally, the Proposed Rule would restrict mosaic wetlands to the individual wetland segments, which previously together constituted a single wetland comprising the hydrologically connected segments. In particular, this has significant implications for jurisdictional determinations in Alaska, where permafrost wetlands have long been regulated under the mosaic wetland interpretation.

Additionally, the Agencies are seeking comment regarding whether to adopt a USDA definition of wetland under the Food Security Act that expressly excludes certain permafrost wetlands in lands with high agricultural potential in Alaska.

Implications

The Proposed Rule would limit the scope of federal jurisdiction over the nation's waters and correspondingly reduce the federal regulatory burden and compliance issues for work done in and near waters that are no longer considered jurisdictional. We would anticipate a significant reduction in the number of Section 404 permits and associated CWA 401 water quality certifications. However, the Proposed Rule is unexpectedly vague and deferential on many details for Agencies to define the limits of the rule.

Once finalized, additional litigation on the final rule is almost certain to occur.

Furthermore, irrespective of this rulemaking, states and Tribes will likely use their own regulatory authority to fill the gap left by Sackett and the finalized rule. States, including Washington, have ongoing rulemaking processes to further develop their regulatory authority over state waters.

""As India moves closer to its goal of becoming a $ 5 trillion economy, advancing a green economy is no longer a choice but a strategic necessity.
Advt At the centre of the push is the need for strong transition finance, circularity, and improved reporting systems.
Banerjee said, ""As India strides forward on its path of green transition, it is imperative to have a holistic approach to decarbonisation where transition finance, circularity and a robust ESG reporting ecosystem are prioritised, in addition to the focus on renewables and green mobility.""
To address the gap, Banerjee has suggested creating a Green Finance Institution (GFI) that can bring in large-scale, low-cost capital.","The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has called for a holistic green transition that strengthens finance, boosts recycling systems, and simplifies environmental approvals, saying this shift is essential as India moves closer to its $ 5 trillion economy goal.

Elaborating on the CII Proposals in this area, Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General, CII, underlined that India needs a green transition not as a choice but as a strategic requirement for long-term growth. ""As India moves closer to its goal of becoming a $ 5 trillion economy, advancing a green economy is no longer a choice but a strategic necessity. This transition is vital not only for meeting climate goals but also for shaping India's long-term growth, competitiveness, and global standing,"" said Banerjee.

At the centre of the push is the need for strong transition finance, circularity, and improved reporting systems. Banerjee said, ""As India strides forward on its path of green transition, it is imperative to have a holistic approach to decarbonisation where transition finance, circularity and a robust ESG reporting ecosystem are prioritised, in addition to the focus on renewables and green mobility.""

According to him, India needs nearly $ 1 trillion in green investments over the next 10 to 15 years, and close to $ 10 trillion by 2070, to reach its net-zero goal. But current finance flows meet only about one-fourth of this requirement. To address the gap, Banerjee has suggested creating a Green Finance Institution (GFI) that can bring in large-scale, low-cost capital. The body can be set up in GIFT City and supported by global funds without needing direct government spending. It can offer concessional finance, equity support, guarantees, and securitisation to bring down project costs across renewable energy, clean mobility, green buildings and industrial decarbonisation.

Banerjee also proposed a ""Green Tech Expo Fund"" to help Indian clean-tech companies participate in global technology events. The idea is to push India's growing innovations in green technology onto the world stage and build partnerships with global investors and buyers.

He further highlighted the strong need for a recycling strategy for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and nickel, as India depends heavily on imports. Rules for mandatory recycling of batteries and electronics, fast-track clearances, and incentives for domestic recovery of minerals, were also suggested. Banerjee recommended creating Circular Economy Parks for waste like plastics, tyres, e-waste and batteries, with 15 parks in three years and 45 in five years.

Advt

To make approvals faster and clearer, Banerjee has proposed a unified Environmental and Climate Clearance Authority with a fully digital system and automatic approvals within fixed timelines for projects that meet low-emission and sustainability norms. He also stressed the need for energy-efficient buildings, recommending a National Digitalization of Built Environment Initiative and uniform adoption of building energy codes.

As India builds for the future, the shift must go beyond electric vehicles and renewable power to include green finance, easier environmental processes, stronger recycling systems and sustainable buildings. ""These are vital for not only building a resilient, innovative, and inclusive economy but also offer significant untapped opportunities for investors looking to capitalise on these transformative trends,"" Banerjee said.

Starting Jan. 1, 2026, every public charging station in Maryland that accepts payment must register with the state’s Weights and Measures program and pay a $150 annual fee.
In spring 2026, state inspectors will arrive with certified test equipment to verify that each charger meters electricity within tolerances.
The public charging network shrinks at the exact moment Maryland needs it to expand.","Maryland set a bold goal of 1.1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030. With just shy of 150,000 EVs registered as of October 2025, the state has ground to make up.

That growth depends on a public charging network that is reliable, affordable and widely available, especially for apartment and condo dwellers without home charging and for drivers crossing the state on longer trips. Public charging must keep pace. Yet a new regulation from the Maryland Department of Agriculture threatens to do the opposite.

Starting Jan. 1, 2026, every public charging station in Maryland that accepts payment must register with the state’s Weights and Measures program and pay a $150 annual fee. That is per port. A simple four-plug Level 2 station at a grocery store, office garage, or apartment complex now owes Maryland $600 a year just to remain in service.

The state calls it a registration fee. In practice, it operates as a $150-per-port tax, perhaps the highest in the nation. For comparison, Maryland charges gas stations only $20 to register each fuel dispenser. An EV charging plug now costs 7.5 times more to keep legal than a gasoline nozzle.

The Maryland Department of Agriculture is gearing up for enforcement. Chargers not registered by Jan. 1 face being red-tagged with a stop-use order. This removes the unit from service entirely. Every fix requires a registered service agency to sign off on repairs, and those technicians charge real money.

In spring 2026, state inspectors will arrive with certified test equipment to verify that each charger meters electricity within tolerances. New chargers must be certified before operating. The cost of compliance begins long before the first kilowatt-hour is sold.

Large fast-charging networks will simply take this in stride and raise rates a few cents. The damage falls hardest on low-margin Level 2 stations that drivers rely on daily. Apartment complexes, hotel lots, small retail centers, and office buildings often run these chargers at break-even or as customer perks.

A substantial yearly charger tax transforms a goodwill gesture into a financial liability. Many hosts will run the numbers, see red ink, and simply rip out the equipment rather than pass the cost to users or risk repeated red tags for minor violations.

Charger hosts lose the incentive to keep stations online. Drivers lose convenient charging options. The public charging network shrinks at the exact moment Maryland needs it to expand.

By 2026, compliant chargers will sport a little MDA decal proving they are registered. What many won’t see will be the faint outlines on the pavement where perfectly functional Level 2 chargers once stood, quietly removed because the juice just wasn’t worth the squeeze.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-101/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/54918991226_f8b0d3035c_o-1024x7681764557690.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=or7AvzVL,N,,2025-11-30 23:58:10.431753

The Future of Green Manufacturing The future of manufacturing in the South is being shaped by sustainability, technology, and innovation.","The Shift Toward Sustainability

The manufacturing industry has long been a cornerstone of the Southern economy. From chemical plants along the Gulf Coast to food processing facilities across the region, these industries have provided jobs, growth, and stability for decades. However, traditional manufacturing has often relied heavily on fossil fuels and energy-intensive processes. This has led to growing concerns about environmental impact and long-term sustainability.

Today, many Southern manufacturers are taking significant steps to reduce their environmental footprint. By adopting sustainable practices, companies are finding ways to improve efficiency, cut costs, and meet increasing consumer and regulatory demands for cleaner operations. Tyler Pommier, a renewable energy executive based in Baton Rouge, observes that the move toward sustainability is not just about compliance. “Companies are recognizing that being sustainable is good for business and good for the community,” he says.

Energy Efficiency in Manufacturing

One of the first areas manufacturers are addressing is energy consumption. Modernizing equipment, upgrading lighting, and installing energy management systems can reduce electricity usage significantly. Factories are investing in high-efficiency motors, variable-speed drives, and smart HVAC systems to optimize energy performance.

Solar and wind energy are also becoming part of the solution. Companies are installing rooftop solar panels or participating in community solar programs to supplement their energy needs with renewable sources. These steps not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also lower operating costs over time.

Tyler Pommier emphasizes that energy efficiency is often the simplest and most impactful starting point. “You do not have to wait for new technology to make a difference,” he notes. “Even small improvements in energy management can lead to substantial savings and environmental benefits.”

Water Conservation and Waste Reduction

Manufacturing processes often consume large amounts of water and generate waste. Many Southern companies are implementing water recycling and treatment systems to reduce consumption and limit pollution. By reusing water within production cycles, factories can cut costs and reduce their impact on local waterways.

In addition, waste reduction programs are becoming more common. Manufacturers are rethinking materials, optimizing supply chains, and finding ways to recycle byproducts instead of sending them to landfills. Some companies have even started using waste as a raw material for other processes, creating a circular economy that benefits both business and the environment.

“Water and waste are two areas where manufacturers can make real changes without sacrificing productivity,” Tyler Pommier says. “It requires planning and investment, but the results speak for themselves.”

Clean Energy and Industrial Innovation

Beyond efficiency and conservation, Southern manufacturers are exploring cleaner energy sources. Combined heat and power systems, hydrogen energy, and bioenergy are emerging as viable options for industrial applications. These technologies provide reliable energy while reducing emissions and reliance on fossil fuels.

Some manufacturers are integrating smart technology to monitor and optimize their operations in real time. Sensors, data analytics, and automation allow companies to detect inefficiencies, predict maintenance needs, and adjust energy usage dynamically. This approach not only supports sustainability but also enhances productivity and reduces downtime.

The combination of clean energy and smart technology is redefining what it means to be a modern manufacturer. It is no longer just about producing goods efficiently. It is about producing them responsibly, with a focus on long-term environmental and economic benefits.

Economic and Community Benefits

Sustainable manufacturing brings benefits beyond environmental impact. It creates new jobs, attracts investment, and strengthens local economies. Skilled positions are needed to design, install, and maintain renewable energy systems and smart manufacturing technologies. This opens opportunities for workers who may have previously relied solely on traditional roles.

Communities also benefit when manufacturers reduce pollution and use resources responsibly. Cleaner air, reduced water contamination, and lower greenhouse gas emissions improve public health and quality of life. Companies that prioritize sustainability often build stronger relationships with local stakeholders and gain trust within their regions.

Overcoming Challenges

Transitioning to sustainable practices is not without challenges. Initial costs for new technology, energy systems, and process upgrades can be significant. Some companies may also face regulatory hurdles or uncertainty about the return on investment.

Education and planning are essential. Leaders must assess their current operations, identify areas for improvement, and develop realistic strategies. Collaboration with renewable energy experts, technology providers, and community partners can make the transition smoother and more effective.

Tyler Pommier stresses that persistence and vision are key. “Sustainability is a journey, not a single project,” he explains. “The companies that succeed are those that are willing to invest in the long term and continuously improve.”

Success Stories Across the South

Several Southern manufacturers are already showing how sustainability can work in practice. Chemical plants are using bio-based feedstocks, food processing facilities are implementing water-saving measures, and automotive suppliers are reducing energy consumption with smart systems. These examples demonstrate that environmental responsibility and industrial growth can go hand in hand.

States like Louisiana, Georgia, and Texas are supporting these efforts through grants, incentives, and technical assistance. Public-private partnerships are helping manufacturers adopt renewable energy, modernize equipment, and train their workforce for a sustainable future.

The Future of Green Manufacturing

The future of manufacturing in the South is being shaped by sustainability, technology, and innovation. Companies that embrace these principles will not only reduce their environmental impact but also strengthen their competitiveness and resilience.

As Tyler Pommier notes, “The South has an incredible opportunity to lead in sustainable industry. By combining innovation with our traditional strengths, we can build a manufacturing sector that is cleaner, smarter, and more resilient for generations to come.”

From energy efficiency to clean technology, from waste reduction to smart systems, the South is reimagining its industrial future. Green manufacturing is no longer an option; it is a necessary evolution. The region is proving that economic growth and environmental responsibility can go hand in hand, paving the way for a stronger, more sustainable Southern economy.",https://microgridmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image1.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 03:58:49.129706

President Xi Jinping has put forward the concept that ""lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets"". Embracing this concept, China has undergone a fundamental shift in its economic development paradigm. As a responsible manufacturing powerhouse, China is advancing new industrialization as a key task, with green and low-carbon development as its ecological foundation. By reducing carbon emissions, curbing pollution, expanding green initiatives and fostering economic growth, China contributes its wisdom and solutions to global sustainability.

Strengthening green vision guidance

Ideas guide actions, and the deep impetus for the green transition of China's sprawling manufacturing sector stems from President Xi's ecological civilization concept. The belief that ""lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets"" transcends the traditional industrial paradigm, setting China on a path of high-quality growth coupled with high-level environmental protection. Guided by this vision, China has established a ""1+N"" policy framework for carbon peak and carbon neutrality, translating these ambitious goals into actionable and measurable steps. Through tools like setting green standards, promoting green finance and building carbon trading markets, China has created a stable and predictable market environment for green transition.

In recent years, China's economic growth has been relying less on energy consumption. From 2021 to 2024, China recorded an average annual industrial growth rate of over 5 percent with only around 3 percent annual growth in energy consumption. This green transition has unleashed robust new economic momentum: China has built the world's largest new energy industry chain. In 2024, China's total installed capacity of wind and solar power exceeded 1.2 billion kilowatts, achieving the 2030 installation target in Nationally Determined Contributions six years ahead of schedule. Today, over half of the world's electric vehicles run on Chinese roadways.

Deepening green tech innovation

Technological innovation is the core driver of the green transition in manufacturing. China has integrated green technology innovation into its national innovation system, achieving remarkable results through strategic government support, economies of scale and industrial synergy. According to the 2024 China Patent Survey Report by the China National Intellectual Property Administration, nearly half of Chinese enterprises have engaged in, or plan to pursue, green technology innovation.

Over the past decade, China has contributed to a cumulative reduction of over 60 percent and 80 percent, respectively, in the global average levelized cost of electricity for wind power and solar photovoltaic technologies.

Breakthroughs have also been made in making traditional industries greener. For instance, Chinese companies have built hydrogen-based metallurgy production lines with an annual production capacity of one million metric tons and green ammonia synthesis production lines with an annual capacity of 300,000 tons, achieving full-process mastery of complex technologies that support these factories. Meanwhile, one-million-ton carbon capture, utilization and storage projects have been completed and put into operation. These advancements lay the groundwork for larger-scale and deeper green transitions of manufacturing.

Popularizing green manufacturing models

Green manufacturing is a modernized production mode characterized by low consumption, low emissions, high efficiency and high returns. China has built a green manufacturing system encompassing green factories, industrial parks, supply chains and products, embedding environmentally friendly development into entire industrial processes. To date, China has cultivated 6,430 green factories, 491 green industrial parks and 727 green supply chain enterprises, while promoting over 40,000 types of green products. Among these, the output value of green factories now accounts for 20 percent of China's total manufacturing output, up from 9 percent in 2020. The energy and water consumption per unit of industrial output in green industrial parks is only two-thirds and one-fourth of the national average, respectively, with their average solid waste utilization rate exceeding 95 percent.

An increasing number of Chinese companies are incorporating green design and procurement into supply chain management, driving upstream and downstream partners to adopt green upgrades. Meanwhile, some industry leaders are pioneering carbon footprint management across product life cycles.

Contributing green transition solutions

By providing high-quality green technologies and products, Chinese manufacturing offers practical pathways for the global green transition. The nation's renewable energy products are exported to over 200 countries and regions, meeting more than 80 percent of global demand for photovoltaic modules and 70 percent for wind power equipment. This helps nations around the world, especially developing countries, access clean, reliable and affordable energy.

For instance, from 2021 to 2024, China produced approximately 15.6 trillion kW of photovoltaic modules, helping the world generate about 3.2 trillion kilowatt-hours of green electricity and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by roughly 2.54 billion tons. China has also collaborated with more than 100 countries and regions on green energy projects, delivering high-quality equipment and affordable green power. These initiatives demonstrate the tangible impact of Chinese solutions in helping other developing nations address climate change while fostering economic growth.

Systematic advancement of green transition

At a time when global climate governance is encountering setbacks and some nations are backsliding on their commitments, China's decision to embark on a green and low-carbon transition for its manufacturing sector serves as a powerful demonstration of its drive to foster new quality productive forces and pursue high-quality development. This choice also stands as a solemn pledge to global climate governance.

In his video speech at the United Nations Climate Summit 2025 in September, President Xi announced China's new NDC targets. China will, by 2035, reduce economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions by 7 percent to 10 percent from peak levels, striving to do better; increase the share of non-fossil fuels in total energy consumption to over 30 percent; expand the installed capacity of wind and solar power to over six times 2020 levels, striving to bring the total to 3.6 billion kW; scale up the total forest stock volume to over 24 billion cubic meters; make new energy vehicles the mainstream in the sales of new vehicles; expand the National Carbon Emissions Trading Market to cover major high-emission sectors; and basically establish a climate adaptive society.

China's new NDC targets demonstrate a pragmatic and actionable ambition for emission reductions. With manufacturing spearheading the green transformation of our economy and society, China's industrial strategy is now honing in on a systematic transition. Moving forward, efforts will focus on three key fronts — modernizing the industrial system, developing green supply chains and deepening international collaboration.

Building a green industrial system

Traditional industries remain a crucial pillar of Chinese manufacturing. Their transformation and upgrading require systematic adjustments to product mixes, energy consumption patterns and raw material structures, along with the re-engineering of industrial processes. Particular emphasis will be placed on scaling-up the application of innovative technologies in sectors such as steel, building materials and chemicals.

Industries will capitalize on the vast market opportunities created by the green and low-carbon transition. Efforts will be made to vigorously develop green and low-carbon sectors, increasing the share of industries like environmental protection, new energy equipment and NEVs.

Simultaneously, to meet the demands of the energy revolution and industrial transformation under the ""dual carbon"" goals, China will strategically plan and deploy future-oriented energy and manufacturing industries, including hydrogen energy, energy storage, bio-manufacturing and carbon capture, utilization and storage.

Building a green supply chain

China is committed to embedding green development principles throughout the entire manufacturing chain — from raw material procurement to production, sales and recycling. China will drive large enterprises to implement green and low-carbon supply chain enhancement initiatives, leveraging green procurement as a guiding force. Through activities such as green audits and supply chain financing, the initiative will support upstream and downstream suppliers in adopting green upgrades and managing carbon footprints.

The country will also promote the cultivation of green factories, steadily increase the procurement share from green factory suppliers and strengthen international cooperation in building green supply chains. Furthermore, China will advance circular economy models, facilitate the development of reverse logistics networks that manage the flow of goods from their final destination back to the point of origin for purposes like recycling, and encourage businesses to establish recycling systems for key products such as batteries.

Enhancing international cooperation

Adhering to the principle of extensive consultations and joint contributions, China will leverage bilateral and multilateral cooperation mechanisms to deepen collaboration in green technologies, equipment, trade and standards.

The country will encourage competitive Chinese enterprises in photovoltaics, wind power, lithium batteries and new energy vehicles to expand globally and to invest in and develop green energy projects in countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative and beyond, while promoting green infrastructure and transportation solutions. China will also actively participate in shaping international green and low-carbon regulations and strengthen its capacity to implement international conventions.

An ancient Chinese proverb reads: ""Those who persevere in action will achieve their goals; those who steadfastly journey will reach their destination,"" which echoes the universal spirit of the Western adage: ""Actions speak louder than words.""

History rewards those who take concrete actions. No matter how the international landscape shifts, ""Made in China"" remains committed to honoring its pledge of building a community with a shared future for mankind through tangible green initiatives. China will champion the exchange of green technologies, promote the global alignment of green standards, facilitate the supply of green products and share opportunities in the green market. By forming the world's greatest joint force for green development, the country can collectively advance toward a future that is greener, more inclusive and sustainable.

The US infrastructure market is enjoying a surge of interest, with more firms seeking access largely due to the country’s strong artificial intelligence position. The North American economic giant is home to many of the early leaders in the space, as well as heavy government backing for the technology.

Of course, developing and maintaining a competitive edge is not easy. But some of the more established firms are benefiting from tried and tested approaches. 3i, which just celebrated its 80th anniversary, is one such firm. Rob Collins, managing partner for 3i North American Infrastructure Partners, explores what makes the US such an attractive market, as well as which opportunities stand out strongest.

How would you characterise the current investment landscape for infrastructure in the US?

Generally speaking, since the pandemic, US infrastructure has become a more expensive market to invest in. There are a lot more fishermen in the pond, so to speak, and this is driving up prices.

The opportunity set we most prefer is found in the mid-market, which is a less competitive space than the mega-market. We focus our efforts on identifying under-the-radar infrastructure opportunities that we can support or put in place high-quality management teams to execute on our investment thesis. 3i has been investing in the mid-market since 1945, and has built up a longstanding track record over that period.

Which sectors are attracting the most attention?

Clearly, digital infrastructure has gained the most attention since the pandemic. This has been most prominent across fibre broadband providers and most recently data centre developers, resulting in higher valuations across the board.

We believe that digital infrastructure is attractive and have invested through differentiated strategies such as backing an experienced team to build cell towers or being very selective in the fibre markets we want to go after. While traditional data centre development is less attractive to us, we are exploring adjacent industries such as power generation and other services that will benefit from the same industry tailwinds.

In addition to digital, we’re focused on three additional sectors right now: transportation, environmental services and social infrastructure. Some of our peers will define social infrastructure assets differently, so it’s worth clarifying that we have a wide-span aperture to this area. Our ambition to invest in social infrastructure has led us towards businesses related to food and agriculture production or leasing of equipment, which support other essential services.

How important is sustainability to investment decisions?

ESG is an important part of our process and something we, as a firm, have taken seriously for a long time. In 2008, 3i acquired SLR Consulting, the largest ESG consulting firm in Europe. We held on to the investment in SLR for a decade, which helped us firmly embed ESG criteria in our investment committee processes over almost the last 20 years.

The way in which we champion ESG considerations in our investments is evident in several of our holdings, such as EC Waste. This is the largest vertically integrated provider of solid-waste services in Puerto Rico. The company is also the only provider of 100 percent US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) compliant, regulated and permitted waste disposal on the island.

With our help, EC Waste has made significant investments in its infrastructure and operations technology through sustainable waste practices and continuing to exceed US EPA compliance. Doing so has had a meaningful impact on improving drinking-water quality in Puerto Rico.

This is also important work because the main competition for EC Waste is illegal solid-waste disposal that’s unregulated and can severely contaminate the groundwater through toxic leachate without properly regulated EPA landfill permits. Our work, and consideration of ESG criteria in our investment decisions, is continuing to enhance the quality of drinking water in Puerto Rico, while growing the investment performance of the company.

What are the biggest challenges investors face in the US market?

In terms of finding businesses that perform an essential service, and that have sustainable barriers to entry with demonstrated and durable cashflows, we have a wide lens on identifying such opportunities. The challenge is finding businesses that meet those criteria and are also recession resistant.

An example I would give is Smarte Carte, which is our airport-concession business. For over 50 years, this business has been a key player in North American logistics, providing customers with products like luggage solutions and secure storage in over 300 airports and other locations globally (including 97 of the top 100 airports in the US). In 2017, we invested in Smarte Carte after identifying the company as having the same revenue risk as owning a stake in an airport.

The pandemic demonstrated the most severe downside case of any underwriting model and temporarily paralysed air travel. However, we were pleased to see Smarte Carte not just survive covid but really thrive throughout that period and beyond. Now, international airlines have increased flights, seat capacity, pilot training and new-plane purchases.

As evidence of core-risk infrastructure, Smarte Carte was designated by the US Treasury Department as an essential-service company, and the only business selected in the US aviation-value chain that wasn’t an airport or airline. The company was able to overcome the challenges of that severe economic downturn through optimising pricing and managing costs.

Since then, we’ve worked with Smarte Carte to expand its operations to more locations and geographies. This was while helping introduce the business to the infrastructure-lending market (for the first time in its history) and raising several successful rounds of financing on attractive terms.

How can managers differentiate themselves when investing?

Since we were founded in 1945 to help reconstruct the UK after World War II, 3i has been building businesses. In fact, our 3i name stands for Investors In Industry. From the beginning, we’ve invested in infrastructure by identifying best-in-class management teams and partnering with them to realise the full potential of each investment. We also have decades of value-add private equity experience that we leverage throughout our infrastructure underwriting and asset management processes.

We’re also differentiated thanks to our global network of operating partners, which we call our Business Leaders Network (BLN). We’ve been cultivating this network for the last 40 years and actively leverage these relationships to bring industry-leading expertise to our holdings when they need it.

For another example during the pandemic, with Smarte Carte we really relied on a 3i BLN operating partner we put on the company board – Greg Hart, retired COO at United Airlines – to help us navigate that challenging time for the aviation industry.

Going into the pandemic we were prepared, much like the major US airports were, for a complete 90-day domestic airport shutdown. This involved taking a fresh look at expense management and putting in place availability payments with airport partners to help the company perform during that economic downturn.

How do you see opportunities evolving?

Looking ahead, we’re seeking businesses in the US that fit our criteria and play into the AI revolution. Whether that’s power generation or providing support services to operating data centres, we’re finding businesses connected to AI’s growth story. This is similar to the way Smarte Carte gave us great exposure to the aviation value chain, with the same revenue risk of owning an entire airport.

The AI investment theme is deservedly getting a huge amount of attention and disruption concern. But I see this disruptive technology as more exciting than challenging to infrastructure investing. Ironically, we can use AI itself to identify AI infrastructure businesses. This is making for a really exciting time. AI will be transformational and disruptive in virtually every industry, and infrastructure perhaps has the most to benefit.

How are geopolitical events and domestic politics impacting US infrastructure investing?

There’s a lot of dynamic change right now with respect to global geopolitical events and US politics specifically, which naturally provides challenges and opportunities.

Encouragingly, though, most domestic US infrastructure investments still enjoy broad and very consistent bipartisan support. Regional Rail is an example of this. The company is a short-line rail platform that we acquired in 2019. Regional Rail has been running since 2007 and provides freight transportation, car storage and transloading services across the US and Western Canada, spanning over 875 miles of track.

Covid hit less than a year after we first invested in Regional Rail. Fortunately, both Republican and Democratic states continued to provide grants for rail expansion, as this mode of transport played a critical role in getting the economy back up and running. And since our initial investment in three railroads, we’ve supported Regional Rail in acquiring 14 additional railroads, further strengthening and expanding its presence in the US and Canada.

The pandemic also greatly expanded the definition of core-risk infrastructure, and such investments were thoroughly tested throughout the economic downturn. However, one of the benefits of that two-year period was it really helped us further identify downside risk in our investments, making them even more recession resistant.",https://media.infrastructureinvestor.com/uploads/2025/11/P87.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 21:58:55.445603

Collaboration, from customizing workforce training to preparing shovel-ready sites, has nourished North Carolina’s life-sciences industry for more than 40 years. New programs ensure that support will continue into the future.

Fujifilm Biosciences opened one of North America’s largest commercial-scale cell culture factories in September. The more than $3 billion investment measures 1 million square feet and will employ 750 people by year’s end. It’s expected to add 300,000 square feet when it reaches capacity in 2028 and employ 1,400 by 2031. “North Carolina is creating the future of biotech, and Fujifilm is an industry leader,” Gov. Josh Stein said at the ribbon cutting. “This overall project will grow our state’s economy by $4.7 billion over the next decade.”

Growth was a pillar of Research Triangle Park’s master plan in 1984, when state leaders began investing in the state’s future economy. Traditional manufacturing — tobacco products, textiles and furniture — was declining. “North Carolina’s leaders realized that genetic engineering and other new technologies from bioscience research labs had enormous potential,” says Mark Phillips, N.C. Biotechnology Center vice president of statewide operations and executive director of its eastern regional office in Greenville. “They also knew that technology could transform some of North Carolina’s largest industries, notably agriculture and medicine.”

Fujifilm is the latest in a steady stream of life-sciences companies that have invested in North Carolina. More than 840 of these companies do business here and employ 75,000 people, according to N.C. Biotechnology Center. Include the 2,500 businesses that support this industry, and employment swells to 225,000 statewide. Growing the industry, which made more than $10 billion in investments last year alone, is a community effort.

North Carolina’s biomanufacturing corridor stretches from Winston-Salem’s Innovation Quarter, which is home to more than 90 companies and 3,600 employees, to the BioPharma Cresent, which arcs through Edgecombe, Johnston, Nash, Pitt and Wilson counties. The latter has been called one of the East Coast’s largest biopharma manufacturing concentrations.

It employs more than 10,000 people and continues to grow. Six projects, representing more than $6.2 billion in investments, were announced last year.

Scott Ralls is president of Wake Technical Community College. It’s his latest post in a career with the N.C. Community College System that stretches nearly three decades. He has watched the biotechnology industry grow during that time, and he says its recent spurt is the culmination of years of hard work and investment. Those efforts have built a business-friendly environment that’s filled with shovel-ready sites, a falling corporate tax, and rail, road and air connections to consumers around the world. And there’s plenty of mechanics in place to ensure companies have the workforce they need to succeed.

Wake Tech serves about 75,000 students across its eight campuses. “One of the things the community colleges and universities attempt to do is to keep scaling to support our new and existing industries,” Ralls says. “Today, we have four times the number of students in biotechnology programs than we did four years ago and a myriad programs we didn’t

have before.”

Ralls and his team train, upskill and reskill workers. That’s done through traditional courses and training tuned to each company’s exact needs. The college partnered with CSL Seqirus, Fujifilm and Eli Lilly, for example, to create the country’s first eight-month program for training advanced maintenance technicians. And it collaborates with Amgen to provide training programs for its recent $1.5 billion investment in Holly Springs. Amgen also sponsors a co-laboratory at Wake Tech’s RTP campus, where technologists and industry professionals collaborate on innovations.

The community college system’s customized workforce training is available to existing businesses, too, and it’s often offered before the first dirt is turned for new locations and expansions. “We actually get involved with proposals when companies begin making the decisions about when to locate here,” Ralls says. NCEdge, for example, develops training solutions that address the participating company’s immediate challenges and prepare it for the future.

Collaborations between companies and colleges are becoming more common. “We have established a brand-new Lilly Center for Science and Technology, and next August we’re opening Fujifilm Hall on our new campus in Apex,” Ralls says. “Our biopharma partners work with us on apprenticeship programs, and that wasn’t happening four years ago.”

Partnerships across the 58-college system increase capacity. Wake Tech and Durham Technical Community College launched RTP Bio. It unifies the talent pipeline for the industry. “We have this notion that our economic development partners are part of an ecosystem,” Ralls says. “But to me, it is really a community. I’m very close with my colleagues at other community colleges, NC State University and our industry partners, and it feels like we’re all building it together.”",https://images.businessnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LifeSciences_main_image_web.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 21:59:14.485469

The Terrapins are using chitin, the chemical that makes crustacean casings hard, to form a biodegradable electrolyte, according to an Instagram post from the World Economic Forum. By using it in a battery, the experts may have created a circularly produced power pack for electric vehicles and other tech.

""Now we can 'eat ze water bugs' and use their skeletal remains for energy!"" one charismatic viewer commented.

And, they aren't far off the mark. Research from the Chemical Engineering Journal, published in ScienceDirect, reported that up to 8.8 million tons of shrimp, lobster, and crab shell waste are made each year. Much of it comes from the restaurant industry.

The Maryland team can turn recycled chitin from those shells into a degradable electrolyte, one of the key components of a battery. Adding zinc enables chemistry that astoundingly maintains 99.7% of its capacity after 400 charge/discharge cycles, according to the post.

If successfully scaled, the innovation could limit invasive mining for lithium and other hard-to-gather and costly materials in common packs.

For its part, chitin is abundant. The University of Connecticut reported that 100 billion tons of the biological polymer are naturally made each year. Researchers elsewhere are experimenting with it as the base for plastic-free products.

The Instagram post shows phones, drones, and EVs as everyday products that could be powered by the shell-based packs.

What's more, the battery can be broken down by microbes in less than half a year, compared to the hundreds of years it can take common lithium-ion components to degrade, per the World Economic Forum. And, zinc from the shell packs can be reclaimed and used again for the same purpose.

Some commenters took issue with harvesting crustaceans as part of the process.

""How is [it] sustainable to kill millions of crabs [for] batteries? This is insane!"" a viewer wrote.

But the World Wildlife Fund reported that three billion people rely on seafood as a protein, so shell waste is likely inevitable. Putting it to use keeps it from contributing to methane-producing landfill trash that adds to our planet's warming. Most of the world's excess heat is trapped in the ocean, harming sea life, according to the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration. So, the impact of cleaner batteries could benefit future shellfish if scaled.

One of the best ways to help limit heat-trapping air pollution is to add home solar to your electricity plan. Solar panels with a battery backup can help you reduce or eliminate your electricity costs while ensuring your lights stay on during outages.

The Cool Down's Solar Explorer can match you with trusted partners that will compare quotes, find an installer, and help you secure tax breaks that expire on Dec. 31, saving up to $10,000 in upfront costs.

The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) notes that in the first three quarters of 2025, sales have skyrocketed — with 1.2 million EVs sold — more than the entire previous year.
The increase in sales is largely due to automakers making their EVs more affordable and expanding electrification across new models.
In 2015, only 25 EV models existed, compared with 113 in 2025.

The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) notes that in the first three quarters of 2025, sales have skyrocketed — with 1.2 million EVs sold — more than the entire previous year.

The increase in sales is largely due to automakers making their EVs more affordable and expanding electrification across new models. According to the ICCT, 68% of EVs are now priced at under $50,000. In 2015, only 25 EV models existed, compared with 113 in 2025.

The ICCT states that ""consumer appetite continues to grow,"" noting that recent surveys show a majority of respondents are interested in making an EV their next vehicle.

Still, many automakers are holding back from investing in EVs. The ICCT reports that companies are hesitating because of market uncertainty, rising costs, shifting regulations, and concerns about consumer demand.

A shift toward vehicle electrification benefits consumers by introducing new models at more affordable prices. EVs do not need gas and typically require less maintenance, which can significantly reduce ownership costs and customer dissatisfaction.

As EVs continue to outnumber combustion vehicles, prices are expected to keep dropping, making them a more affordable option. This may also encourage consumers to electrify their lifestyles further by looking into solar energy to power their homes and vehicles.

EVs are also a far more environmentally friendly option because they lack tailpipes that release dirty, polluting gases that contribute to the warming of our planet.

To further increase affordability, a startup, Ateios Systems, has come up with a process that coats electrodes for faster battery manufacturing. This allows batteries to be produced more quickly to ramp up EV production.

Corporations are also teaming up to strengthen the battery supply chain. Epsilon Advanced Materials and Phillips 66 are partnering to produce key graphite materials inside the U.S., rather than relying on foreign sources that are vulnerable to tariffs and export restrictions.

It is evident that automakers are working hard to reduce the cost of EVs. Jeremy Short, chief engineer for the GM Bolt, told Fast Company, ""We wanted to get that under-$30,000 number.""

In a rare instance of bipartisan alarm, Republican-chaired committees in the House and Senate announced that they have launched inquiries into an explosive Washington Post report alleging Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had given a spoken order to “kill everybody” aboard a vessel carrying suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean. The occupants included two people who had survived an initial missile strike on the vessel and were seen “clinging” to the wreckage.

“We take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question,” the leaders of the House Armed Services Committee said in a joint statement on Friday.

The decision to extend the payments to December 2026 follows strong uptake of the KAP since it commenced on 1 July this year.

KAP, an expansion of the successful New Energy Apprenticeship Program (NEAP), has seen more than 6,600 apprentices commencing under the housing construction stream, while more than 15,400 new energy apprentices have started training under the NEAP and KAP.

Employers will continue to receive $5,000 for engaging apprentices in KAP priority occupations for another year, while apprentices will continue to receive $10,000.

The changes to the incentive payments follow recommendations from the Strategic Review of the Incentive System and support the Albanese Government's broader plan to meet net zero targets and to build 1.2 million homes by 2029.

From 1 January next year, new apprenticeships in priority occupations that are not eligible for KAP funding will receive incentive payments of $5,000 per apprenticeship. This support will be shared equally - with $2,500 for the apprentice and $2,500 for the employer.

Incentive payments for apprenticeships that commence prior to 1 January 2026 won't be affected by these changes.

This payment is among a suite of government support measures for apprentices, including:

Australian Apprenticeship Support Loans of up to $25,983 (2025-26) to help with the costs of undertaking an apprenticeship in priority occupations

The Living Away From Home Allowance to help those who need to move away from home to take up an apprenticeship opportunity.

Other supports available for apprenticeships include the Apprentice Connect Australia Providers for advice and assistance accessing services, Free TAFE and the Building Women's Careers Program.

The Australian Skills Guarantee Procurement Connected Policy is also creating more employment opportunities for apprentices and trainees by including national targets for apprentices as a requirement for Commonwealth infrastructure and ICT projects.

Quotes attributable to Minister for Skills and Training, Andrew Giles:

""The Albanese Government recognises that employers play a key role in getting more apprentices into critical housing construction and clean energy jobs. This includes carpenters and joiners, plumbers and electricians.

""Changes to the incentive system have been carefully calibrated to target support towards housing and new energy occupations, ensuring a skills pipeline in these nation-building industries.

""The Government continues to provide a range of supports for apprentices because we acknowledge the importance of growing a skills-based workforce ready for the future.""

Quotes attributable to Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Amanda Rishworth:

""The Albanese Government is supporting apprentices in priority occupations who are literally building Australia's future.

,Louisiana Environment,2025-11-30 23:02:21+00:00,The Advocate,"Faimon Roberts: Carbon capture opponents won't go away, and it's scrambling conservative politics","Faimon Roberts, FAIMON A. ROBERTS III, Staff columnist, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/opinion/faimon-roberts-carbon-capture-opponents-wont-go-away-and-it-s-scrambling-conservative-politics/article_8a222ce6-150a-5a5b-bf2a-87f335dfc83e.html,"The carbon capture insurgency just won’t die.
Some conservatives say carbon capture is unneeded because climate change is overblown.
Earlier this year, it seemed that those who favored expansion of carbon capture had the upper hand.
Jeff Landry issued a moratorium on new carbon capture permits.
Not surprisingly, carbon capture boosters were not pleased.","The carbon capture insurgency just won’t die.

Last week, a group called Save My Louisiana filed a lawsuit in Baton Rouge, arguing that the process amounts to a “egregious and overt trampling” of property rights.

And on Nov. 17, the Vernon Parish Police Jury reversed an earlier decision and passed a resolution opposing the practice.

These latest salvos are an indication of how carbon capture has scrambled conservative and Republican Party politics in this state, because much of the opposition to the process comes not from left-wing environmental justice types (though many of them oppose it, too), but from rock-ribbed conservatives in some of the reddest regions of Louisiana.

To understand what is going on here, it’s important to know what exactly is being proposed. Carbon capture and sequestration is an industrial process by which CO2 and greenhouse gases produced as byproducts are captured and stored rather than released into the air.

Proponents, including industry and business groups, argue that this makes production greener by releasing less CO2. They also contend that the storage, which typically happens thousands of feet underground and is performed by something known as a carbon injection well, is safe, and that there is no danger of the CO2 leaching upward through the ground into water supplies or to the surface.

But the opponents, including many landowners, aren’t buying it.

They worry about the potential for pipeline failures, or that the carbon could find its way into local aquifers. Some conservatives say carbon capture is unneeded because climate change is overblown.

Many of those who oppose it are clustered in the central part of the state, where there are a number of proposed carbon storage areas.

Earlier this year, it seemed that those who favored expansion of carbon capture had the upper hand. Following a 2024 federal government decision that gave the state “primacy” in permitting carbon capture projects, the Legislature rejected Republican-authored bills that would have given local governments the right to veto injection wells, though lawmakers did tighten some rules in landowners’ favor.

But the opposition wouldn’t go away. Last month, in response, Gov. Jeff Landry issued a moratorium on new carbon capture permits. A handful already in the process were not affected.

""Local government and citizens, through their local government, have a right to be heard to ensure safety, transparency, and local input,"" Landry wrote in his order.

Not surprisingly, carbon capture boosters were not pleased.

The move sends the “wrong message,” said David Cresson, of the Louisiana Chemical Association. Others warned of “obstacles” the state was putting in the way of expansion.

So what we have here is a pitched fight between, essentially, two different conservative constituencies who are both dug in.

On the one hand, you have business, industry and economic development types who see the potential for growth.

On the other, citizens and officials in many of Louisiana’s reddest parishes who, in a notable development, echo many of the concerns that environmentalists have uttered for years — and also assert traditional conservative values like property rights and local control.

It’s too early to see how it will all play out. But if this oil and gas state ever turns on its biggest and most powerful industry, analysts may point to carbon capture as the spark that ignited the flame.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/a2/8a222ce6-150a-5a5b-bf2a-87f335dfc83e/6927760dadc22.preview.jpg?crop=1662%2C873%2C0%2C187&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-12-01 02:59:43.286652

In 2024, the EPA reduced the allowable levels of soot 2.5 microns and larger from 12 micrograms per liter to nine.","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rolled back regulations on air polluters twice recently by exempting steel plants from rules governing coal-fired smokestacks and by asking a federal court to drop the 2024 changes to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for fine particles of soot.

“Coal-fired power plants nearly destroyed the Adirondack Park’s forests, lakes and ponds with acid rain,” Adirondack Council Clean Air Specialist and Director of Communications John F. Sheehan said in a press release. “Things are starting to get better here after 30 years of pollution reductions. We don’t want to undo this win and once again lose trees and fish.

“The 2024 soot standards were 25% better at protecting public health than the old standard, which now goes back into effect. Rolling back National Ambient Air Quality Standards undermines public health and safety and will have lasting economic impacts for the country. The nation saves $20 in public health costs for every dollar spent cutting air pollution such as soot, ozone and sulfur dioxide.”

The Adirondack Park contains one of the largest, intact temperate forests in the world and is home to approximately 130,000 year-round residents.

The executive order, issued Nov. 21, said steel makers would be exempt from former President Joe Biden-era standards designed to prevent future pollution increases at all coal-fired smokestacks. All of the steel plants exempt were already meeting the new standards.

This past week, the EPA filed a motion in the U.S. District Court saying it doesn’t intend to enforce the updated national soot standards.

In 2024, the EPA reduced the allowable levels of soot 2.5 microns and larger from 12 micrograms per liter to nine. Several states and industries sued the EPA to overturn the rule.

Members of the Student Action Committee of the NJ Chapter of the Sierra Club recently launched a thrift store at Princeton Farmer’s Market at Hinds Plaza to raise funds for the Club’s Political Action Committee (PAC), in support of Mikie Sherill’s successful bid to become governor of New Jersey.

Our action tells two stories: one of polyester and other nondegradable materials saved from the landfill, and another of students choosing to support a political election.

The funds were raised the sustainable way: through recycling. Friends, families, and neighbors across the state rallied behind us by donating gently worn clothing, spreading word of our mission, and providing a community level market with the potential to thrive. Clothing items were priced from $3–$15, and Princeton community members and beyond excitedly shopped at our thrift shop, turning closets into catalysts for change! Our goal was not only to support a PAC but also to protect the planet.

Why Thrifting?

In recent years, fast fashion—often unsustainable and polluting—has led to large amounts of clothing being discarded. Much of it could have been reused or recycled. The fast-fashion trend has encouraged people to purchase more clothing than is truly needed. This clothing is often cheaply made, worn just a few times, and then thrown away. This cycle harms the environment in ways that may not always be obvious.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in 2018 around 11.3 million tons of clothing, footwear, and linens were sent to landfills in the United States, and about 85% of all textiles were landfilled or incinerated. That’s a lot of waste.

According to the United Nations Environment Programme and allied sources, the fashion and textile industry is one of the world’s largest consumers of water (often cited as second only to agriculture) and is responsible for roughly 8% to 10% of global greenhouse‑gas emissions.

The materials in many of these clothes are also harmful. For example, polyester releases tiny plastic particles when washed. These end up in rivers, oceans, and even the food chain. It is estimated that washing synthetic clothes releases up to 500,000 tons of microfibers into the ocean each year, roughly equivalent to billions of plastic bottles.

Even donated clothes may end up in landfills. A more effective solution is buying secondhand clothes, known as thrifting. Thrifting lessens the environmental impact and supports local shops and charities that depend on donations. Another option is recycling or upcycling old clothes by turning them into something new instead of discarding them.

If more people bought secondhand items, repaired their clothing, or donated responsibly, less clothing would end up in landfills, and fewer harmful chemicals would pollute the environment.

Places We Can Sustainably Shop

Frequently recommended thrift stores in New Jersey include myUnique, on 2nd Street in Westfield, and Gift To Earth, at 712 Clinton Ave. in South Plainfield. Shoppers also prefer Goodwill for a more classic thrifting experience. It has many locations.

Places to Donate Clothes

Goodwill locations in New Jersey accept clothing donations, and unsold items at their stores are in turn donated to other organizations. Donating to local thrift stores and churches can ensure that donated clothing is distributed to people who live near you. Some other organizations that take clothing donations are Salvation Army and Planet Aid

Global Efforts

Some solutions to textile waste focus on turning discarded clothes into useful new products and materials. Fiber materials are taken from used garments and repurposed into new textiles, cleaning cloths, and construction materials. Mechanical textile recycling has been practiced for over 250 years. This involves physically separating fabrics and fibers for reuse. However, this often results in low-quality materials.

A more recent option is chemical recycling, which breaks down fabric into polymer building materials, although the downsides of this are concerning, such as energy use, emissions, and chemical pollution. There are also biotech solutions being explored at MIT that involve developing proteins to break down the polymers in fabrics so textiles can decompose in as little as two weeks.

Policy-based solutions in the United States, such as California’s Responsible Textile Recovery Act of 2024 (SB 707), are being implemented. This is an extended producer responsibility (EPR) law designed to hold fashion brands accountable for the entire lifecycle of their products, including waste management.

New York and Washington also are proposing EPR bills. Moreover, clothing companies such as Patagonia and H&M encourage consumers to trade in used clothes for credit.

What More Can We Do?

Fast fashion is harming our planet, but small, intentional choices are our building blocks for sustainable consumption.

Supporting local thrift stores reduces waste while strengthening our communities. Spreading awareness and educating those around us can also make a large difference. If we make responsible clothing choices, we can mitigate fast fashion’s impact and promote a cleaner, more sustainable future.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-30 19:59:19.645675

Money spent on nuclear power in Maine wouldn’t stay here, Lawrence said, unlike local, renewable energy development such as offshore wind.","As the Trump administration works to dismantle renewable energy initiatives and boost oil, coal and natural gas, states such as Maine with aggressive climate initiatives will be largely on their own to maintain momentum. Or maybe shift gears.

That’s why the makeup of the Maine Legislature and the occupant of the governor’s office after the 2026 election cycle will be so consequential.

While the 132nd Legislature will reconvene in January and the who’s who of 2027 is unknowable now, the key issues lawmakers will face were foreshadowed earlier this month during a panel discussion at the Maine State Chamber of Commerce’s Energy Summit in Portland.

One takeaway is that energy affordability — under mounting stress chiefly from rising electricity prices — will be a litmus test for most any climate policy or spending decisions. That puts pressure on Democrats specifically. They have controlled both the Legislature and the executive branch since 2019, and have thus set Maine’s energy agenda, embodied in the state’s climate action plan.

Another takeaway is that, although Democratic and Republican legislators have different visions of how to make energy more affordable, they seem to have retained the rapport necessary for dialogue, a value largely gone from Washington in the Trump era.

The policy outlook panel hosted by the chamber featured four lawmakers with deep institutional knowledge, gained from their years on the Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee: Sen. Mark Lawrence, D-York, the Senate co-chair; Rep. Melanie Sachs, D-Freeport, the House co-chair; Rep. Steve Foster, R-Dexter, ranking committee member; and Sen. Matt Harrington R-York, the assistant Senate Republican leader.

Solar policy has been among the most divisive issues handled by the committee. Maine has wrestled in recent years to adjust financial incentives, championed by Democrats, that unleashed a wave of solar development but proved too generous and created a multi-million-dollar burden for electric customers. A recent law, L.D. 1777, restructured the incentives and set the stage for designing a successor program.

During the panel discussion, Sachs and Lawrence expressed satisfaction with the reforms, with Lawrence saying solar policy is now “in the rearview mirror.” But Harrington and Foster disagreed, saying the changes didn’t go far enough. Whether solar stays in the rearview mirror will depend on whether Democrats remain in the driver’s seat, or if a suit filed this week by the solar industry to block the law gets traction.

On the challenge of balancing affordability with clean energy goals, Sachs said Maine can do both. And Lawrence suggested Maine can expand its renewable energy sectors to export more power and boost economic growth. But their Republican colleagues see it differently.

Referring to a large wind farm in Bingham, near his district, Foster noted it was built to satisfy out-of-state contracts and didn’t directly benefit Maine electric customers. More pointedly, Harrington questioned the entire premise of building clean energy projects to meet “our climate goals.”

Harrington continued: “I do not share in those goals. The last six years in the Maine Legislature, the only focus has been on ‘their climate goals.’ There has been zero emphasis on affordability. And Maine people are feeling that so badly today.”

One step that could reduce electricity prices is lowering the wholesale cost of natural gas, which is used to generate half of New England’s electricity. The region doesn’t have enough pipeline capacity on the coldest days, and building new pipelines into southern New England could help lower costs and reduce price volatility. Public and political opposition in New York and Massachusetts, however, has kept more gas from coming north. That’s the primary reason most Maine electric customers will see their electricity supply rates rise next year.

Lamenting that, Foster spoke at length about the financial and climate emission benefits that natural gas brought to Maine paper mills after they converted from oil. He noted the political opposition occurring out of state, but offered no suggestion of how the Maine Legislature could influence it.

There’s a global effort to design small, less-expensive nuclear reactors that can be built in factories and assembled on site, although none yet exist in North America. Asked by the panel’s moderator to comment on the potential role of next-generation nuclear power, Harrington said it should be part of the energy conversation in Maine. He said a Maine law that requires voter approval of any effort to restore nuclear power here should be changed.

Lawrence, who along with Sachs had recently visited Ontario to learn about Canadian plans to build small modular reactors, said he wasn’t opposed to nuclear power. But the effort in Ontario is heavily subsidized by the government, he said, with job opportunities related to uranium mining, research and construction taking place in Canada.

Money spent on nuclear power in Maine wouldn’t stay here, Lawrence said, unlike local, renewable energy development such as offshore wind. He called nuclear power “an economic loser for the state of Maine.”

The panelists were asked to identify priorities for the upcoming legislative session. No surprise, the top issue was affordability. Harrington said affordability should be the only standard to work under, as opposed to the clean electricity standard now in state law that calls for greater shares of renewable power.

One hopeful sign that Maine lawmakers can work across party lines on affordability came in a closing remark from Lawrence, reflecting on his seven years working with Foster. It spoke to mutual respect, at a time when some lawmakers vilify their political opponents as personal adversaries.

“He’s very much a conscience,” Lawrence said of his Republican colleague, “when we Democrats are doing something too fast, too ambitious.”",https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/04/AP19218765527962.jpg?w=780,N,,2025-11-30 16:59:12.074505

The Trump Administration has published the maximum fair prices for covered drugs in the Medicare Drug Negotiation Program for initial price applicability year 2027; these 15 drugs in Part D were selected because of either high program spending or high beneficiary utilization.

The administration’s touted $12 billion in savings (an approximately 44-percent reduction in net Part D spending if the prices had been in place for 2024) are nearly double the initial year of savings under the Medicare Drug Negotiation Program.

While the savings seem significant, further analysis of the announcement identifies calculated inefficiencies, an overrepresentation of benefit, and the continued lack of evidence that any savings will truly materialize in Part D.

Introduction

On November 25, 2025, the Trump Administration announced the latest round of negotiated drugs under the Medicare Drug Negotiation Program established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The initial price applicability year (IPAY) 2027 announcement marks the second major wave of Medicare drug price negotiations, extending negotiated “maximum fair prices” (MFPs) to 15 high-spend or high-utilization Part D drugs starting January 1, 2027. These drugs accounted for roughly $42.5 billion in gross Part D spending in 2024 – about 15 percent of total program drug costs – and were used by about 5.3 million beneficiaries. The administration touted savings of $12 billion in net covered prescription drug costs, or approximately 44 percent lower aggregate net spending, if the MFPs had been in effect for 2024. For 2027, the administration estimated that people enrolled in Medicare prescription drug coverage would save $685 million in out-of-pocket costs under the MFPs. While seemingly impressive, these aggregated, theoretical savings based on retrospective data continue to tell only one aspect of the entire Medicare landscape.

CMS IPAY 2027 Announcement

Under the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) directly negotiates prices for high-expenditure, single-source Part D drugs lacking generic or biosimilar competition. For IPAY 2027, CMS finalized MFPs for 15 selected Part D drugs after a year-long negotiation process with manufacturers. The table below, from the CMS fact sheet announcing the MFPs, demonstrates the range of projected savings.

Source:

Headline Savings and Comparison to IPAY 2026

CMS’ 2027 estimates show larger aggregate savings in both absolute and percentage terms: $12 billion in net savings (44-percent reduction) excluding the coverage gap discount program (CGDP), and about $8.5 billion (36 percent) when CGDP is incorporated. Under the CGDP – or the Manufacturers Discount Program as it is now called – participating manufacturers are required to provide discounts on applicable drugs in the initial and catastrophic coverage phases of Part D. In other words, a wide-reaching discount program already resulting in beneficiary savings without the IRA MFPs. On the beneficiary side, CMS projects that, under the defined standard Part D benefit, enrollees could save an estimated $685 million in out-of-pocket costs in 2027 from these MFPs alone.

The IPAY 2027 figures are frequently contrasted with those from the first negotiation cycle, IPAY 2026, which involved 10 Part D drugs used for conditions such as diabetes, heart failure, autoimmune disease, and blood cancers. For the first round, CMS estimated that if the 2026 MFPs had applied in 2023, Medicare would have saved about $6 billion in net spending – roughly a 22 percent reduction – while beneficiaries were projected to save about $1.5 billion in out-of-pocket costs in 2026.

The second-year discounts are deeper on average than those in the first year, in part because the 2027 group includes very high-spend GLP-1s and oncology agents with substantial room between list prices and MFPs. Additionally, the absolute out-of-pocket gain to beneficiaries from MFPs alone is smaller than in 2026 because the broader Part D redesign (including the new out-of-pocket cap) is now doing much of the heavy lifting on catastrophic costs. The table below shows numerous calculations to demonstrate the “true” amount of the government-determined rebate. Note: t did not have sufficient data to assess average manufacturer rebates, and thus comparable numbers could not reliably be generated. Based on the calculations, some rebates may be impactful; others are clearly not huge sources of savings for either the government or beneficiaries.

Potential Implications for Beneficiaries

For individual Part D enrollees, the practical impact of these new MFPs will depend on benefit design, utilization, and interactions with other IRA changes.

Interaction with the Part D out-of-pocket cap: As of 2025, Part D enrollees face a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket drug spending (rising to $2,100 in 2026), after which they owe no additional cost sharing for covered Part D drugs. For heavy users of high-cost products such as GLP-1s or oral oncology drugs, this cap may already substantially limit spending; the MFPs then reduce the amount of cost sharing they incur before hitting the cap and may mean fewer people hit the cap in the first place.

Coinsurance versus copay designs: Beneficiaries in plans that charge coinsurance (a percentage of the drug’s price) should see a direct reduction in per-fill costs when the MFPs take effect, assuming the MFP is below the plan’s current net price. Those facing flat copays may see little or no immediate change if the plan keeps the same copay amount, even though the plan’s own liability falls. The magnitude of out-of-pocket savings from negotiation is inherently uncertain and will vary by plan design and beneficiary utilization.

Formulary coverage and access: A key structural component is that Part D plans are required to cover all selected drugs with MFPs, including all dosage forms and strengths, which may reduce the risk that a beneficiary finds a high-profile drug excluded from their plan or subject to unusually restrictive utilization management compared to non-selected competitors. CMS has indicated it will scrutinize tiering and management practices that could undermine access to selected drugs.

Distribution of gains: Because the IPAY 2027 list includes several specialty and high-cost products, savings will be concentrated among beneficiaries who use these specific drugs rather than spread evenly across all Part D enrollees. At the same time, program-level savings can exert downward pressure on premiums and on federal Part D spending over time, potentially benefiting a broader population indirectly.

Points of Confusion and Contention

Aggressive “negotiations” to address beneficiary needs

Outside of the IRA negotiations, the White House had long been signaling that drug pricing would be handled aggressively, with a mix of Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) rhetoric and tariff brinkmanship. The message to manufacturers and foreign governments has been: Accept lower prices, or face some combination of trade penalties, import restrictions, or regulatory pressure. That’s not a traditional negotiation over value; it’s a leverage campaign.

The IRA’s negotiation authority is just the domestic counterpart to these external tactics. MFN talk toward other countries says, “we’ll make you pay if you don’t give us your lowest price.” The IRA framework says to manufacturers, “we’ll tax you out of the Medicare market if you don’t sign the MFP contract.” This approach doesn’t build a principled, predictable pricing framework; it levies the threat of punishment to drag prices down in discrete skirmishes.

As noted in POLITICO, Chris Klomp, the Director of Medicare, stated this clearly:

The key factor in the second round of price negotiations was the administration’s willingness to walk away from the table if they didn’t reach a deal, said Chris Klomp, deputy administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which handled the talks.

“A true negotiation implies that you might not reach a negotiated outcome,” Klomp said.

Thus, framing the IPAY 2026 and IPAY 2027 rounds as “negotiations” obscures what’s really going on. The same posture that underlies MFN posturing and pharmaceutical tariff threats –naming and shaming manufacturers and threatening punitive penalties for headline-ready percentage cuts – has simply been imported into Medicare. The millions of beneficiaries that CMS is arguably responsible for representing have no say in the determination of an acceptable price, so the central decision-making process can’t be called a negotiation. It creates a blurred line between legitimate purchasing strategy and ad hoc economic coercion, and it makes it hard to argue that the resulting prices are the product of a thoughtful, evidence-based process rather than the latest move in a high-stakes game of chicken.

Any “value” created is narrow

On paper, the IPAY 2027 MFPs deliver several billion dollars a year in lower Medicare spending on a carefully curated list of high-spend drugs. But those “savings” are calculated relative to a baseline that assumes the old system – escalating list prices and opaque rebates – would have continued unchanged. There is still no serious accounting for how manufacturers will respond when a significant share of their Medicare revenue is capped by statute: higher prices in commercial markets, trimmed investment in follow-on indications, different launch strategies, or more aggressive contracting outside Medicare. Those downstream effects are invisible in the headline savings figure, but they are very real economic costs.

For beneficiaries, the purported benefits are muddled. The projected out-of-pocket savings sound impressive in aggregate, but they are narrowly concentrated among people taking a small set of drugs and sit on top of a redesigned Part D that would have reduced catastrophic exposure anyway. A sizable share of the “benefit” claimed through MFPs is arguably just double-counting: The out-of-pocket cap and restructured liability phases are doing most of the heavy lifting, while MFPs marginally lower the prices that feed into that benefit formula.

The graph below shows that the comparative impact of these “negotiations” is less than the market itself could drive. Only four of the 15 selected drugs (the graph omits Pomalyst due to sparse data) have an IRA rebate that outperforms the market. This is more than last year’s MFPs – which had no IRA rebates that out-performed the market – but it is not a ringing endorsement of the program’s success.

The Ever-present Mismatch of GLP-1 policy

As if the GLP-1 coverage decision-making process wasn’t convoluted enough, the gap between the semaglutide MFP for IPAY 2027 and the earlier, highly publicized GLP-1 “deal” is a useful case study in how ad hoc this policy environment has become. The administration has announced two different prices for the same medication that is intended to be administered in the same program. We now have two competing reference points:

a statutory MFP for semaglutide inside Part D, produced by the IRA’s statutory process and meant to apply across plans; and

a program-specific GLP-1 price, marketed as a breakthrough “deal,” that in some cases lands below, and in other cases above, the semaglutide MFP – depending on channel, indication, and details of the arrangement.

CMS has already announced that the separately negotiated GLP-1 deal will supersede the IRA MFP outcomes, which could support a narrative that the Medicare drug negotiation program is not a rational, rules-based anchor for the market, but instead is a stopgap for the price-setting endeavors being led by the White House. It tells patients and plans that there is no single “true” price for these drugs; there are multiple, politically-negotiated prices depending on where you sit. The result looks less like a principled, evidence-based pricing regime and more like a layered set of one-off bargains.

Conclusion

CMS’ long-awaited announcement of maximum fair prices for covered drugs in the Medicare Drug Negotiation Program closes one of the largest outstanding items on its 2025 regulatory agenda. The accompanying data, however, does not provide clear evidence of the benefits of the IRA Medicare drug negotiation program. While the savings seem significant, further analysis of the announcement identifies calculated inefficiencies, an overrepresentation of benefit, and the continued lack of hard evidence that any savings will truly materialize in Part D. The health care industry still has not experienced a world in which any MFP has been effectuated for Part D, and until this is the case, the impact of any MFPs remains theoretical and unsubstantiated.",https://www.americanactionforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MDNP-IPAY-2027.png,N,,2025-11-30 16:59:47.004501

Flagship BEV Taurus prime mover features innovative battery-swapping technology

Company to continue supporting hydrogen solutions with price reductions coming

At the company’s annual general meeting, shareholders voted strongly in favour of the name change which the company said reflects its expansion beyond hydrogen into a wider portfolio of clean energy technologies, mobility solutions and services.

While Pure One (proposed code: P1C) will continue to offer a strong line-up of hydrogen mobility products, its vehicle offering has also expanded into battery-electric solutions.

Importantly, this includes a battery-swap technology that is cheaper than diesel in both capex and maintenance.

This tech allows vehicle batteries to be quickly swapped out in minutes, which completely side-steps the biggest drawback of BEVs – namely the need for lengthy recharging times.

Highlighting this, the company is targeting a price point of $200,000 plus GST for its flagship Taurus battery-swap 6x4 prime mover – a highly competitive price point for a new prime mover in Australia.

The prime mover and the 8X4 rigid are both expected to be strong sellers as Pure One leverages its first-mover advantage as a leading supplier of clean energy vehicles for the commercial transport sector.

PH2 has also reiterated it will continue to support hydrogen solutions as input prices continue to decrease with improved product redesign and diversified supply channels.

To deliver on its market opportunity, Pure One is taking a strategic partnership approach – highlighted recently by a signed term sheet with Advanced Manufacturing Queensland for the supply, assembly and sale of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in Australia.

Diverse, ADR compliant fleet

Operating as Pure one, the company will offer customers a diverse fleet of clean technology commercial vehicles that have been designed from the ground up.

It provides a pathway to near-term cashflow with proven technology and the company notes a strong demand pipeline for BEV buses as passenger transport.

The company’s prime mover – 23t waste truck and buses compliant with Australian Design Rules – meet national standards for road vehicle safety, anti-theft and emissions.

Multiple vehicles are being built to meet a growing sales pipeline comprising multi-vehicle orders from large Australian industrial and construction customers.

In August 2025, Pure One secured more than $3m in new orders from commercial transport operators for its leading fleet of hydrogen fuel cell (HFC) vehicles.

These include two Taurus HFC prime movers ordered by Scott Lovatt Transport – a NSW- based company in Preston, southwest of Sydney – and a follow-up purchase order from construction major Heidelberg Materials Australia for a second HFC 8×4 concrete agitator rigid truck.

California-based truck distributor and leasing operator GTS Group has also sent the company a letter of intent for the purchase of Class 8 HFC tractor units along with a range of rigid trucks including 6X4 waste collection and 8X4 concrete mixer vehicles for its leasing customers.

The company has also been growing its exposure with agreements in place.

To meet these and future orders, Pure One has established manufacturing capacity capable of producing up to 200 hydrogen fuel cell or BEV vehicles per month.

The wetlands were constructed at Sycamore's Oliver Preserve and the Sam Shine Foundation Preserve. In the past, these areas were wetlands already, but they were part of the 87% of Indiana's similar ecosystems that were destroyed to make room for farmland and other developments.

While it might sound like a good thing to turn a marsh into a productive field, wetlands serve multiple important purposes, not just for wildlife, but also for humanity. They help filter and purify water, improving water quality for all the communities downstream.

They also store floodwaters, reducing the risk of flooding during heavy rain. They serve as breeding grounds for many important species and are recognized as some of the most productive ecosystems on Earth, according to the Republic.

Sycamore was pleased to add these two wetland areas to its over 11,000 acres of restored nature. It planted 12,500 native trees and will add over 4,000 native plant plugs by the end of the project.

US President Donald Trump’s “American Energy Dominance” policy is most often viewed through the lens of conservative priorities that favor fossil fuels, but that’s only part of the partisan political picture. Solar power has become an economic lifeline for k-12 school districts, putting it at odds with a long-standing effort to reshape the nation’s politically neutral system of public education.

The US Solar Industry Hearts Public Education

The conservative effort to undercut k-12 public schools has a long history. It stretches far back into the 20th century, when journalists drew media attention to the personal and corporate enrichment of self-proclaimed “school choice” activists.

The same political divide is evident today. While blue states continue to support traditional k-12 public schools as a universal right, a series of new “voucher” laws in red states has raised concerns that the quality of public education will suffer from lack of funding, alongside a fresh wave of book bans and other forms of censorship.

Against this backdrop, solar power has emerged as an ally on the side of public education. Solar projects provide local school districts with new tax dollars and relief from high electricity costs, providing a significant new pillar of support for districts that face stagnating or declining state and federal funding. The extra relief can help school districts manage new restrictions on funding, too. Local solar arrays also provide new opportunities for study in and out of the classroom, and they can serve as platforms for workforce training.

The Power Of Solar Power

One interesting example comes from Texas, where the global energy firm RWE just flipped the switch on its new Stoneridge Solar power plant. The facility is located in Milam County, which bills itself as a “peaceful retreat” between Austin and Waco.

The new power plant includes a 200 megawatt-hour battery energy storage system along with a solar capacity of 200 megawatts, adding another notch to RWE’s 11-gigawatt footprint in in the US. “The project is expected to generate millions in tax revenue for Milam County and the Thorndale Independent School District, with direct investments supporting first responders and educational initiatives,” RWE notes. The non-revenue assist to Milam County schools includes funds for renovating a local elementary school.

Like all school districts in Texas, Milam County faces pressure from rising costs and stagnating assistance from state policy makers. A years-long bottleneck in state funding finally broke last summer but the bulk of the new $85 billion funding went to increase teacher pay among the state’s 1,200 school systems, not to help offset rising operational costs. The new funds also failed to make a meaningful improvement in the all important metric of per-student allotment. Lawmakers did, however, approve a new $1 billion voucher program for non-public schools, a pet project of Texas Governor Greg Abbott.

Urban Solar Power: 20 Megawatts And Counting

Large, utility scale solar power plants are beyond the immediate reach of urban school districts, but even a modest rooftop array can provide significant economic and educational benefits. For big cities with numerous schools, the numbers add up.

In October, the education news organization Chalkbeat New York took stock of New York City’s school solar program. “With solar panels on 126 school building rooftops, New York City schools are central to the city and state’s green energy goals and generate the majority of solar energy installed on municipal buildings,” observed reporter Seyma Bayram.

All together, the rooftop arrays have a capacity of almost 20 megawatts, accounting for about 80% of the combined rooftop capacity of all municipal properties in the city.

In addition to the economic and climate action benefits of school solar power, Bayram also teased out yet another significant reason to install rooftop solar at public schools. “More than half of FEMA’s approximately 67,500 designated shelters nationwide are located in schools, making it more urgent to equip them with solar storage systems that can provide backup power during outages,” Bayram explained.

Bayram also cites Sara Ross, whose nonprofit UndauntedK12 advocates for clean energy in schools. “ School budgets are tight, and fundamentally, solar is the cheapest energy around, so when schools install solar, they can reduce their operating costs,” Ross told Chalkbeat. “That frees up more dollars to go back into their core mission.”

Solar can also be a revenue earner in some cases. When school buildings are idle for holidays, their electricity needs are lower, and they can sell unused solar power back to the grid.

On the down side, as part of the fallout from the Republicans’ new “OBBA” federal tax bill, the cost of installing school solar arrays is expected to shoot up by as much as 30% after the end of 2027, when the relevant tax credits are set to expire. New country-of-origin restrictions on solar panels and other equipment could also put a crimp in the school solar movement.

Nevertheless, New York City is not letting the solar power grass grow under its feet. According to Bayram, 90 additional school solar projects are already in motion and 200 more are in the review process.

K-12 Schools As Solar Ambassadors

Despite their radically different political profiles, Texas and New York State are both hotspots for solar development among other renewable energy activities. West Virginia provides another perspective on the school solar movement, considering its longstanding hostility to anything that interferes with fossil energy extraction.

Talk of converting West Virginia’s spent coal mines to solar farms goes back at least as far as 2011, with little to show for it. As of 2020 West Virginia hit the lowly #49 slot in a state-by-state ranking of installed solar capacity, at just 10.52 megawatts. Still, a trickle of new utility-scale power plants benefiting school districts continued to slip through, and the emerging Energy-as-a-Service industry has added another wrinkle.

EaaS contracts enable the client to install new energy efficient systems and equipment without paying up-front costs. They pay off the installer in increments from their savings on energy costs, and pocket the rest for themselves. In some cases, those funds can help support new rooftop solar projects.

Last year the CMTA branch of the advanced engineering consulting firm Legence recapped its EaaS work with the Grant County, West Virginia school district. The contract included guaranteed energy savings at all four schools in the rural district. One highlight was Petersburg Elementary School, where CMTA focused its “Zero Energy” strategy for introducing renewable energy supported by energy efficiency upgrades.

“The building was not Zero Energy ready prior to this project,” CMTA explained. “The elementary facility had a unique opportunity to have a large solar array installed that would be fully funded by energy savings.”

Power purchase agreements are another financial tool aiding the school solar movement in West Virginia. In 2021 state lawmakers approved new legislation enabling schools to use PPA contracts. Among the first to set the wheels in motion was Calhoun County, which entered into a PPA for two of its schools with the firm Secure Solar Futures.

The two projects went live in May of this year. Got Electric, the company that installed the solar arrays, calculates that solar power is offsetting a healthy 70–80% of electricity used by the schools. At that rate, Secure Solar estimates that the school system will save $740,000 over the 25-year term of the agreement.

The Calhoun County project also illustrates the ripple effect of hands-on solar education at schools, with local students now getting a leg up on solar-related scholarships and apprenticeships as well as new job opportunities in their communities.

Who could hate it? West Virginia State Senator Craig Hart (R-Mingo), for one. Earlier this year Hart proposed new legislation that would pull the rug out from under PPA contracts. “I don’t think a school is a good place to make a political statement about your utilities and whatnot,” Hart reportedly said during a committee meeting in April, while drawing politics into the conversation.

It was just several days ago that I wrote an article about Tesla launching a huge EV charging hub that runs on solar power. Today I found another one. Though, it actually launched a little before the Tesla one. It’s a new hub with 18 fast chargers for fleet vehicles. The press release from Terawatt Infrastructure says the source of electricity is renewables. “Solar canopies and 100% renewable energy powering every session.”

The location is Rialto, California, about 56 miles east of Los Angeles. The new fleet charging hub provides:

18 pull-through 350kW DC fast-charging stalls

55 bobtail parking stalls for overnight parking, shift changes, and logistics needs

Driver lounge building featuring Wi-Fi, climate control, and restrooms

License plate recognition for seamless entry

Solar canopies and 100% renewable energy powering every session

24/7 security with 360-degree cameras and gated access to protect vehicles, cargo, and drivers.

For people who might think this new site is just a one-off, Terawatt opened a similarly sized hub in April. “The private site, shared among multiple fleets, will house a total of 20 pull-through and bobtail DC fast charging stalls and boast a capacity of 7MW — enabling charging for up to 125 trucks per day.”

But let’s get back to the Rialto hub. “The Rialto site brings Terawatt’s vision of a connected, electrified network to life. It provides fast, reliable, and high-speed pull-through charging along an electric lane that runs from the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles through Vernon and Commerce, culminating in Rialto. Our network enables companies to reduce emissions and run a variety of routes across a number of vehicle classes with the confidence of a dependable charging solution. EV fleets can now travel further, more cleanly, without slowing down their operations,” said Neha Palmer, CEO and co-founder of Terawatt.

Solar power canopies generate electricity and don’t require vast amounts of land. They also provide shade and protection from precipitation.

There has been much good news about new EV charger installations lately, despite the loss of the federal EV incentives and a Trump administration that is anti-EV.

NJ ZIP Incentives for GreenPower

GreenPower Motor Company announced that its full Class 4 EV Star lineup—including the Passenger Van, Mobility Plus, ReeferX, Cab & Chassis, Stakebed, and Utility Truck—is now eligible for major incentives under New Jersey’s newly reopened Zero-Emission Incentive Program (NJ ZIP). Base vouchers start at $65,000 per vehicle and can exceed $90,000 with stackable bonuses.

The NJ ZIP program relaunched November 24, 2025, with $75 million in funding, split into two $37.5 million rounds. GreenPower vehicles qualify on a first-come, first-served basis.

New Jersey also launched the NJ ZEV Financing Program, offering low-interest loans of $50,000 to $500,000 for up to 100% of eligible zero-emission vehicle costs. This financing can be combined with NJ ZIP vouchers or used independently.

GreenPower executives highlighted the company’s ready-to-deliver lineup of passenger, mobility, cargo, refrigerated, and utility configurations, while Wolfington Body Company expressed support for expanding zero-emission fleets across the state.

Pure Lithium Saudi Patent for Brine-to-Battery Technology

Pure Lithium Corporation has received a foundational patent from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for its “Vertically Integrated Pure Lithium Metal Production and Lithium Battery Production” technology. The patent covers the company’s end-to-end Brine to Battery™ process, which unifies lithium extraction, anode production, and battery manufacturing.

CEO Emilie Bodoin noted that Saudi Arabia’s lithium-rich brines and abundant vanadium make it an ideal location for the company’s next-generation battery ecosystem. The company now holds more than 128 patents and applications globally, along with multiple trademarks.

Saudi Arabia’s Energy Capital Group, an investor since 2023, says the technology could give the country a competitive foothold in battery manufacturing with exceptional supply-chain security. Pure Lithium’s metal battery design uses no graphite, nickel, cobalt, or manganese—materials that dominate the current lithium-ion supply chain—while offering lighter, more powerful, and lower-cost performance.

ChargePoint & Dabaja Brothers: Ultra-Fast EV Charging Site in Detroit

ChargePoint has opened a new ultra-fast EV charging site in Canton, Michigan, in partnership with the Dabaja Brothers Development Group. This marks the first of several Dabaja-owned properties that will be equipped with ChargePoint Express Plus fast chargers, with additional sites planned in Dearborn and Livonia.

The rollout aims to fill “fast charging deserts” across metro Detroit by deploying more than 40 fast-charging ports. All stations will run on the new ChargePoint Platform, offering real-time monitoring, flexible pricing, and performance management.

Dabaja Brothers says the project addresses a significant lack of EV charging options in the region. ChargePoint’s Express Plus system supports every EV model, can charge two vehicles simultaneously, and uses advanced cooling to maintain peak charging speeds for quicker, uninterrupted sessions.

Suncoast Charging 1st Fast-Charging Station

Suncoast Charging Corporation has officially opened its first public DC fast-charging station in Land O’ Lakes, Florida, marking the start of its broader EV charging network rollout planned for 2026 and beyond. The station supports up to eight vehicles simultaneously and features 325 kW Tesla V4 Canvas Superchargers, accessible to all EV models with flexible payment options and 24/7 availability.

The company also announced its two Founders: electric mobility veteran David Patrick, who brings extensive leadership in EV infrastructure deployment, and Wesley Sima, whose background in finance and clean energy business development supports Suncoast’s growth strategy.

Suncoast is partnering with Center Connect Development to build its first two premium charging locations: the Hub at Bexley (now open) and the Hub at Lexington Oaks, expected in Q1 2026. These sites were selected for their destination-style amenities, including dining, retail, live music, and community events, serving both local residents and travelers.

Looking ahead, Suncoast plans to open approximately 20 new stations in 2026 as part of a reliable, customer-focused regional network.

Summary

TC Energy benefited from positive results in 2Q25, beating estimates, with EBITDA guidance being modestly raised, and the current capex remaining static.

Enbridge has vast scale across oil, gas, utilities and renewables. Enbridge’s strategy is to focus on a steady dividend, coupled with modest growth.

Earlier in the year, ONEOK missed 7-8% on EBITDA, which hurt performance for the company.

In 2Q25, Hess Midstream beat street estimates and remains a solid yield play.

Chart: Solar and wind are meeting — and exceeding — new power demand

A few months I posted a link to Michael Liebreich’s excellent two-part essay on the great climate reset. Underpinning Liebreich’s thesis was math: if clean energy exceeds demand by 3% per year for the next 40 years, pretty much everything will be clean shortly after 2060, despite a tripling of demand. I know that’s not fast enough for a lot of folks but for any student of energy history, that would be extremely fast.

And so far this year, solar and wind growth has outpaced demand by over 5%.

Throw in nuclear and new clean supply has outpaced demand by over 10%.

It’s only nine months but it’s extremely encouraging nonetheless.

Texas Grid Operators and Regulators Iron Out New Rules for Data Centers - Inside Climate News

This article provides a good overview of the various rulemakings underway to implement Senate Bill 6 — and the need for them.

The large load interconnection queue faced by ERCOT, Texas’ power grid, is now dominated by data centers, according to data from ERCOT’s latest system planning and weatherization update. Compared with September 2024, ERCOT now is tracking more than three times as many large load interconnections, with nearly 69% of the large load requests coming from data centers. By contrast, in May 2024, non-cryptocurrency data centers made up less than half of the large power demand requests.

While writer Arcelia Martin highlights the many concerns swirling around data center development, she also highlights an important perspective I often talk and write about here: Texas is a unique place for this kind of development which could inure to Texas’ benefit:

For Woody Rickerson, chief operating officer of ERCOT, the new rules outlined in SB6 are exemplary of why Texas is an opportune place for the growth of data centers, particularly those servicing artificial intelligence.

Grid operators and regulators want to move quickly, he said at a Sept. 30 data center industry conference in San Antonio.

Rickerson said in recent years, the state has proven it can transform the grid through the widespread adoption of renewable energy in ERCOT. The state’s independent grid now hosts more solar, wind and batteries than any other state in the country, with operators saying it can grant customers access to large amounts of power without the bureaucracy other grids face.

“We can change. We can adapt,” Rickerson said. “We can put new processes in place more quickly.”

This could mark the largest rollback of environmental protections under any administration.

In November, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed to remove federal protections from millions of acres of wetlands and streams, thereby reducing the power of the 1972 Clean Water Act. The EPA said it planned to more narrowly define “waters of the United States” to exclude many wetlands and streams, which is expected to take away federal protections from up to 55 million acres of wetlands, or about 85 percent of all wetlands nationwide, according to the environmental group the Natural Resources Defence Council.

Just two days later, federal wildlife agencies announced changes to the Endangered Species Act, which may make it more difficult to rescue endangered species from the brink of extinction. The move would permit the government to assess economic factors, such as the loss of revenues by not exploiting the land in question, before deciding whether to list a species as endangered, rather than assessing the region based on purely scientific evidence.

Another day later, the Interior Department announced plans to allow for new oil and gas drilling across almost 1.3 billion acres of U.S. coastal waters, with as many as 34 lease sales in federal waters. The agency is exploring the potential for holding lease sales in California, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Arctic waters of Alaska.

Pat Parenteau, a professor of climate policy at Vermont Law and Graduate School, said, “This was the week from hell for environmental policy in the United States… Unless stopped by the courts, each of these proposed rollbacks will do irreparable harm to the nation’s water quality, endangered species and marine ecosystems.”

Ironically, the move to dismantle some of the strongest environmental protections in the United States took place as many world leaders were attending the COP30 climate summit in Brazil. President Trump did not attend COP30, making it the first time in the summit’s 30-year history that the United States was not present.

White House representatives said that the moves supported Trump’s American energy dominance agenda, which he has been pushing for several months. In recent months, Trump has signed a flurry of executive orders taking target at the growing green energy sector, and instead favouring the expansion of U.S. fossil fuels.

This has been met with mounting criticism from environmental groups who claim that Trump is not fulfilling his legal obligations by scrapping several major environmental policies. However, several industries support the latest move, including farming groups, oil drillers, chemical manufacturers, home builders, and real estate developers. Nevertheless, finalising the three proposals could take up to two years, during which time the government may have to endure lengthy legal battles over the proposals.

Many Americans are in favour of the environmental protections currently in place. Approximately four out of five Americans surveyed supported the Endangered Species Act, according to the International Fund for Animal Welfare. Meanwhile, 81 percent of Americans who were polled said they were concerned about the environment, including the welfare of animals and nature.

Kristen Boyles, an attorney with environmental law group Earthjustice, said in a statement, “Trump’s attacks on the Endangered Species Act seriously misread the room. Most people are not going to allow the sacrifice of our natural world to a bunch of billionaires and corporate interests.”

However, the EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said that he aims to establish regulations that would be “durable and withstand future swings of presidential elections to come.” He said he expected significant environmental rollbacks to be taken in 2025. “We will do more deregulation in one year than entire federal governments in the past have done across all federal agencies combined,” said Zeldin.

In addition to the recent attacks on environmental protections, the Trump administration is making several changes to the Department of Energy (DoE), seemingly aimed at weakening the agency’s research and support for green energy and cleantech initiatives.

The DoE posted a revised organisational chart this month, which no longer shows the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, the Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, or the Grid Deployment Office, which have previously provided financial support for clean energy sectors. This follows moves by Trump earlier in the year to cut Biden-era funding destined for decarbonisation projects.

The efforts by the Trump administration to rein in clean energy spending and reduce environmental protections double down on President Trump’s goal to roll back the aims outlined in Biden’s climate policies, in favour of the expansion of U.S. fossil fuels. However, we will likely see pushback from environmental organisations and communities across the country who oppose these moves.

But who should pay for these losses?
These scores have mostly been generated by First Street – a private company that takes publically available information about climate risk, and downscales it to the lot level using a proprietary algorithm.

If you have been browsing Zillow or Redfin in recent years, you may have noticed that (in the US at least), listings have been accompanied by a property risk score for fire, flood, air quality, etc. These scores have mostly been generated by First Street – a private company that takes publically available information about climate risk, and downscales it to the lot level using a proprietary algorithm.

Here’s an example for a home in Houston, Texas:

Since this has been common, analysts have noticed that the worst-ranked homes for risk are suffering from relative price declines, particularly for homes at risk of flooding. This seems like a natural outcome, the higher the risk of flooding, the more expensive insurance will be, and if you can’t get insurance, the higher the risk of financial loss, and thus there is a reduction of price to compensate. If this was a static situation, then ideally these additional costs/risks would have been built into the historical prices and new prices wouldn’t be any worse affected. However, the situation is not static.

Intense rain events, wild fires, coastal flooding etc. are becoming more common in many places (while air quality issues are decreasing), and so risks to properties are changing over time, and homeowners are finding that they may not be able to sell their home for as much as they expected. That is a (relative) loss to those owners, for something that is not their fault (at least directly). Additionally, lower (relative) prices mean lower (relative) real estate commissions, and thus this has upset the realtor industry as well.

This is actually a big problem

Sympathy for brokers is not high outside of the industry (to say the least), and their struggles are not going to win many hearts or minds, but the bigger issue is much more serious. Climate changes are going to lead to increased future losses not just because of more ‘stuff’ being built (a big factor in increasing historical damages), but also because existing properties are facing more risk.

For example, take a row of houses along the North Carolina dunes, one of which fell into the sea this summer. Sea level there is rising (even more than the global mean), predominantly as a function of human impacts on the climate. Thus, a home built in 1976 that Zillow values at over $400,000 is now actually not worth anything. There are many less extreme examples where rainfall intensity increases are leading to more risks of flooding, or increases in fire weather etc. but the point is that areas of higher hazards are expanding and, objectively, many property values are (relatively) decreasing.

Generally speaking, property value rises and falls are felt by the current owners – they benefit (when they sell) if an area becomes more desirable, or take a loss if the opposite occurs. Public policy can impact this, but mostly society deals with this via changes in property taxes and assessments (in the US at least). The impacts due to climate changes are different though – these are changes that can in fact be blamed on our historical emissions that we have known for decades have been having such an effect.

Previously, it was a situation like pass-the-parcel – whoever was left holding the property when the impact was felt (the flood, the fire, the collapse into the sea) would end up paying for it or, at best, split the losses with their insurance company. The risk factor information is helping spread the costs to the current owners (as well as the future owners), which (I think) is a bit fairer but, of course, the costs are not being borne by the people causing the issue (the fossil fuel companies, the people that used their products etc.). People have also argued that society writ large should cover these losses – that regional or federal governments either through grants or insurance payouts should compensate owners, while others argue that the oil and gas companies should pay.

There is a real issue in how reliable these risk assessments are – if they are wildly different from different companies or approaches, or if the algorithms are proprietary, then it’s possible the impacts from releasing this information will be sub-optimal. But both Florida (h/t Kelly Hereid) (for hurricane damage) and California (wildfires) are leading the way in having public, open source, catastrophe models, and conceivably that could be spread more widely.

In practice, there is going to be a patchwork of different ideas, and different models, but there is no (sensible) answer that is based on ignoring the risks to keep prices artificially high. Even realtors should be able to accept that, and if they want to be compensated for their loss of commissions, they should get in line to sue the people who caused it.

Hydrogen power plants could be the answer to a greener future and a way to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. Hydrogen plants are rare, with only four currently producing low-carbon hydrogen in Europe, but a new project, HySynergy, was recently inaugurated in Denmark, according to Tech Xplore.

The plant is powered by solar and wind energy, and it will produce around ""eight tonnes of hydrogen a day in its first phase,"" per Tech Xplore. This hydrogen will then be transported to a nearby refinery and to Germany.

Though this power option has been slow to take off, it presents a real, positive solution to air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels. When hydrogen is burned, it only creates water vapor, rather than the harmful pollutants that are released when burning oil or gas.

The plant will initially produce 20 megawatts of power, with ambitions of producing up to 350 megawatts. This could power up to 315,000 homes for a whole year.

Green hydrogen is one of the most expensive forms of power, due to the large amounts of electricity it uses to produce hydrogen fuel. It is created through electrolysis, where an electrical current is used to separate the hydrogen from oxygen in water. However, as the cost of renewable energy sources drops, the cost of hydrogen should also become more affordable.

There are many exciting advancements in green hydrogen, such as researchers finding a way to make the electrolysis work on seawater as well as freshwater.

Jakob Korsgaard, founder and CEO of Everfuel, which owns 51% of the HySynergy project, said: ""The growth of green hydrogen depends on the political momentum.""

Without sufficient funding from governments and support for renewable energy sources by politicians, many of these expensive projects can't get off the ground.

""The momentum behind hydrogen is strong. In total, 60 governments (including the European Union) have adopted hydrogen strategies,"" the International Energy Agency commented.

""However, faster action is required to create demand for low-emissions hydrogen and unlock investment that can accelerate production scale-up and bring down the costs of technologies for producing and using low-emissions hydrogen.""

This move reflects a shift in strategy and capital allocation.

The reshuffling of Hut 8’s assets has coincided with striking share price volatility. The 1-day share price return recently surged 6.2%, and the 7-day return jumped over 31%. However, the 30-day period saw an 11.2% decline. Still, the stock is up more than 100% year-to-date, and its total shareholder return over the past year stands at 60.6%, suggesting momentum is building around the company’s latest moves and renewed strategic focus.

If you’re eager to expand your search beyond Hut 8, now is a great time to discover .

With such a dramatic stock rally and ongoing strategic changes, the real question is whether Hut 8’s current share price still offers a bargain or if the market is already factoring in the company’s future growth prospects.

Most Popular Narrative: 22.2% Undervalued

Compared to Hut 8's last close price of $45.00, the most closely followed narrative assigns a significantly higher fair value. This highlights a notable mismatch in market expectations versus narrative-driven projections.

The Power First strategy, featuring sizable pipeline origination (10.8 GW under diligence; 3.1 GW under exclusivity) and dual-purpose sites for both Bitcoin mining and AI compute, provides scalability and flexibility to benefit from rising institutional adoption of digital assets and accelerating demand for clean energy-powered blockchain infrastructure. This supports future revenue and earnings growth.

Still, disruptions in Bitcoin prices or delays in converting the development pipeline into revenue could quickly challenge the bullish outlook surrounding Hut 8’s story.

Another View: Looking at Market Ratios

While the narrative-based valuation pitches Hut 8 as markedly undervalued, our look at market price-to-earnings ratios paints a different picture. Hut 8's 23.8x ratio is well below the software industry average of 31.8x, yet it stands dramatically higher than its fair ratio of 7x and even above some peers. This gap suggests that, despite seemingly favorable comparisons, there may be valuation risk if the market reverts closer to the fair ratio over time, especially if growth stalls.

The order requires PJM, working with Constellation Energy, to ensure Units 3 and 4 remain operational and to limit costs to consumers. The Department of Energy said continued electricity production from the units is essential to avoid blackouts during the coming winter months.

“Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, the Department of Energy is using all tools available to keep the lights on and heat running for the American people,” Wright said. He added that the emergency directive is critical to maintaining affordable and dependable power during periods of high demand.

The two Eddystone units were already operating beyond their planned retirement date due to a previous emergency action issued May 30, 2025, followed by an additional directive on August 28. DOE said the facility played a significant role during heat waves in June and July, when PJM called on the units to help stabilize the grid.

PJM’s region is expected to continue facing “emergency conditions both in the near and long term,” according to DOE. The grid operator set a new winter peak in January 2025, surpassing a record that had stood since 2015.

The order takes effect November 26, 2025, and runs through February 24, 2026.

PJM has repeatedly warned federal regulators and Congress about escalating reliability risks tied to rising electricity demand, slow entry of new generation resources, and accelerating retirements of existing power plants. A February 2023 analysis highlighted concerns about the timing mismatch between retirements and new capacity. In a December 2024 filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, PJM reported “substantial increases” in expected load growth and stated its reliability concerns were “increasing at an extraordinary pace.”

During a March 2025 hearing before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, PJM President and CEO Manu Asthana told lawmakers the grid operator faces a “growing resource adequacy concern” affecting a large portion of the country.

DOE’s own Resource Adequacy Report warns that power outages could rise dramatically by 2030 if reliable power sources continue to be removed from the system.

Neso will soon begin informing projects from the previous queue whether they have been moved to a new delivery pipeline.","Imagine a coffee shop with just one power socket. There’s a queue of people with laptops and phone chargers ready to plug in.

Some aren’t quite ready so they leave the queue, but they still ask and expect their place to be saved. Others with vital immediate work to do have no choice but to wait outside the door. In the confusion, no one knows who should really take priority. Delay and uncertainty ensue.

That’s a bit like the way connecting to Britain’s electricity system has been working. Strong, ready-to-go projects are being left behind and waiting a decade to connect as a result.

• Fears grow over surge in electricity demand from data centres

Despite the initial successes of the first-come, first-served approach to grid connections, which helped the early and rapid deployment of renewable power and batteries, there were unintended consequences.

The value of having a connection offer led to more unviable and speculative projects, with no intention to build. Outdated rules meant that for any project, plans had to be made to design and build the pylons, offshore and onshore electricity cables to support them. All at a cost to the consumer.

As a result, the queue has grown tenfold in just five years, and together the projects in it exceed 800GW, four times the generation needed by 2030.

Dormant projects have blocked promising clean energy ventures that are ready to connect and have stood in the way of further clean economic growth across Great Britain. That must change.

By abolishing the first-come, first-served system, we can ensure that the connections process enables what is needed, when it’s needed, where it’s needed. Neso can free up space for shovel-ready wind and solar power, and make room for the data centres and electric vehicle superhubs of the future.

Neso will soon begin informing projects from the previous queue whether they have been moved to a new delivery pipeline. What we’ve been clear about is that not every project can progress in this round.

But Neso and Schroders Greencoat know that clearing the gridlock is essential to giving developers and investors the certainty they need to unlock jobs, develop supply chains and supercharge £40 billion a year of economic growth.

Overhauling the connections process isn’t a panacea. Transmission owners still need to build thousands of kilometres of new electricity cables. Planning reforms must be implemented.

But by putting in place these major changes to how we plug in to the grid, we are taking a big step forwards to help make sure the vast economic potential of Britain’s clean energy transition is realised.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fae271929-5281-4399-a97d-0dc7d28cbcaa.jpg?crop=1600%2C900%2C0%2C0&resize=1200,N,,2025-11-30 13:59:57.410263

Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.), opinion contributor, opinion contributor",,,,,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/5626178-antidumping-laws-foreign-threats/,"During my tenure in Congress, I shared many of the president’s grievances with American trade policy and I maintain those views now.
But there is another trade policy area where the Trump administration should focus its energy and pursue reforms to offer relief to American manufacturers.
As this cheating continues, American businesses lose customers and markets to the under-valued foreign products causing harm which can be long-lasting.
Perhaps not surprisingly, China is the biggest violator of U.S. anti-dumping orders, comprising 26 percent of adjudicated cases since 2020.
It is essential that we reinvigorate American manufacturing by enforcing fair competition and President Trump’s trade policies have the potential to do that.","A hallmark of each of President Trump’s terms in office has been his focus on trade issues. He has sought to use the power of the presidency to address perceived imbalances in the benefits of trade with foreign partners, and to put in place policies — led by tariffs — to encourage businesses to reshore and invest in manufacturing in the United States.

During my tenure in Congress, I shared many of the president’s grievances with American trade policy and I maintain those views now. We as a country have been too willing to sit back and accept a shift of production to countries that have lower labor, environmental and other standards, allowing multi-national companies to make increased profits on goods that they sell back to us as imports. Consequently, manufacturing jobs have fallen drastically, industrial investment in the U.S. has dropped, and the communities that rely on these mainstays have experienced economic decline. America lost roughly 5 million manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2020. I am hopeful that by applying tariffs smartly, President Trump can set in motion a fundamental change in this trend and reinvigorate production and manufacturing in the U.S.

But there is another trade policy area where the Trump administration should focus its energy and pursue reforms to offer relief to American manufacturers. While tariffs are often applied broadly against all imports from specific countries or on a class of imported products, antidumping laws and duties are narrowly applied to address violations of American trade law by specific foreign countries.

When foreign entities are found to be selling their goods in the U.S. at below market value with the intent of undercutting American companies, these duties are applied against those imports to penalize unfair trade practices and even the playing field for domestic producers. Such relief is critical, especially for small and medium-sized manufacturers.

However, even when a petition for relief is successful, foreign companies can find ways to evade the application of the duties. For example, after one American small business prevailed in its anti-dumping claims against European producers, the same products were found being shipped through third-country routes under new product names, seeking to evade Customs and duty payments. As this cheating continues, American businesses lose customers and markets to the under-valued foreign products causing harm which can be long-lasting.

According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the number of anti-dumping (and countervailing duty) cases enforced by the agency increased from 540 in 2020 to 716 in 2024, a 33 percent increase, indicating that these foreign threats continue to grow. Perhaps not surprisingly, China is the biggest violator of U.S. anti-dumping orders, comprising 26 percent of adjudicated cases since 2020. But plenty of developed countries make the list too, with South Korea, India, Japan, and even Italy making the top ten. Despite the breadth of these violations, CBP only collected $2 billion in duty deposits and levied $80 million in penalties for violations in FY24.

The process for filing an anti-dumping claim can be expensive and time consuming. Specialized legal support is often required to help small businesses investigate and file claims, and the adjudication process can take months if not years. Approved anti-dumping claims are then subject to annual reviews, adding to costs and delays in applying duties. Efforts by American businesses to prove violations of dumping laws and evasion of duties require “non-public” information which is difficult and expensive to obtain.

Moving forward, CBP should utilize some of the significant new funding it recently received to better enforce anti-dumping laws and deter and penalize those who seek to evade these laws. The Commerce Department should update its procedures and modernize the process to make it more efficient and effective. Congress should consider changes in law to prevent any U.S. government entity or federal contractor from buying or utilizing imports that are subject to anti-dumping laws. Commerce should establish an ombudsman office to help small and medium-sized American businesses understand and file anti-dumping cases as a means of relief from the legal costs that may otherwise impede them from pursuing these cases.

The agency should also consider expedited procedures for filings and annual reviews, especially for smaller-sized petitioners. Finally, the United States should encourage the World Trade Organization to revise its rules on anti-dumping which have not been updated since the 1990s and are well overdue for reform.

It is essential that we reinvigorate American manufacturing by enforcing fair competition and President Trump’s trade policies have the potential to do that. A key component of those policies, however, must be strengthening the protections that we have in place to punish foreign entities who cheat our trade laws, which will allow American companies and their workers to thrive.

Community energy groups and not-for-profit organisations across NSW can apply for grants up to $600,000 to scale up their work helping households adopt renewable technologies, access incentives and rebates, improve energy efficiency and navigate the transition to cleaner, smarter energy solutions.

Funded projects could include community education workshops, one-on-one energy guidance, adapting existing programs for wider audiences, creating digital tools, staffing local advisory roles and developing marketing or communication campaigns to reach more households. Other innovative projects addressing local energy needs will also be considered.

Professor Ty Christopher, Director of Energy Futures Network at the University of Wollongong’s Faculty of Engineering and Information Sciences, said this kind of support could supercharge what Illawarra community groups had already been building in the region.

“One thing we’ve seen here in the Illawarra is a terrifically positive group of grassroots organisations such as Electrify 2515, Hi Neighbour and Good for the Gong to increase energy literacy in the community,” he said.

“These community-driven efforts are incredible, but there comes a time, if all this good work is for the benefit of the public, that the government charged with serving that public should help things along. This funding will help with just that.

“Pardon the pun, but more power to them, as they support these community activation efforts not just to kick off, but to build and maintain momentum.”

The program forms part of the NSW Government’s Consumer Energy Strategy, which aims to put households and small businesses at the centre of the state’s clean energy transition.

It also supports early planning for the Illawarra Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), enhancing the capacity of local groups to help residents integrate technologies such as rooftop solar, batteries, energy-efficient appliances and home electrification into the region’s evolving energy system.

Member for Wollongong Paul Scully said the program would position the Illawarra at the forefront of NSW’s clean energy future.

“The Illawarra is at the centre of NSW’s clean industrial future and this program will help the community further embrace renewable energy and prepare to be home to the state’s first urban renewable energy zone,” he said.

“Crucially it will help to better inform everyone in the Illawarra from community groups to businesses and individual households on renewables so we can all work together to lead the way for renewable energy generation in urban areas.”

It comes as the Australian Research Council (ARC) Future Grids Training Centre at the University of Wollongong (UOW) prepares to host the IEEE International Conference on Energy Technologies for Future Grids (ETFG 2025) next month, bringing together global experts to explore the future of clean, reliable and resilient energy systems.

The conference will welcome researchers, policymakers and industry leaders from Australia and around the world to address the challenges and opportunities in transforming Australia’s electricity networks.

In Zaragoza, Spain, a groundbreaking ceremony marked the start of construction on one of Europe’s largest battery factories. Chinese battery maker CATL and automaker Stellantis are launching a €4.1 billion joint project. The site is set to underpin the next phase of the EU’s electric transition, with capacity to supply batteries for up to one million electric cars a year — an output that turns policy targets into production reality.

The gigafactory will focus on lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells and, across the lifetime of all units produced, could cut more than 30 million tonnes of CO2. Production is scheduled to begin at the end of 2026. More than 4,000 direct jobs are planned, with thousands more indirectly, a scale likely to jump-start a local supply chain rather than simply add another pin to the map.

The financing momentum accelerated further in July, when the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) approved a US$495 million guarantee to shelter CBE’s assets from currency volatility and transfer restrictions in countries where macroeconomic fluctuations have historically deterred private capital.

CBE’s approach centers on fully financed renewable systems, primarily solar and storage, that industrial clients pay for through consumption rather than capital expenditure. This has been especially appealing to firms in mining, manufacturing and telecommunications, where unpredictable grid supply and high diesel costs erode profit margins.

One of its flagship developments is a 30-megawatt solar-plus-storage unit under construction for the Kamoa-Kakula copper mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo. If completed on schedule, it will deliver steady baseload power that reduces shutdown risks, lowers operating costs and curbs emissions in a region where diesel generators remain the fallback for most industrial sites.

The scale of the new debt facility signals that lenders are increasingly willing to back decentralized renewable infrastructure in markets once considered too high-risk. However, the financing gap remains vast. IRENA’s most recent figures show that sub-Saharan Africa received only around 2 percent of global renewable energy investment in 2024, amounting to less than a tenth of what analysts estimate the region requires annually to meet medium-term demand.

Countries such as Kenya, South Africa, Egypt and Morocco continue to draw the bulk of capital, while frontier markets, including parts of West and Central Africa, rely heavily on concessional finance and guarantee structures like the one CBE secured from MIGA.

The implications extend beyond the energy sector. Reliable power is one of the most significant determinants of competitiveness for African industries. The mining sector alone accounts for more than 30 percent of export revenues in countries like Zambia and the DRC, yet outages often push firms to spend as much as 20 percent of operating budgets on alternative power.

In manufacturing hubs such as Nigeria and Ghana, grid instability forces companies to run diesel generators for between 30 and 60 percent of operating hours, inflating production costs and undermining sustainability commitments. Projects financed under CBE’s model have the potential to reverse part of this trend by embedding long-term cost predictability into industrial supply chains.

Africa’s broader energy transition hinges on whether capital can reach commercially viable projects at scale, and whether those projects can demonstrate performance strong enough to pull in more investors. The latest financing round positions CBE among a handful of firms attempting to prove that renewable power in frontier markets is bankable when structured with the right risk protections and operational guarantees.

If the pipeline proceeds as planned, the company’s installations could serve as reference points for lenders assessing similar opportunities across the continent. For now, the US$200 million secured marks a step forward in linking private capital to Africa’s energy needs, offering industrial consumers alternatives to unreliable grids and high-carbon fuels.",https://africasustainabilitymatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/croed-energy.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 14:00:25.566636

The old warehouse strip reborn as the Lee + White development is a popular destination for anyone seeking a bite or a beverage on the Atlanta Beltline’s Westside Trail. But steps from the breweries and eateries inhabiting much of the space, serious science is taking place.

In an industrial space at the complex’s north end, engineers in blue lab coats huddle over circuit boards. Scientists test how certain films and other materials respond to pressure, heat and more. And in a machine shop off the main lab, a computer-controlled machine mills custom components from raw metal.

The space is a hive of activity, one that exudes the spirit of experimentation embodied by its founder, the legendary inventor Lonnie Johnson.

Johnson isn’t a household name like Thomas Edison or Alexander Graham Bell. You’ll be hard-pressed, however, to find a child of the 1990s who isn’t familiar with his most famous invention: the Super Soaker. The ubiquitous water gun has produced an estimated $1 billion in sales over its lifetime.

“Inventing, for me anyway, is looking for a good problem to tackle,” Johnson said.

At 76, the prolific inventor is not done hunting for solutions, and he believes the one his team is refining steps from the Beltline — the Johnson Thermo-Electrochemical Converter, or JTEC — could be his most significant yet.

Johnson and outside experts say the JTEC is a “novel” energy device. It’s not a battery or a fuel cell, and it doesn’t fit neatly into other conventional categories.

What it is, Johnson thinks, is a potential key to unlock a huge power source that’s rarely utilized today: waste heat. At the same time, he thinks it could help humanity slow climate change and meet its seemingly insatiable need for more electricity.

It’s still relatively early days for the company, but Johnson and other JTEC executives think the future is bright — if they can clear the hurdles that come with scaling any first-of-its-kind technology.

Capturing waste heat

A trained nuclear engineer, Johnson served in the Air Force and later worked on NASA’s Galileo mission. A lifelong inventor, he has more than 140 patents to his name and was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2022.

Energy issues have been a driving force behind Johnson’s innovations for years. In fact, an “aha” moment working on a more efficient heat pump — a type of home heating and cooling system — is what led to the Super Soaker.

In the late 1980s, while experimenting at home with new nozzles he’d fashioned, he shot a stream of water across his bathroom.

“I thought, you know, a high-performance water gun would be a lot of fun,” Johnson said.

The idea for the JTEC wasn’t quite as spontaneous. It was born about 20 years ago, while Johnson was researching solid state batteries — an intense focus of automakers and other industries to this day.

The JTEC has few moving parts, no combustion and no exhaust. All the work to generate electricity is done by hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe.

Inside the device, pressurized hydrogen gas is separated by a thin, filmlike membrane, with low pressure gas on one side and high pressure gas on the other. The difference in pressure in this “stack” is what drives the hydrogen to compress and expand, creating electricity as it circulates. And unlike a fuel cell, it does not need to be refueled with more hydrogen.

All that’s needed to keep the process going and electricity flowing is a heat source. As it turns out, there are enormous amounts of energy vented or otherwise lost from industrial facilities like power plants, factories, breweries and more.

Between 20% and 50% of all energy used for industrial processes is dumped into the atmosphere and lost as waste heat, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

‘Power … from just about anywhere’

The JTEC works with high temperatures, but the device’s ability to generate electricity efficiently from low-grade heat sources is what company executives are most excited about.

Inside JTEC’s headquarters, engineers show off a demonstration unit that can power lights and a sound system with water that’s roughly 200 degrees Fahrenheit — below the boiling point and barely warm enough to brew a cup of tea, said Julian Bell, JTEC’s vice president of engineering.

Comas Haynes, a research engineer at the Georgia Tech Research Institute specializing in thermal and hydrogen system designs, agrees the company could “hit a sweet spot” if it can capitalize on lower temperature heat. Haynes is not affiliated with JTEC.

For Johnson, the potential application he’s most excited about lies beneath our feet.

Geothermal energy exists naturally in rocks and water beneath the Earth’s surface at various depths. Tapping into that resource through abandoned oil and gas wells — a well-known access point for underground heat — offers another opportunity.

“You don’t need batteries and you can draw power when you need it from just about anywhere,” Johnson said.

Right now, the company is building its first commercial JTEC unit, which is set to be deployed early next year. Mike McQuary, JTEC’s CEO and the former president of the pioneering internet service provider MindSpring, said he couldn’t reveal the customer, but said it’s a “major Southeast utility company.”

“Crossing that bridge where you have commercial customers that believe in it and will pay for it is important,” McQuary said.

‘Horse race’

The challenge for JTEC, as for all startups, is whether the company can control costs as it scales its product.

It took decades for renewables like wind and solar to bend their respective cost curves to compete with fossil fuels. McQuary said the company can’t wait that long, and its focus now is on sourcing the specialized materials it needs, while it works to drive down cost.

Haynes from Georgia Tech said he’s “generally optimistic” about the JTEC, especially if it can find ways to put low-quality heat to good use.

“The lower the temperature it can accommodate, the more novel it will be,” he said.

On top of some initial seed money, the company brought in $30 million in a Series A funding in 2022 — money that allowed the company to move to its Lee + White headquarters and hire more than 30 engineers. McQuary said it expects to begin another round of fundraising soon.

Johnson, meanwhile, hasn’t stopped working on new inventions.

He continues to refine the design for his solid-state battery — the one that spawned the JTEC. Solid-state batteries have long been considered the “holy grail” for battery makers, offering more range in electric vehicles, shorter charging times and improved safety.

Watching his battery venture progress alongside JTEC has been like a “horse race,” Johnson said. He’s still not sure which one will cross the finish line first.

“I‘ve got teams for both technologies now,” Johnson said. “Sometimes, one is ahead of the other in getting to commercialization … but it’s fun watching them solving their own problems in their individual space.”

A Bloomberg report on Saturday claimed China, citing Goldman Sachs economists, is squeezing developing nations by dominating both low- and high-tech manufacturing. The article bluntly characterizes China's strategy as a ""beggar-thy-neighbor"" threat to the global economy.

Dressed up in the language of data and economics, this narrative is less a neutral assessment and more a repackaged version of the old ""China manufacturing threat"" storyline.

Its political intent is hard to miss: to recast China not only as a challenger to the US and Europe, but also as a spoiler of other developing countries' prospects - thereby justifying a broader coalition in support of decoupling policies against Beijing.

For years, parts of the Western commentariat have relied on zero-sum thinking to explain China's rise.

A decade ago, the refrain was that China had ""stolen American blue-collar jobs."" Today, the script has been updated: China is now supposedly ""stealing"" Africa's industrialization, Southeast Asia's export growth and Latin America's development space.

The claim that ""China is crowding out other developing countries"" is simply another layer of rhetorical wrapping around a broader strategy of ""de-risking from China.""

The problem is that this story does not hold up against the facts. In recent years, Chinese outward direct investment and industrial cooperation have expanded rapidly. Chinese companies have established industrial parks and production bases in Vietnam, Indonesia, Mexico, Egypt, Ethiopia and many other countries, bringing not just capital and equipment, but also technology, management expertise, and, crucially, jobs.

Across Africa, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, Chinese-built railways, ports, power plants and telecom networks are providing critical infrastructure that many countries had long lacked.

The statement that China is ""taking its industries abroad"" is much more accurate than saying it is ""clinging to low-end manufacturing at home.""

Key segments of Chinese-linked industrial chains are being reconfigured across borders. Many emerging economies are actively drawing on elements of China's development experience to upgrade their own manufacturing. Through this kind of chain extension, developing countries can plug into global production networks more quickly by leveraging Chinese capacity, while also exporting more in complementary sectors. That is a pathway to faster industrialization, not a roadblock.

This is what the West is most worried about: The development of manufacturing in more developing countries will ultimately shake the West's dominance in more fields.

It is not a result of Chinese competition, but of the long-standing division of labor dominated by advanced economies and the resurgence of protectionism in the West. For decades, a small group of rich countries has controlled key technologies, standards and financial rules, keeping high-value, high-margin activities at home while offloading labor-intensive and resource-intensive segments abroad. Many developing economies have been stuck at the bottom of global value chains as a result.

Now, under the banners of ""national security"" and ""de-risking,"" the US and some of its allies are erecting new tariff and technology barriers, championing ""friendshoring"" and building ""small yards and high fences"" to restructure supply chains in ways that explicitly sideline China and, in practice, also limit the policy autonomy of many Global South countries. Western efforts to ""contain China"" are increasingly being projected into the wider developing world, seeking to weaken trade and industrial ties between these countries and China. That is what a genuine beggar-thy-neighbor strategy looks like - and it is a more credible explanation of who has historically taken the ""jobs and opportunities"" of the developing world.

China, by contrast, has sought to offer an alternative through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Global Development Initiative - built on principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. This approach does not pretend that there are no interests at stake; instead, it recognizes that sustainable cooperation is in all parties' long-term interest and that development rights should be more equally shared.

China's development has never been an isolated success story. It has unfolded alongside, and increasingly in partnership with, the broader developing world. Sharing opportunities, supporting partners and contributing to global growth through concrete actions, not slogans, is the strongest possible response to any ""China threat"" narrative.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2025/2025-11-30/87be9e0f-cf7b-49cc-be46-b930bfb4ee1b.jpeg,N,,2025-11-30 14:01:13.000745

The region has seen the government advancing initiatives to grow the wind power sector, and through the new deal with Nordex, the Irish wind power market is set to become a dominant force in the region’s energy market.

Wind power projects have become immensely popular in Europe

Several European nations have revived their wind power ambitions in recent years amid calls to diversify the global energy market. Wind power’s potential to deliver large-scale energy projects is commendable, add to that the clean energy and emission reduction properties, and one questions why more nations are not turning to the wind sector.

The climate in Europe is perfect for wind power projects, almost as if the region were designed to make use of the wind that is a constant feature, especially in places like Ireland. The government has been fostering investments in wind power, with Nordex playing a vital role in supplying wind turbines for the UK energy market in recent years.

Nordex will supply up to 12 wind turbines for the Irish wind project

The German wind turbine manufacturer has an immensely impressive portfolio in the wind sector, providing turbines for a litany of projects not only in Europe, but further afield as well. Nordex will supply 12 N133/4.8 wind turbines at the Drumnahough Wind Farm in Donegal, Ireland, continuing its presence in the UK energy market for many years to come.

The Drumnahough project is just the latest in a long relationship between SSE and Nordex

The new Drumnahough project is just the latest for the long-standing relationship between SSE Renewables and Nordex, with the German manufacturer already supplying 29 turbines for the 101MW Yellow River wind farm in Offaly, Ireland. Additionally, the pair of companies recently announced a new order for wind turbines for a wind project in Spain.

“We’re pleased to have been awarded the contract to manufacture and install turbines for the Drumnahough Wind Farm – another important milestone in Ireland’s renewable energy journey. With the N133’s suitability for high wind locations and our long-term service commitment, at Nordex, we’re proud to continue to deliver as a trusted, dependable partner in the Irish onshore sector.” – Jason Welch, Managing Director UK & Ireland at the Nordex Group

Nordex will not only construct and install the 12 wind turbines at the Drumnahough project, but will also continue to provide substantial maintenance for the project as part of a long-term Premium Service agreement. The company has become the backbone of the international wind sector, and recently received an order for wind turbines for a wind project in Germany, exemplifying the company’s expertise in turbine manufacturing.

X-Energy Leaps Ahead with $700M in Series D Funding

X-Energy Reactor Company, LLC, a developer of advanced nuclear reactor and fuel technologies, announced it has closed an oversubscribed Series D financing round of approximately $700 million led by Jane Street. X-energy expects to utilize proceeds from the round to help continue the expansion of its supply chain and commercial pipeline. (TRISO fuel element. Image: X-Energy)

Additional new investors include ARK Invest, Galvanize, Hood River Capital Management, Point72, Reaves Asset Management, XTX Ventures and various others, as well as existing investors including Ares Management funds, Corner Capital, Emerson Collective, NGP, Segra Capital Management and others.

Prior Funding Supports Current Development Efforts

X Energy, LLC in April 2024 awarded a $148.5 million tax credit for the construction by its wholly-owned subsidiary, TRISO-X LLC an advanced nuclear fuel fabrication facility, TX-1, in Oak Ridge, TN. Funded by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the award is part of the Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Tax Credit program jointly administered by the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and the Internal Revenue Service.

In addition to ARDP funding, the U.S. Department of Energy also awarded X-energy $9 million in 2018 to support the initial design of the company’s fuel fabrication facility that later evolved into TX-1.

TRISO-X anticipates regulatory approval from the NRC by May 2026 and recently received approval from the Department to spend an additional $30 million to secure long-lead procurement items to adhere to the overall project schedule.

In October 2024 X-Energy Reactor Company, LLC announced a Series C-1 financing round of approximately $500 million, anchored by Amazon.com, Inc. Citadel Founder and CEO Ken Griffin, affiliates of Ares Management Corporation (Ares), NGP, and the University of Michigan join Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund in the financing round.

The investment will help meet growing energy demands by funding the completion of X-energy’s reactor design and licensing as well as the first phase of its TRISO-X fuel fabrication facility.

X-energy and Amazon plan to establish and standardize a deployment and financing model to develop projects in partnership with infrastructure and utility partners. The investment includes manufacturing capacity to develop the SMR equipment to support more than five gigawatts of new nuclear energy projects utilizing X-energy’s technology.

The efforts will help meet growing energy demands in key locations through direct project investments and long-term power purchase agreements to help power Amazon operations.

Order Book Pipeline

X- Energy has plans to build four of its 80 MW HTGR design SMRs at the DOW Seadrift Operations manufacturing site located on the Texas Gulf Coast. X-energy has received updates from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regarding the construction permit application for the initial deployment of the Xe-100 advanced reactor. The proposed project is being developed by The Dow Chemical Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Long Mott Energy LLC.

Citing the completeness and quality of the application, and the effectiveness of pre-application engagements, the NRC published an 18-month review timeline for the Texas Gulf Coast project and will concurrently proceed with its environmental assessment. Since 2018, X-energy has led and participated in extensive pre-application engagements with NRC staff on the Xe-100 design, TRISO-X fuel, and topical reports covering numerous aspects of the company’s technology

Another deal is to build up to five and as many as 12 of the SMRs for Amazon at a site adjacent to the Columbia Generating Station in Washington by the end of the 2030s. The reactor is operated by Energy Northwest. The utility has signed an MOU to operate the SMRs once they are built.

In Washington, Amazon’s agreement with Energy Northwest, a consortium of state public utilities, will enable the development of four advanced SMRs. The reactors will be constructed, owned and operated by Energy Northwest, and are expected to generate 320 MW of capacity for the first phase of the project, with the option to increase to 960 MW total.

Additionally, X-energy is partnered with British multinational energy and services company Centrica to deploy 6 GW in the United Kingdom. The project includes plans to build up to 12 of the 80 MW HTGR SMRs. Centrica will provide initial project capital for development with the goal of initiating full-scale activities in 2026.

Subject to regulatory approval in the U.K., the first electricity generation would be expected in the mid-2030s. Centrica and X-energy are in discussions with additional potential equity partners, as well as leading global engineering and construction companies, with the goal of establishing a UK-based development company to develop this first and subsequent projects.

Fuel Fabrication Plant Under Construction in Oak Ridge, TN

X-energy is building an advanced nuclear fuel fabrication facility in Oak Ridge, TN, to manufacture its proprietary TRISO-X fuel. Earlier this month X-energy announced the start of vertical construction for its $300 million TX-1 fuel fabrication facility. The facility will manufacture the company’s proprietary TRISO fuel for its commercial reactors.

Located within the Horizon Center Industrial Park, the 110-acre TRISO-X campus is situated on land that was formerly part of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and was part of a tract released in 1996 for private development to help diversify the region’s economic base. TRISO-X acquired the campus from the Oak Ridge Industrial Development Board in 2022.

TX-1 will be the first of two facilities planned for the site to fabricate the company’s ceramic fuel designed to withstand extreme temperatures and retain fission products under all reactor conditions.

The fuel will be enriched to 19.5% U235. TRISO-X utilizes more energy dense high assay low enriched uranium (HALEU) that allows for longer periods of operation. X-Energy manufacturs a proprietary product to enrure supply and quality control.

The group will start building the shell of the 214,812 square foot facility at the Oak Ridge site that will be used to fabricate 700,000 TRISO fuel pebbles each year, which is enough fuel for 11 Xe-100 small modular reactors. X-Energy said full employment at the plant will be 500 people.

TRISO-X acquired the campus from the Oak Ridge Industrial Development Board in 2022.

First Allocation of HALEU from DOE

In April 2025 X-energy and its wholly owned subsidiary TRISO-X LLC announced an allocation of High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium from the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy’s HALEU Allocation Program.

“This first allocation is a critical step forward to bridge the HALEU availability gap in the nuclear supply chain with existing material,” said TRISO-X president Joel Duling.

“Coupled with the HALEU Availability Program and other efforts, we expect the commercial sector to further bridge the availability gap to support the delivery and scalability of the advanced reactor fleet.”

The allocation is part of X-energy’s participation in DOE’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program and will be delivered in the first core loads of fuel in partnership with Dow Inc. at their UCC Seadrift Operations manufacturing site.

The two companies recently announced the submission of a construction permit application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the proposed Xe-100 plant at Seadrift, with the potential to begin construction later this decade and start up early next decade.

X-Energy TRISO Fuel Irradiation Testing Underway at INL

Pebbles of TRISO-X fuel have begun 13 months of irradiation testing at Idaho National Laboratory to evaluate fuel performance across operating scenarios and qualify them for commercial use. Over a 13-month trial, the experiments will evaluate fuel performance under different power levels, temperatures and burnup scenarios, which are essential for meeting Nuclear Regulatory Commission standards for commercial use in advanced reactors, including X-energy’s Xe-100 small modular reactor. Once testing is complete, post-irradiation examination will begin at INL and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

Vattenfall Invests $42 Million in New Nuclear for Sweden

Up to five small modular reactors being planned for existing Ringhals site

(NucNet) Swedish state-owned power company Vattenfall and the industrial consortium Industrikraft have signed an agreement for joint investment and collaboration that will enable the next steps in a project to deploy new nuclear power in Sweden.

Vattenfall said in a statement that Industrikraft will become a 20% shareholder in the nuclear project company Videberg Kraft and invest $42 million in the project.

Vattenfall and Industrikraft, formed in June 2024 to support the expansion of Swedish non-fossil fuel electricity supply, will work on the deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs) at Vattenfall’s existing Ringhals nuclear site on the Värö Peninsula, southwest Sweden.

The agreement covers project management and selection of technologies. Vattenfall said Swedish technology has a role to play in driving the development of a strong supplier cluster in Europe.

In August Vattenfall said it will proceed with US-based GE Vernova (GEV) and British company Rolls-Royce SMR as it looks to choose a potential supplier for new nuclear power plants next to Ringhals.

Vattenfall said at the time final investment decisions will be made “later in the process”.

It said both companies offer SMRs with proven technology and simplified designs that have integrated learnings from previous nuclear projects worldwide. Both use fuel for which Vattenfall has established supply chains.

GEV’s technology is the 300-MW BWRX-300. Construction of the first BWRX-300 unit is underway at Ontario Power Generation’s Darlington nuclear site near Toronto in Canada.

Rolls-Royce SMR is developing a 470-MW unit. The company has been selected by the British government as the preferred bidder to develop SMRs for the UK.

Vattenfall is planning a project with either five BWRX-300 plants for a total capacity of 1,500 MW or three Rolls-Royce SMR plants for 1,410 MW.

The company also said it is already looking at the next step to build an additional 1,000 MW of SMR capacity at the Ringhals site, where two large-scale reactors are in operation and two have been permanently shut down.

The company said building a series of smaller units as opposed to single, large-scale reactors, brings clear cost advantages. SMRs require less space, need significantly fewer personnel, and lead to more manageable logistics.

Dutch Government Prepares To Build Four New Nuclear Reactors

The incoming Dutch government has backed plans to more than triple the funds earmarked for the expansion of the nuclear sector. This plan would bring the total planned investments in the nuclear sector up from $4.9 billion to $15.2 billion, marking a significant increase in funding.

The Dutch government has started the assessment process for two new nuclear projects, with Borssele and Eemshaven being designated as possible locations for the new nuclear facilities. The government said its involvement in the nuclear plans is preferable to private sector investment due to the uncertain nature of nuclear projects including schedule and cost issues.

In December 2022 the Dutch government chose the Borssele site as its preferred location for the proposed construction of two new 1,000 MW+ nuclear units.

The government said the units should be deployed by 2035, each have a capacity of between 1,000 MW and 1,650 MW, and use Generation III+ reactor technology.

Earlier this year, the Dutch government established the Nuclear Energy Organization Netherlands (NEO NL) to facilitate the construction of the planned new nuclear power plants, marking a long-term involvement and commitment from the state. The new organization will be responsible for the entire process of developing the nation’s nuclear new reactors.

The government said it is considering two nuclear facilities to include small modular reactors, or SMRs, as they are significantly cheaper to construct, install, and operate than a larger conventional nuclear reactor. This would be a first for the European continent, as it has no small modular reactors in operation in the EU.

Japan Will Offer Loans to Finance Nuclear Power Projects

Government-backed loans would work with private investment as Tokyo backs reactors

(NucNet) Japan will introduce a loan support program to aid public investment in nuclear power plants and major transmission projects. The news was confirmed by the Tokyo-based industry group the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum (JAIF), which said that under the plan loans would be provided through the government’s Organization for Cross-Regional Coordination of Transmission Operators.

The loans would be granted as co-financing agreements between private institutions and the state, with the government recognizing its part in supporting the development of nuclear power projects.

JAIF said that Japan had been encouraged to follow the path of other governments which provide loan guarantees and other public investment to ensure that nuclear projects were viable and spread the risk more equitably.

At a press conference Ryosei Akazaka, Japan’s Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), said, “With electricity demand expected to grow, we will take a hard look at whether private financing alone is sufficient for large-scale investments in decarbonized power sources and transmission networks.”

“We intend to deepen discussions on institutional frameworks and legal amendments that make effective use of the government’s creditworthiness.”

Japan’s new prime minister Sanae Takaechi has publicly supported the revival of nuclear power, with the aim of reducing the country’s reliance on fuel imports.

At present, 14 of the country’s 33 commercially available nuclear power plants have been restarted following the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The government plans to restart additional reactors and finish several that were under construction at the time of the 2011 Fukushima disaster.

Asian Development Bank to Invest in Nuclear Energy

The multilateral development bank has amended its energy policy, paving the way for it to support developing member countries that choose to pursue nuclear power.

(WNN & IAEA) The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) signed a new agreement on 11/25/25 to strengthen cooperation in support of countries across Asia and the Pacific that are exploring nuclear energy as part of their long-term energy and development strategies. Discussions will include identifying potential projects for collaboration, including those involving small modular reactors.

The agreement was signed by the IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi and the ADB President Masato Kanda in Manila, Philippines at a meeting of the the ADB’s Board of Directors. The Board revised its energy policy to support nuclear power, including investment measures for the first time as a pathway for decarbonization.

As part of the new policy, it has signed an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to cooperate in supporting countries in Asia and the Pacific who are exploring nuclear energy as part of their energy and development strategies.

The Asian Development Bank’s move to consider funding nuclear energy projects follows a similar one between the IAEA and the World Bank earlier this year.

Asian Development Bank (ADB) President Masato Kanda said: “These changes further enhance ADB’s ability to support countries in Asia and the Pacific as they work to meet their rapidly growing energy needs. Nuclear power, for example, is an important technology option for countries looking for reliable alternatives to baseload electricity.”

“With ADB’s updated energy policy recognizing nuclear power as an alternative to fossil fuels for baseload generation, this agreement ensures that developing member countries choosing this path do so with robust safeguards, strong governance and a clear commitment to sustainability.”

IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, who attended the announcement with Kanda, said, “As ADB opens the door to financing nuclear power, we will move quickly to identify practical areas of collaboration that respond to rising energy needs of countries across the region … our teams will now begin shaping concrete initiatives that deliver reliable, low-carbon energy and strengthen resilience for millions of people.”

“It further broadens that international momentum, strengthening support for countries that are turning to nuclear energy to enhance energy access, security and resilience”.

The memorandum of understanding with the IAEA will see the two “collaborate to build knowledge and technical capacity across the full nuclear life cycle. Key areas of cooperation include energy planning, the management of nuclear fuel cycles and radioactive waste, and nuclear facilities’ life-cycle management. The IAEA will also support informed decision-making by providing guidance on safety, security, safeguards, and stakeholder engagement.”

Founded in 1966 and owned by 69 member states, including 50 from the region, ADB committed $3.8 billion to energy projects in 2024. It says it aims to support “inclusive, resilient, and sustainable growth across Asia and the Pacific.”

General Atomics Completes Concept for New Fast Reactor Design

The fast modular reactor (FMR) design is one of three early-stage concept projects the Department of Energy supported under its Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program.

General Atomics has demonstrated feasibility of their fast modular reactor (FMR) design through various modeling and lab-scale tests to verify the performance of key safety systems, fuel, and operations — allowing the firm to start maturing the technology to a preliminary design phase for potential demonstration in the 2030s. Completed work also included the fabrication of sample fuel rods that match the design intended for use in the FMR.

The company is developing a gas-cooled modular reactor that can be made in factories and assembled on-site to deliver 44 MW as little as 0.2 acres of land.

The reactor is designed to pair with an air-cooling system for potential deployment in remote or arid locations and runs on silicon carbide-wrapped high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel that can withstand temperatures twice as high as fuel claddings currently used in light-water reactors.

The FMR’s conceptual design work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy through an Advanced Reactor Concepts 2020 (ARC-20) award, part of the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program.

Funding supported General Atomics’ strategic partnerships with other companies, academia and national laboratories to successfully verify the technical feasibility of the FMR design, helping to progress the advanced reactor design in its early phase.

Dr. Christina Back, Vice President of General Atomics said, “The ARC-20 program has supported critical advances in the gas-cooled fast reactor concept and demonstration of robust materials that enable an added layer of safety, while still enabling operation without the need for a water source. These features facilitate siting and compatibility for small communities and diverse applications, including the recycling of used nuclear fuel.”

What’s Next?

General Atomics has submitted their Principal Design Criteria and the Quality Assurance Plan Description licensing documents to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The NRC also docketed several pre-application FMR documents that will be referenced in the future license application when General Atomics submits future formal licensing documents.

The proposed Fast Modular Reactor (FMR) is designed to generate 44 megawatts of firm electricity. The system utilizes silicon carbide-wrapped high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel.

With the completion of the conceptual design, General Atomics is moving to the preliminary design phase. Future planned activities include safety-related testing, and work to further develop fuel, materials, and power conversion system components. Work will lead to the final design phase, which will include construction, non-nuclear tests, and receiving HALEU for fuel fabrication.

The prototypes of the FMR fuel rods fabricated during the conceptual design process are undergoing irradiation testing at Idaho National Laboratory to experimentally verify their integrity.

This technology, referred to as SiGA, utilizes a silicon carbide composite material intended to form the basis of fuel rods capable of withstanding temperatures exceeding the limits of currently used materials. The multilayer composite cladding structure is designed to provide high-temperature resilience for both current and future reactor systems.

Westinghouse And Google Partner Using AI To Speed Up Nuclear Construction

Early pilot of technology shows significant time and cost savings

(NucNet) Westinghouse announced a partnership with Google Cloud to develop a custom AI-powered platform using specialized models that help optimize and accelerate the construction of nuclear power plants. Google said in a statement that early pilots of the platform have shown significant time and cost savings. The companies are also exploring ways for AI to help enhance nuclear operations and safety.

The core AI innovation targets the construction process, which historically represent 60% of reactor costs. Until recently, construction management relied on spreadsheets and paper documents, leading to delays that cascaded across thousands of interdependent tasks. Westinghouse turned decades of documentation to its advantage by loading them into an AI application.

The new AI system combines the companies’ AI models and prediction tools with Westinghouse’s WNEXUS, a 3D digital twin of its reactors. When combined with current and historic data, the system can predict bottlenecks, optimize construction task sequences, adjust staffing levels and account for external factors like supply chain constraints.

The optimization technology for new reactor construction is built using a “technology brick approach”, said Lou Martinez Sancho, Westinghouse’s chief technology officer and executive vice-president of R&D and innovation. He added that this means the technology has applications far beyond the initial project.

Google’s AI tools are being applied to reduce licensing processes and operations timing. By finding the fastest path through maintenance and refuelling tasks, the AI helps minimize reactor downtime.

Westinghouse CEO Dan Sumner has stressed that AI-driven decision-making optimization is essential to making nuclear power a viable investment for utilities and addressing energy urgency.

The company has already established its own proprietary AI infrastructure, Hive, designed specifically to meet the nuclear sector’s stringent regulatory and export-control frameworks. It also developed Bertha, a generative AI assistant that instantly accesses 75 years of nuclear knowledge and documentation at Westinghouse. The firm said that early use of the AI tools showed positive results in terms of reducing construction costs.

Google has increasingly looked towards nuclear energy as a key power source for its operations. In October, the company signed a 25-year Power Purchase Agreement with NextEra Energy to offtake power from its 615MW Duane Arnold Energy Center in Palo, Iowa. The agreement will support restarting the plant, which has been shuttered since 2020.

Raiford Smith, Google Cloud’s global director of Power & Energy, noted that energy now “underpins economic growth, data-center expansion and 24/7 carbon-free goals.”

Google has signed several nuclear energy deals. These include a 200 MW PPA with Commonwealth Fusion Systems for fusion power, a 50 MW PPA with SMR reactor firm Kairos Power, and a strategic agreement with Elementl Power to develop three nuclear energy projects in the US. The location and timing of these projects are still to be determined.",https://neutronbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/x-energy-triso-fuel_thumb.png,N,,2025-11-30 12:00:59.149004

Chronic underinvestment, overregulation, deindustrialization, and fragmentation have left Europe’s defense industrial base too small, too slow, and incapable of meeting its security needs.
The world’s economic center of gravity has long since shifted away from Europe and the Atlantic toward the Indo-Pacific.","“Nothing grows in the shadow of great trees,” said the sculptor Constantin Brâncuși when he left his master, Rodin. He wasn’t rebelling for rebellion’s sake; he was claiming the space to become himself. He spoke of art, but he might as well have been speaking of today’s Europe.

Europe has long mistaken comfort for strength. Under the protective shelter of the United States, it outsourced its own defense, convinced that diplomacy and regulatory power could substitute for hard power. Under the seductive efficiency of China’s manufacturing engine, it outsourced its industrial backbone, trusting that access to cheap technology and components would last forever. And under the lure of Russian energy, it outsourced its security, mistaking abundant gas and oil for lasting leverage.

Europe’s energy transition is largely powered by Chinese technology. Over 98 percent of imported solar panels come from China, which also dominates the rare earth and magnet industry—controlling roughly 70 percent of global mine production, 90 percent of refining, and 94 percent of permanent magnet manufacturing. These materials are critical for everything from renewable energy to EVs and high-tech devices.

Europe is barely in the game when it comes to artificial intelligence, a competition dominated by two giants. In 2024, U.S.-based institutions produced forty notable AI models, compared with China’s fifteen and Europe’s three. The continent also relies heavily on major American companies for digital infrastructure and cloud services, as recent disruptions from an AWS server outage have shown. It has no hyperscalers of its own.

Moreover, red tape is choking tech development. The Draghi report mentions that the bloc has roughly 100 tech-focused laws and more than 270 regulators overseeing digital networks across all member states.

Defense isn’t much better. Reliance on the U.S. has hollowed out Europe’s capabilities, as the war in Ukraine has shown. Defense spending sits at just 1.9% of GDP in 2024. The gap is even starker in R&D, where the U.S. outinvested Europe by nearly €120 billion in 2023. The problem is not a shortage of know-how but of scale and strategic vision. Chronic underinvestment, overregulation, deindustrialization, and fragmentation have left Europe’s defense industrial base too small, too slow, and incapable of meeting its security needs.

The world’s economic center of gravity has long since shifted away from Europe and the Atlantic toward the Indo-Pacific. Home to more than half the planet’s population, nearly two-thirds of global GDP growth, and the world’s busiest trade routes, that region now anchors global security and prosperity.

Once, Venice was a great power. But when the center of gravity moved from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, it failed to adapt and ended up as a city living off tourism and relics. Europe risks the same fate through a slow “Venetization” of its own. Unless it awakens, it too will become an open-air museum of its own past glories.

For as long as the Atlantic system dominated, Europe’s internal weaknesses—its fragmented market, sluggish productivity, sprawling bureaucracy, and energy dependence—remained hidden. But under the current geopolitical realities, those weaknesses are no longer manageable.

If Europe’s leaders fail to think strategically and in global competitive terms, the continent will fall even further behind. The pressure from Washington, particularly under Donald Trump, may be self-serving, but it also acts as a wake-up call. Europe can no longer afford to depend on others for its defense. The long shadow of the United States, especially since the end of the Cold War, has atrophied Europe’s strategic muscles and discouraged the growth of a competitive defense industry.

Economic dependence breeds political timidity. A continent that relies on others for its energy, technology, and critical resources cannot claim real independence. As Mario Draghi warned, Europe’s maze of regulations, fragmented markets, and chronic underinvestment are stifling its ability to compete. Europe survived every storm since the Cold War, but it lets others decide which way the wind blows.

Europe must take tough decisions. That means making choices that often seem politically impossible within the short cycles of national politics: pooling defense capabilities, building genuine capital markets, investing jointly in next-generation technologies, and accepting that sovereignty shared among Europeans is stronger than sovereignty borrowed from others.

Europe now needs a new “whatever it takes” moment, not to save its currency, but to save its future. It must find the courage to think and act on its own terms, to grow and compete on its own strength rather than rely on others for protection, power, or purpose.

Constantin Brâncuși left Auguste Rodin’s studio despite his admiration for the master. Europe now faces the same moment of truth. It is more a question of will rather than means. It can either cling to a fading shelter, protected, supplied, and slowly diminished, or step into the light and learn to stand on its own. Stepping into the light does not mean turning its back on its allies, but standing tall beside them.",https://moderndiplomacy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/european-union.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 11:01:02.343241

The European continent has been embracing the renewable energy market with open arms in recent years, with Italy serving the global hydrogen demand that has emerged over the past few years. The all-new decade-long agreement between the two companies sets the stage for a long and prosperous project in Italy.

Italy’s Hydrogen Valley Rosignano Project is reaching a new milestone

The renewable energy sector has been growing at an astonishing rate in recent years as more nations around the world finally accept the realization that the generational reliance on fossil fuel-based energy production needs to come to an end. Climate change has become so severe that it has devastated numerous regions of the world, so something needs to change. Up steps hydrogen power to save the day, hopefully.

To combat climate change, several nations are turning to the renewable energy market to decarbonize their energy markets. In that regard, Italy is progressing in its plans to develop the Hydrogen Valley Rosignano Project by enabling Solvay and Sapio to enter into a 10-year deal to develop renewable hydrogen for the project, marking a turning point in the European hydrogen dream.

Solvay’s Rosignano site is set to receive significant support from Sapio’s solar expertise

The new agreement calls for Solvay to construct a new 5 MW electrolysis plant, while Solvay will install a 10 MW solar photovoltaic system to provide the site with the required power. With the expected completion date set for mid-2026, the project is expected to produce approximately 756 tonnes of renewable hydrogen, marking a 15% reduction in CO₂ emissions at the site.

The new project was officially launched in November this year

At a groundbreaking ceremony attended by the most prominent officials in the Italian energy sector, the energy firms highlighted the importance the project will play in Italy’s clean energy transition and emission reduction ambitions. Italy has been working exceedingly hard in recent years to fast-track any projects that may enable the energy transition to renewable power.

The green hydrogen produced on-site will supply Solvay’s peroxide manufacturing operations, which serve a multitude of sectors across the world. The partnership exemplifies the cooperative nature of the global energy market as nations aim to boost investments in the renewable energy market. Europe’s positive sentiment for renewable energy projects has become all too evident in recent months.

“Our partnership with Sapio represents a good example in how we enhance our global peroxide operations. This project is a key part of our broader strategy to support essential industries – from electronics and water treatment to energy and food safety – with more sustainable solutions. – Carlos Silveira, President of Solvay Peroxides’ business

Building on the statement from Solvay’s leadership, Sapio’s CEO noted that “We are extremely proud of our collaboration with Solvay: this project, funded by the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP).”

“There is a demand pull that gives investors optimism,” said Adam Stein, director of nuclear energy innovation at the Breakthrough Institute, which seeks an expansion of nuclear power.
Its effort to license a new form of nuclear energy technology failed during the Biden administration.
“You would get acute radiation syndrome,” said Nick Touran, a nuclear reactor physicist, who called Valar out on X.
There are people who are building nuclear reactors on time, on budget in the world today.”","The fledgling Texas company Fermi America has yet to produce an electron, split an atom or survive the torturous gantlet of regulatory and manufacturing obstacles required to build a nuclear reactor.

But investors are betting big that the Trump administration will help Fermi turn from a glossy, aspirational marketing brochure into a cutting-edge nuclear operation to meet the rapacious energy needs of AI data centers. So much so that they catapulted its founders into the ranks of the world’s richest men a few months after Fermi filed paperwork with regulators to build the “Donald J. Trump Advanced Energy and Intelligence Campus.”

Typically, a company’s revenue, track record and market advantage drive valuations. But in the age of President Donald Trump’s promised nuclear revival, shareholders and backers see connections to the White House as the road to profitability, investment analysts and longtime industry insiders say.

Fermi was founded by three men: Rick Perry, who served as Texas governor and was U.S. energy secretary during Trump’s first term; Perry’s investor son; and the son of a former Texas congressman celebrated by the right when he founded an “anti-woke” bank that later failed.

“If you or I launched the same business, our valuation would be zero,” said Raphaëlle d’Ornano, whose firm Decoding Discontinuity advises investors on AI-related start-ups.

Fermi’s corporate blueprint, d’Ornano said, essentially signals to investors “we have no proven execution capabilities in this field but what we do have is a team of politically connected people who make us believe attaining the needed regulatory clearance should not be too much of a problem.”

Fermi is not an outlier. Other Trump-connected companies with untested business plans are brimming with cash infusions and winning regulators’ favor.

They include the advanced reactor developer Oklo, where Energy Secretary Chris Wright was a board member; General Matter, a uranium enrichment start-up where former Trump megadonor and adviser Peter Thiel is a board director and funder; and Valar Atomics, a small California reactor company backed by major Trump donor Palmer Luckey and Shyam Sankar, the chief technology officer of Palantir Technologies, a firm closely aligned with the White House. Some of the companies are leapfrogging past far more seasoned firms.

“They assume there is something shiny, new and fancy just waiting for a Steve Jobs of nuclear,” said Chris Keefer, co-founder of Canadians for Nuclear Energy. “It is creating valuations that are probably wildly out of touch with what these companies are capable of.”

Energy Department officials said nuclear approvals are subject to rigorous regulatory review. They referred questions about the firms’ political connections to the White House, which declined to answer them.

These firms are far from the only ones working on advances in nuclear power. BWXT, a longtime military contractor, is developing new small commercial reactors. Industry leader Westinghouse recently signed an $80 billion deal with the Trump administration to build large legacy reactors across the nation. Even relative newcomer TerraPower, an advanced reactor firm founded by Bill Gates, is further along than other start-ups, having broken ground for a commercial plant in Wyoming.

Some in the industry say investor excitement makes sense as dozens of new firms compete to meet AI’s exploding need for power.

“There is a demand pull that gives investors optimism,” said Adam Stein, director of nuclear energy innovation at the Breakthrough Institute, which seeks an expansion of nuclear power. “The market sees companies close to the administration as having the best chance for success, as would be the case in any administration.”

The start-ups chafe at the characterization that they’re merely trading on connections.

“Ask the world’s leading investors and potential customers who watch our site via satellite, and they will tell you they marvel at what we’ve already accomplished,” Fermi CEO Toby Neugebauer, son of former congressman Randy Neugebauer, R-Texas, said in an interview.

Neugebauer, a GOP megadonor who lives in a home styled after the White House, is referring to a large patch of land near Amarillo where the company hopes to have reactors operating by 2032, a timeline experts say is unheard of, and has already started building gas plants to generate additional power.

He said he has hired highly accomplished nuclear executives and argued that some of the nation’s most complicated energy undertakings were launched by small groups of entrepreneurs.

The combined net worth on paper of Toby Neugebauer and his father – a major investor in Fermi – surged to $5 billion when he and the Perrys took their company public nine months after forming it. Griffin Perry, the son of the former Texas governor, saw his net worth grow to $2 billion, according to Forbes. Their fortunes have since fluctuated with the stock price.

Oklo is another darling of Wall Street speculators, despite zero revenue and no licensed reactors. Its effort to license a new form of nuclear energy technology failed during the Biden administration.

After Trump invited Oklo co-founder Jacob DeWitte to join him in the Oval Office for the signing of executive orders boosting companies developing advanced reactors, the firm’s stock surged.

Oklo, with its 188 employees, at times last month was valued higher than industry powerhouse BWXT, a nearly 10,000-employee company that has sold hundreds of reactors to the military over many decades.

DeWitte and co-founder Caroline DeWitte, his wife, are also on the Forbes list of billionaires now. The couple cashed out $90 million in Oklo stock this year, cementing some of those paper gains.

“If we look at all of Oklo’s insider activities, there is little to no purchasing of stock,” said Michael Seely, an industry consultant who advises investors on nuclear firms. “It is all selling, at somewhat regular intervals. If you were confident the company will succeed, you would not be doing that.”

DeWitte said in an interview that the stock sales were scheduled before the firm’s valuation surged, as part of the couple’s plan to unload a set amount of shares at fixed times. He said investors value firms like his higher than legacy government contractors because Oklo is oriented toward solutions for energy needed for AI data centers.

BWXT, he said, “doesn’t necessarily have the same pace and rate of growth opportunity that I think investors are expecting and seeing from groups, like us, that are facing a lot more towards the AI side.”

BWXT does not agree. “BWXT has built an unmatched reputation in the nuclear industry through delivery, including the production of fuel and components for more than 420 nuclear reactors,” Joe Miller, who leads its government operations, said in an email.

Wright has forfeited his interest in Oklo and, according to DOE, recuses himself from decisions involving the company. But Oklo’s White House ties remain strong: Interior Secretary Doug Burgum traveled to Idaho Falls in September to help Oklo break ground for a pilot plant.

The Trump administration has fast-tracked some start-ups that are cagey about technologies or reviving designs that sputtered previously.

The uranium enrichment company General Matter has not even disclosed which process it would use to enrich uranium. Yet, after its April public launch, the firm won a valuable federal land lease in Paducah, Kentucky, where enrichment took place during the Cold War. Company officials say they briefed regulators on their technology but do not share that information publicly “due to security concerns,” an unusual position in the industry.

General Matter has yet to build anything but is now thought by company officials and competitors to be a front-runner to receive subsidies valued at as much as $900 million to construct enrichment operations, over competing bids by established firms that have already completed large-scale projects.

General Matter CEO Scott Nolan was one of only three nuclear executives, along with Oklo’s DeWitte and the CEO of Constellation Energy, invited to join Trump in the Oval Office when he signed executive orders in May and hailed a nuclear “renaissance.”

Newcomer Valar Atomics, where company leaders wear “Make Nuclear Great Again” hats, is partnering with DOE and Utah to build a test reactor there. It was selected, along with Oklo, for a federal program to help companies make fuel needed for next-generation reactors.

Valar’s 26-year-old CEO, Isaiah Taylor, was the subject of a July feature in the American Conservative, where he praised the current administration and attacked earlier energy policy as being driven by the left’s misguided climate obsessions. Three years ago, he wrote on LinkedIn that he was destined to build several multibillion-dollar companies.

Valar declares on a company webpage that “holding the spent fuel from [its] system for five minutes gives the equivalent radiation exposure to receiving a CAT scan.” Nuclear engineers were appalled by his claims.

“You would get acute radiation syndrome,” said Nick Touran, a nuclear reactor physicist, who called Valar out on X. “You would have a fatal dose within seconds. The gamma rays kill enough of your cells – white blood cells first – that your body loses ability to have an immune system and you would die a quite painful death in a couple of weeks.”

Taylor released company data to back the safety claim, but other engineers said it only bolstered Touran’s criticism. Taylor promised further explanation in a post on X, but it never came. Valar did not respond to requests for comment.

DOE said in its statement that all the firms selected for its pilot reactor program, including Valar, passed rigorous safety reviews.

Longtime nuclear proponents are bewildered to see firms that publicly have shared only vague safety plans and engineering blueprints getting expedited approvals.

Keefer, the Canadian nuclear energy advocate, warned that investors in these firms risk a major reckoning. Oklo, for instance, is trying to make commercially viable a new type of reactor that Keefer said even the government of China, with its advantages in nuclear energy, has struggled to make pencil out despite 15 years of effort.

In fact, during the Biden administration, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission found a similar Oklo reactor plan inadequate.

“It’s not like the NRC asks for an extraordinary amount of information,” said a former nuclear official who was involved in reviewing Oklo’s failed application and spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing their work in the industry. “The NRC asks three questions: What is the worst that can happen, what are the systems, structures and components in your reactor that prevents that from happening, and how do you know that?”

“Oklo would only answer them at a very high level,” the person said. “They wanted to say nothing bad can happen to our reactor.”

DeWitte said Oklo had planned a robust public rebuttal but claims that at the time, NRC officials “threatened us, in a retributional way, not to issue a response letter to correct the record.”

“Well, they’re gone now,” he added.

Scott Burnell, an NRC spokesman, did not respond to the allegation. In an email, he referred to the agency’s official denial letter and said the agency is working with Oklo on a new application.

DeWitte argues the company is well positioned to demonstrate that its test reactor is capable of creating electricity as soon as next summer. But he acknowledged building turnkey reactors that can produce sustained, uninterrupted electricity could take years longer.

The Trump administration is working to help companies such as Oklo succeed by changing safety reviews in ways that unnerve many safety advocates.

Some of the independent agency’s traditional safety reviews for projects such as Oklo’s reactor will be handled instead by the Energy Department, which is led by political appointees. The NRC and the administration signed an agreement in October saying that safety “risks that have already been addressed in DOE review” will not be revisited by the NRC.

Burnell said in his email that if DOE “thoroughly tests a reactor design and shows it operates safely, the NRC will build on that work, not repeat it.”

Even so, several conservative states have joined Valar and other nuclear start-ups in suing the NRC, arguing that the federal agency has overstepped its authority by regulating smaller nuclear reactors the companies claim are inherently safe. The plaintiffs say licensing for such plants should be left to the states. The agency declined to comment on the lawsuit.

For its part, Fermi argues it can build the same type of reactors already operating across the country – but do it exponentially cheaper and faster. Since modern safety standards were established in the 1970s, even the most experienced developers have not met anything close to Fermi’s timeline to have a reactor turned on by 2032.

The last such reactors were seven years behind schedule and $7 billion over budget by the time they went online in Georgia in 2023. South Carolina utilities burned through $9 billion before scrapping a similar project, and executives involved were later convicted of making false promises to investors.

Skeptics caution that Fermi could be destined for the same fate as Neugebauer’s last buzzy start-up, Glorifi. The bank, which promoted credit cards made out of bullet casings and homeowner’s insurance discounts for gun owners, went bankrupt and landed in the “Museum of Failure,” a traveling collection of entrepreneurial “failures and mistakes.”

Neugebauer said Glorifi inspired other “anti-woke” financial firms and is “the crowning achievement of my career.” He is adamant, though, that Fermi will succeed.

“We’re not playing the Washington game,” he said. “We’re playing the let’s-go-build-these-with-people-who’ve-done-it game. There are people who are building nuclear reactors on time, on budget in the world today.”",https://thumb.spokesman.com/5j2YS-6mJNyRTfN7QtQFjka0_BA=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2025/11/27/6928ea1e6bbd1.hires.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 11:01:45.068194

Household-battery startup Base Power Inc. raised $1 billion to expand its energy-storage business and build a manufacturing plant in Texas.

The Series C funding round led by venture capital firm Addition included other existing investors such as Lightspeed Venture Partners, Andreessen Horowitz and Altimeter, the company said in a statement Wednesday. Base Power, co-founded by entrepreneur Zach Dell, will use the proceeds to boost energy-storage production.

“We’re building domestic manufacturing capacity for fixing the grid,” Chief Operating Officer Justin Lopas said. “This factory in Austin is our first, and we’re already planning for our second.”

Battery companies are expanding in the US as the need to support the nation’s aging power grid grows amid rising electricity demand from data centers and widening electrification of the economy.

Base installs residential backup power systems at a fraction of the cost of traditional natural gas- or propane-fueled generators. Under Dell’s business model, the batteries are charged when local electricity prices are low.

But during high-demand periods, such as heat waves or cold snaps, Base can tap a portion of those stored electrons to capture price differentials while ensuring each homeowner retains ample spare electricity to avoid power blips or blackouts.

The new facility will enable Base to “build our own hardware to meet surging demand and scale nationwide,” Dell wrote in a post on X. “This is a key step in putting a battery on every home in the country.”

“I told all of them, elect a Democrat, and your bills will go up some more.” Data centers have been a prominent issue in Atlanta’s rural exurbs.","As loyal Republicans, Reece Payton said that he and his family of cattle ranchers in Hogansville, Ga., had one thing on their minds when they cast their ballots in November for the state’s utility board — “to make a statement.”

They were already irked by their escalating electric bills, not to mention an extra $50 a month levied by their local utility to cover a new nuclear power plant more than 200 miles away. But after they heard a data center might be built next to their Logos Ranch, about 60 miles southwest of Atlanta, they had enough of Republicans who seemed far too receptive to the interests of the booming artificial intelligence industry.

“That’s the first time I ever voted Democrat,” Mr. Payton, 58, said.

Message sent.

In some of Georgia’s reddest and most rural counties, Republicans crossed party lines this month and helped propel two Democrats, Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson, to landslide upsets, ousting the incumbent candidates on the Georgia Public Service Commission. No Democrat has served on the five-person commission, which regulates utilities and helps set climate and energy policy, since 2007.

Across the country, Democrats have seized on rising anxiety over electricity costs and data centers in what could be a template for the 2026 midterm elections.

In Virginia, Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger pledged during her campaign to lower energy bills and make data centers pay more. In the House of Delegates, one Democratic challenger unseated a Republican incumbent by focusing on curbing the proliferation of data centers in Loudoun County and the exurbs of the nation’s capital.

In New Jersey, Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill promised to declare a state of emergency on utility costs and freeze rates. And in Memphis, State Representative Justin J. Pearson, who is challenging Representative Steve Cohen in a high-profile Democratic primary next year, has vowed to fight a supercomputer by Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, that would be located in a predominantly Black neighborhood.

Strong opposition by citizens forced the Tucson City Council in August to pull the plug on an Amazon data center slated for that Arizona city, and then in September forced Google to call off one in Indianapolis.

“Electricity is the new price of eggs,” said Charles Hua, executive director of Powerlines, a nonpartisan organization which aims to modernize utility regulations and reduce power bills. “This is a defining moment for politicians of all stripes — what’s your answer to lowering utility bills? Because I think consumers and voters are looking for leadership on this.”

After meeting recently with Virginia legislators, Mr. Hua said he was struck by how “the nexus of data centers and utility bills actually came up very consistently.”

In 2022, a spike in natural gas prices following the Russian invasion of Ukraine fueled a rise in energy costs around the U.S. Utilities have also undertaken costly projects to modernize the power grid and improve the infrastructure to guard against extreme weather and absorb an anticipated surge in demand from data centers.

As the price of electricity has risen, more American customers have fallen behind on their utility bills, or have had their power cut off.

Georgia ranks 35th in energy affordability, in part because of cost overruns and delays associated with its new Plant Vogtle nuclear generators in Waynesboro, according to the American Legislative Exchange Council, an influential conservative policy group.

So it wasn’t a surprise when Attorney General Chris Carr and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger — candidates in the Republican primary to succeed term-limited Gov. Brian Kemp — called November’s results a referendum on affordability. “You’re a fool if you don’t recognize that,” Mr. Carr said.

Some Georgia Republicans have cautioned against reading too much into the 25-percentage-point losses suffered by the utility board incumbents, Tim Echols and Fitz Johnson.

This year’s elections stemmed from a 2020 federal lawsuit, which contended that the statewide elections for commission seats, which represent geographic districts, were unfair to Black voters. An appeals court eventually ruled against the plaintiffs, but the legal battle delayed the elections — setting the stage for November’s two races, the only statewide ones this year. (Two more utility seats will be contested in 2026.)

Democratic turnout was also boosted, Republicans said, by municipal elections in strongholds like Atlanta.

“I think it’s a complete anomaly,” State Senator Greg Dolezal said at a Republican event in Valdosta to tout his candidacy for lieutenant governor next year. Noting the comfortable margins racked up by President Trump in 2024 and Mr. Kemp in 2022, he added, “There’s no planet on which a 65-35 split is representative.”

One plaintiff in the lawsuit was Brionté McCorkle, executive director of Georgia Conservation Voters. She said the lawsuit enabled advocacy groups to develop a plan to help people “connect the dots” between the bills they were receiving and the commission’s role in approving six rate increases for Georgia Power, the state’s largest electric provider, over the last two years.

The group’s political action fund spent $2.3 million, sending half a million texts, plastering 92 billboards across the state and producing an anti-incumbent website.

That outreach made a difference, she said, pointing to Lowndes and Brooks counties on the Florida border. In previous races for federal and state offices going back to 2018, including the public service commission, Republicans won there by 20 points.

This year, Mr. Echols and Mr. Johnson each lost by 20 points.

At a weekly food pantry run by South Street Care House in Valdosta, Ga., where dozens of cars had lined up to receive a box full of fresh fruits, vegetables, breads and other staples, several people said they had heard about the election through texts and social media.

Barbara Lehman, 66, is typically a reliable Republican, but not this time, according to her daughter Angela and granddaughter Shelby, who were among those waiting for food.

“If the power companies want to expand their business, then that should be on them, not the consumer,” Ms. Lehman said in a text message. “Some people are just barely making it as it is.”

At the event attended by Mr. Dolezal and two other candidates for statewide offices, Gary McMillan, a former chair of the Lowndes County Republican Party, said that he, too, knew Republicans who bucked the party.

“They said my electric bills keep going up, and Republicans control the public service commission, and I’ve got a problem with that,” Mr. McMillan recounted. “I told all of them, elect a Democrat, and your bills will go up some more.”

Data centers have been a prominent issue in Atlanta’s rural exurbs. Mr. Trump wants to accelerate their growth in the battle for A.I. supremacy. At least 26 are under construction within 60 miles of Atlanta, and another 52 are planned.

But some Georgia Republicans — including Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is resigning her seat in January — have questioned the facilities’ use of resources. Some residents say local wells have been damaged, and the cost of municipal water has climbed.

Good Jobs First, a liberal group that tracks tax breaks for corporations, has said the state has done a poor job disclosing subsidies for data centers. The public service commission’s own staff has also warned that monthly residential bills could climb by $20 a month or more (a figure disputed by the utility) if the commission approves Georgia Power’s proposal to add almost 10,000 megawatts of power to accommodate data centers — the equivalent of nine nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle.

Only one-third of that proposal should be approved, the staff recommended.

In Troup County on the Alabama border, the victorious Democratic utility candidates whittled 24-point romps enjoyed by the Republican candidates in 2020 and 2018 down to 10, thanks to voters like the Paytons.

The Paytons had never been to a Hogansville City Council meeting before they heard about a proposal to build a data center on 437 acres next to their ranch, and across from their Georgia Untamed Zoo, which houses animals like sloths and capybaras and is popular with school field trips. Now they’ve been to two, and counting.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/26/multimedia/00nat-electricity-politics-data-lvpw/00nat-electricity-politics-data-lvpw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 10:02:14.379985

“Canada is acting decisively to establish ourselves as a global energy superpower in the face of a changing world.","CALGARY — On Nov. 27, Prime Minister Mark Carney and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on shared energy missions. This agreement intends to strengthen federal-provincial collaboration in the energy sector to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, utilize Alberta’s energy resources, and create more careers for Canadians.

Per a Nov. 27 press release, Canada and Alberta will collaborate on multiple projects to build Canada’s economy and meet growing energy demands. It will advance the construction of Pathways Plus, reportedly the world’s largest carbon capture, utilisation, and storage project.

The agreement centres around a new pipeline to the British Columbia coast. The MOU states that upon receipt of a proposal from the Government of Alberta, the Government of Canada will provide an approval process under the Building Canada Act for the construction to be financed and constructed by the private sector, with Indigenous Peoples’ ownership and benefits. The pipeline would reportedly transport at least one million barrels per day to Asian markets as a priority.

“In the face of global trade shifts and profound uncertainty, Canada and Alberta are striking a new partnership to build a stronger, more sustainable, and more independent Albertan and Canadian economy. We will make Canada an energy superpower, drive down our emissions and diversify our export markets. We want to build big things, and we’re building bigger and faster together,” said Carney.

The MOU advances multiple clean energy projects including an industrial carbon pricing agreement for the province and an agreement to lower methane emissions by 75% over the next decade. Additional initiatives intend to enable Alberta to build nuclear power generation, reinforce the electricity grid to power AI data centres, and build large transmission interties with British Columbia and Saskatchewan.

The federal government states that these projects will only be built in consultation and partnership with Indigenous rights-holders and British Columbia. They will reportedly create opportunities for Indigenous co-ownership, partnership, and economic benefits.

“Canada is acting decisively to establish ourselves as a global energy superpower in the face of a changing world. Together, Canada and Alberta will not only export critical energy to our customers, we will also support our allies, create hundreds of thousands of jobs here at home, and show that our energy sector can lead on a global stage,” said Tim Hodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources.",https://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/favicon.png,N,,2025-11-30 10:00:38.347830
,American Energy,2025-11-30 13:31:07+00:00,the Guardian,Power surge: law changes could soon bring balcony solar to millions across US,"Oliver Milman, www.theguardian.com, oliver-milman",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/30/balcony-solar-power-states-laws,"But small, simple, plug-in solar panels for use on balconies are soon to become available for millions of Americans, with advocates hoping the technology will quickly go mainstream.

A further five states could join the rush in the next few months, according to Kevin Chou, executive director of Bright Saver, a non-profit that champions the adoption of balcony solar panels.

But small, simple, plug-in solar panels for use on balconies are soon to become available for millions of Americans, with advocates hoping the technology will quickly go mainstream.

Earlier this year, Utah became the first state in the country to pass legislation allowing people to purchase and install small, portable solar panels that plug into a standard wall socket.

When attached outside to the balcony or patio of a dwelling, such panels can provide enough power for residents to run free of charge, home appliances such as fridges, dishwashers, washing machines and wi-fi without spending money on electricity from the grid.

Balcony solar panels are now widespread in countries such as Germany – where more than 1m homes have them – but have until now been stymied in the US by state regulations. This is set to change, with lawmakers in New York and Pennsylvania filing bills to join Utah in adopting permission for the panels, with Vermont, Maryland and New Hampshire set to follow suit soon.

“Plug-in solar is a powerful tool to deliver enhanced energy independence and affordability to millions of New Yorkers who are currently shut out of the solar economy,” said Liz Krueger, a New York state senator who has sponsored a bill to allow balcony solar.

Krueger said that her tweak to state law will be “a gamechanger for renters, low-income New Yorkers, and many others who can’t install rooftop solar”.

A further five states could join the rush in the next few months, according to Kevin Chou, executive director of Bright Saver, a non-profit that champions the adoption of balcony solar panels.

“There’s now so much interest in this,” said Chou. “The federal administration has been so negative to clean energy that people have thought ‘OK what can we do at the state level?’ and this has been one of those things.

“There’s real momentum behind this now. In states where electricity is more expensive, in particular, I think we will see market forces really carry this far.”

As with solar panels that are attached to a building’s roof, or arrayed in fields, balcony solar soaks up the sun, albeit on a smaller scale. It then feeds this clean energy, via an inverter, into the wall socket. The panels themselves are smaller than standard rooftop panels and can be zip-tied in place without professional installation.

They sell for the equivalent of about $300 in Germany, with more expensive versions for $1,500 and upwards, that include some battery storage that can continue to feed in solar power to the home once the sun has vanished for the day.

All of this power is sufficient to run most home appliances for free, although it isn’t enough for larger family homes that have substantial air conditioning units or require charging for an electric vehicle.

“If you’re a single person living at home it can power all of your needs, but not for a family of six,” said Chou. “This isn’t a silver bullet or anything, it could maybe knock 5% off emissions. But it is an easy thing to do, it’s convenient and it can save people money. At the moment, there aren’t many wins happening for the climate and this can be one.”

A major barrier to balcony solar, though, has been the regulatory system across states, which typically requires anyone who installs solar panels to strike an agreement with the local utility for the power they are feeding back to the grid.

The installation of panels also typically has to be done by contractors and is inspected. This regime, plus inconsistent federal and state incentives for solar, means that only about 7% of US homes have rooftop solar, far less than some other countries. In Australia, for example, more than one in three households have rooftop solar.

In Utah, state legislator Raymond Ward was intrigued after reading about balcony solar and realized a minor adjustment to the law would allow Utahns to purchase the technology. His legislation carved out an exemption from interconnection agreements for people generating 1.2 kilowatt of power or less.

“The state law said that if you put any power back on the grid, even one electron, you need a contract with the utility, which is just crazy,” said Ward, who is a Republican.

“No one opposed the change. I fully expect 10 other legislatures in 2026 will run a bill like this, and more and more people will become interested in this. It will definitely happen.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/997e791ece5cc1681d149264ea11d93783969b69/898_0_4650_3721/master/4650.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ac0018441a7808c443a8b98f6e1d928b",N,,2025-11-30 10:02:18.629125

Mr. Sacks opened the event by describing his White House experience as “incredible” and hailing the administration’s work on A.I.","In July, David Sacks, one of the Trump administration’s top technology officials, beamed as he strode onstage at a neoclassical auditorium just blocks from the White House. He had convened top government officials and Silicon Valley executives for a forum on the booming business of artificial intelligence.

The guest of honor was President Trump, who unveiled an “A.I. Action Plan” that was drafted in part by Mr. Sacks, a longtime venture capitalist. In a nearly hourlong speech, Mr. Trump declared that A.I. was “one of the most important technological revolutions in the history of the world.” Then he picked up his pen and signed executive orders to fast-track the industry.

Almost everyone in the high-powered audience — which included the chief executives of the chipmakers Nvidia and AMD, as well as Mr. Sacks’s tech friends, colleagues and business partners — were poised to profit from Mr. Trump’s directives.

Among the winners was Mr. Sacks himself.

Since January, Mr. Sacks, 53, has occupied one of the most advantageous moonlighting roles in the federal government, influencing policy for Silicon Valley in Washington while simultaneously working in Silicon Valley as an investor. Among his actions as the White House’s artificial intelligence and crypto czar:

Mr. Sacks has offered astonishing White House access to his tech industry compatriots and pushed to eliminate government obstacles facing A.I. companies. That has set up giants like Nvidia to reap an estimate of as much as $200 billion in new sales.

Mr. Sacks has recommended A.I. policies that have sometimes run counter to national security recommendations, alarming some of his White House colleagues and raising questions about his priorities.

Mr. Sacks has positioned himself to personally benefit. He has 708 tech investments, including at least 449 stakes in companies with ties to artificial intelligence that could be aided directly or indirectly by his policies, according to a New York Times analysis of his financial disclosures.

His public filings designate 438 of his tech investments as software or hardware companies, even though the firms promote themselves as A.I. enterprises, offer A.I. services or have A.I. in their names, The Times found.

Mr. Sacks has raised the profile of his weekly podcast, “All-In,” through his government role, and expanded its business.

No event better illustrates Mr. Sacks’s ethical complexities and how his intertwined interests have come together than the July A.I. summit. Mr. Sacks initially planned for the forum to be hosted by “All-In,” which he leads with other tech investors. “All-In” asked potential sponsors to each pay it $1 million for access to a private reception and other events at the summit “bringing together President Donald Trump and leading A.I. innovators,” according to a proposal viewed by The Times.

The plan so worried some officials that Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, intervened to prevent “All-In"" from serving as the sole host of the forum, two people with knowledge of the episode said.

Steve Bannon, a former adviser to Mr. Trump and a critic of Silicon Valley billionaires, said Mr. Sacks was a quintessential example of ethical conflicts in an administration where “the tech bros are out of control.”

“They are leading the White House down the road to perdition with this ascendant technocratic oligarchy,” he said.

Mr. Sacks has been allowed to serve in government while working in private industry because he is a “special government employee,” a title the White House typically confers on experts who temporarily advise the government. He is not paid for his work for the administration.

But Mr. Sacks stands out as a special government employee because of his hundreds of investments in tech companies, which can benefit from policies that he influences. His public ethics filings, which are based on self-reported information, do not disclose the value of those remaining stakes in crypto and A.I.-related companies. They also omit when he sold assets he said he would divest, making it difficult to determine whether his government service has netted him profits.

A White House spokeswoman, Liz Huston, said Mr. Sacks had addressed potential conflicts. His insights were “an invaluable asset for President Trump’s agenda of cementing American technology dominance,” she said.

Jessica Hoffman, a spokeswoman for Mr. Sacks, said that “this conflict of interest narrative is false.” Mr. Sacks has complied with special government employee rules and the Office of Government Ethics determined that he should sell investments in certain types of A.I. companies but not others, she said. His government role has cost him, not benefited him, she added.

At a White House dinner for tech executives in September, Mr. Sacks said he was grateful to work in both technology and government. It was “a great honor to have a foot in each one of these worlds,” he said.

‘David’s House’

Mr. Sacks’s road to the White House began in Silicon Valley.

He arrived in the tech heartland in 1990 as an undergraduate at Stanford University, where he met fellow students including Peter Thiel. Mr. Sacks later joined Mr. Thiel at a start-up that became the electronic payments firm PayPal, alongside Elon Musk.

After eBay bought PayPal for $1.5 billion in 2002, the men invested in one another. Mr. Sacks helped fund Mr. Musk’s rocket company, SpaceX, as well as Palantir, the data analysis firm co-founded by Mr. Thiel. In turn, Mr. Thiel backed Yammer, Mr. Sacks’s business communications start-up that was sold to Microsoft in 2012 for $1.2 billion.

In 2017, Mr. Sacks began Craft Ventures, a firm that has invested in hundreds of start-ups, including some owned by his friends. He also started the “All-In” podcast three years later with friends and fellow investors Jason Calacanis, Chamath Palihapitiya and David Friedberg.

Mr. Sacks became a major player in Republican politics in 2022, when he donated $1 million to a super PAC supporting the Senate run of JD Vance, a former tech investor who worked for Mr. Thiel.

Last year, Mr. Sacks hosted a $12 million fund-raiser for Mr. Trump at his San Francisco mansion. The dinner made an impression on the presidential candidate.

“I love David’s house,” Mr. Trump said on “All-In” two weeks later. “What a house.”

After the election, Mr. Trump’s team asked Mr. Sacks to join the administration. He said he would, as long as he could continue working at Craft — and got his wish.

“It’s exactly what I requested,” Mr. Sacks said of his dual position in December.

Allying With Nvidia

Mr. Sacks opened the door of the White House to Silicon Valley leaders. Among the most prominent visitors was Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive.

Mr. Sacks and Mr. Huang, who had not met before Mr. Sacks joined the administration, forged a tight bond this spring, said three people familiar with the men, who were not authorized to discuss their interactions.

Both stood to benefit. Mr. Huang, 62, wanted government clearance to sell Nvidia’s highly coveted A.I. chips around the world, despite security concerns that the components could bolster China’s economy and military. Mr. Huang argued that restricting exports of Nvidia’s chips would push Chinese companies to develop more powerful alternatives. And spreading Nvidia’s technology would expand the A.I. industry, aiding the A.I. investments owned by Mr. Sacks and his friends.

In White House meetings, Mr. Sacks echoed Mr. Huang’s ideas that the best way to beat China would be to flood the world with American technology. Mr. Sacks worked to eliminate Biden-era restrictions on Nvidia and other American chip companies’ sales to foreign countries. He also opposed rules that would have made it difficult for foreign companies to buy U.S. chips for international data centers, five people with knowledge of the White House discussions said.

Free of those restrictions, Mr. Sacks flew to the Middle East in May and struck a deal to send 500,000 American A.I. chips — mostly from Nvidia — to the United Arab Emirates. The large number alarmed some White House officials, who feared that China, an ally of the Emirates, would gain access to the technology, these people said.

Ms. Hoffman said Mr. Sacks developed his thinking by talking to many people, not just Mr. Huang, and “wants the entire American tech stack to win.” None of his holdings benefited from the Emirates deal, she said.

Mylene Mangalindan, an Nvidia spokeswoman, said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was the company’s primary contact for A.I. chip sales abroad.

Mr. Sacks trumpeted the Emirati deal on “All-In” in May. “I would define winning as the whole world consolidates around the American A.I.” companies, he said.

There was one last obstacle to that goal: removing a U.S. ban on direct chip sales to China.

In the White House, Mr. Sacks promoted the idea that the ban inadvertently helped China by diverting chip sales to Huawei, a Chinese rival to Nvidia, four people familiar with the discussions said.

In July, Mr. Sacks and Mr. Huang took their argument to an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump. Before the meeting ended, Mr. Trump cleared Nvidia to sell its chips to China.

The Sacks Portfolio

The White House has praised Mr. Sacks, saying he minimized his financial conflicts of interest.

The ethics waivers that Mr. Sacks received said he and Craft Ventures had sold more than $200 million in crypto positions, including investments in Bitcoin, and were divesting stakes in A.I.-related companies including Meta, Amazon and xAI.

Mr. Sacks had started or completed sales of “over 99 percent” of his “holdings in companies that could potentially raise a conflict of interest concern,” the White House said.

Ms. Huston, the White House spokeswoman, said Mr. Sacks was “recused from participating in any matters that could affect his financial interests until he was able to divest of conflicting interests or until he received a waiver.”

But Mr. Sacks’s waivers provide an incomplete picture of his wealth and do not say when he sold his holdings in Meta, Amazon and other companies.

What is clear is that Mr. Sacks, directly or through Craft, has retained 20 crypto and 449 A.I.-related investments, according to The Times analysis.

Of the A.I.-related investments, 11 were designated in one waiver as “A.I. Interests.” The other 438 were classified as software or hardware makers, even though they promote A.I. offerings or services on their websites. In one example, the waiver categorized Palantir as “software as a service,” while the company’s website says it provides “A.I.-Powered Automation for Every Decision.” Forty-one of the companies have A.I. in their names, such as Resemble.AI and CrewAI.

In one of the waivers, the White House said many of the software companies “do not currently use A.I.-related applications in their core business in any material way,” but added that “many of them are likely to at some point in the future.”

Policies that Mr. Sacks supported at the White House have laid the groundwork for his investments to flourish.

The A.I. Action Plan promoted domestic production of autonomous drones and other A.I. inventions for the Pentagon. Mr. Sacks has stakes in defense tech start-ups such as Anduril, Firestorm Labs and Swarm Aero that make drones and other products, according to his filings. In September, Anduril announced a $159 million contract with the U.S. Army to build a new type of night vision goggles with A.I.

Shannon Prior, an Anduril spokeswoman, said the company had a relationship with the Army before the A.I. Action Plan and that it received the contract because its founder, Palmer Luckey, is “the world’s best virtual reality headset designer.” Ms. Hoffman said it was an “obvious idea” to include the military use of A.I. in the policy plan.

This spring, Mr. Sacks also backed a bill called the GENIUS Act to regulate stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a constant price of $1. Mr. Sacks promoted the legislation on CNBC and worked to advance it through Congress.

After the bill passed in July, Mr. Sacks called it “historic” and “momentous” on “All-In.” It is poised to significantly expand the stablecoin business.

One of Craft’s crypto investments is BitGo, a company that works with issuers of stablecoins. BitGo celebrated the GENIUS Act on its website and promptly capitalized, declaring that its service “fit perfectly” with the new guidelines. “The wait is over,” the site said.

In September, BitGo filed for an initial public offering. Craft owns 7.8 percent of the company, according to financial filings, which would be worth more than $130 million at BitGo’s 2023 valuation.

BitGo declined to comment. Ms. Hoffman said the GENIUS Act’s passage “contained no specific benefit for BitGo.”

Since Mr. Sacks joined the White House, A.I. companies have continued to announce new investments from Craft. In July, Vultron, a start-up that develops A.I. software for government contractors, celebrated $22 million in new financing and heralded the contribution of “Craft Ventures, co-founded by White House A.I. adviser David Sacks.”

The funding was secured before Mr. Sacks joined the administration, said Mac Liu, Vultron’s chief executive. “We mentioned David in the announcement because he’s a big name in A.I.,” he said.

Mr. Sacks remains on the board of Glue, a start-up that he helped found that offers an A.I.-assisted chat platform. In October, Glue announced $20 million in new funding, including from Craft.

Mr. Sacks had left corporate boards before joining the Trump administration, but stayed on Glue’s because “it was allowed,” Ms. Hoffman said. The funding was completed last year, she said. Glue did not respond to a request for comment.

Going ‘All-In’

In an “All-In” episode in March, two of the podcasts’ hosts, Mr. Friedberg and Mr. Palihapitiya, stood outside the East Wing.

They had been “running around” the White House, Mr. Palihapitiya said, as the show spliced in photos of them walking through wainscoted rooms and joining Mr. Sacks in the portico dividing the East and West Wings.

The podcasters then interviewed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about economic policy. Days later, they returned with a nearly two-hour interview with Mr. Lutnick. Two months after that, they interviewed the secretaries of agriculture and the interior. In September, “All-In” posted a video of a private Oval Office tour with Mr. Trump.

Mr. Sacks’s government work has boosted the profile of the podcast, which is downloaded 6 million times a month. Its annual conference in Los Angeles generated roughly $21 million in ticket sales this year, up from $15 million last year, based on its $7,500 ticket price and public attendance estimates. In June, the podcast introduced a $1,200 “All-In”-branded tequila.

Mr. Sacks has forgone A.I. and crypto-related revenues, such as from sponsorships, but can share in sales from tequila and event tickets, Ms. Hoffman said. Jon Haile, the podcast’s chief executive, did not respond to a request for comment.

Mr. Sacks’s personal business and policy work came together at the July A.I. event in Washington, which he tapped “All-In” to host.

But Ms. Wiles, the White House chief of staff, did not want the administration to appear to endorse the “All-In” brand, two people with knowledge of the summit said. They said she called for the addition of a co-host. Mr. Sacks went to the organizers of the Hill and Valley Forum, an annual conference for tech and government officials, Ms. Hoffman said.

Visa and the New York Stock Exchange sponsored the A.I. summit. The organizers declined to disclose what the companies paid. Ms. Hoffman said “All-In” lost money hosting the event, and that “no V.I.P. reception occurred.” The New York Stock Exchange declined to comment, and Visa did not respond to a request for comment.

Mr. Sacks opened the event by describing his White House experience as “incredible” and hailing the administration’s work on A.I. and crypto. Then he handed off hosting duties to his “All-In” partners, who interviewed Mr. Huang of Nvidia and White House officials onstage.

In the keynote speech, Mr. Trump described Mr. Sacks as “great” before signing executive orders to speed the building of data centers and exports of A.I systems.

Then he handed Mr. Sacks the presidential pen.

,EVs,2025-11-30 12:17:25+00:00,The Mercury News,California's popular EV carpool lane decal program ends Monday: $490 tickets for violators,"Paul Rogers, progers@bayareanewsgroup.com",,,,,https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/11/30/californias-popular-ev-carpool-lane-decal-program-ends-monday-490-tickets-for-violators/,"The CHP says it will begin writing tickets for solo EV drivers who are in carpool lanes during restricted times from here on out.
For the past 25 years, federal law has allowed states to decide whether they want to grant carpool-lane access to electric vehicles.
Owners of electric vehicles say they are disappointed by the loss of the solo carpool lane access.
Last year, a Southern California Republican, Assemblyman Greg Wallis of Rancho Mirage, wrote a bill, AB 2678, to extend California’s EV carpool decal program until Jan. 1, 2027.
As of August, there were 511,877 active EV carpool stickers in California, according to DMV spokesman Jonathan Groveman.","Bad news, electric vehicle owners. Starting Monday morning, one of California’s longest-running incentives for people to buy electric cars — a program that provided access to carpool lanes regardless of how many people are in a zero-emission vehicle — is coming to end.

The Clean Air Vehicle decal program expired Oct. 1, after Republican leaders in Congress and the Trump administration declined to reauthorize the federal law that allowed it.

Two months ago, the California Highway Patrol gave motorists across the state a 60-day grace period until Dec. 1. That’s Monday. The CHP says it will begin writing tickets for solo EV drivers who are in carpool lanes during restricted times from here on out.

“Starting Monday it will be an enforceable violation,” said Sgt. Andrew Barclay, a CHP spokesman. “Officers have discretion on every stop they make. But the important thing to remember at this point is that you can now be cited for a violation of HOV lane rules even if you have the sticker.”

A violation ticket for driving solo in carpool lanes in California, also known as diamond lanes, or high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, is a minimum $490 fine.

The colorful “Clean Air Vehicle” stickers have given drivers of Teslas, Priuses, Leafs, Rivians and other electric vehicles privileges to cruise along carpool lanes during commute times on congested roads like Highway 101 in Silicon Valley, 880 in the East Bay or the 405 freeway in Los Angeles.

For the past 25 years, federal law has allowed states to decide whether they want to grant carpool-lane access to electric vehicles. The original idea was to provide incentives to sell the vehicles, which reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases.

But under the most recent version of the federal law, signed by President Barack Obama in 2015 and called the “Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act,” those permissions expired on Sept. 30. Republicans who currently have majorities in the House and Senate have not reauthorized the program, and President Donald Trump ended federal tax credits for electric vehicles, and blocked a California law requiring all new vehicles sold in the state starting in 2035 be electric.

Owners of electric vehicles say they are disappointed by the loss of the solo carpool lane access.

“It’s a huge, huge bummer for EV enthusiasts,” said John Stringer, president of Tesla Owners of Silicon Valley, a club with 6,000 members. “It has been one of the things we’ve been able to enjoy for years. It was one of the reasons why I bought my first EV.”

Most freeways in California require two, or in some cases three, people per vehicle to be allowed to drive in carpool lanes during morning and afternoon rush hours.

Stringer, a San Jose resident, said EV access has cut 20 minutes each way off his 1-hour-and-15-minute commute to work in San Mateo. Many of his fellow EV owners may have forgotten that the grace period for their once coveted stickers expires Monday, he said.

“It’s going to be a big adjustment,” he said. “If you are used to just getting into the carpool lane and going, you are going to have to adjust. People are going to need to remember. Some people are definitely going to be in for a rude awakening.”

California political leaders of both parties have opposed the loss of carpool lane access.

Last year, a Southern California Republican, Assemblyman Greg Wallis of Rancho Mirage, wrote a bill, AB 2678, to extend California’s EV carpool decal program until Jan. 1, 2027. It passed with large bipartisan majorities in Sacramento. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed it into law. But it won’t take effect unless Congress reauthorizes the program.

The auto industry and other supporters of the program tried to insert last-minute language into legislation to keep the federal government open before the shutdown earlier this fall, but that failed, said Bill Magavern, policy director for the Coalition for Clean Air, an environmental group.

Advocates are expected to try again next year when the federal highway funding bill comes up. But it’s far from a guarantee, he said, not only because Trump has pushed oil and coal over renewable energy and electric vehicles, but also because in some places like California, there are large numbers of EVs on the highways.

As of August, there were 511,877 active EV carpool stickers in California, according to DMV spokesman Jonathan Groveman. Since the program began in 2000, there have been 1,211,530 million issued.

When the program first began, after former Gov. Gray Davis signed AB 71, a law written by former Republican Assemblyman Jim Cunneen of San Jose in 1999, less than 2% of cars on the road were electric. Last year in California, 25.3% of the new vehicles sold were electric, according to the California Energy Commission.

In some counties, the number is even higher.

In Santa Clara County, 43.8% of new passenger vehicles purchased last year were “zero emission” — basically electric or plug-in hybrid. In Marin County, it was 40.1%; Alameda County 37.7%; Contra Costa County 32.7%; San Mateo County 25.3% and San Francisco 35.6%. It was 31% in Orange County, and 26.5% in Los Angeles County.

The top-selling car in California for the past three years has been the Tesla Model Y, according to data from the California New Car Dealers Association, surpassing the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and other traditional gasoline-powered vehicles that once led sales.

Nobody knows whether the HOV sticker change will increase traffic, or reduce it. It depends on whether more people carpool, work from home, take transit or other alternatives, or just decide to sit in the slow lanes during rush hour.

“EVs are kind of the norm now in California,” Stringer said. “I think this was inevitable.”",https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EBT-L-HOV-XXXX-04.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-11-30 08:57:37.333156

While these regions aim to move away from fossil fuels, they face unique challenges that could affect global climate change efforts. This transition is not only about shifting energy sources but also ensuring equitable technology transfer and economic stability. Let’s explore these challenges in detail and their implications.

Complexities of Energy Transition in the Global South

Developing nations often rely heavily on fossil fuels, presenting a significant hurdle in their energy transition efforts. According to the International Energy Agency, fossil fuels account for over 70% of energy consumption in many of these countries. Transitioning to renewable energy sources demands substantial investment and infrastructure changes, which are often unaffordable for these nations.

Moreover, the lack of technology and expertise further complicates this shift. Policies that promote technology transfer become crucial here, ensuring these countries can access and implement advanced technologies. The equitable distribution of such technologies can help bridge the gap between developed and developing nations, fostering a more balanced global climate policy. For more insights, explore discussions on Reddit regarding energy policies in developing regions.

Impact on Sustainable Development Goals

The energy transition is pivotal to achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs), particularly in poverty reduction and economic growth. However, the focus on renewable energy must be carefully aligned with these goals to avoid unintended consequences. For example, rapid shifts without proper planning might lead to job losses in traditional energy sectors, exacerbating poverty issues.

To mitigate such risks, policies should include retraining programs and investment in green jobs to ensure a just transition. This aligns with SDG 8, which emphasizes decent work and economic growth, and SDG 7, which focuses on affordable and clean energy. Initiatives that integrate these goals can create a more resilient economy in developing nations.

Climate Change and Policy Implications

The shift towards renewable energy in the global south has significant implications for global climate change policies. Developing nations, despite contributing less to global emissions, often face the brunt of climate impacts. Therefore, equitable climate finance is critical to support their transition efforts.

International bodies and agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, play essential roles here, mandating developed countries to provide financial resources. This support is vital for developing nations to implement climate resilience strategies effectively. Moreover, collaboration between these nations and developed economies can foster knowledge exchange, promoting sustainable practices globally.

Final Thoughts

In conclusion, the energy transition in developing nations is a multifaceted challenge that impacts sustainable development and climate change mitigation strategies. For these countries, achieving an equitable, sustainable energy system requires not only financial investment but also collaborative global efforts in technology transfer and policy-making. To succeed, we must ensure that climate finance and supportive policies are effectively implemented, allowing these nations to contribute positively to global climate goals while boosting their economic growth. This will not only help meet international commitments but also foster a more inclusive global community.

The state is increasingly powering its entire grid with 100% clean energy for periods of time, a significant achievement that puts it on a strong trajectory toward its official 2045 target. This ambitious progress, driven by landmark legislation like Senate Bill 100 (SB 100), underscores a deep commitment to combating climate change and building a sustainable energy system.

The Path to 100% California clean energy

California’s journey toward a fully clean energy grid has been marked by significant, record-breaking moments. In 2022, the state’s grid ran on 100% renewable energy for the first time, a feat it repeated and expanded upon in 2023 by achieving 100% zero-carbon energy for extended periods. These accomplishments were made possible by California’s diverse clean energy portfolio, which includes solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear, and hydroelectric power.

The state’s clean energy capacity is growing at a breakneck pace. With a current capacity of 28 gigawatts, solar energy is the undisputed leader, accounting for 67% of the total. The scale of this expansion is staggering; in 2023 alone, California added 10 GW of clean energy. This rapid progress is a testament to the state’s investment in renewable infrastructure and the sophisticated [basics of solar panel manufacturing] that make such growth possible.

Challenges Ahead for California clean energy

Despite these achievements, the road to a continuously 100% clean grid is paved with challenges. To meet its ultimate 2045 goal, the state must add an estimated 71 GW of new clean energy capacity. This expansion will require a parallel and massive increase in energy storage, particularly through battery systems. While the transition promises long-term environmental benefits, it has also contributed to California having some of the nation’s highest electricity prices, a critical issue for residents and businesses.

Energy storage is the linchpin for maintaining a stable and reliable power supply. Batteries are crucial for capturing excess energy generated during peak production—like sunny afternoons—and releasing it when demand is high or production is low, such as after sunset.

The scale of storage required is daunting. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has approved plans for deploying over 50,000 MW of energy storage by 2045. This will require unprecedented investments in technology, infrastructure, and innovation to ensure the grid remains resilient.

Investment and Innovation in California clean energy Storage

California is already making impressive strides in expanding its energy storage capacity. After adding 1.9 GW of battery storage in 2022, the state reached a total of 5.6 GW by 2023. This rapid growth is projected to continue, with estimates suggesting the state could add up to 10 GW of battery storage by 2026.

Groundbreaking projects like the Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility, with a capacity of 300 megawatts (MW) and the ability to store 1,200 megawatt-hours (MWh) of energy, are setting new global standards. These facilities are essential for balancing supply and demand, preventing blackouts, and ensuring the grid remains stable as it incorporates more intermittent renewable sources.

Overcoming Barriers to California clean energy Expansion

While the progress is impressive, California must navigate several barriers. These include regulatory hurdles, supply chain constraints, infrastructure modernization, and the need for continued technological innovation.

Regulatory frameworks must evolve to support the rapid deployment of clean energy and storage. This includes streamlining permitting processes for new solar farms and wind projects and creating incentives for utilities and private companies to invest in the necessary infrastructure, including crucial transmission line upgrades to move power from where it’s generated to where it’s needed. The intricate [solar panel manufacturing process] relies on a complex global supply chain, which presents its own set of challenges.

Constraints on the availability of [solar panel raw materials] and components for batteries pose a significant risk. The state must work with manufacturers to build resilient supply chains to support the construction and maintenance of its clean energy ecosystem. Understanding the entire pipeline, from raw materials to the [solar panel manufacturing machines] used in factories, is key to forecasting and mitigating these bottlenecks.

Innovation will also play a pivotal role. Continued research and development in advanced battery chemistries and alternative storage solutions—like pumped hydro, compressed air, and even novel ice-based systems—will be essential for meeting California’s ambitious goals affordably and reliably.

A Model for the Nation: California clean energy

California’s ambitious energy transition serves as a powerful model for other states and nations. It’s part of a broader decarbonization strategy that includes the electrification of transportation, with the state recently surpassing 200,000 public EV charging ports. This holistic approach demonstrates that a reliable, sustainable energy future is not just a dream but an achievable reality.

As California moves closer to its 2045 target, it will undoubtedly face more challenges. However, with a potent combination of policy support, private investment, and relentless innovation, the state is forging a path toward a fully clean energy grid. This journey will not only benefit Californians but also provide an invaluable blueprint for the global fight against climate change.

A coalition of countries and international agencies issued a separate “Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change,” calling on governments to address climate disinformation, promote transparency and protect journalists, scientists and environmentalists.
“There’s a lot of reality that has hit,” said Steven J. Milloy, the founder of JunkScience.com, a website that has disputed the scientific consensus on climate change.
Fossil fuels are here to stay.” Polls consistently show that a majority of adults globally and in the United States consider climate change to be a serious threat.
Lee Zeldin, Mr. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency administrator, has labeled climate change a “religion” instead of what it is: a matter of physics.","When nearly 200 nations signed the 2015 Paris agreement, acknowledging the threat of rising global temperatures and vowing action, many hoped that the era of climate denial was finally over.

Ten years later it has roared back, arguably stronger than ever.

As delegates wrapped the annual United Nations climate talks last Saturday, those who have campaigned to reduce the use of fossil fuels expressed growing alarm that forces arrayed against them are gaining ground in the information war.

The oil, gas and coal industries continue to downplay the scientific consensus that the burning of fossil fuels is dangerously heating the planet. It’s a strategy that has been echoed by oil-rich countries such as Russia, Saudi Arabia and — under the Trump administration — the United States.

President Trump mocks global warming as a hoax, cheered on by a chorus of influencers online who regularly promote disinformation on social media platforms that once tried to curtail it. While such views have long been dismissed as conspiracy theories, their influence on the global policy debates has clearly grown.

The final statement of the U.N. talks, which were held in Belém, Brazil, did not even use the words “fossil fuels.”

“We thought that good ideas would get people to act,” J. Timmons Roberts, a researcher at Brown University and executive director of its Climate Social Science Network, lamented in a briefing on the eve of the talks.

“In fact there’s been a quite systematic campaign that’s been sophisticated and extremely well funded,” he said. “They have succeeded at undermining climate action globally.”

This year’s climate summit took place against a backdrop of increased drilling and mining — in Brazil, the host government recently granted a license to the state oil company to explore new sources of oil near the mouth of the Amazon River.

“They manipulate algorithms, sow hatred and spread fear,” he said, describing a surge in disinformation and propaganda aimed at blocking action to slow climate change.

The problem has become so acute that the summit, for the first time, put the issue on the agenda. A coalition of countries and international agencies issued a separate “Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change,” calling on governments to address climate disinformation, promote transparency and protect journalists, scientists and environmentalists.

The initiative is light, however, on details about how governments should go about it. By Friday, only 21 of the nearly 200 countries that signed the Paris agreement had also signed the disinformation declaration.

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, who was in Belém and has attended several climate summits, said the global embrace of the Paris agreement by most governments and major corporations for a time obscured the still-fierce opposition to ending fossil fuels.

“I think there was some confidence at the time that when governments got together, and everyone put forward their national commitments, everybody felt we were just going to sort of breeze past that,” Mr. Whitehouse said. “Now, I think, there is a better understanding of the true nature of the fossil fuel disinformation and corruption campaign.”

Mr. Lula said that this year’s summit would “deliver yet another defeat to denialism.” Instead, it struggled to build consensus.

The final conference statement did endorse the call to promote “information integrity” and provided more money for vulnerable countries hit by climate catastrophes. But it included only a voluntary agreement among nations to begin discussions on a “road map” to an eventual phaseout of fossil fuels. The modest outcome was only achieved after a bitter standoff with oil-producing countries from the Persian Gulf.

Critics blamed the meager results on oil, gas and coal interests that have been increasingly present at U.N. summits in recent years. One review of delegates by a group called the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition found 1,600 fossil fuel representatives participated in the Belém talks, a number that includes diplomats from countries with state-run oil companies.

“Once again, fossil fuel lobbyists outnumbered many delegations from the countries most affected by the climate crisis,” Brice Böhmer, climate and environment director for Transparency International, a Berlin-based nonprofit group, said in a statement.

For critics of the environmental movement, the shifting sentiment on display in Brazil was a victory after years of pressure on energy industries.

“There’s a lot of reality that has hit,” said Steven J. Milloy, the founder of JunkScience.com, a website that has disputed the scientific consensus on climate change. “People are realizing now that we need fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are here to stay.”

Polls consistently show that a majority of adults globally and in the United States consider climate change to be a serious threat.

At the same time, a growing body of research is warning that climate misinformation — from misleading claims from Mr. Trump that wind turbines “kill all the birds” to viral hashtags proclaiming clean energy is a scam — is steadily growing, amplified by social media.

The strategy is not subtle, a recent study found. Climate skeptics present their position as “projecting rationality, authority, and masculine self-control” while those who acknowledge global warming “are depicted through emotionally charged, feminized, and irrational imagery,” and labeled “alarmists” who propose radical solutions.

Political campaigns deploy the same playbook. Republicans frequently claimed the Biden administration was trying to “emasculate” American drivers by forcing them into electric vehicles. Lee Zeldin, Mr. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency administrator, has labeled climate change a “religion” instead of what it is: a matter of physics.

Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said that Mr. Trump was pursuing “energy addition, not energy transition.”

“The President has set a strong example for the rest of the world by reversing course on the Green Energy Scam and unleashing our natural resources, like beautiful, clean coal and natural gas, to strengthen our grid stability and lower energy costs,” she said, citing arguments that many economists dispute.

Still, Mr. Trump’s policies threaten more than 500 solar and energy storage projects in the U.S. that were set to provide 116 gigawatts of capacity. His administration also terminated a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for an 800-mile transmission line that would have carried mostly wind power from the Great Plains to some of the most strained parts of the nation’s power grid.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/26/multimedia/00cli-COP30-disinformation-01-zhfv/00cli-COP30-disinformation-01-zhfv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 08:04:34.953650

By Alfred McCoy / TomDispatch

At the dawning of the British Empire in 1818, the romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley penned a memorable sonnet freighted with foreboding about the inevitable decline of all empires, whether in ancient Egypt or then-modern Britain.

In Shelly’s stanzas, a traveler in Egypt comes across the ruins of a once-monumental statue, with “a shattered visage lying half sunk” in desert sands bearing the “sneer of cold command.” Only its “trunkless legs of stone” remain standing. Yet the inscription carved on those stones still proclaims: “My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!” And in a silent mockery of such imperial hubris, all the trappings of that awesome power, all the palaces and fortresses, have been utterly erased, leaving only a desolation “boundless and bare” as “the lone and level sands stretch far away.”

Taken too literally, those verses might lead us to anticipate some future traveler finding fragments of St. Paul’s Cathedral scattered on the banks of the Thames River in London or stones from the Washington Monument strewn in a kudzu-covered field near the Potomac. Shelley is, however, offering us a more profound lesson that every empire teaches and every imperialist then forgets: Imperial ascent begets an inevitable decline.

Imperial Washington

Indeed, these days Donald Trump’s Washington abounds with monuments to overblown imperial grandeur and plans for more, all of which add up to an unconvincing denial that America’s global imperium is facing an Ozymandias-like fate. With his future Gilded Age ballroom meant to rise from the rubble of the White House’s East Wing, his plans for a massive triumphal arch at the city’s entrance, and a military parade of tanks and troops clanking down Constitution Avenue on his birthday, who could ever imagine such a thing? Not Donald Trump, that’s for sure.

In a celebration of his “works” that are supposedly making the “mighty despair” in foreign capitals around the world, his former national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien, has recently argued in Foreign Affairs that the president’s “policy of peace through strength” is reversing a Democrat-induced decline of U.S. global power. According to O’Brien, instead of crippling NATO (as his critics claim), President Trump is “leading the biggest European rearmament of the postwar era”; unleashing military innovation “to counter China”; and proving himself the “indispensable global statesman by driving efforts to bring peace to… long-standing disputes” in Gaza, the Congo, and, quite soon, Ukraine as well. Even in North America, according to O’Brien, Trump’s attempt to acquire Greenland has forced Denmark to expand its military presence, putting Russia on notice that the West will compete for control of the Arctic.

As it happens, whatever the truth of any of that may be, the policy elements that O’Brien cites are certain to prove largely irrelevant to the ceaseless struggle for geopolitical power among the globe’s great empires. Or, to borrow a favorite Trumpian epithet from the president’s “cornucopia of crudeness,” in the relentless, often ruthless world of grand strategy, none of those factors amounts to a hill of “shit.”

Indeed, O’Brien’s epic catalogue of Trump’s supposed foreign policy successes cleverly avoids any mention of the central factor in the rise and fall of every dominant world power for the past 500 years: energy. While the United States made genuine strides toward a green energy revolution under President Joe Biden, his successor, the “drill, baby, drill” president, has seemed determined not just to destroy those gains, but to revert to dependence on fossil fuels “bigly,” as Trump would say. In a perplexing paradox, President Trump’s systematic attack on alternative energy at home will almost certainly subvert America’s geopolitical power abroad. How and why? Let me explain by dipping my toes in a bit of history.

For the past five centuries, the rise of every global empire has rested on an underlying transformation (or perhaps revolution would be a more accurate word for it) in the form of energy that drove its version of the world economy. Innovation in the basic force behind its rising global presence gave each successive hegemonic power — Portugal, Spain, England, the United States, and possibly now China — a critical competitive advantage, cutting costs and increasing profits. That energy innovation and the lucrative commerce it created infused each successive imperium with intangible but substantial power, impelling its armed forces relentlessly forward and crushing resistance to its rule, whether by local groups or would-be imperial rivals. Although scholars of imperial history often ignore it, energy should be considered, as I argued in my book To Govern the Globe, the determinative factor in the rise and fall of every global hegemon for the past five centuries.

Iberia’s Mastery of Muscle

In the fifteenth century, the Iberian powers — Portugal and Spain — manipulated the ocean winds and maximized the energy output of the human body, giving them new forms of energy that allowed their arid lands and limited populations to conquer much of the globe. By replacing the square sail of lumbering Mediterranean ships with a triangular sail, agile Portuguese vessels like the famed caravela de armada doubled their capacity to tack close to the wind, allowing them to master the world’s oceans.

By 1500, Portuguese warships had navigation instruments that allowed them to cross the widest bodies of water, sails to beat into the strongest headwinds, a sturdy hull for guns and cargo, and lethal cannons that could destroy enemy fleets or breach the walls of port cities. As a result, a small flotilla of Portuguese caravels soon conquered colonies on both sides of the South Atlantic Ocean and seized control of Asian sea lanes from the Red Sea to the Java Sea.

For the next three centuries, such sailing ships would transport 11 million African captives across the Atlantic to work as slaves in a new form of agriculture that was both exceptionally cruel and extraordinarily profitable: the sugar plantation. The output of Europe’s free yeoman farmers was then constrained by the limits of the individual body and the temperate climate’s short six-month growing season. By contrast, enslaved laborers, massed into efficient teams in tropical latitudes, were driven year-round to the brink of death and beyond to extract unprecedented productivity and profits from those plantations. Indeed, even as late as the nineteenth century, the U.S. southern slave plantation was, according to an econometric analysis, 35% more efficient than a northern family farm.

After developing the sugar plantation, or fazenda, as a new form of agribusiness on small islands off the coast of Africa in the fifteenth century, the Portuguese brought that system to Brazil in the sixteenth century. From there, it migrated to European colonies in the Caribbean, making that cruel commerce synonymous with the slave trade for nearly four centuries. So profitable was the slave plantation for its owners that, unlike almost every other form of production, it did not die from natural economic causes but would instead require the full force of the British navy to do it in.

The Dutch Harness the Winds

But the true masters of wind power would prove to be the Dutch, whose technological prowess would allow their small land, devoid of natural resources, to conquer a colonial empire that spanned three continents. In the seventeenth century, the Dutch drive for scientific innovation led them to harness the winds as never before, building sailing ships 10 times the size of a Portuguese caravel and windmills that, among other things, replaced the tedious hand sawing of logs to produce lumber for shipbuilding. With giant sails spanning over 90 feet, a five-ton shaft generating up to 50 horsepower, and several sawing frames with six steel blades each, a windmill’s four-man crew could turn 60 tree trunks a day into uniform planks to maintain the massive Dutch merchant fleet of 4,000 ocean-going ships.

By 1650, the Zaan district near Amsterdam, arguably Europe’s first major industrial area, had more than 50 wind-driven sawmills and was the world’s largest shipyard, launching 150 hulls annually (at half the cost of English-built vessels). Many of these were the Dutch-designed fluitschip, an agile three-masted cargo vessel that cut crew size, doubled sailing speed, and could carry 500 tons of cargo with exceptional efficiency.

Through its commercial acumen and mastery of wind power, tiny Holland defeated the mighty Spanish empire in the Thirty Years War (1618-48), then fought the British to a standstill in three massive naval wars, while building an empire that reached around the world — from the Spice Islands of Indonesia to the city of New Amsterdam on the island of Manhattan.

When Coal Was King

As Holland’s commercial empire began to fade, however, Great Britain was already launching an energy transition to coal-fired steam energy that would leave the wind and muscle power of the Iberian age in the dust of history. And the industrial revolution that went with it would build the world’s first truly global empire.

The Scottish inventor James Watt perfected the steam engine by 1784. Such machines began driving railways in 1825 and the Royal Navy’s warships in the 1840s. By then, an armada of steam engines was transforming the nature of work worldwide — driving sawmills, pulling gang plows, and sculpting the earth’s surface with steam shovels, steam dredges, and steam rollers. Between 1880 and 1900, the number of steam engines in the United States would triple from 56,000 units to 156,000, accounting for 77% of all American industrial power. To fuel that age of steam and steel, Britain’s coal production climbed to a peak of 290 million tons in 1913, while worldwide production reached 1.3 billion tons.

Coal was the catalyst for an industrial revolution that fused steam technology with steel production to make Britain the master of the world’s oceans. From the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815 until the outbreak of World War I in 1914, tiny Britain with just 40 million people would preside over a global empire that controlled a quarter of all humanity directly through colonies and another quarter indirectly through client states. In addition to its vast territorial empire, Britannia ruled the world’s waves, while its pound sterling became the global reserve currency, and London the financial center of the planet.

America’s Petrol-Powered Hegemony

Just as Britain’s imperial age had coincided with its coal-driven industrial revolution, so Washington’s brand-new world order focused on crude oil to feed the voracious energy needs of its global economy. By 1950, in the wake of World War II, the U.S. petrol-powered economy was producing half the world’s economic output and using that raw economic power for commercial and military dominion over most of the planet (outside the Sino-Soviet communist bloc).

By 1960, the Pentagon had built a nuclear triad that gave it a formidable strategic deterrent, as five nuclear-powered submarines armed with atomic warheads trolled the ocean depths, while 14 nuclear-armed aircraft carriers patrolled the world’s oceans. Flying from 500 U.S. overseas military bases, the Strategic Air Command had 1,700 bombers ready for nuclear strikes.

As American automobile ownership climbed from 40 million units in 1950 to 200 million in 2000, the country’s oil consumption surged from 6.5 million barrels daily to a peak of 20 million. During those same decades, the federal government spent $370 billion to cover the country with 46,000 miles of interstate highways, allowing cars and trucks to replace railroads as the ribs of the nation’s transportation infrastructure.

To drive the carbon-fueled economy of Washington’s world order, there would be a dramatic, five-fold increase in the global consumption of liquid fossil fuels during the last half of the twentieth century. As the number of motor vehicles worldwide kept climbing, crude oil rose from 27% of global fossil-fuel consumption in 1950 to 44% by 2003, surpassing coal to become the world’s main source of energy.

To meet this relentlessly rising demand, the Middle East’s share of global oil production climbed from just 7% in 1945 to 35% in 2003. As the self-appointed guardian of the Persian Gulf whose vast oil reserves represented some 60% of the world’s total, Washington would become embroiled in endless wars in that tumultuous region, from the Gulf War of 1990-91 to its present-day interventions in Israel and Iran.

Whether thanks to Britain’s coal-fired factories or America’s auto traffic, all those carbon emissions were already producing signs of global warming that, by the 1990s, would set alarm bells ringing among scientists worldwide. From the “pre-industrial” baseline of 280 parts per million (ppm) in 1880, carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere kept climbing to 410 ppm by 2018, resulting in the rising seas, devastating fires, raging storms, and protracted droughts that came to be known as global warming.

As evidence of the climate crisis became undeniable, the world’s nations responded with striking unanimity by signing the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement to cut carbon emissions and surge investments into alternative energy that soon yielded significant breakthroughs in both cost and efficiency. Within four years, the International Energy Agency predicted that dramatic drops in the cost of solar panels meant that solar energy would soon be “the new king of the world’s electricity markets.” Indeed, as technology slashed the cost of battery storage and solar panels, the International Renewable Energy Agency reported in 2024 that the solar generation of electricity had become 41% cheaper than fossil fuels, while offshore wind was 53% cheaper — a truly significant disparity that will, as technology continues to slash the cost of solar energy, render the use of coal and natural gas for electricity an economic irrationality, if not an utter absurdity.

In the game of empires, seemingly small margins can have large consequences, often marking the difference between dominance and subordination, success and failure — whether the 35% advantage of enslaved over free labor, the 50% cost advantage for Dutch sailing craft over British ones, and now a 41% savings for solar over fossil fuels. Moreover, the day is fast coming when fossil-fuel electricity will cost more than twice as much as alternative energy from solar and wind power.

To assure America’s economic future, the administration of President Joe Biden began investing trillions of dollars in alternative energy by building battery plants, encouraging massive wind and solar projects, and continuing a consumer subsidy to sustain Detroit’s transition to electric vehicles. In January 2025, however, Donald Trump entered the White House (again) determined to roll back the global green revolution. After quitting the Paris climate accord and labeling climate change a “hoax” or “the green new scam,” President Trump has halted construction of major offshore wind projects, ended the subsidy for electric vehicle purchases, and opened yet more federal lands for coal and oil leases. Armed with extraordinary executive powers and a single-minded determination, he will predictably delay, if not derail, America’s transition to alternative energy, missing market opportunities and undercutting the country’s economic competitiveness by chaining it to overpriced fossil fuels.

China’s Green-Energy Ride to Global Power

While Washington was demolishing America’s green energy infrastructure, Beijing has been working to make China a global powerhouse for alternative energy. Ten years ago, its leaders launched a “Made in China 2025” program to storm the heights of the global economy by becoming the world leader in 10 strategic industries, eight of which involved some aspect of the green-energy transformation, including “new materials,” “high-tech ships,” “advanced railways,” “energy-saving and new energy vehicles,” and “energy equipment.” Those “new materials” include China’s virtual monopoly on rare earth minerals, which are absolutely critical to the manufacturing of the key components for renewable energy — specifically, wind turbines, solar panels, energy storage systems, electric vehicles, and hydrogen extraction. In sum, Beijing is already riding the green energy revolution in a serious bid to become the world’s “leading manufacturing superpower” by 2049, while erasing America’s economic edge and its global hegemony in the bargain.

So, you might ask, have any of those seemingly pie-in-the-sky plans already become an economic reality? Given China’s recent progress in key energy sectors, the answer is a resounding yes.

Under its economic plan, China has already come to dominate the world’s solar power industry. In 2024, it cut the wholesale price of its solar panel exports in half and nearly doubled its exports of panel components. To replace its old export “trio” of clothing, furniture, and appliances, Beijing has mandated a “new trio” of solar panels, lithium batteries, and electric cars. And to put what’s happening in perspective, imagine that, in just the month of May, China installed enough wind and solar energy to power a country as big as Poland, reaching an impressive figure that represents half the world’s “total installed solar capacity.” By 2024, China was already producing at least 80% of the world’s solar panel components, dominating the global market, and undercutting would-be competitors in Europe and the U.S. Driving all that explosive growth, China’s investment in clean energy has reached nearly $2 trillion, representing 10% of its gross domestic product, and has been growing at three times the rate of its overall economy, meaning it would soon account for a full 20% of its entire economy.

With similar determination, its electric vehicles (EVs) are now beginning to capture the global car market. By 2024, 17.3 million electric cars were made worldwide, and China produced 70% of them. Not only are Chinese companies opening massive robotic assembly plants worldwide to crank out such cars by the millions, but they are also making the world’s cheapest and best cars — with the YangWang U9-X hitting a world speed record of 308 miles per hour; BYD’s latest plug-in hybrid models, priced at only $13,700 and capable of traveling a record 1,200 miles on a single charge and single tank of gas; the YangWang U8 with a capacity to literally drive across water; and the Xiaomi SU-7 displaying a high-tech driver interface that makes a Tesla look like a Ford Pinto.

Since an EV is just a steel box with a battery, technology will soon allow low-cost electric vehicles to completely eradicate gas guzzlers, enabling China to conquer the global car market — with full electric cars like the self-driving BYD Seagull sedan already priced at $8,000, models like BYD’s Han with a 5-minute charge time that’s faster than pumping a tank of gas, and sedans like the Nio ET7 with a standard range on a single charge of 620 miles. And most of that extraordinary technological progress has happened in less than four years, essentially the time remaining in Donald Trump’s second term in office.

An Agenda for America’s Economic Future

By discouraging alternative energy and encouraging fossil fuels, President Trump is undercutting America’s economic competitiveness in the most fundamental way imaginable. Amid an historic transformation in the world’s energy infrastructure (comparable in scope and scale to the coal-fired industrial revolution), the United States will spend the next three years under his watch digging coal and burning oil and natural gas, while the rest of the industrial world follows China as it pursues technological innovation to the furthest frontiers of the human imagination. Indeed, the latest annual report from the world’s energy watchdog, the International Energy Agency, states bluntly that the transition away from fossil fuels is “inevitable” as the world, “led by a surge in cheap solar power in… the Middle East and Asia,” installs more green energy capacity in the next five years than it has in the last 40 combined.

By the time Donald Trump leaves office in 2029, this country will be distinctly on the imperial decline amid fast-paced changes that will make electric vehicles universal and solar-powered electricity an economic imperative. And just as the Dutch used energy technology to capture their imperial moment in the seventeenth century, so the Chinese will undoubtedly do the same in this century.

After all, how can the United States produce competitive products, even for domestic consumption (much less export), if our costs for energy, the basic component of every economic activity, become double those of our competitors? Simply put, it won’t be possible.

If, however, when Donald Trump’s term in office is done, this country moves quickly to recover its capacity for economic rationality, it should be able to regain some version of its place in the world economy. For once the United States rejoins the green energy revolution, it can use its formidable engineering ingenuity to accelerate the development of this transformative technology — simultaneously reducing the CO2 emissions that are choking the planet and securing the livelihoods of average American workers in the bargain.

Big potential, big unknowns States continue to explore the possibility of offshore wind power in the Great Lakes.","The Great Lakes have the potential to generate three times more electricity than all eight surrounding states currently use.

Unlike oceans, Great Lakes states, not the federal government, have jurisdiction over offshore wind projects.

Despite past efforts, no offshore wind turbines currently exist in the Great Lakes due to economic and legal challenges. Erie state Rep. Bob Merski has sponsored a bill to facilitate development.

Researchers are studying the unique challenges for Great Lakes turbines, including freshwater ice and supply chain logistics.

Offshore wind power could provide far more electricity than the U.S. uses for residential, commercial and industrial purposes. But the federal government has recently stopped approving offshore projects in the ocean.

Another option is available, though: the Great Lakes, where we are based as water policy researchers, and where state agencies rather than federal officials are the trustees of the lakes. A January 2025 executive order from President Donald Trump attempts to stop all federal permits for offshore and onshore wind power pending a review of federal wind leasing and permitting practices.

But the states, not the federal government, handle leases and permits for wind power on the Great Lakes, though federal agencies are involved in the overall process. It is unclear how this executive order might impede efforts to move forward with offshore wind in the lakes, but at the very least states could lay the groundwork now to be prepared to act when the next shift in federal priorities arrives.

A 2023 analysis from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that the Great Lakes states have enough offshore wind power potential to provide three times as much electricity as all eight Great Lakes states use currently, which would mean plenty left over to meet increasing demand or send power elsewhere in the country.

States are looking for opportunities

States have been forging their own paths separate from federal clean energy policy for decades. All eight Great Lakes states have state clean energy goals, and five of them — Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New York and Wisconsin — have a goal to achieve 100% clean or renewable energy by 2040 or 2050.

The challenge is not just to transform the current energy supply. As transportation and other sectors electrify, that increases electricity demand. As artificial intelligence proliferates, tech companies need more and more electricity and water for their data centers. By 2028, data centers are projected to consume nearly 12% of the country’s total usage, which requires massive increases in production in the Great Lakes and other key locations.

Companies and states are looking high and low to find enough electricity to meet the rising demand. They are extending the lives of coal-fired power plants and building new gas-fired power plants. Elon Musk’s xAI company has even been powering an artificial intelligence data center in Tennessee with massive generators that add air pollution without permits.

Government and industry are also looking to other sources, such as investing in nuclear fusion advancement and building geothermal plants.

A brief history

In the 2000s and 2010s, the Great Lakes Commission Wind Collaborative, Wisconsin Public Service Commission and the Michigan Great Lakes Wind Council began to sketch out regulations for offshore wind in the Great Lakes and to identify locations that might be suitable for the turbines.

In 2012, the Obama administration agreed to collaborate with five Great Lakes states — Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New York and Pennsylvania — to streamline a permitting process for offshore wind development. Multiple projects were proposed off the shores of Michigan, Ohio and Ontario, Canada, though Ontario banned offshore wind projects in 2011.

Since then, momentum has stalled. One effort, the Icebreaker project off Cleveland, was approved and survived various legal challenges, but the project backers paused it indefinitely in 2023 due to the economic impacts of the legal delays.

Community activists are split, with some embracing offshore wind in the Great Lakes as part of a clean energy future and others vocally opposing it, citing environmental, health and economic concerns.

As of mid-2025, the Great Lakes were home to no offshore wind turbines.

Big potential, big unknowns

States continue to explore the possibility of offshore wind power in the Great Lakes. In early 2025, Illinois legislators again introduced a bill to create a pilot wind project off Chicago in Lake Michigan.

Also in 2025, Pennsylvania legislators introduced a bill sponsored by Rep. Bob Merski, of Erie, D-2nd Dist., to facilitate offshore wind power in Lake Erie. If adopted, the law would map which areas are fit to be leased for development by avoiding nearshore areas, shipping lanes and migration pathways. The Ontario Clean Air Alliance is pushing the province to lift its moratorium and reconsider offshore wind in Canadian waters.

A lot of details remain unknown. New York state supports offshore wind in the ocean but says “Great Lakes Wind does not provide the same electric and reliability benefits” by comparison. Ocean wind tends to be closer to areas where electricity demand is high, which can make those projects more cost-effective.

New York also concluded in 2022 that despite the combined 144.5 terawatt-hours of annual technical potential in state waters in Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, “numerous practical considerations … would need to be addressed before such projects can be successfully commercialized.”

To further explore the concerns New York’s report and others have raised, in 2024, with National Science Foundation funding, we collaborated with a team of researchers looking at a wide range of issues, including engineering, environmental effects and law. That effort resulted in articulating research questions whose answers would clarify how realistic different aspects of offshore wind could be in the Great Lakes, such as:

How does ice that forms in freshwater affect the structural integrity of turbines?

Are floating turbines a better fit than traditional fixed-bottom turbines to reach the higher wind speeds in the deeper parts of the lakes and out of view from shore?

If turbine components and installation vessels can’t fit through the St. Lawrence Seaway, could they be built in the region and drive economic development?

Can turbines be located in places that improve fisheries and avoid migratory paths of birds and bats?

How can states establish leasing and permitting programs that maximize environmental, social and economic benefits?

State jurisdiction is an opportunity

In the oceans, U.S. states have jurisdiction from shore out three miles, with the federal government’s jurisdiction continuing out for hundreds of miles beyond that. So offshore project sites in the oceans are leased by the federal government.

The Great Lakes are different. The state governments hold the lakes’ waters and submerged lands in trust for the public. And state jurisdiction extends from shore all the way out to the boundary of a neighboring state’s jurisdiction or the international boundary with Canada.

Regulation of planning, site selection, leasing and other elements of offshore wind projects in the Great Lakes are the responsibility of one or another U.S. state. The federal government’s role is secondary, conducting environmental reviews and protecting navigation, but could still result in slowing state-led projects.

In research we published in 2024 and 2025, we explain that states could evaluate and select offshore wind projects based on a range of social and environmental benefits, in addition to financial considerations. For instance, they could look for designs that provide fish habitat or seek corporate partners that agree to train local workers, manufacture turbines and ships near the lakes, and provide cheaper electricity to local consumers.

Despite all the unknowns, we encourage greater support for research to harness the potential of offshore wind energy in the Great Lakes to be a renewable resource for states, the region and the nation as a whole.","https://www.goerie.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/02/NETN/74277612007-getty-images-520511959.jpg?crop=3350,1885,x0,y1426&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-30 05:57:12.566523

Not to be outdone, Thailand committed to buying $5.4 billion in American energy on an annual basis. A successive trip to South Korea secured the annual purchase of 3.3 tons of American LNG.

Asia has not been the only bright spot. Trump’s trade deal with the EU, announced earlier this year, saw Brussels agree to invest $750 billion in American energy by 2028.

Congress has also gotten in on the action, primarily via the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which mandated offshore oil and gas leases, opening up drilling in the Gulf of America. It also brought down the federal royalty rate for offshore gas and oil development to 12.5%, restoring it to where it was before former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act increased it to over 16%.

The “big, beautiful” bill also included the Enhancing Energy Recovery Act. Originally a separate bill, the legislation increased 45Q tax credits. While these may not be well-known, they are extremely important for companies in the energy sector, as they provide tax credits for carbon capture. Previous versions of the tax credit were limited to only certain types of companies; the bill eliminated this, allowing for what lawmakers called “across-the-board” access.

But there is more that can be done. The Natural Gas Export Expansion Act, currently pending before the Senate, will make it easier for the U.S. to expedite LNG abroad to any country that is not under sanction. Sponsored by Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), the bill recognizes that LNG will be, going forward, a key tool for the U.S. as it navigates a multipolar world order where Russia, China, and other adversaries are all seeking economic leverage. At the same time, it empowers domestic producers — helping America at home and abroad.

MIKE JOHNSON WARNS DELIVERING ON TRUMP’S AFFORDABILITY AGENDA WILL TAKE ‘A WHILE’: ‘VERY COMPLEX’

Whether the Natural Gas Export Expansion Act is passed via a new reconciliation package or on its own, the Trump administration should throw its weight behind it, and Republicans should use their majority in the House to pass it, thereby giving it momentum in the Senate.

America is a land blessed with a plethora of natural resources, including energy. As we seek to bolster our own people while securing peace and stability abroad, we should use these resources to our advantage.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP24305092104734.jpg?resize=1200,683",N,,2025-11-30 05:57:43.745399

The U.S. Energy Department announced that most of its lending authority will be directed toward new nuclear power projects, to accelerate reactor construction as national electricity demand rises.

“We have significant lending authority at the loan program office,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright, at a conference hosted by the American Nuclear Society in Washington, D.C. “By far the biggest use of those dollars will be for nuclear power plants — to get those first plants built.”

An executive order from President Trump calls for breaking ground on ten large reactors by 2030, and the department expects private investors to commit substantial capital that could be paired with federal low-cost loans. Secretary Wright said he hopes to see numerous sites under construction by the end of the administration’s term.

The administration recently reached an agreement with Westinghouse’s owners to support up to $80 billion in nuclear development across the country. Officials say federal financing tools could help support reactor deployment.

Renewable energy digital services are becoming the foundation of our new energy system.","The energy industry is in a strange place right now. People talk nonstop about clean energy, net-zero goals, big plans for the future — but the practical side is much messier. Even if we keep adding solar and wind at a record pace, it’s still not enough. IRENA estimates that the world needs roughly 1,000 GW of new renewable capacity every year from now until 2030. It’s a massive target, and the older power grids we rely on were never designed for anything like this.

With conventional power plants, you more or less know what you’re getting. They run steadily, and operators can control the output. Renewables don’t behave that way. Digital systems help make sense of everything: they predict demand, estimate how much energy renewables will produce, and coordinate countless devices scattered across different regions. And now it’s worth looking at the companies that are actually pushing these solutions forward.

What renewable energy sources actually look like today

When people say “renewable energy,” they’re usually thinking about basic stuff. Solar panels on roofs. Maybe some windmills. But it’s gotten way more complex than that.

Solar energy now includes massive industrial parks generating hundreds of megawatts. There’s Al Dhafra PV2 in the UAE – the world’s biggest single-site solar plant with four million modules powering 200,000 homes. Some solar installations float on reservoirs. Others are built right into building facades.

Wind energy has gone offshore in a big way. Dogger Bank in the UK has turbines as tall as skyscrapers, sitting miles out in the North Sea where winds are stronger and more consistent. These things can power millions of homes.

Hydropower is old news, sure. But pumped hydro storage is basically a giant battery – pump water uphill when you have extra electricity, let it flow down through turbines when you need power. Simple physics, massive impact.

Biomass energy uses everything from agricultural waste to wood chips. Countries like India and the US are converting biomass plants that used to run on coal.

Geothermal just keeps running. No weather dependence, no variability. Iceland gets most of its energy this way. And green hydrogen, made by splitting water with renewable electricity, might be the future for heavy industry and shipping.

Here’s what all these sources have in common: they only work at scale if we have serious digital transformation in renewable energy. You can’t manage this many variables, this much data, this many interconnected systems without software that can think faster than humans.

The companies building these solutions

1. DXC Technology

DXC gets into the complicated stuff. They build Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems – DERMS for short. What that means in plain English: software that can juggle thousands of solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries at once.

Their renewable energy digital services do real-time forecasting and balancing. When a cloud covers a solar farm, the system already knows and has adjusted before anyone notices a flicker. They use predictive analytics to figure out what’s going to happen hours or days ahead, which matters when you’re trying to keep the lights on for millions of people.

The thing about DXC is they’re focused on helping utilities transition without blowing up their existing infrastructure. Grid stability sounds boring until your power goes out. Their systems make sure that doesn’t happen, even when half your electricity is coming from sources that change by the minute.

2. Siemens Energy

Siemens has been in energy forever. Their Omnivise Digital Solutions covers pretty much everything – from the moment you build a power plant to the day you tear it down decades later. They make distributed control systems that pull data from every sensor, every turbine, every transformer, and show it all in one place.

What’s interesting is their edge computing for substations. Instead of sending all data to some central cloud and waiting for instructions, the processing happens right there on-site. Milliseconds matter when you’re managing a grid.

Siemens is also deep into green hydrogen tech. They’re working on projects in over 100 countries and their equipment generates about half the world’s electricity. When you flip a light switch, there’s a decent chance Siemens technology is involved somewhere in that chain.

3. Schneider Electric

Schneider built EcoStruxure, which is basically their answer to “how do we make everything smarter?” It connects hardware, software, and services to optimize energy use in buildings, factories, and grids.

Their new One Digital Grid Platform uses AI to manage planning, operations, and asset management all in one place. The AI automatically catches when the digital model of a grid doesn’t match reality – like when someone forgot to update the system after installing new equipment. Sounds simple, but that kind of mismatch causes real problems.

Schneider also runs a venture fund backing startups working on clean energy tech. Their approach to digital transformation in renewable energy includes everything from microgrid management to consulting services that help companies figure out how to actually decarbonize their supply chains.

4. ABB

ABB does electrification and automation at a massive scale. They make robotic systems for manufacturing solar panels, complete instrumentation packages for solar and wind plants, and the smart grid systems that tie it all together.

Their battery storage solutions are particularly interesting. BESS-as-a-Service means companies can use battery systems without buying them outright. For industrial users trying to cut electricity costs during peak hours, that’s huge. You get energy independence without the capital expenditure.

ABB supplies converters for the world’s biggest offshore wind farms and generators for hydroelectric plants. Their renewable energy digital services include distributed control systems that give operators real-time visibility into everything happening across their assets. Less downtime means more power generation means more money.

5. GE Vernova

GE Vernova is the spinoff from General Electric that focuses purely on power generation and grid management. They generate about 25% of the world’s electricity through their installed base of 2200 GW worth of equipment.

Their Grid Orchestration Software uses AI to predict demand, optimize energy flow, and integrate all those distributed resources we keep talking about. Their Advanced Asset Performance Management system pulls data from information systems, operational systems, and engineering models to help people make faster decisions.

GE Vernova partnered with Amazon Web Services to accelerate cloud migration and bring generative AI into energy infrastructure. They’re working on everything from wind farms to small modular reactors. The renewable energy digital services from GE Vernova are about coordination – making sure different energy sources work together instead of fighting each other.

6. IBM Energy and Utilities

IBM brings Watson and AI expertise to energy. Their Maximo platform manages assets, and Watson handles the heavy data analytics. They’re using AI to forecast renewable energy production, optimize maintenance schedules, and manage distributed resources.

IBM is also experimenting with quantum computing for modeling complex energy systems. Their blockchain platforms enable peer-to-peer energy trading – imagine selling excess solar power from your roof directly to your neighbor. They build digital twins that simulate how turbines, transformers, and entire grids will behave under different conditions.

Cloud solutions from IBM let energy companies scale operations without spending millions on IT infrastructure. Digital transformation in renewable energy from IBM is about making the complex stuff manageable through better data and better intelligence.

7. Accenture

Accenture isn’t selling hardware or software directly. They’re consultants who help energy companies figure out their entire digital transformation strategy. Sometimes the problem isn’t technology – it’s knowing which technology to use and how to implement it without disrupting your business.

They work with industry leaders on IoT, Big Data, AI, and cloud solutions. Their approach covers operational excellence, asset management, customer experience, and decarbonization. Renewable energy digital services from Accenture include predictive maintenance for wind and solar farms, platforms for managing virtual power plants, and real-time carbon emission monitoring.

They also help companies integrate ESG principles into operations and reporting.

Why this stuff actually matters

We’re at a turning point. IRENA calls digital transformation in renewable energy a “critical catalyst” for hitting COP28 targets – tripling renewable capacity by 2030. Companies investing in digital solutions are already cutting operational costs by 20-30%.

Predictive analytics can forecast wind and solar generation 24-48 hours ahead. That gives grid operators time to prepare for fluctuations. IoT sensors detect equipment failures weeks before they happen, cutting maintenance costs by 20% and extending equipment life by 3-5 years.

Fixing this requires collaboration between private companies, governments, and tech firms. Projects like TwinEU – a 25 million euro initiative to create a digital twin of Europe’s electricity grid – show what’s possible when everyone works together. Denmark and Germany are already using digital twins to improve renewable integration and prevent grid failures.

Bottom line

Digital transformation in renewable energy isn’t optional anymore. The world is electrifying transportation, industry, and buildings. The only way to provide stable, affordable, clean energy is through smart grids that can adapt on the fly.

These seven companies – DXC Technology, Siemens Energy, Schneider Electric, ABB, GE Vernova, IBM, and Accenture – each tackle the problem differently. Some focus on hardware and automation. Others build software and analytics. Some create comprehensive consulting strategies.

Renewable energy digital services are becoming the foundation of our new energy system. They let us not just generate cleaner energy, but use it smarter.

Ola Electric’s Backup Plan On a sticky wicket, the listed EV maker has switched to plan B — B for battery.","When a hero product begins to wobble, the founder’s first instinct is almost always the same: pull the diversification lever. That’s exactly the crossroads where Bhavish Aggarwal of Ola Electric is finding himself standing. And he has been swift in diversifying. In October, Aggarwal launched Ola Shakti, a residential battery energy storage system (BESS).

The device, which uses Ola’s in-house 4680 Bharat Cells, has been built to provide power backup to residential units, farms, and commercial purposes.

But why this diversification from an EV maker, one may ask?

Well, once celebrated as India’s largest electric vehicle maker, with a commanding 30% market share, Ola Electric’s state of affairs is in complete shambles. The company has lost its leadership position, thanks to its shrinking monthly unit sales, which it acknowledges could fall even further. Then, raising fresh capital has become challenging for the EV maker.

The tension is clearly visible. While its losses continued to take a toll on its balance sheet, compounded with falling revenues, its cash balance dropped to INR 2,903 Cr in Q2 FY26 from INR 3,959 Cr in March 2025.

This erosion has bit Ola Electric, and Aggarwal has been forced to shift his narrative and capital towards an ancillary business that he hopes will eventually reduce costs and offset slowing scooter demand.

While the future holds the answer to whether the bet will eventually pay off, let’s trace how the EV juggernaut skidded out of the fast lane.

The EV Rocket That Lost Its Grip

For years, Ola Electric symbolised India’s EV two wheeler revolution. Despite arriving later than its Bengaluru rival Ather Energy, Ola Electric sprinted ahead with a strong brand recall, aggressive marketing, and rapid scale-up of its scooter manufacturing.

For a brief period, the company held a 30% market share. Ola Electric has struggled to be consistent.

Poor after-sales service, unresolved quality concerns, and intensifying competition steadily eroded its lead.

Compounding this, Ola Electric quietly shelved its ambitions in electric three-wheelers and cars, signalling that the company was stretched way too thin.

The situation further worsened when, in a bid to conserve cash, Ola Electric abruptly discontinued discounting, an aggressive pricing tactic that had fuelled its early rise. Without subsidies, customers simply walked away. The sales collapse was immediate, allowing Ather Energy to overtake Ola Electric.

While Ola Electric sold around 52,666 units in Q2 FY26, Ather sold around 66,000 units in the quarter.

This reversal of fortunes has made fundraising exceedingly difficult for the EV major. Lenders have steered clear of the company’s proposal to raise INR 1,700 Cr via debt, a plan that was approved by the company board in May 2025. But more than six months later, the company is yet to conclude this raise.

Now, the company wants to raise INR 1,500 Cr in a mix of debt and equity, for which it received a shareholder nod this week.

While the company has avoided stating the reasons for this change in plans, backers are wary of declining sales and the absence of a stable operating model.

Ola Electric’s Backup Plan

On a sticky wicket, the listed EV maker has switched to plan B — B for battery.

In a move that many believe was inspired from Tesla’s journey, Aggarwal announced in 2022 that Ola Electric would manufacture its own cells to gain control over costs and supply chains.

By 2024, Bhavish Aggarwal was ambitiously projecting a 100 GWh battery cell capacity, even as Ola Electric was laying the groundwork for a mere 1.4 GWh.

Delays were inevitable. The much-touted “indigenous” battery cell, expected to be mass-produced in 2023, finally entered production in Q1 FY26, almost two years behind schedule.

Then, just one quarter after stating that Ola Electric would complete 5 GWh of installation by FY26, Aggarwal revised the target to 5.9 GWh by FY26-end and 20 GWh by the second half of 2027.

This ongoing course correction, with every milestone pushed back again and again, shows that it has been rather tough for Aggarwal to scale its battery manufacturing. Besides, the cell business is a major cash guzzler.

In Q2 FY26, its battery vertical, Ola Cell Technologies, clocked a mere INR 4 Cr in top line (up from INR 1 Cr in Q2 FY25), while losses surged a massive 61% YoY to INR 79 Cr.

To aid the slowing sales of its EV scooters, Ola needs a new narrative, and ideally, a new revenue generator. And its diversification to battery tech fits perfectly.

Aggarwal sees FY26 as a ‘transition year’ where Ola activates its next growth vector in energy. He claims this energy segment will generate INR 100 Cr by Q4 FY26, and INR 1,200 Cr by FY27.

Given Ola’s history of overpromising and underdelivering, these numbers could be just fancy mumbo jumbo.

An Uncertain Road Ahead

Aggarwal is now reportedly pitching his newly launched residential battery system to investors, an implicit sign that the scooter business no longer inspires confidence on its own. But the path ahead is fraught with structural challenges.

The battery storage market is already dominated by giants such as Exide and Amara Raja that have deep pockets, strong goodwill, and powerful distribution networks.

While the market is dominated by lead acid battery systems sold at relatively low price points, Ola Electric is attempting to sell pricey lithium-ion packs, priced in the range of INR 29,999 to a steep INR 1,59,999, depending on capacity.

Then there’s the challenge of building a nationwide distribution network from scratch, which will put even more pressure on the company’s already strained balance sheet. Putting pressure further on this will be Ola’s credibility in the market.

Its new 4680 cells, though positioned as a technological breakthrough, are untested at scale. The company’s history of quality issues with its scooters still hangs over it, and any reliability problems with these battery packs could cripple the segment even before it takes off.

Aggarwal may be betting big on energy storage, but he is entering a category where reputation, reliability and service matter more than hype – the areas where Ola still has significant ground to gain.

As for now, Ola Electric’s diversification to energy storage appears to be a defensive manoeuvre against sliding scooter sales, missed fundraising attempts, and eroding investor trust.

Aggarwal may frame this as the company’s next growth frontier, but the reality is that Ola is stepping into a capital-heavy, competition-dense industry with untested technology, a fragile brand trust, and weak balance sheets.

The question is simple: Is Ola only delaying the inevitable, or charting a real comeback?",https://inc42.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75/https://asset.inc42.com/2025/11/The-outline-ola-electric-social-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 06:58:15.833069

But manufacturing the solar panels, wind turbines and battery cells for those energy sources is anything but clean.

Most production facilities require large amounts of electricity from emission-spewing coal and gas plants to make them, explained Sergey Paltsev, deputy director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy.

Mining the minerals needed for solar panels and batteries also requires huge amounts of mostly dirty energy and can also pollute the environment and endanger the health of local residents.

“Low-carbon sources are lower, but they’re not zero,” Paltsev said. “We definitely need to educate both decision-makers and the general public on making sure that we are not making claims which are not realistic.”

It all begs the question: How clean really is green energy, and do the potential benefits offset the negative impacts?

‘There’s a big difference’

Manufacturing wind, solar and batteries can come with a significant upfront carbon footprint. But nearly all research agrees that those energy sources produce far fewer greenhouse gas emissions than coal or gas over their entire lifecycle.

Coal plants, on average, generate 1,000 grams of CO2 for every kilowatt hour of energy produced, according to an analysis by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

Wind generates 13 grams per kilowatt hour; solar produces 28 grams; and lithium-ion batteries generate 33 grams, according to the analysis.

“When you are comparing around 10 grams versus 1,000, that’s a big difference,” Paltsev said. “We need to keep that scale in perspective.”

To put those numbers in perspective, solar panels need to operate for 4 to 8 months to offset their manufacturing emissions; wind turbines need about three months to two years; and lithium batteries take 1 to 3 years.

That’s a short stretch in the lifespan of a solar array.

“When we do a solar system, it’s there for 30 years if you want it to be,” said Allan O’Shea, president of Contractors Building Supply in Copemish. “You will continue to make your return on investment on the minerals and silver and steel, the aluminum you’ve put into it and the glass.”

Fossil fuels also generate huge amounts of toxic air pollution that killed more than 8 million people worldwide in 2018, according to a Harvard University study released in 2021.

While manufacturing solar, wind and other clean energy sources produce some air pollution, the technology is completely clean once it’s operational.

Reducing air pollution through clean energy sources could help save 400,000 American lives by 2050, according to Princeton University’s 2021 Net Zero America study.

“Coal is really out there in terms of the bad impacts,” Paltsev said. “So, at this point, even though wind and solar isn’t at zero emissions, it’s still better.”

Getting green clean

But even with clean energy’s clear track record of producing less pollution and earth-warming gases, its downside shouldn’t be ignored, argued Dustin Mulvaney, an environmental studies professor at San Jose State University.

Today, many solar panels and batteries contain toxic chemicals that could be hazardous to human health, but still slip under the regulatory radar.

A case in point: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in December banned the use of trichloroethylene, which increases risks of certain cancers, in nearly every industry. Battery manufacturers, however, don’t have to phase out their use for 20 years.

“Here’s a hazardous chemical that’s in the battery supply chain that is not necessarily being adequately addressed,” said Mulvaney. “The EPA is putting this green halo on batteries, saying we forgive all of the bad sides to this.”

Mining lithium for electric-vehicle batteries is notoriously bad for the environment, using vast amounts of water in sometimes arid locations while employing heavy machinery that generates tons of emissions.

Silicon mining for solar panels also poses major health risks to workers, who face permanent and sometimes fatal lung diseases by inhaling toxic silica dust.

Mining can also pollute groundwater and degrade soil.

Most solar panels, wind turbines and some batteries also end up in landfills at the end of their lifecycle, which negatively impacts the environment.

Although the research is clear that clean energy produces fewer carbon emissions than fossil fuels, there currently is no metric measuring the overall, life-to-death environmental impact of green technologies, noted Paltsev with MIT.

Mulvaney argued that although it’s imperative to reduce the impacts of climate change through green energy, the people who do deal with its negative side effects, like polluted groundwater or increased health risks, shouldn’t be ignored.

“I think it’s dangerous to dismiss these impacts,” he said. “Even if 7 billion people benefit and only 20 people suffer on the planet, I think those 20 people deserve attention.”

Approaching zero

But new technology and improved manufacturing processes for clean energy sources are quickly diminishing those adverse impacts.

Companies like Arizona-based First Solar have developed a panel that doesn’t use silicon, greatly reducing its carbon footprint and water usage, compared to traditional arrays.

The publicly traded company with facilities in four countries also started the first global solar recycling program, and today recovers 90% of the materials in each module it produces.

The American Battery Technology Company is innovating ways to recycle lithium batteries and extract the rare metals inside to sell back into the battery-supply chain. The system reduces the need for mining and produces American-sourced metals with less environmental impact, according to the company.

Even China, where about 80% of all solar panels are manufactured, has since 2011 halved the CO2 produced through its manufacturing processes, according to the International Energy Agency. Still, total emissions from solar manufacturing there have almost quadrupled in the same time as production skyrockets.

Solar panels can be recycled, O’Shea said. His solar array company has replaced a few dozen out of the thousands it’s installed since transitioning to installing the arrays in the mid-90s. Those were broken by hail, the occasional golf ball or vandalism.

While those panels went back to the manufacturer to be recycled, others that still function could get a second life, O’Shea said.

Advances in photovoltaics have improved a panel’s efficiency from converting 17% of solar energy to electricity up to 23%.

That’s led some utility-scale array operators to upgrade their panels, as even a small increase in efficiency adds up over time and across thousands of panels, O’Shea said. If the old ones still function, they can be refurbished and resold.

“So if it tests properly … it can still be very viable for 15 years or more,” he said.

Paltsev said how quickly green energy can move toward net-zero emissions in the U.S. really depends on policymakers and the economic incentives that they can provide.

That matters, he argued, because reduced emissions from clean energy won’t be enough to curb climate change in the long run. Greenhouse gases are also coming from non-energy sources like agriculture and deforestation, Paltsev noted.

Until zero emissions are reached across the globe, temperatures will continue to rise and contribute to a surge in catastrophic weather events around world.

“At some point, I think there will be a huge demand for much more aggressive actions, because when you see things which are destroying your way of life, you will start asking more and more loudly that policymakers do something,” he said.",https://www.cnhi.com/wp-content/themes/cnhi/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-30 08:04:39.099280

""It shows how to accelerate those retirements using drivers that worked with other retired or soon-to-be retired coal plants.""","A recent study led to the development of a comprehensive framework that policymakers can use to retire America's coal plants forever.

The study, published in Nature Energy, was conducted by a team of researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara. A Tech Xplore article said that the goal was to develop a strategy to speed up the country's transition away from coal power.

Although many coal plants have already shut down, over 100 remain active with no retirement plans, per the outlet. The plants' continued operation could make it more difficult to meet carbon pollution goals meant to protect air quality and health.

But shutting down coal plant operations can be more complicated than one might realize.

""Our goal was to build tools that reflect that complexity, so different actors can take on different facets of the problem,"" said study lead Sidney Gathrid, for whom the project started as a senior thesis. ""There's no one straightforward path, and we wanted to do research that represented that reality.""

The researchers' framework has two major points that policymakers could use to inform their decisions.

One is the ""contextual retirement vulnerability"" score, which measures a coal plant's likelihood of shutting down. The other is ""retirement archetypes"" — patterns that explain why plants may close, such as economic, health-based, and political factors.

Burning coal can have a variety of negative impacts on human health. For example, the pollutants from burning coal can lead to respiratory concerns, lung disease, and brain damage, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Coal power plants can also affect the environment. The Union of Concerned Scientists stated that ash may contaminate waterways, impacting recreation and drinking supplies.

That makes this new framework an exciting opportunity to close the coal plants that have had lasting impacts on people and the planet.

Some research suggests that coal use in the U.S. has reached its lowest since the 1960s. Another study discovered that most coal plants cost more to maintain than it would to replace them with wind or solar.

""What's exciting is that this framework doesn't just describe which plants might retire,"" said senior author and professor Grace Wu. ""It shows how to accelerate those retirements using drivers that worked with other retired or soon-to-be retired coal plants.""

The scientists involved in the study believe the framework could even be adapted for other energy policy efforts. Wu said: ""It's flexible, transparent and reproducible — exactly what we need to make smarter, more strategic decisions about the energy transition.""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OX.727hkan2HkayN4JFviw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/9b332861fed2429d98ccbac82e6e6773,N,,2025-11-30 06:58:27.245509

JEFF ROLANDER

VICE PRESIDENT OF CLAIMS AND CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, FAYE, RICHMOND

After almost 20 years working for Allianz Group subsidiaries, Jeff Rolander left the French corporation in late 2021 to join Richmond travel insurance startup Faye, drawn by its focus on customer loyalty and retention. Following his most recent promotion, Rolander oversees the claims and frontline teams, comprising almost all of Faye’s roughly 50-person local workforce.

Founded in 2019 and owned by Zenner, Faye achieved $100 million in sales revenue this year, and Time magazine included the company on its Best Inventions of 2025 list. Its app allows customers to file claims quickly and to keep them in a virtual wallet, as well as offering a “cancel for any reason” coverage option.

Faye’s corporate office is in Delaware, but it has major hubs in Richmond and Tel Aviv. The company has leased an office in Henrico County, and it anticipates more growth in 2026. With about 150 employees worldwide, the company hopes to grow its local headcount by 35% within the next year.

GWENN ROSENER

CEO, FLEXPROFESSIONALS, FAIRFAX

In 2010, Gwenn Rosener co-founded her staffing firm, FlexProfessionals, which even pre-pandemic has focused on finding remote and hybrid jobs for women with family demands. The company has worked with about 1,000 companies over the past decade and a half, and many of its placements are in accounting, sales, marketing and human resources at organizations throughout Northern Virginia.

Before starting FlexProfessionals, Rosener was a systems engineer at General Electric and a senior manager at Capgemini, the French multinational IT company that purchased Ernst & Young Consulting in 2000.

Amid federal spending cuts and job layoffs in the private and public sectors, Rosener and her colleagues have been very busy fielding calls this year. Speaking this summer, Rosener said that many of the former federal workers she’s spoken with never expected to go through another job search after landing what used to be dependably secure employment.

JEFF WHITT

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, , LYNCHBURG

In February, former Framatome U.S. Government Solutions President Jeff Whitt became executive director of the Virginia Innovative Nuclear Hub. Created in 2024 with a seed grant of $350,000 from the Virginia Department of Energy, the organization connects researchers, utilities and nuclear tech companies, including Lynchburg’s Framatome, in promoting nuclear energy production in Virginia.

This year, the VIN Hub received $1.2 million in grants to create a research facility around a microscale reactor, all still in the planning stages.

Small modular nuclear reactors have a major cheerleader in Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who has promoted SMRs as a clean energy source amid higher power demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

NATALIA ZAPPERNICK

DIRECTOR OF HORTICULTURE, , RICHMOND

In her sophomore year at Ohio State University, Natalia Zappernick decided that she wanted to work in biosystems and agricultural engineering. “I really haven’t looked back since then,” she says.

Zappernick moved from Baltimore’s Bowery Farming to Richmond this summer to start her new job as horticulture director for Babylon Micro-Farms, a growing indoor farming operation.

On a recent morning, Zappernick and two colleagues were studying 11 micro-farms at the Inc. 5000 company’s Richmond headquarters. “We’ll spend our day seeing what we need to do in terms of harvesting and farming tasks, collecting data, synthesizing it and sort of interpreting if our research trials worked or didn’t work,” she explains.

In 2026, Zappernick plans to expand Babylon’s produce menu. Currently, the company cultivates more than 45 leafy greens, lettuces, microgreens, herbs and flowers for its customers, including Aramark, Sodexo and other food service corporations.

The precious metals landscape has transformed dramatically as global monetary systems face unprecedented stress. While traditional economic models suggested moderate commodity appreciation, the convergence of multiple destabilizing forces has created conditions far beyond conventional forecasting parameters. Furthermore, silver's rise to all-time highs reflects deeper structural shifts that extend well beyond typical supply-demand dynamics.

Monetary Policy Shifts Creating Perfect Storm Conditions

Federal Reserve policy pivots have fundamentally altered opportunity cost calculations across asset classes. When central bank officials signal dovish positioning amid persistent inflationary pressures, non-yielding assets like precious metals suddenly appear more attractive relative to debt instruments offering negative real returns.

Interest rate cut speculation has amplified this dynamic considerably. Market participants increasingly view precious metals as essential portfolio components when monetary authorities prioritise employment metrics over price stability concerns. This environment particularly favours silver given its dual role as both monetary metal and industrial commodity.

Currency debasement concerns now extend beyond traditional dollar-skeptic demographics. Institutional investors increasingly recognise that monetary expansion policies create wealth preservation challenges that standard portfolio diversification cannot adequately address. In addition, the silver market squeeze impact demonstrates how monetary uncertainty translates into tangible market dynamics.

Central bank coordination failures have created additional monetary uncertainty. When major economies pursue conflicting policy objectives, currency volatility increases substantially, driving demand for assets with intrinsic value independent of government backing.

Inflation Persistence Rewarding Hard Asset Positioning

Consumer price index data continues revealing elevated inflation levels despite aggressive policy interventions. This persistence validates precious metals allocation strategies that many investors adopted during initial inflationary phases but later questioned during temporary price corrections.

Real interest rates have turned negative across multiple developed economies. When inflation-adjusted returns on government bonds and bank deposits become negative, precious metals offer compelling alternatives despite their lack of yield generation.

Currency purchasing power erosion has accelerated wealth preservation demand among high-net-worth individuals. Historical analysis demonstrates that during periods of sustained monetary expansion, silver often outperforms other inflation hedges due to its industrial demand component creating additional price support.

Historical inflation hedging performance validates silver allocation strategies employed by sophisticated investors. During the 1970s inflationary period, silver achieved record returns significantly exceeding those of gold, real estate, and equity markets, establishing precedents that current market participants reference when making allocation decisions.

How Are Industrial Demand Dynamics Reshaping Silver Market Fundamentals?

Industrial consumption patterns have evolved beyond historical precedents as technological transformation accelerates. The electrification megatrend encompasses transportation, energy generation, storage systems, and digital infrastructure, all requiring substantial silver quantities for optimal performance characteristics.

Green Energy Transition Driving Structural Consumption Growth

Solar panel installations require approximately 20 grams of silver per unit manufactured. As renewable energy mandates expand globally, this consumption base continues growing exponentially. Photovoltaic efficiency depends heavily on silver's superior electrical conductivity properties, making substitution technically challenging without performance degradation.

Electric vehicle production consumes unprecedented silver quantities compared to traditional automotive manufacturing. Each electric vehicle requires significantly more silver than conventional automobiles due to enhanced electrical systems, battery management components, and charging infrastructure requirements.

Renewable energy infrastructure demands conductive metal components throughout power generation, transmission, and storage systems. Wind turbines, smart grid technology, and energy storage systems all incorporate substantial silver quantities, creating sustained industrial demand independent of financial market conditions.

The electrification megatrend represents a multi-decade demand trajectory that supply planners struggle to accommodate. Unlike cyclical industrial demands that fluctuate with economic conditions, this structural transformation appears irreversible given climate policy commitments worldwide.

Application Annual Demand (Million Oz) Growth Rate (YoY) Photovoltaics 140 +18% Electronics 240 +8% Automotive 55 +25% Medical Devices 15 +12%

Supply Constraints Amplifying Price Discovery Mechanisms

Primary mine production has stagnated due to ore grade deterioration across major producing regions. Geological surveys indicate that easily accessible high-grade silver deposits have been largely exploited, forcing miners to process increasingly lower-grade materials at higher operational costs.

Environmental regulations now restrict new project development in many jurisdictions. Permitting processes extend development timelines far beyond historical norms, creating supply response delays that cannot accommodate rapid demand growth in emerging applications.

Geopolitical tensions disrupt traditional supply chains regularly. Trade disputes, sanctions, and resource nationalism policies affect silver flows between major producing and consuming nations, creating additional supply uncertainty that market participants must price accordingly.

Recycling rates remain insufficient to offset consumption growth. While electronic waste contains substantial silver quantities, recovery processes are energy-intensive and economically viable only at elevated price levels, limiting recycled supply elasticity during price increases.

What Geopolitical Catalysts Are Accelerating Safe-Haven Demand?

International trade tensions have escalated beyond conventional diplomatic frameworks. Recent announcements regarding potential tariff increases reaching 100% on strategic commodities signal a fundamental shift toward economic nationalism that undermines global supply chain efficiency.

Trade War Escalation Creating Market Uncertainty

Rare earth export controls fragment global supply networks in ways that affect multiple industries simultaneously. When nations weaponise resource access, international businesses must develop alternative sourcing strategies that often prove more expensive and less reliable than previous arrangements.

Technology transfer restrictions disrupt industrial partnerships that previously facilitated efficient production processes. These disruptions force companies to develop domestic capabilities or alternative international relationships, creating transitional periods characterised by increased costs and operational uncertainty.

Furthermore, the tariff impacts on silver demonstrate how economic nationalism policies reshape international commerce toward bilateral rather than multilateral frameworks. This transformation reduces efficiency gains from comparative advantage while increasing transaction costs across international borders.

Government Shutdown Aftermath Revealing Systemic Vulnerabilities

Federal operations disruptions highlight institutional fragility that concerns market participants. When government functions cease temporarily, economic data collection suffers, policy implementation delays occur, and market confidence decreases regarding institutional stability.

Economic data collection interruptions create information gaps that complicate investment decision-making. Missing economic indicators force market participants to rely on incomplete information, increasing uncertainty premiums across asset classes.

Policy implementation delays generate market volatility as businesses postpone investment decisions pending clarity regarding regulatory frameworks. This uncertainty particularly affects long-term industrial projects requiring substantial capital commitments.

Debt ceiling concerns resurface despite temporary resolutions. Each recurring debt ceiling debate undermines confidence in fiscal sustainability while highlighting political dysfunction that could eventually threaten economic stability.

How Do Current Silver Valuations Compare to Historical Precedents?

Current silver valuations appear modest when examined through historical inflation-adjusted analysis. Market participants increasingly recognise that nominal price comparisons provide misleading perspectives without considering currency debasement effects over extended periods.

Inflation-Adjusted Price Analysis Revealing Undervaluation

The 1980 peak equivalent exceeds $180 in current purchasing power terms. This comparison suggests substantial upside potential exists if similar monetary conditions develop, though market participants acknowledge that contemporary industrial demand provides additional price support not present during previous cycles.

Real price performance has lagged behind monetary expansion significantly. Federal Reserve balance sheet growth over the past two decades far exceeds silver's rise to all-time highs, indicating that monetary metals have not kept pace with currency creation rates.

Asset class rotation potential suggests significant upside opportunities. When institutional investors recognise that traditional portfolio allocations inadequately address monetary debasement risks, precious metals allocation increases often occur rapidly and substantially.

Risk-adjusted returns favour precious metals allocation within diversified portfolios. Academic studies demonstrate that modest precious metals allocations improve portfolio risk-return characteristics across various economic scenarios.

A 1923 US Silver Peace Dollar containing 0.7734 troy ounces now holds $44.15 in metal value alone, representing 4,315% currency debasement over 102 years.

Gold-Silver Ratio Dynamics Indicating Relative Opportunity

The current 74.6x ratio exists below the century average of 69.4x, suggesting potential mean reversion opportunities. Historical analysis indicates that extreme ratio readings often precede significant silver outperformance periods.

Industrial demand creates structural ratio compression pressures. Unlike gold, silver's substantial industrial consumption provides price support that becomes particularly important during economic expansion phases when industrial activity accelerates.

Investment flows increasingly favour higher-beta precious metals exposure. When investors seek precious metals exposure, silver's greater volatility appeals to those seeking enhanced return potential despite increased risk characteristics.

However, comprehensive gold-silver ratio analysis reveals complex dynamics beyond simple mean reversion expectations.

What Supply-Demand Imbalances Are Supporting Price Momentum?

Market fundamentals reveal structural deficit conditions that traditional economic models struggle to accommodate. Annual consumption now exceeds mine production by over 200 million ounces, creating inventory drawdown pressures that affect market dynamics substantially.

Structural Deficit Conditions Tightening Physical Markets

Exchange-traded product inflows accelerate inventory drawdown from available stockpiles. When institutional investors seek silver exposure through ETF purchases, these products must acquire physical metal, removing supply from industrial markets.

Industrial stockpiling creates additional demand pressure beyond immediate consumption requirements. Manufacturers increasingly maintain larger inventories to ensure production continuity amid supply chain disruptions, effectively removing metal from available markets.

Speculative positioning amplifies price volatility in both directions. When trend-following strategies dominate futures market activity, price movements often exceed levels justified by fundamental supply-demand conditions alone.

Furthermore, silver supply deficits highlight the structural challenges facing market equilibrium.

Mine Development Pipeline Insufficient for Demand Growth

New project economics require silver prices above $40 for development viability. At current cost structures, most potential projects cannot generate adequate returns unless prices remain elevated substantially above historical averages.

Permitting delays extend development timelines beyond demand curve projections. Environmental review processes now require multiple years for completion, making supply response lag substantially behind demand growth in emerging applications.

Capital allocation favours higher-margin base metals projects over silver-focused developments. Mining companies typically prioritise copper, zinc, and nickel projects that offer superior return profiles compared to primary silver operations.

Exploration budgets have declined despite elevated commodity prices. Mining companies focus capital on developing known deposits rather than discovering new resources, limiting long-term supply growth potential.

Which Investment Strategies Are Capitalising on Silver's Momentum?

Investment approaches vary significantly across market participant categories. Institutional investors typically favour liquid instruments that provide silver exposure without storage complications, while sophisticated individual investors often pursue physical allocation strategies.

Exchange-Traded Product Flows Accelerating Price Discovery

ETF holdings have reached multi-year highs amid institutional adoption. These products provide convenient silver exposure for investors who cannot or prefer not to hold physical metal directly, creating substantial demand flows.

Futures positioning indicates continued bullish sentiment among managed money participants. Commitment of Traders data reveals speculative long positions approaching historical extremes, suggesting widespread optimism regarding price direction.

Options market activity reflects elevated volatility expectations. Implied volatility levels indicate that market participants anticipate significant price movements, creating opportunities for strategies that benefit from volatility expansion.

Retail investor participation expands through accessible products. Simplified investment vehicles enable broader participation in silver markets, creating additional demand from demographics previously unable to obtain meaningful exposure.

Consequently, sophisticated silver price strategies have evolved to capitalise on these market dynamics.

Mining Equity Leverage Amplifying Returns

Silver miners generate substantial operational leverage to underlying metal prices. When silver prices increase, mining companies benefit from fixed cost structures that amplify margin expansion effects significantly.

Production cost curves support margin expansion opportunities. Many producers operate with all-in sustaining costs below current price levels, creating substantial free cash flow generation potential at elevated prices.

Exploration upside creates additional value catalysts beyond current production profiles. Successful exploration programmes can substantially increase company valuations independent of prevailing metal prices.

Dividend policies evolve to reward shareholder returns. Mining companies increasingly return cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share buyback programmes, making equity ownership more attractive.

Security Return Leverage Ratio Global X Silver Miners ETF (SIL) +122% 1.3x Pan American Silver (PAAS) +111% 1.2x VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) +124% 1.1x

What Technical Indicators Support Continued Price Advancement?

Technical analysis reveals multiple confirmation signals suggesting sustained bullish momentum. Chart patterns, momentum oscillators, and volume characteristics align to support continued price advancement beyond current levels.

Momentum Signals Confirming Bullish Trajectory

Weekly parabolic trends indicate sustained buying pressure across extended periods. When parabolic indicators remain bullish across multiple timeframes simultaneously, trend continuation probability increases substantially.

Volume patterns support price breakout authenticity. Increasing volume during price advances suggests genuine participation rather than technical manipulation, providing confidence regarding trend sustainability.

Resistance level penetration creates new technical floors. Previous resistance zones often become support levels during subsequent corrections, establishing higher price ranges for future trading activity.

Moving average configurations signal trend continuation. When short-term averages remain above longer-term counterparts with expanding distances, momentum typically persists until configuration changes occur.

Market Structure Analysis Revealing Institutional Participation

Large speculator positioning has reached multi-year highs according to regulatory filings. Institutional participation provides price support during corrections while creating additional upward pressure during advances.

Commercial hedging activity declined relative to historical norms. When traditional short hedgers reduce positions, upward price pressure typically increases due to reduced selling pressure from producers.

Open interest expansion indicates genuine demand growth rather than position rotation. Increasing open interest during price advances suggests new capital entering markets rather than existing position adjustments.

Volatility patterns remain consistent with structural market shifts. Price volatility characteristics differ during fundamental trend changes compared to cyclical corrections, suggesting underlying demand changes.

How Might Regulatory Changes Impact Silver Market Dynamics?

Regulatory frameworks continue evolving in ways that favour silver-intensive technologies. Environmental mandates, energy transition policies, and financial market regulations all influence silver demand and investment flows substantially.

Environmental Policies Accelerating Industrial Demand

Carbon reduction mandates require silver-intensive technologies for implementation. Solar panels, electric vehicles, and energy storage systems all depend heavily on silver's unique properties, creating policy-driven demand growth.

Renewable energy subsidies support photovoltaic deployment across multiple jurisdictions. Government incentives make solar installations economically attractive, directly increasing silver consumption for electrical components.

Electric vehicle incentives drive automotive consumption beyond market-driven adoption rates. Tax credits and purchase subsidies accelerate EV adoption, creating additional silver demand from enhanced electrical systems.

Energy storage regulations favour silver-dependent solutions. Grid-scale storage requirements often specify technologies that incorporate substantial silver quantities for optimal performance characteristics.

Financial Market Regulations Affecting Investment Flows

Basel III implementation potentially supports physical precious metals demand. Banking regulations that require higher capital reserves for paper gold holdings may encourage physical allocation strategies among institutional investors.

Commodity position limits influence futures market structure. Regulatory constraints on speculative position sizes may reduce paper market influence while increasing physical market importance for price discovery.

Central bank reserve diversification policies increasingly include precious metals considerations. Monetary authorities seek alternatives to dollar-denominated assets, potentially creating additional institutional demand.

Tax policy changes affect investment vehicle preferences. Favourable tax treatment for specific precious metals investment structures influences capital allocation decisions among tax-sensitive investors.

What Scenarios Could Sustain Silver's All-Time High Trajectory?

Multiple scenario paths support continued silver price advancement beyond current levels. The convergence of monetary, industrial, and geopolitical factors creates conditions where various outcomes lead to sustained demand growth.

Bull Case: Convergence of Multiple Growth Drivers

Industrial demand growth exceeding 15% annually through 2027 represents a realistic outcome given current technology adoption trajectories. Solar installations, electric vehicle production, and energy storage deployment all support this growth scenario.

Monetary policy remaining accommodative amid persistent inflation creates continued precious metals demand. If central banks prioritise employment over price stability, negative real interest rates support non-yielding asset allocation.

Geopolitical tensions escalating safe-haven premium requirements affects portfolio allocation decisions. International conflict, trade disputes, and currency instability all favour assets with intrinsic value characteristics.

Supply disruptions creating acute shortage conditions become increasingly probable. Mining accidents, labour disputes, and geopolitical restrictions can rapidly tighten physical markets beyond normal supply-demand dynamics.

Base Case: Gradual Price Appreciation with Periodic Volatility

Steady industrial demand growth supporting a $45-55 price range reflects continued technology adoption without acceleration. This scenario assumes normal economic growth rates with gradual energy transition implementation.

Moderate monetary policy normalisation limits downside risk while constraining upside potential. Gradual interest rate adjustments allow economic adaptation without creating severe precious metals headwinds.

Technological substitution occurring gradually enables market adaptation without demand destruction. Alternative materials development proceeds slowly enough to allow supply adjustments and price optimisation.

New mine supply partially offsets consumption growth through gradual capacity expansion. Existing operations increase production while new projects come online with sufficient lead times to moderate price pressures.

What Are the Risk Factors?

Aggressive interest rate increases could reduce precious metals appeal substantially. Rapid monetary tightening that creates attractive real yields on fixed income instruments typically pressures non-yielding assets.

Technological breakthroughs enabling silver substitution in key applications represent long-term risks. Alternative materials development could eventually reduce industrial demand for critical applications.

Economic recession dampening industrial consumption requirements affects near-term demand projections. Reduced manufacturing activity directly impacts silver consumption across multiple applications.

Large-scale mine discoveries could significantly expand supply outlook. Major new deposits with favourable development characteristics could alter long-term supply-demand projections substantially.

Positioning for Silver's Next Phase

Silver's rise to all-time highs reflects fundamental shifts across monetary, industrial, and geopolitical landscapes. The structural supply deficit, combined with accelerating green energy adoption and persistent inflation concerns, creates conditions supporting continued upward pressure. While short-term volatility remains inevitable given silver's historical price characteristics, the underlying drivers appear sustainable across multiple economic scenarios.

The industrial demand transformation represents perhaps the most significant long-term factor supporting silver prices. Unlike previous precious metals rallies driven primarily by monetary concerns, current conditions feature substantial industrial consumption growth that provides price support independent of financial market sentiment. This dual-demand characteristic distinguishes silver from other precious metals and suggests greater resilience during potential economic transitions.

Investment strategies capitalising on silver's momentum vary significantly across risk preferences and time horizons. Direct physical ownership provides maximum exposure with storage considerations, while ETF products offer liquidity advantages for tactical allocation adjustments. Mining equity exposure amplifies returns but introduces additional operational and management risks that require careful evaluation.

The regulatory environment continues evolving in ways that generally favour silver demand growth. Environmental policies, energy transition mandates, and financial market regulations all create conditions supporting increased silver utilisation and investment demand. These policy trends appear unlikely to reverse given climate commitments and energy security concerns.

Market participants should remain cognisant of potential risk factors that could disrupt silver's rise to all-time highs. Aggressive monetary tightening, technological substitution breakthroughs, or major supply discoveries could alter market dynamics substantially. However, current conditions suggest these risks represent longer-term considerations rather than immediate threats to price advancement.

Analysis from Reuters highlights silver's outperformance compared to other precious metals, reinforcing the fundamental drivers supporting current market dynamics.

The project marks one of Europe’s most significant battery investments to date, accelerating affordable and sustainable electric mobility across the continent.

Set to start production in late 2026, the plant will supply batteries for up to one million EVs annually, cutting more than 30 million tons of CO₂ over vehicle lifetimes.

With a total investment of up to EUR 4.1 billion, the gigafactory will create more than 4,000 direct jobs and thousands of indirect jobs while strengthening the European battery value chain and the local industrial ecosystem. The project reflects CATL’s shift from “to Europe” to “in Europe, for Europe,” and now toward “of Europe” through deeper industrial integration.

Other Key highlights:

• Carbon Neutrality: Designed as Europe’s first carbon-neutral lithium battery factory.

• Technology Advancement: The project incorporates cutting-edge technologies such as Cell-to-Body design, enabling cells to be integrated directly into the vehicle structure, improving efficiency and safety.

• Sustainable Manufacturing: It will rely on more than 80% renewable energy supply and apply Industry 4.0 standards to ensure intelligent and sustainable processes.

The Zaragoza gigafactory reflects CATL’s evolving European strategy—from early exports “to Europe,” to establishing local production “in Europe, for Europe,” and now toward being “of Europe” through deeper industrial integration. This progression is rooted in the strategic partnership formed in 2016 between Stellantis and CATL, which has grown from a supplier relationship into a shared industrial venture, aligning both companies’ long-term visions for Europe’s electrification.

Europe is a cornerstone of CATL’s global strategy. The company is investing over EUR 11 billion into advanced manufacturing and innovation capabilities across Germany, Hungary, and Spain, underscoring its long-term commitment to Europe’s energy transition.

The board has continued to express interest in wanting a solar deal.
[ Dixon school board may sign onto solar plan to save energy costs ] In late 2022, the district moved forward on a solar project with Chicago-based energy company Econergy that estimated about $2 million in energy cost savings over 25 years.
Based on the lack of progress on the project, school board members voted to terminate those contracts in April 2025, but said they'd still like to pursue solar options.
Campbell said the only concern he has about the project with Solar One is how fast the district needs to move on its decision.","Nov. 29—The Dixon School Board has unanimously approved a solar contract that's expected to save the district roughly $500,000 over seven years in energy costs.

Under the agreement approved Wednesday, Nov. 19, with solar development firm Solar One, the district will purchase the power at a fixed rate of 3.6 cents per kilowatt hour for seven years. Dixon Public Schools Business Manager Marc Campbell said that's less than what it currently pays ComEd at a rate of 4.38 cents per kilowatt hour plus a distribution fee on each kilowatt.

""There is an immediate savings on the supply that it provides in the future. The board has continued to express interest in wanting a solar deal. This appears to be, in our opinion, one of the good ones that we can kind of stand on,"" Campbell said.

[ Dixon school board may sign onto solar plan to save energy costs ]

In late 2022, the district moved forward on a solar project with Chicago-based energy company Econergy that estimated about $2 million in energy cost savings over 25 years. Based on the lack of progress on the project, school board members voted to terminate those contracts in April 2025, but said they'd still like to pursue solar options.

""We're moving on and we're moving forward. We're looking to the future,"" Campbell said.

The contract is a 15-year commitment to operate the system, which has a life of 30 years. At the end of the first seven years, the district can either choose to extend its fixed rate for another eight years or buy the equipment at a fair market value with the option to pay for it at 0% interest over 10 years, according to the agreement.

Solar One Lead Industrial Developer Shawn Stonesifer, who's a 1998 Dixon High School graduate, said it's estimated to save the district $82,000 in the first year, about $70,000 each of the following six years and about $100,000 to $120,000 a year for eight years after that if the district purchases the system.

Those estimates are calculated using the district's past energy bills, with a 1.26% annual rate increase to account for inflation, Stonesifer said.

Campbell said the only concern he has about the project with Solar One is how fast the district needs to move on its decision.

""The 'One Big Beautiful Bill' has made significant changes in the industry. The biggest being timeline and expiration of credits and incentives,"" Campbell said.

President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" was signed into law in July. It includes large tax cuts in multiple areas, along with shifting the federal focus from clean energy to expanding domestic oil and gas production, according to whitehouse.gov.

In 2022 and 2023, ""everybody rushed to the table. There's lots and lots of solar developers all of a sudden,"" Stonesifer said.

During those years, under former President Joe Biden's administration, state and federal governments signed legislation like the federal Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 that provided tax credits and other incentives to clean energy projects.

""The 'One Big Beautiful Bill' put an end to some of those subsidies, so there's a lot of urgency to get this knocked out now,"" Stonesifer said.

Starting at the end of December, solar projects will have to be compliant with new requirements that will increase the cost of purchasing rates, Stonesifer said.

""We have this nice little window here where we can get a project that's going to save the district a lot of money over a long period of time,"" Stonesifer said.

Campbell reminded the board that, based on the length of the contract, it will most likely be passed along to a new group of board members and district administrators.

""We need to make sure that we understand that that's a serious thing to do,"" Campbell said.

""I think it's got to be done for financial reasons and environmental reasons,"" Board President Linda Wegner said.

Stonesifer said the next steps are for Solar One to purchase the equipment before the new rules kick in and complete final engineering and design plans.

As of now, the plan is for panels to be installed on the roof of DHS and Washington Elementary and in the field behind Jefferson Elementary and Reagan Middle School. Building is expected to start in late summer 2026, Stonesifer said.",https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,N,,2025-11-30 08:57:45.941813

To transport the equipment from shipping barges to the CEP construction site, crews will move the modules over River Road using a temporary heavy-haul bridge.
Temporary road closures are scheduled to begin in early December and last through February, when the temporary bridge is expected to be fully deconstructed.
Cornerstone Energy Park has grown into a multimillion-dollar industrial campus and is home to several companies that operate both independently and collaboratively.
And, with decades of history and major projects pointing to a cleaner, more resilient future, Cornerstone Energy Park remains a vital pillar of Jefferson Parish’s industrial landscape.","Cornerstone Chemical Company, LLC, a fixture of industry and community life in Waggaman for more than 70 years, is helping to usher in a new chapter of energy innovation and economic development in Jefferson Parish. Through continued modernization of the Cornerstone Energy Park (CEP) and major new investments from companies that share its commitment to safety, sustainability and long-term growth, the site is emerging as one of the Gulf Coast’s most important hubs for advanced manufacturing.

This transition will be especially visible in the coming months as UBE C1 Chemicals America (UCCA) begins the next phase of construction on a $500 million production facility inside CEP. The project will establish the first reliable U.S. supply of critical components used in energy storage systems — materials essential to building a more sustainable national energy future.

“This is an exciting time for Cornerstone Energy Park as we continue to forge partnerships focused on creating a sustainable future for the site,” said Jacques Byrd, Cornerstone Vice President of Site Development. “Please pardon our progress as we work to construct this vital facility and transition the Cornerstone Energy Park for a sustainable future.”

To construct the new facility efficiently and responsibly, UCCA is employing modular construction, a method increasingly used in advanced manufacturing projects around the world. In modular construction, equipment is built in smaller components off-site, transported by barge, and then assembled on location.

“Think of modular construction as putting together the pieces of a puzzle,” said UCCA President and CEO Tom Yura. “The pieces are built elsewhere, and the puzzle is assembled on-site. It’s a smarter way to build because it minimizes disruption to the community and reduces the duration of construction.”

These pre-built modules offer multiple advantages: improved efficiency and reduced construction time. To transport the equipment from shipping barges to the CEP construction site, crews will move the modules over River Road using a temporary heavy-haul bridge.

UCCA has selected Morimatsu, a contractor with more than 20 years of global experience moving modular components using hydraulic systems. “Morimatsu brings valuable knowledge and experience to assure project safety and efficiency,” Yura said.

As the modular equipment arrives and is transported onto the site, residents should expect intermittent road closures along River Road. Installation of the temporary bridge will be completed in early to mid-December. Shortly after, the modules will begin crossing the temporary bridge into CEP.

Temporary road closures are scheduled to begin in early December and last through February, when the temporary bridge is expected to be fully deconstructed. Until then, periodic road closures, typically lasting less than one hour, will occur outside of peak travel times.

“We are working with local authorities to help keep the community informed on River Road traffic conditions throughout the construction process,” said Ainslie Blanke, Cornerstone’s senior marketing and communications advisor. “Thank you for your patience as we make Jefferson Parish one of the country’s leaders in sustainable energy.”

Cornerstone and UCCA are coordinating with the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jefferson Parish Levee District and the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development to ensure all work is completed safely and efficiently.

Cornerstone Energy Park has grown into a multimillion-dollar industrial campus and is home to several companies that operate both independently and collaboratively. The shared focus aims to produce essential materials, support local jobs and prepare Louisiana’s petrochemical sector for a more sustainable future.

The UCCA facility represents the first U.S. production of its kind and deepens Jefferson Parish’s role as a location of choice for energy-forward projects. With sustainability top of mind, CEP and its site companies continue to upgrade technology and strengthen environmental stewardship.

“CEP is focused on transitioning the site for the future,” Byrd said. “The companies on our site share a commitment to safety, health and the environment. That unity is key to building long-term growth.”

As construction accelerates, the UCCA facility stands as both an industrial milestone and a signal of what’s to come: more green-energy jobs, enhanced manufacturing capacity and a stronger local economy built on innovation. And, with decades of history and major projects pointing to a cleaner, more resilient future, Cornerstone Energy Park remains a vital pillar of Jefferson Parish’s industrial landscape.

Now with shale technology, you go down it until you hit that layer and then you go horizontally.
The shale revolution at this point is about 20 years old.
So in the United States, unless you have signed it away, you own the mineral rights on your land.
And so Argentina already has the second most successful shale industry in the world.","Hey everybody, Peter Zeihan here. Coming to you from Colorado. Today we’re taking a question from our Patreon page, specifically from one of our friends down in Australia, wondering if it would be possible for Australia to recreate the sort of energy complex that the United States has, courtesy of the shale revolution. The United States is now just a gross over producer of both oil and natural gas.

It’s driven down energy costs in the country, especially electricity costs, which are now among the lowest in the world. And it’s generated a robust processing and manufacturing system with downstream work and a significant export industry, Australia having a smaller population, but almost as much land could they do it? I don’t want to say no, but there’s some things you have to keep in mind.

Number one, geology is just the first step. So in order to have a shale industry, you have to have a lot of sedimentary layers that are petroleum bearing that just the right age to generate oil, natural gas. And the United States has that because in the past, the North American continent, especially our part of it, has had a series of shallow seas.

And then geology would change, and then you’d get another shallow sea and you basically got these stacked layers so you can drill down and hit multiple petroleum producing zones. In fact, in some places in West Texas, you can have upwards of 20 layers that you can all access from one vertical. Now with shale technology, you go down it until you hit that layer and then you go horizontally.

And that brings us to the second thing. You need water. The way shale works is you make this suspension of water and sand, and that is pumped into the lateral through a series of holes that basically crack the, rock open and release the petroleum. And then back pressure pushes all the liquid out and eventually oil and natural gas comes to the surface.

Don’t have to pump the stuff, but you have to have the water to do it. And part of that folds into the third issue, which is proximity. You have to have relative proximity for your oil and natural gas production. Two population centers are places that can take the stuff for processing. And in this this the United States is pretty good.

We have shale zones in Texas, which of course can get pumped to corpus Christi in Houston. And the rest we’ve got some in Colorado which benefit the Denver area. We’ve got some in Ohio which can be pumped into the Northeast and Pennsylvania. Same thing. Australia’s problem is that most of the geology that looks promising is in the outback.

So not only is it a long ways away from any potential population centers, you’re in the middle of a literal desert, so the water access is more difficult. You can access groundwater that’s done in the United States, too. But all of these things incrementally raise the cost of development. Let’s see what else. Regulatory structure. This is one where a lot of countries, trip up shale wells, as a rule, generate somewhere from the hundreds of barrels to thousands of barrels a day, which sounds great, but it’s not like the mega wells you’re going to get a place like, say, Saudi Arabia.

So you’re going to have more of them and they’re more involved from a technical point of view for production. So you have to have a more advanced educational system to generate that sort of workforce. And the United States really does stand out among the world when it comes to petroleum engineers, because we’ve been doing it for so long.

The shale revolution at this point is about 20 years old. In the United States. Our first oil deposits were back in the mid 1800s. So this is something that we’ve been going and going and going. It’s not that the Australians don’t have that, but most of what the Australians have been doing for energy production in the last 30 years has been offshore, where they tap foreign labor almost as much as local labor.

So there’s there’s a labor crunch there. In addition, if you live in Houston, you can work in West Texas. If you live in Sydney or Brisbane, you’re probably not going to be working on the northwest shelf. It’s just too far. So linking these together, and then on the regulatory side, you have to be able to do things on the fly very, very quickly and have a regulatory structure.

That’s okay with that. So in Texas, the Texas Railroad Commission, which is the one that regulates the space issues, permits 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. They drill on Sundays, they drill on Christmas. And if you don’t have an institution set up to handle that, everything else gets pushed back. This is one of the reasons why the shale attempt in Poland just didn’t work out, because the poles tried to work European hours and it just didn’t fly.

The geology wasn’t as good either. But the most important thing, the single most important thing is landowners have to have an interest in the industry. So in the United States, unless you have signed it away, you own the mineral rights on your land. So if a petroleum company comes and wants to drill in your land, you get a chunk of the proceeds.

We’re the only country in the world that does it that way. So when the United Kingdom tried to kick in the shale that ten years ago, they discovered huge amounts of local opposition because the companies would take all of the money, and that would be that the locals had to deal with the noise and the traffic and all the rest, and they saw absolutely no benefit.

Australia is kind of in that camp. So if, if, if this is going to happen, it’s going to take a lot more money and put a lot of pressure on the labor force and require a regulatory and maybe even a legal overhaul of property rights in Australia in order to generate the sort of outcome that you might want to see.

There are three countries, however, that are worth keeping an eye on when it comes to shale that are closer than Australia to achieving something like the United States. The first, ironically, is Argentina. They already have preexisting infrastructure in a place called vacuum worth a dead cow fields which are very close to populated Argentina, including Buenos Aires. The socialist governments of the past set a price floor.

So anyone going to invest knows how much they’re going to get out. So even though the property law structures are weird and it’s Argentina. So if they’re very weird, if you know the rules of the game on the day that you start, you can get some projects going. And so Argentina already has the second most successful shale industry in the world.

The other two to watch are Mexico and Canada. both have a shale fields that in many ways are extensions of the American geography, especially northern Mexico. The weird thing about Canada in Mexico, though, is their closest population centers for most considerations around the American side of the border. So if we’re going to ever see a successful shale industry in those two countries, it will be because they’re accessing American infrastructure, population structure, processing infrastructure and basically linking into a greater North American energy grid.

Doesn’t mean it can’t happen, but if you’re in Ottawa or Mexico City developing a local energy sector to serve another country, let’s just call that a bit of a political complication.",https://zeihan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/oil-rona-header.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 01:58:25.108388

Not enough chargers have been built and the ones that do exist don’t work for all vehicles. Tesla has built the most substantial charging network and finally Stellantis has agreed to switch to the Tesla North American Charging System for some of its battery electric vehicles. That means starting in 2026, vehicles like the 2026 Dodge Charger Daytona and the 2026 Jeep Recon will be built with the NACS plugs. Jeep, Dodge and Chrysler have electrified vehicles that can be plugged in to charge. Ram is working on an extended range hybrid pickup.

The Tesla Plug Change Will be Phased in Gradually

Apparently, the adoption of the North American Charging System (NACS) for select Stellantis battery-electric vehicles will happen in phases. Starting in early 2026, in North America, existing BEVs, such as the Jeep Wagoneer S and Dodge Charger Daytona will be equipped to use the Tesla Supercharger network. Eventually the 2026 Jeep Recon and other future products will also be able to use the NACS network. There will be more details about adapter information for current Stellantis BEV models released in the future.

The change in charging plugs will start in North America in 2026. In 2027, vehicles in Japan and South Korea will be added to the NACS network. There are currently 28,000 Tesla superchargers in North America, Japan and South Korea.

Reluctance to Buy Electric Vehicles

Range anxiety and concerns about finding adequate charging facilities are two of the main reasons that people are reluctant to buy electric vehicles. All of the automakers have struggled with convincing customers that they will be able to charge vehicles quickly. Most complaints center around poor charging infrastructure, especially in rural or remote areas. Jeep has financed installing chargers at trailheads but still the outlets are few and far between. Often, when drivers do find charging facilities, they have been vandalized.

The collaboration between Stellantis and Tesla will certainly boost customer confidence in public charging. By unlocking broader access to charging infrastructure, Stellantis gives customers more choice, more coverage and more control over how, where and when they power their EVs.

Since 1982, the Department has disbursed over $402 billion in mineral leasing revenues.","The Department of the Interior’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue announced the disbursement of $14.61 billion in revenues generated in fiscal year 2025 from energy production on federal and tribal onshore lands, and federal offshore areas.

New Mexico received the most of any state with more than $2.7 billion in payments.

The disbursements support a wide range of initiatives, including public infrastructure, education, emergency services, conservation and reclamation projects, and historic preservation. This year’s total represents the fifth-largest disbursement since 1982.

The Donald J. Trump administration has focused on combating inflation and reducing energy costs. These lower prices have helped keep more money in the pockets of American consumers while still providing critical funding to states, tribes and federal programs through ONRR’s disbursements. This year’s disbursements decreased from the previous year largely due to the drop in commodity prices.

ONRR’s disbursements were aided by the Trump administration’s priorities under Executive Order 14154, Unleashing American Energy, which directs federal agencies to remove regulatory barriers and encourage responsible energy development on public lands. Additionally, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which reduced the cost of doing business on public lands, making oil and gas development more economically attractive to industry, spurred domestic energy production while lowering commodity prices.

Fiscal year 2025 Disbursement Highlights:

$5.01 billion to the U.S. Treasury

$4.07 billion to 34 states

$2.98 billion to the Reclamation Fund

$1.05 billion to the Land and Water Conservation Fund

$1.00 billion to Tribes and individual Indian mineral owners

$350 million to federal agencies

$150 million to the Historic Preservation Fund

The $4.07 billion in state disbursements reflects revenue from mineral and energy production on federal lands within the states’ borders and offshore tracts in federal waters adjacent to states’ shores.

The states receiving the highest disbursements based on those activities are:

New Mexico

$2.76 billion

Wyoming

$544.87 million

Louisiana

$162.42 million

North Dakota

$114.95 million

Texas

$99.83 million

Colorado

$90.77 million

Utah

$81.72 million

Mississippi

$52.34 million

Alabama

$51.73 million

California

$39.12 million

Alaska

$27.33 million

Montana

$27.02 million

The revenue disbursed to 33 federally recognized tribes and approximately 31,000 individual Indian mineral owners represent 100% of the revenues received for energy and mineral production activities on Indian lands. Tribes use these revenues to develop infrastructure, provide health care and education, and support other critical community development programs, such as senior centers, public safety projects and youth initiatives.

Since 1982, the Department has disbursed over $402 billion in mineral leasing revenues. ONRR is responsible for the collection, accounting for, analysis, audit and disbursement of these revenues and makes most of these disbursements monthly from the royalties, rents, and bonuses it collects from energy and mineral companies operating on federal lands and waters.",,N,,2025-11-29 23:59:17.316872

Prices have strengthened, and shares of Alcoa and Century Aluminum have rebounded after last spring’s tariff shock.
Domestic production slips into survival mode This shift has left the United States with only four active smelting operations.
Century Aluminum has secured a multi-year power deal in South Carolina to keep one of its plants viable through 2031.
Industry leaders warn that without government action, the United States will struggle to rebuild a capability many now consider strategically important.","The United States should be living through a renaissance in aluminium. Data centers, electric vehicles and the wider clean-energy buildout are pulling unprecedented volumes of the metal into server racks, cooling systems, power grids and vehicle frames. Prices have strengthened, and shares of Alcoa and Century Aluminum have rebounded after last spring’s tariff shock. Yet the companies behind the country’s remaining smelters say the boom is slipping away from them just as demand surges.

The problem is electricity. Turning alumina into metal requires vast, steady power — roughly 14 megawatt-hours for every tonne of aluminium. A single modern smelter draws as much energy as a mid-sized American city. For decades, the economics worked only when smelters locked in long-term power at around USD 30 to USD 40 per megawatt-hour. That equation has collapsed. The explosion of AI infrastructure has tech giants paying more than USD 100 per megawatt-hour to secure guaranteed supply, far beyond what metal producers can absorb. Industry executives admit they simply cannot match Big Tech’s bidding power.

Domestic production slips into survival mode

This shift has left the United States with only four active smelting operations. Output last year barely reached 670,000 tonnes — less than one percent of global production — and nowhere near enough to meet domestic needs. The country now relies heavily on Canadian imports, while China and Indonesia expand aggressively with cheaper energy and looser constraints. No new US smelter has been built in nearly half a century, and the sector’s decline has become structural.

Demand outpaces the country’s ability to supply

Ironically, the long-term fundamentals look stronger than ever. Automakers are substituting aluminium for steel as they electrify their fleets. Renewable power developers need the metal for turbines, solar frames and transmission hardware. And data center construction is rising so quickly that Bank of America expects US power demand to grow five to ten times faster over the coming decade. Yet Goldman Sachs forecasts that the wave of new global supply will push prices lower through 2026, compressing margins for the producers that remain.

Smelters search for lifelines

In this environment, companies are scrambling for stability. Century Aluminum has secured a multi-year power deal in South Carolina to keep one of its plants viable through 2031. Emirates Global Aluminium has announced plans for a new smelter in Oklahoma — an extraordinary move that would nearly double current US capacity if it proceeds. Alcoa, meanwhile, has hinted that selling assets directly to technology firms might make more economic sense than running power-hungry metal operations that no longer pencil out.

Industry leaders warn that without government action, the United States will struggle to rebuild a capability many now consider strategically important. The Aluminum Association estimates that reviving domestic smelting would require at least five large facilities, billions in capital and years of construction. Washington has already moved on tariffs, but producers argue that the deeper challenge lies in the power market, where the surge in AI-driven demand is leaving traditional industries priced out.

The result is a paradox: a country experiencing its highest aluminium demand in modern history, yet unable to supply the metal that underpins the technologies it wants to lead. As AI expands and electricity grows scarce, America’s aluminium sector finds itself fighting for relevance in the very boom that should have secured its future.",http://www.alcircle.com/api/media/1764380591.26506_AI_0_0.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 10:03:03.222413

The end of cancer? These like cancer and Alzheimer's.

MPLX Investment Narrative Recap

MPLX shareholders must believe in the enduring demand for U.S. energy infrastructure and the company's ability to capitalize on export growth from key regions like Houston and the Permian Basin. The recent partnership with Oneok to develop a US$1.75 billion Texas City export terminal expands MPLX’s export capacity, but does not meaningfully reduce near-term risks tied to market or regulatory headwinds that can impact return on new investments.

Among recent announcements, the 12.5% increase in MPLX’s quarterly dividend stands out. A strengthened distribution underscores management’s confidence in cash flow durability, an important point, given the sizable capital commitments like the new Houston project that will test MPLX’s ability to deliver long-term returns and sustain payout growth.

In contrast, investors should also keep a close eye on how expanding capital expenditures might magnify balance sheet and refinancing risks if...

MPLX's narrative projects $14.0 billion in revenue and $5.3 billion in earnings by 2028. This requires 6.8% yearly revenue growth and a $1.0 billion increase in earnings from the current $4.3 billion.

Recently, Targa Resources, a market leader of midstream services in the United States, outlined its plans to develop a 500-mile “Speedway” NGL pipeline that will link the Permian to Mont Belvieu, Texas. The company has been contemplating measures to increase its foothold in the Permian and now has plans to construct the astonishingly long NGL pipeline, along with several other projects.

The 500-mile Natural Gas Liquids pipeline exemplifies the company’s ambitions for the US market

Targa Resources has become one of the largest independent infrastructure companies in North America and boasts a diversified portfolio of significant domestic infrastructure assets that have positioned the United States as the world’s go-to destination for gas supply.

The reality of the impact of sanctions on Russian energy has led the US to become the top destination for the world’s gas and NGL buyers, all frantically searching for a non-Russian energy supplier. The new “cold war” of energy resources between the US and Russia has led many nations that formerly did business with Moscow to enter into purchasing agreements with the US to buy their substantial gas supply.

Targa Resources’ Speedway NGL Pipeline will become the backbone of the US gas sector

The company has noted that the plan is to construct a 30-inch pipeline and associated infrastructure with a start-up capacity of 500,000 barrels per day, which could be doubled to 1 million barrels per day if needed. The expected price tag to build the Speedway NGL Pipeline is hovering around $1.6 billion and is expected to begin service in the third quarter of 2027.

The Speedway NGL pipeline is not the only project being planned by Targa Resources

The firm has confirmed its plan to construct the Yeti processing plant, which will boast a 275 million cubic feet per day capacity that will serve the firm’s growth on the Permian Delaware system. Targa is currently constructing five gas processing plants that will come online over the next by 2027, and has outlined plans to build an additional 35-mile natural gas pipeline that will enhance the company’s connectivity to the Permian operations.

Furthermore, Targa is planning a 55-mile conversion of an existing pipeline into natural gas service, targeting the expansion of its extensive energy infrastructure to accommodate an expected increase in gas demand around the United States and the world. However, some industry analysts have cautioned that the new pipeline could result in substantial spare capacity out of the Permian Basin.

“If Targa sustains the approximate 140,000-barrel-per-day annual NGL growth it achieved during the Grand Prix-Daytona buildout, Speedway’s initial 500,000-barrel-per-day capacity could be filled within about two years after startup. Speedway provides much-needed headroom, though Targa must carefully coordinate fractionation and LPG export expansions to avoid system bottlenecks.” – Julian Renton and Jaxson Fryer of East Daley Analytics

As several energy-rich nations outline their plans to invest heavily in the midstream sector over the coming years, Targa is betting on its vast Permian infrastructure to lead the US into a new era.

The first is the Nain Wind Microgrid Project, the over $22m in federal funding for which will support installation of two 1.5 kW wind turbines and battery storage. The result: 1.6 million litres or 63 percent less annual diesel consumption in the region.

“I think is just an incredible win for the community, for the environment, for Canada,” said Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations Rebecca Alty told The Telegram.

An unspecified region near Rigolet is host to the second: the Rigolet Tidal Project, which nearing the end of the assessment phase. Federal funding here totals $225,000 and will support data collection in order to inform possible tidal energy facility locations.

The Makkovik Arena Solar Project is the last of the three. Details on it are scarce, but like the others, it is Indigenous-led. $424,000 by way of the federal Northern REACHE program has been allotted to support it as well as the installation of 80 kW of solar to Nunatsiavut Community Centres in Nain, Rigolet, Postville, and Hopedale.

,EVs,2025-11-30 00:04:57+00:00,SlashGear,"Tesla Isn't Alone, Most Electric Cars Lose Value Faster Than You Might Think - SlashGear",Charlie Berrey,,,,,https://www.slashgear.com/2036940/electric-cars-like-tesla-losing-value-faster-why/,"Electric cars are nothing new.
So, while the data suggests electric cars depreciate at a faster rate, it's important to explore other avenues to verify the claim.
This steep drop-off in value was seen clear as day recently when a 2021 Tesla Model Y Long Range sold for less than half of its original MSRP, despite being fairly well presented.
While Tesla models do not feature on the list, among the worst performers are models like the Nissan Leaf, Wrangler 4xe, Volkswagen ID.4, Subaru Solterra, and Toyota bZ4x.
There are many reasons why Tesla models might drop value quickly, from over saturation in the market to the CEO's controversial political viewpoints, but the truth is the same results can be seen across the entire EV market.","Electric cars are nothing new. Not even in the sense that, yes technically, electric vehicles have been around for over a century, but even in the mainstream automotive world, EVs have been regular sights on the road now for over a decade. The infrastructure has come on leaps and bounds: they can be charged in minutes, battery packs don't degrade as badly as the naysayers feared they would, and they are even getting more affordable to buy, too.

However, for some reason, they still depreciate far quicker than their gas-powered counterparts. EVs are fairly attractive as a new buy for many of us, but secondhand models are just not that desirable, it would seem. According to Thunder Said Energy, while ICE cars tend to depreciate on average by $0.11 per mile covered, EVs come in at $0.27 per mile, demonstrating just how wide the gulf is. There are variables that could affect the value of this data, for example, over the past few years, many EVs will have been purchased with a $7,500 reduction, courtesy of the now-canceled federal tax credits. This, effectively, immediately places $7,500 worth of depreciation onto qualifying vehicles, as surely no one would pay more for a used model.

This needs to be taken into account when looking at electric vs. gas in terms of depreciation; it's important to compare the actual price paid, and not just the MSRP listed prior to incentives. With that being said, we can't rely solely on depreciation reports, as it's unclear whether or not the effective $7,500 reduction has been factored into the calculations. So, while the data suggests electric cars depreciate at a faster rate, it's important to explore other avenues to verify the claim.

It's true that Tesla resale values aren't what they used to be. This might be down to their huge popularity; a large supply on the used market might be outpacing demand. Other factors are always at play too, such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk's political controversies, and how the brand fares in relation to new competition, such as Rivian and Lucid. This steep drop-off in value was seen clear as day recently when a 2021 Tesla Model Y Long Range sold for less than half of its original MSRP, despite being fairly well presented.

Back in 2021, the Tesla cost its owner $54,190, and came in a smart specification, with a smart Satin Dark Gray wrap, 20-inch Induction wheels, and a black leather interior. If we factor in a $7,500 reduction, courtesy of the federal tax credits, that gives us a revised purchase price of $46,690. However, this attractive spec and reasonable odometer reading of just 48,500 miles did little to excite buyers when it came up for auction, with the hammer falling at a miserable $24,888. CarEdge's depreciation calculator suggests this is quite typical of the model, suggesting that a Model Y will drop 57% of its value after four years on the road and 48,000 miles. Judging by this estimate, the auction seller actually did quite well, losing roughly 47% of the original purchase price, taking into account a likely $7,500 reduction on the MSRP when new.

In addition, CarEdge has ranked 185 cars according to how well, or how poorly, they retain value. While Tesla models do not feature on the list, among the worst performers are models like the Nissan Leaf, Wrangler 4xe, Volkswagen ID.4, Subaru Solterra, and Toyota bZ4x.

The Wrangler 4xe — one of which we test drove in 2024 — is an interesting model to highlight, as of course, there is a near-identical gas-powered model with which we can compare in terms of depreciation. Once again relying on data sourced from CarEdge, we see that the gas-powered Wrangler typically can be expected to shed 29% of its value in the first five years of ownership. This is based upon a new price of $48,226 and 13,500 miles being covered each year, and it translates to a total loss of $14,116.

By way of comparison, the Wrangler 4xe is projected to drop a staggering 59% of its value over those same years and miles. The starting price given by CarEdge is higher, at $61,887, to reflect the model's real-world higher starting price. As such, the amount lost is also considerably more, at $36,235. Even if we strip the qualified amount of EV tax credits from that figure, and factor in cheaper running and maintenance costs, the traditionally motivated Wrangler still looks to be the financially safer bet after five years on the road.

Similar comparisons can be made elsewhere, and comparing Toyota's bZ4X and RAV4 brings similar results, as does pitting Subaru's Crosstrek against the Solterra. There are many reasons why Tesla models might drop value quickly, from over saturation in the market to the CEO's controversial political viewpoints, but the truth is the same results can be seen across the entire EV market.",https://www.slashgear.com/img/gallery/tesla-isnt-alone-most-electric-cars-lose-value-faster-than-you-might-think/l-intro-1764154569.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 19:58:11.882443

The statement covered headline issues such as support for electric vehicles, changes to motoring taxation and fresh commitments on energy security and efficiency.
For many on the left, the sustainability content will likely feel underpowered, especially given the scale of the climate challenge.
""One of the greatest drivers of the rising cost of living is the cost of energy prices,"" Reeves told the Commons.
""The cause of high energy bills must be tackled at source and so we are investing in energy security in nuclear and renewable energy, and in insulation through our Warm Homes Plan.""","The UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves has set out the Labour government’s second Autumn Budget since taking office in 2024, outlining how the UK intends to tax and spend in 2026 and the years that follow.

The statement covered headline issues such as support for electric vehicles, changes to motoring taxation and fresh commitments on energy security and efficiency.

The fiscal package had been trailed as a pivotal moment for Reeves and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, with the administration seeing pressure from both the Greens and Reform as discontent grows across the political spectrum.

With this backdrop, the Chancellor opted for a relatively cautious stance, keeping income tax and national insurance rates unchanged in a bid to avoid provoking either left or right.

“I’ve made my choices: not reckless borrowing, not dangerous cuts, but stability for our economy, security for our public finances and security for family finances too,” she said. “Those are the Labour choices.”

Overall, the Budget contained fewer big-ticket spending pledges than some recent predecessors, though there were notable signals on how the UK will support renewable power, EV charging and energy-efficiency schemes over the next five years.

For many on the left, the sustainability content will likely feel underpowered, especially given the scale of the climate challenge. Reeves also used her speech to caution against what she characterised as overreach in pursuit of net-zero, taking aim at the Green Party in the process.

“The leader of the Green Party is a keen hypnotherapist and he believes he can achieve remarkable things using only the power of his mind,” Reeves said.

“Unfortunately, the only things getting bigger under his approach would be the deficit and the rate of inflation.”

A new pay-per-mile tax for EV drivers

One of the most eye-catching measures for the energy and transport sectors is a new mileage-based levy on battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, designed to narrow the gap with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs).

Under the plans, the Electric Vehicle Excise Duty will charge EV owners per mile driven, rather than relying solely on conventional vehicle excise duty bands.

""Because all cars contribute to the wear and tear on our roads,” she said, “I will ensure that drivers are taxed according to how much they drive and not just by the type of car they own by introducing the EV Excise Duty on electric cars.”

The charge is expected to be set at around £0.03 per mile for fully electric models and £0.015 per mile for plug-in hybrids, starting in April 2028 and projected to generate about US$1.8bn by the 2029-2030 fiscal year.

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has indicated that this will offset roughly a quarter of the 0.6% of GDP that would otherwise be lost from declining fuel duty receipts as the fleet electrifies.

While still only around half of the effective rate faced by petrol and diesel drivers, the move has already prompted debate over its impact on the EV transition.

“Today’s announcement is a clear signal that the UK is serious about an all-electric future,” says Mark Caskey, MD of Projects at Mitie.

“However, introducing a pay-per-mile charge for EVs, on top of existing road taxes, sends a mixed message. Businesses need certainty to invest in cleaner fleets, not policies that could stall momentum and threaten jobs in UK manufacturing.”

Britain's nuclear future

On the power system, the Budget confirms temporary funding for the renewables obligation mechanism, with spending of US$3.8bn pencilled in for the coming year and an average outlay of US$2.6bn in both 2027-28 and 2028-29.

This support is due to be wound down and removed entirely by 2029-30, signalling an eventual transition away from this particular subsidy regime.

""One of the greatest drivers of the rising cost of living is the cost of energy prices,"" Reeves told the Commons.

""The cause of high energy bills must be tackled at source and so we are investing in energy security in nuclear and renewable energy, and in insulation through our Warm Homes Plan.""

As part of this, Reeves highlighted plans to team up with Rolls-Royce to build three small modular reactors in Wales at the Wylfa site, a move intended to anchor a new generation of nuclear capacity in the UK.

The Warm Homes Plan will channel funding towards lower-income households, helping them upgrade insulation and low-carbon heating, including through an expanded Boiler Upgrade Scheme and streamlined planning rules for heat pump installations.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/b58015f2c9a8b69086119c3e93ff0dad:acbb713b6edbadb634167b08996a56b7/rachel-reeves-the-uk-s-chancellor-of-the-exchequer-today-revealed-the-government-s-budget.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 23:59:08.113830

There must have been some mistake. A wrecking crew showed up almost without notice, rumbling in the direction of the East Wing. I hope no one was inside when, unannounced, the crane stood astride the structure and embarked on its demolition directive.

It must have come as a surprise, even to the White House staff, since President Trump had assured everyone that the East Wing would be spared in his plan for the 90,000-square-foot ballroom he envisioned.

As with so many other assurances from him, Trump ignored his promise, and authorized the complete destruction of the east facade of the People’s House. The garish, gold-plated

monument that will replace the east entryway often used by guests and access to the headquarters of our first ladies aligns perfectly with the tasteless, gold-festooned Oval Office, reminiscent of tsarist vulgarity.

What the construction blueprint ought to have envisioned was an urgently needed upgrade to the septic system that serves the presidential suite. Remember the time the current occupant touted his agenda to “drain the swamp.” Instead, he has created a cesspool of corruption that dwarfs the misdeeds of any prior occupant.

The public reaction to the odor demands a thorough sanitizing to rid the residence of the stench.

Here is what a filter of the detritus would encounter:

Acceptance of a $400 million (before retrofitting) jetliner from a foreign government that will land at the Trump library, such as it will be.

A pardon for the world’s best known and wealthiest crypto felon, whose business

dealings with the Trump boys will surely flourish.

A crypto business deal with the UAE worth $2 billion, which will benefit the boys,

the son-in-law and the pal, Steve Witkoff.

This doesn’t even account for the coins, Bibles, guitars, boots and, yes, even the Constitution, merch that could clog any heavy-duty filter.

All of this can be cataloged as unprecedented greed by an American president. It mirrors the behavior of Trump’s role model, Vladimir Putin: using power to line the pockets of family and oligarchs, in return for unconditional loyalty.

If this denigration of the office of president were the only waste to be encountered by a

White House septic system, it would overwhelm it. But, there is so much more.

Let’s recall Trump’s 2023 Rose Garden promise to be “the most transparent president ever.” The utter hypocrisy of that assurance is evident in his refusal to release visitor logs and tax returns (are they still under audit?), his restricting media access to those friendly to his administration and perhaps most tellingly, to his pressuring anyone he can not to release the Epstein files.

Why would he not support transparency, unless there was something to hide? Those emails released by the House Oversight Committee confirm, at the very least, a close relationship between these men, which, given Epstein’s nefarious activities, carries its own odor. The stench is so palpable that even MAGA supporters want to know the source.

That we are even seeking to determine if our president was aware of the sex trafficking operation of a person with whom he spent considerable time so demeans our country that it will take a long time to recover. To witness the complicity of Republican lawmakers attempting to suppress the information concealed in FBI and DOJ files only adds to the sordid story unfolding before our eyes.

As some defectors for whom the White House conduct is too revolting come out of their closet, we can only hope that some measure of accountability will result. It’s a long shot if we think about how successful Trump has been in intimidating his party’s senators.

And, even if they were to display uncommon bravery and vote to release the Epstein files, rest assured a veto awaits, relying, in all likelihood, on the claim that an ongoing investigation (which Trump initiated against Democratic notables using his law firm, the DOJ) prevents the release.

The sleaze is unending.

However, due to a multitude of challenges standing in the way of a complete overhaul, U.S. energy infrastructure remains highly unprepared for severe weather events.
Now, another threat is adding to fears of winter blackouts – data centres.
During a severe winter storm, Texas’ power demand could rise to as much as 85.3 GW.
This demonstrates just how dramatically the tech sector is changing the landscape of power demand through data centre development.","The energy infrastructure in the United States has failed repeatedly in instances of severe weather, due to years of underinvestment and the failure of utilities to work together to strengthen larger networks. During winter storms and wildfires, a wide range of energy infrastructure has been known to fail due to the lack of preparedness by utilities and state governments. Going into the winter months, there are fears over more potential network failures across various parts of the U.S.

Texas, California, and several other states face annual power outages due to severe weather events, from winter storms to heatwaves. In February 2021, Storm Uri brought plunging temperatures to the state of Texas and left millions of people without electricity, heat, or running water, as much of the infrastructure froze. These outages turned off electricity in various parts of Texas, including parts of the natural gas network that are electrically operated, such as pumps and antifreeze injection systems. This led to the shutdown of several power plants.

During the storm, as demand increased for heating, Texas grid operator ERCOT ordered 20 GW of rolling blackouts to prevent a total system collapse, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). It was the “largest manually controlled load shedding event in U.S. history,” with 4.5 million people losing power for several days, stated a FERC report.

The U.S. energy network is highly fragmented, with different state governments each managing parts of the grid, and a multitude of utilities responsible for different infrastructure. The fractured nature of the system makes it extremely hard to fix. For example, investment made in the transmission lines of one state may not be replicated by the neighbouring state, meaning that the network in part of a region may be more resilient than another.

In 2021, the Biden administration introduced the $2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, aimed at upgrading U.S. infrastructure. The plan earmarked $100 billion in financing to update and modernise the electric grid to make it more reliable and resilient. However, due to a multitude of challenges standing in the way of a complete overhaul, U.S. energy infrastructure remains highly unprepared for severe weather events.

Now, another threat is adding to fears of winter blackouts – data centres. There has been a rapid rollout of data centres across the U.S. in recent years, as tech companies invest heavily in the infrastructure needed to power advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence. This has driven up energy demand in several states, particularly in Texas. The concern now is that this will increase the risk of energy shortages, which could result in power cuts during freezing temperatures.

Requests for new data centres are on the rise in Texas, thanks to its growing renewable energy capacity and natural gas resources. In recent years, Houston has become known by many as the Silicon Valley of energy, for its strong reputation for energy production, growing cleantech sector, and welcoming business environment. This has helped attract significant investment to the state from tech companies looking to expand operations.

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) warned in November that the 24/7 energy demand of data centres will make it increasingly difficult to maintain sufficient electricity supply during times of high demand, such as if the temperature drops to an extreme low.

During a severe winter storm, Texas’ power demand could rise to as much as 85.3 GW. While the state’s 92.6 GW electricity capacity would normally be enough to power this demand, the available power could decrease to roughly 69.7 GW during a severe weather event, meaning a deficit of over 15 GW.

In a recent analysis, NERC stated, “Strong load growth from new data centres and other large industrial end users is driving higher winter electricity demand forecasts and contributing to continued risk of supply shortfalls.” It went on to say that while Texas will experience elevated risk during extreme winter weather, but the grid will remain stable during normal peak demand.

Over 120 GW of projects have requested to be connected to the Texas grid, marking a 170 percent increase since January requests. Approximately 73 percent of these projects are data centres, according to ERCOT. If all these data centres are built, it would equate to the average annual power consumption of almost 154 million homes. However, experts believe that it is unlikely for the massive project pipeline to be developed in its entirety, as there is simply not enough power to serve it.

Years of underinvestment in the U.S. grid, a lack of preparedness from utilities, and the rise in demand for data centres could lead to a power deficit if Texas, or another state, is hit by severe weather this winter. This demonstrates just how dramatically the tech sector is changing the landscape of power demand through data centre development. It also implies the need for stronger regulations to ensure that the electricity supply is sufficient and stable enough to meet demand before approving new projects.

But a new analysis from the Pew Research Center shows that behind the innovation is a massive, and growing, strain on the country’s energy and water systems. And for everyday Americans, that could mean higher bills and new long-term environmental challenges.

AI’s Power Appetite Is Exploding

Pew’s review of federal and international data shows U.S. data centers used 183 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2024, about 4% of all electricity used nationwide, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). That’s roughly equal to the entire annual electricity use of Pakistan.

The biggest driver? Hyperscale facilities built specifically for AI models.

According to Pew and the IEA, a typical AI-optimized hyperscale center uses as much electricity as 100,000 homes a year. Newer mega-facilities could use 20 times more once they go online.

In major hubs, especially Northern Virginia, clusters of these centers now consume more than a quarter of the state’s total electricity supply, the Electric Power Research Institute reports.

The Ripple Effect: Rising Bills and Stressed Grids

The higher the power demand, the more utilities must upgrade the grid, and those costs don’t disappear.

In the PJM electricity market (Illinois to North Carolina), data center growth added $9.3 billion in capacity costs for 2025–26, per Pew’s analysis of PJM data. The result:

+ $18/month in western Maryland

+ $16/month in Ohio homes

Looking ahead, Carnegie Mellon University estimates U.S. electricity bills could rise 8% by 2030 just from data centers and crypto mining alone, with even steeper hikes in the most data-center-dense regions.

Water Use: The Quiet Problem No One Is Ready For

Electricity isn’t the only resource being pushed to the limit.

Pew cites federal figures showing U.S. data centers used 17 billion gallons of water in 2023, mostly to cool energy-intensive AI chips at hyperscale sites. And by 2028, hyperscale centers alone could be consuming 16 to 33 billion gallons annually — roughly the yearly use of a mid-sized U.S. city. Cooling demands vary by season and by facility design, but researchers say the overall trend is clear: AI growth means water demand is climbing fast.

Americans Are Unsure What to Make of AI’s Environmental Impact

Pew’s August 2024 survey suggests the public hasn’t formed a consensus:

25% believe AI will harm the environment

20% believe it will help

25% think it’ll be a mix

30% aren’t sure

Yet in recent months, we’ve watched two long-standing local restaurants — The Lawrenceville Drive-In, a fixture in our community for decades, and Hardee’s — close their doors. These losses should be a wake-up call for all of us.

The truth is simple: when we choose to shop or eat across the river instead of right here at home, our local businesses struggle to survive. Dollars spent in Vincennes support their economy, their workers, and their tax base — not ours. Meanwhile, our own businesses, owned and staffed by our neighbors, face an uphill battle just to keep the doors open. If more of our daily spending had stayed local, it’s entirely possible these two restaurants could still be open today.

Supporting local businesses isn’t just sentimental — it’s smart economic strategy. Money spent in Lawrenceville circulates within Lawrenceville. It helps pay local employees, fund local services, and build the foundation needed to attract new businesses and restaurants. When potential investors see a community that actively supports its businesses, they’re more likely to bring new opportunities here.

But the business climate isn’t only shaped by shopping habits. Serious environmental violations — like the ones recently committed by our wastewater treatment plant — also have a direct impact on economic growth. Companies considering Lawrenceville look closely at infrastructure, regulatory compliance, and environmental safety. When our WWTP exceeds permitted discharge limits and risks polluting our river, it doesn’t just harm wildlife — it signals to prospective businesses that our city may not be prepared to support long-term, sustainable development. No business wants to invest in a community facing ongoing environmental compliance issues.

City leadership must take this seriously. Along with simplifying processes and improving communication, we need consistent accountability and transparent operation of essential services. A healthy business environment starts with responsible management of the city’s core infrastructure.

A thriving local economy doesn’t happen by accident. It happens when a community decides that supporting its own — and maintaining the standards that attract new investment — is a priority. Lawrenceville deserves that level of commitment from its leaders and its citizens.

The federal Solar for All program that funded his nonprofit, Indigenized Energy, was terminated in August as part of the Trump administration’s broader pullback from renewable energy. Indigenized Energy won’t be reimbursed. The workers he trained are now looking for positions that no longer exist.

It’s the kind of whiplash I keep hearing about from tribal energy leaders across Indian Country. Federal funding for tribal energy surged under the Biden administration, then vanished under the Trump administration — and tribes that built plans around that money are scrambling to find alternatives.

The scale of what’s been cut is staggering. The Environmental Protection Agency has frozen or outright terminated the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund in its entirety, $2 billion of which was aimed squarely at Indian Country. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act laid out a quick sunsetting of game-changing tax credits that will now prove difficult for many tribes to access. In October, the Department of Energy terminated $8 billion in energy projects across the country, including multiple projects tied directly to or closely benefitting tribal nations.

Native energy advocates worried what that policy shift might mean, but expressed optimism that the most important pieces of Biden-era policy would remain in place. They didn’t. As a Republican-led Congress signed onto Trump’s policies mostly wholesale, funding evaporated even faster than expected, kneecapping clean energy’s momentum.

In my reporting, I’ve heard a lot of tribal energy experts say basically the same thing: If Washington won't fund it, Indian Country will find another way.

“The Big Beautiful Bill really took the wind out of our sails in terms of rewriting the energy narrative,” Clara Pratte, executive director and co-founder of energy developer Navajo Power, said during a recent webinar hosted by Clean Energy for America. “Now, as practitioners, one of the things we’re beholden to is figuring out where we find that capital, where we continue the good work.”

Pratte’s answer was specific: “We’re looking at private capital, philanthropy and tribal-to-tribal partnerships,” she said. “If federal dollars aren’t reliable, then we have to make sure our projects are bankable in other ways. That’s how we keep moving.”

Claudio Clini, a policy analyst with energy advocacy nonprofit Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy, said his organization planned to “demystify” Indian Country for potential investors, working to clarify sovereignty and land law, and to close culture gaps.

“If they understand sovereignty and history, they’ll be more comfortable bringing capital into Indian Country,” Clini said.

In the meantime, Two-Bears said, tribes should plan to turn toward banks and private financing to keep projects afloat where nonprofit or foundational dollars can’t quite reach.

“Tribes need to demonstrate that we can build projects that can be repaid. We’ve got to make these attractive to banks and other people that loan the money,” Two-Bears said. “We have to show that we can take those loans and pay those loans back, then keep these projects alive.”

It's a familiar pattern. In my reporting on tribal broadband and workforce development, I've seen tribes building internal capacity specifically to reduce dependence on federal dollars — control what you can, because Washington's priorities change every election.

Where federal funding has failed, the plan for those working in Indian Country energy is to step in and knit together what projects they can, however they can.

The team of volunteers are a full house for the chamber of commerce.” Chamber dinners are about celebrating successes and recognizing individuals and organizations for the work they do in the community.
“Former Wellsburg chamber President Dan Otto even passed along a new set of scissors to commemorate our first ribbon-cutting as a chamber of commerce,” he said.
Emily Byers, president of the Jefferson County Chamber of Commerce, and Brenda Mull, president of the Weirton Area Chamber of Commerce, both were at the dinner.
“You should be proud of your chamber of commerce,” Fithyan added.","Running a chamber of commerce is never an easy assignment, and it can get even more complicated when the organization has been built through the merger of two longtime groups.

When you consider the accomplishments of the Brooke County Area Chamber of Commerce, however, you have to say that the organization has gotten off to a pretty good start.

“This evening, we are all seated at the same table — a table of opportunity connection and growth,” said Sandy Kemp. “It’s wonderful to see so many familiar faces, and so many new ones at our table tonight.”

Kemp, the director of the Brooke County Senior Center, was speaking as the first vice president of the Brooke chamber, and her words were delivered Nov. 12 as part of the opening remarks at the organization’s recognition dinner. She stressed that the chamber’s core was strengthening business connections and bringing people together.

“This past year, the merger of the Wellsburg and Follansbee chambers has been a winning combination,” Kemp said to the 200-or-so who attended the dinner at the St. Francis Center in Follansbee.

Her words were in keeping with the theme of the evening: Place Your Bets on Success: Bet on the Chamber. They also helped to guide President Eric Fithyan.

“Tonight, we celebrate our first year as a merged chamber,” Fithyan explained. “I think it’s safe to say that we’ve hit the jackpot. The team of volunteers are a full house for the chamber of commerce.”

Chamber dinners are about celebrating successes and recognizing individuals and organizations for the work they do in the community. This year’s honorees — A Child’s Place C.A.S.A., the nonprofit organization of the year; Suzanne Davidson, the recipient of the lifetime achievement award; Tony Viola, the young professional of the year; Two Antique Geeks, the business of the year; and Samantha Walters, the citizen of the year — certainly fell into that category.

But, as Fihyan said, the biggest milestone of the year was the merger of the Wellsburg and Follansbee chambers that created the new group.

“What started as months of conversations between two organizations become a reality this year,” he said. “Both groups placed trust in me to serve as president for two years to help guide the transition into a unified chamber of commerce.”

That transition did not come without challenges.

“As with many changes, some members of our board of directors retired, and others decided that the decision was not for them,” Fithyan added. “But those who stayed came together with dedication and a vision, joined by many members. We came together to create something stronger, something better — a vibrant, united organization.”

Fithyan said a rotating board structure will hope to ensure that the organization always has fresh board members who will bring new perspectives and fresh ideas.

While the organization is moving forward, Fithyan said, it’s important that it does not lose touch with the past.

“Former Wellsburg chamber President Dan Otto even passed along a new set of scissors to commemorate our first ribbon-cutting as a chamber of commerce,” he said.

Those scissors have handles that are orange and blue.

“Our colors tell our story — the orange represents Wellsburg High School and the Orange Knights, and the blue is for the Follansbee Blue Wave. We’re deep in history, but we’re still one chamber of commerce,” Fithyan said.

“They represent who we are now, a new organization built on rich traditions as we share one motto of working together.”

Fithyan added that the chamber ribbon-cuttings during the past year had welcomed six new businesses to the area.

Collaboration, he explained, is important to everything the chamber does. That includes partnering with the other chambers of commerce in our region. Emily Byers, president of the Jefferson County Chamber of Commerce, and Brenda Mull, president of the Weirton Area Chamber of Commerce, both were at the dinner.

It also includes working with volunteers at community events, from helping at the Mountaineer Food Bank and the Wellsburg Applefest to providing teacher grants and coordinating one of the region’s biggest trunk-or-treat events. Those efforts helped the organization earn a nomination as a finalist in the community involvement category in the Best of the Best awards presented by the Herald-Star and The Weirton Daily Times.

“That’s recognition that reflects every hour of volunteer time and every ounce of dedication to this team,” Fithyan said.

Volunteer work, he explained, is what makes the chamber a success.

“All of this, every event, every partnership, every success was accomplished by an all-volunteer team,” Fithyan added.

That dedication and work have created a solid foundation for the organization.

“You should be proud of your chamber of commerce,” Fithyan added. “You should be proud of your volunteer effort. As your president, I am proud, deeply proud, to serve and to serve Brooke County and our surrounding communities. From Weirton to Beech Bottom, from Bethany to Colliers to Wellsburg and Follansbee, we are a family.”

But a new analysis from the Pew Research Center shows that behind the innovation is a massive, and growing, strain on the country’s energy and water systems. And for everyday Americans, that could mean higher bills and new long-term environmental challenges.

AI’s Power Appetite Is Exploding

Pew’s review of federal and international data shows U.S. data centers used 183 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2024, about 4% of all electricity used nationwide, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). That’s roughly equal to the entire annual electricity use of Pakistan.

The biggest driver? Hyperscale facilities built specifically for AI models.

According to Pew and the IEA, a typical AI-optimized hyperscale center uses as much electricity as 100,000 homes a year. Newer mega-facilities could use 20 times more once they go online.

In major hubs, especially Northern Virginia, clusters of these centers now consume more than a quarter of the state’s total electricity supply, the Electric Power Research Institute reports.

The Ripple Effect: Rising Bills and Stressed Grids

The higher the power demand, the more utilities must upgrade the grid, and those costs don’t disappear.

In the PJM electricity market (Illinois to North Carolina), data center growth added $9.3 billion in capacity costs for 2025–26, per Pew’s analysis of PJM data. The result:

+ $18/month in western Maryland

+ $16/month in Ohio homes

Looking ahead, Carnegie Mellon University estimates U.S. electricity bills could rise 8% by 2030 just from data centers and crypto mining alone, with even steeper hikes in the most data-center-dense regions.

Water Use: The Quiet Problem No One Is Ready For

Electricity isn’t the only resource being pushed to the limit.

Pew cites federal figures showing U.S. data centers used 17 billion gallons of water in 2023, mostly to cool energy-intensive AI chips at hyperscale sites. And by 2028, hyperscale centers alone could be consuming 16 to 33 billion gallons annually — roughly the yearly use of a mid-sized U.S. city. Cooling demands vary by season and by facility design, but researchers say the overall trend is clear: AI growth means water demand is climbing fast.

Americans Are Unsure What to Make of AI’s Environmental Impact

Pew’s August 2024 survey suggests the public hasn’t formed a consensus:

25% believe AI will harm the environment

20% believe it will help

25% think it’ll be a mix

30% aren’t sure

That uncertainty mirrors the reality: the U.S. is witnessing a resource-intensive surge with no clear long-term blueprint yet.",https://abc45.com/resources/media2/16x9/5025/1320/0x292/90/5dc7c502-fcd0-4b76-abf7-f9abfcb15a73-GettyImages2242297318.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 14:08:40.286860

ALBUQUERQUE – On Small Business Saturday, Deb Haaland, candidate for Governor of New Mexico, encouraged New Mexicans to shop small and support local businesses. Haaland views New Mexico small businesses as a key way to address the affordability crisis by growing opportunities for good-paying jobs across the state and providing an alternative to large corporations that price gauge.

Yet SMEs remain critical links in global supply chains.
Companies that embed traceability, carbon accountability, and third-party assurance today won’t just meet tightening rules.","Global supply chains are facing the most profound audit transformation in decades. What began as siloed compliance programs for safety, quality, or sustainability is rapidly converging into integrated, data-driven assurance. By 2026, suppliers will be audited not just on product quality, but on their carbon footprint, human rights practices, and ability to prove end-to-end traceability.

1. Regulation moves from paper to penalties

Across regions, disclosure and due diligence rules are shifting from voluntary to enforceable. The EU’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) and the German Supply Chain Act already require companies to prove human rights and environmental safeguards. In the U.S., the SEC’s climate disclosure rules and the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) are raising the bar on transparency. Non-compliance no longer means reputational damage alone — it now carries financial, legal, and market access risks.

2. Traceability-by-design is becoming the new standard

According to McKinsey, 70% of a company’s emissions come from suppliers, most of which remain opaque. To meet Scope 3 reporting requirements, batch-level, machine-readable data will soon be non-negotiable. Blockchain pilots in apparel are already proving the feasibility of immutable chain-of-custody records.

3. Assurance extends beyond ESG reporting

Just as financial statements require independent auditors, sustainability data is moving toward third-party verification. The International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) is developing global assurance standards for ESG disclosures, while buyers of automotive and electronics are demanding supplier-level carbon verification.

4. Technology raises — but doesn’t replace — human judgment

AI and automation will play a pivotal role:

AI-powered analytics can detect anomalies in labor hours or energy use before audits take place.

Automated compliance checks will free auditors to focus on remediation and long-term risk.

Yet cultural dynamics, ethical dilemmas, and stakeholder trust still demand human interpretation.

5. The expanding scope: From EHS to climate, human rights and biodiversity

Traditional environmental, health, and safety (EHS) audits are broadening into multi-criteria assessments. Future audits will verify not only emissions but also water usage, biodiversity impacts, and living-wage compliance. The World Benchmarking Alliance reports that fewer than 20% of major companies can currently demonstrate full supply-chain due diligence, a gap buyers and regulators are determined to close.

What does this mean for suppliers?

Adapting to these rising expectations will not be uniform across the supply chain. Large corporations generally have the resources to invest in real-time data systems, cross-functional compliance structures, and external assurance providers. For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), however, the path is far more complex. Fragmented regulatory requirements, limited budgets, and slower technology adoption often create barriers to meeting the new audit standards.

Yet SMEs remain critical links in global supply chains. To avoid being left behind, many will need to rely on collaborative solutions rather than individual investments. Industry-wide digital platforms, pooled audit programs, training partnerships, and shared capacity-building initiatives are emerging as viable models. These mechanisms not only lower costs but also provide smaller suppliers with a way to align with the rising demands around ESG, carbon, traceability, safety, and quality—all converging in a single audit framework.

4 moves to stay ahead

Data governance: Establish auditable “sources of truth” for emissions, labor hours, and material origins.

Digital traceability: Capture batch/lot and chain-of-custody data aligned with EU Digital Product Passport and FDA’s FSMA.

Risk-based due diligence: Follow OECD’s six-step model and ensure grievance mechanisms are in place.

AI-ready documentation: Keep master data structured to enable AI-driven compliance reviews.

The takeaway

Audits are no longer box-checking exercises — they are becoming the currency of trust in global trade. Companies that embed traceability, carbon accountability, and third-party assurance today won’t just meet tightening rules. They will earn a competitive edge in a marketplace where resilience, transparency, and low-carbon performance define the winners of tomorrow.",https://img.sdcexec.com/mindful/acbm/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/parinapril-adobestock-1651133848.MDG0WGNbxO.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-11-29 15:00:15.768344

Across the industry, operators in 2026 face pressure to meet stricter carbon standards and seize rebates that reward innovative retrofits.

The focus now shifts from sweeping remodels to practical fixes, like tuning cooklines, upgrading ventilation, and rethinking gas versus electric tools that promise measurable savings and faster service. Here's an overview of how to make the most of these opportunities.

Reassessing the Hidden Drivers of Kitchen Energy Waste

Much of a kitchen's energy loss comes from small inefficiencies that stack up daily. Gas burners left idling, clogged hood filters, and poor heat recovery waste both fuel and money. It's like leaving a faucet running all night, except the leak is invisible and constant.

Chefs often underestimate standby loads from prep equipment, or how uneven refrigeration seals drive compressors to run nonstop. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows restaurants can use up to 4 times more energy than a typical commercial building, so finding efficiency savings must be a priority in this industry.

Thermal imaging and smart meters now reveal where heat escapes or airflow stagnates. So instead of replacing everything, operators can start by auditing usage, tightening maintenance routines, and retraining staff. The biggest savings usually come not from new appliances, but from sharper control over the ones already in use.

Comparing Gas, Electric, and Hybrid Cooking Systems

Choosing between gas, electric, or hybrid systems now involves more than flavor or tradition. Energy pricing shifts and carbon disclosure rules are reshaping that choice.

Gas still offers instant control, but it vents more heat into the room, forcing hoods and HVAC systems to work harder. Electric induction units, on the other hand, send most of their energy directly into cookware, keeping kitchens cooler and cleaner. Hybrid lines blend both, letting operators match energy type to menu volume and cost.

In practice, a busy grill station might stay gas-fired to maintain peak throughput, while prep or saute areas switch to induction. It's like swapping muscle power for assisted gears on a bike, making things smoother and faster without losing control.

Upgrading Broilers and Ovens for Speed and Efficiency

Broilers and ovens are the heart of any cookline, yet they also rank among the hungriest energy users. Modern models use sensors, reflective panels, and insulated cavities to keep more heat on the food and less in the air. Conveyor and infrared broilers, for instance, deliver steady searing while cutting preheat and recovery times.

Before investing, you can compare different commercial broilers to gauge how throughput, fuel type, and vent requirements affect operating costs. Some new units reclaim exhaust heat to warm incoming air or preheat water, reducing total gas or electric demand.

Restaurants that upgrade older broilers often see payback within two years, especially when combined with utility rebates. The real gain goes beyond savings, though. Faster recovery means shorter ticket times and consistent quality, a quiet advantage that customers notice even if they never see the kitchen.

Smarter Ventilation for Cooler, Cheaper Kitchens

Ventilation often hides as a silent energy drain. Oversized hoods and unbalanced airflow can waste thousands each year by exhausting conditioned air faster than needed. A simple fix, like installing variable-speed fans or demand-controlled sensors, lets airflow adjust automatically with cooking load. When sensors detect idle equipment, fans slow, lights dim, and energy drops without staff effort.

Regular cleaning also matters. Grease buildup restricts flow and makes fans run harder, just as a clogged filter chokes an engine. Some kitchens now link hood monitoring to digital dashboards, allowing them to spot airflow issues before they escalate. So, smarter ventilation doesn't just lower bills. It keeps kitchens cooler, safer, and quieter, creating a more comfortable space where chefs can focus on food rather than heat.

Utility Rebates and Decarbonization Rules That Actually Pay Off

Utility incentives and carbon reduction rules now shape how restaurants plan upgrades. Many states tie rebates to verifiable energy savings, allowing operators to recover part of the cost of efficient cookers, hoods, or refrigeration. It's like trading in an old car for one that uses half the fuel, and getting paid for the switch.

Programs from utilities such as SoCalGas and Con Edison now cover audits, equipment rebates, and even kitchen staff training. The savings stack up quickly when combined with federal tax credits for electrification.

Tracking compliance is simpler, too. Smart meters and data logs supply the proof needed to qualify for funds. So, what once felt like bureaucratic red tape now becomes a profit tool. Those who act early lock in rebates before annual budgets close, turning environmental compliance into a measurable business advantage.

The Bottom Line

Cutting kitchen energy use no longer demands massive overhauls. It starts with smarter choices and daily awareness.

When restaurants treat efficiency as part of service, not just savings, every watt and calorie counts. The payoff arrives in quieter kitchens, steadier costs, and food that still tastes just as good.

Before investing, you can compare different commercial broilers to gauge how throughput, fuel type, and vent requirements affect operating costs. Some new units reclaim exhaust heat to warm incoming air or preheat water, reducing total gas or electric demand.

Restaurants that upgrade older broilers often see payback within two years, especially when combined with utility rebates. The real gain goes beyond savings, though. Faster recovery means shorter ticket times and consistent quality, a quiet advantage that customers notice even if they never see the kitchen.

Smarter Ventilation for Cooler, Cheaper Kitchens

Ventilation often hides as a silent energy drain. Oversized hoods and unbalanced airflow can waste thousands each year by exhausting conditioned air faster than needed. A simple fix, like installing variable-speed fans or demand-controlled sensors, lets airflow adjust automatically with cooking load. When sensors detect idle equipment, fans slow, lights dim, and energy drops without staff effort.

Regular cleaning also matters. Grease buildup restricts flow and makes fans run harder, just as a clogged filter chokes an engine. Some kitchens now link hood monitoring to digital dashboards, allowing them to spot airflow issues before they escalate. So, smarter ventilation doesn't just lower bills. It keeps kitchens cooler, safer, and quieter, creating a more comfortable space where chefs can focus on food rather than heat.

Utility Rebates and Decarbonization Rules That Actually Pay Off

Utility incentives and carbon reduction rules now shape how restaurants plan upgrades. Many states tie rebates to verifiable energy savings, allowing operators to recover part of the cost of efficient cookers, hoods, or refrigeration. It's like trading in an old car for one that uses half the fuel, and getting paid for the switch.

Programs from utilities such as SoCalGas and Con Edison now cover audits, equipment rebates, and even kitchen staff training. The savings stack up quickly when combined with federal tax credits for electrification.

Tracking compliance is simpler, too. Smart meters and data logs supply the proof needed to qualify for funds. So, what once felt like bureaucratic red tape now becomes a profit tool. Those who act early lock in rebates before annual budgets close, turning environmental compliance into a measurable business advantage.

The Bottom Line

Cutting kitchen energy use no longer demands massive overhauls. It starts with smarter choices and daily awareness.

When restaurants treat efficiency as part of service, not just savings, every watt and calorie counts. The payoff arrives in quieter kitchens, steadier costs, and food that still tastes just as good.

America must lead on safety. - The Hill,"Kelly Wanser, opinion contributor, Kelly Wanser, opinion contributor",,,,,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/5622203-us-lags-weather-modification/,"Here’s what should worry us: America is falling behind in the one area where we should lead — the science and data needed to ensure atmospheric safety and security.
Yet today, we lack the basic information infrastructure needed to evaluate or respond to atmospheric interventions to ensure public safety.
The path forward requires sustaining globally unique U.S. federal atmospheric science programs and rapidly expanding our knowledge base — not building deployment capabilities.
We cannot prevent everyone, everywhere from developing atmospheric interventions.
The atmosphere is emerging as a domain of strategic competition with profound implications for national security, economic competitiveness and public safety.","I understand why millions of Americans look up at the sky with concern. Videos of unusual cloud formations circulate on social media, accompanied by questions about “chemtrails” and secret weather modification programs.

While concerns often reflect misunderstandings about ordinary aircraft contrails and natural atmospheric phenomena, the underlying instinct — that something may be happening in our atmosphere that we don’t know enough about — is not exactly wrong.

Weather and climate modification are not conspiracy theories. They are real, expanding capabilities that demand public attention and government action.

The question is whether the United States will lead in ensuring they emerge in the world safely and transparently or whether we will cede this emerging strategic domain to private interests and foreign competitors.

Consider what we know: China operates the world’s most extensive weather modification program, involving around 35,000 personnel, with 20 percent growth in activity from 2024 to 2025.

President Xi declared that China would build a “weather superpower,” and his meteorological director stated, “weather modification technology is an important part of building a weather superpower.”

Other nations including the United Kingdom, Australia, United Arab Emirates and Japan have launched large research and development programs.

Last month, Stardust Solutions — a private company proposing to disperse particles in the stratosphere to influence global climate — secured $60 million in venture capital, the largest funding round ever for an atmospheric intervention company.

A few weeks prior, the New York Times featured a nonprofit proposal to fast-track dispersing particles into the stratosphere.

Private organizations face structural pressures that conflict with objective safety evaluation. Companies must advance their proprietary approach and move quickly to generate returns. Nonprofits advocating for specific interventions face pressures to advance the approaches they have championed and been funded to pursue.

Truly independent assessment must be conducted drawing on strong science by public institutions free from the incentives and pressures affecting both commercial ventures and advocacy nonprofits.

Here’s what should worry us: America is falling behind in the one area where we should lead — the science and data needed to ensure atmospheric safety and security.

The United States historically excelled at atmospheric observation and rigorous, independent scientific assessment. The U.S.-led Montreal Protocol’s success in protecting the ozone layer demonstrated the power of robust research and science-based decision-making.

Yet today, we lack the basic information infrastructure needed to evaluate or respond to atmospheric interventions to ensure public safety.

We are not adequately monitoring the atmosphere. Despite efforts by the U.S. government to provide a baseline of the stratosphere — the very region companies like Stardust target — right now we lack adequate aerial sampling measurements of its chemistry. American satellite instruments dedicated to observing the stratosphere remotely are projected to discontinue service soon, leaving us increasingly blind to a domain of growing strategic importance.

We cannot sufficiently project atmospheric effects of weather and climate interventions. Current models cannot predict the impact on weather patterns, precipitation, agriculture and ecosystems with the precision required for decision-making.

We have not developed protections to ensure safety. Without adequate observations and research, we lack the monitoring capabilities and regulatory frameworks to protect against risks to the ozone layer, changes in weather patterns and other potential side-effects and to compare them to a future Earth system without intervention.

This knowledge deficit has profound national security implications. A state with large-scale weather control capabilities could gain leverage in geopolitical conflicts, manipulate precipitation patterns affecting food, water, economic activity, communications and human health or conduct interventions that harm U.S. interests without clear attribution.

The path forward requires sustaining globally unique U.S. federal atmospheric science programs and rapidly expanding our knowledge base — not building deployment capabilities.

This means public investment in sustained atmospheric observations, improved models and analytical tools, comprehensive evaluation of intervention approaches and independent scientific assessment mechanisms.

To those concerned about secret programs: The transparency and public oversight enabled by research are precisely what we need more of, not less.

The real danger comes not from government and academic scientists conducting open research (such as atmospheric programs at NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency), but from private and foreign actors operating without transparency, public input or monitoring.

We cannot prevent everyone, everywhere from developing atmospheric interventions. But we can ensure the United States leads in building the knowledge base for safety and security. This requires reversing divestment trends, expanding funding for atmospheric observation infrastructure, modeling and science, and developing evidence-based regulatory frameworks.

The atmosphere is emerging as a domain of strategic competition with profound implications for national security, economic competitiveness and public safety. Public concerns about what’s happening in our atmosphere are valid.

Let’s channel them into action with the right investments in science and transparency to ensure atmospheric safety and security now, or risk losing control of the skies that shape our future.

This is accompanied by targets like 11 GW of offshore wind by 2040 and 2 GW of energy storage by 2030.
According to tracking by Media Matters, Murdoch-owned outlets laid the groundwork as early as August by blaming New Jersey’s higher electricity bills on green mandates and plant closures.

The group flagged op-eds and coverage from Fox News, The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post from August to October this year as wrongfully “blaming high electricity bills in New Jersey” on “green-energy mandates.”

“Even though the issue is most pronounced in New Jersey, it is going to be happening probably all over the country. So, any coverage that is happening there will impact the coverage of the issue everywhere,” wrote Ilana Berger, author of the two reports and a senior researcher on the Media Matters’ team on climate and energy disinformation. The nonprofit, based in Washington, describes itself as a “progressive research and information center dedicated to comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media.”

According to a Senate Democratic Joint Economic Committee report released in early November, the average American household will pay about $100 more for electricity this year, with electric bills rising in 47 states.

New Jersey has the goal of 100 percent clean electricity by 2035, meaning all electricity sold in the state must come from “clean” sources under its strengthened Clean Energy Standard. This is accompanied by targets like 11 GW of offshore wind by 2040 and 2 GW of energy storage by 2030. But these are long-term build-outs, many of which are still being procured and, in the case of offshore wind, have faced challenges due to the retreat in federal support for the sector.

“The extreme hikes we are currently seeing are almost entirely attributable to data centers and their tremendous load,” Brian Lipman, director of New Jersey Rate Counsel, an independent state agency representing electricity consumers, said in an email.

PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator for Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, estimates that data centers alone will add about 30 GW in demand for the entire region by 2030, a demand equivalent to adding about 20 million homes to the grid.

Brendan Pierpont, the energy modeling chief of nonpartisan energy and climate think tank Energy Innovation, also pointed to PJM Interconnection’s slow progress in connecting more projects to the grid to match the increased demand.

As of Nov. 12, there are about 1,330 projects totaling at least 100 GW in capacity that are still waiting for interconnection with PJM. Most of the projects held up are renewables. According to a report by energy market intelligence firm Aurora Energy Research, if even about 10 percent of those renewables could be connected by 2026, they could have reduced the capacity price—the charge on electric bills that largely drove the recent price hikes—by about a quarter.

“The reason bills are going up is a simple supply and demand problem. PJM has not built enough supply while also not planning for an increase in demand from data centers,” said Alex Ambrose, an analyst with the nonpartisan think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective. “All those energy projects aren’t waiting in a queue for Governor Murphy’s approval. They’re waiting for PJM approval.”

Fox News, The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post did not respond to requests for comment.

As for plant retirements, coal plants like Logan and Chambers shut in 2022, and Oyster Creek nuclear plant closed in 2018. Keeping facilities like these running would mean expensive upgrades to meet tighter pollution rules. Retiring them avoids those upgrade costs and cuts pollution that drives asthma and premature deaths.

“Coal plants were uneconomic—they could not make enough money in the markets prior to the data center load. In fact, the coal plants in New Jersey were tied to expensive out-of-market contracts and their closure led to savings for New Jersey ratepayers,” Lipman said.

According to tracking by Media Matters, Murdoch-owned outlets laid the groundwork as early as August by blaming New Jersey’s higher electricity bills on green mandates and plant closures.

The opinion articles coincided with the gubernatorial campaign in the Garden State, where Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill triumphed against Republican Jack Ciattarelli.

A Wall Street Journal op-ed by energy executive Paul H. Tice in early August faulted fossil-fuel retirements and the state’s 2035 clean-power target. Two days later, a New York Post op-ed tied hikes to “Democrats’ bungled energy policies.”

Within three days, Fox & Friends and America’s Newsroom followed with reports linking price spikes to coal and nuclear shutdowns. The segments briefly included a counterpoint from then-Democratic gubernatorial candidate Sherrill, who instead put the onus on PJM Interconnection.

Then the drumbeat intensified. Fox Business’ The Big Money Show accused a “green-obsessed” outgoing Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy of driving up costs. Three days later, the New York Post editorial board said “insane” clean energy policies were to blame, and Fox & Friends further amplified that line with commentary, claiming without basis that summer bills had “tripled” and that Democrats prioritize climate over affordability.

President Donald Trump jumped in on August 19, railing against wind and solar on his social media site Truth Social. Trump called them a “scam” and vowed to block them.

Meanwhile, in its endorsement of Republican Ciattarelli on Sept. 27, the New York Post editorial board claimed Democrats’ push for zero emissions sent bills soaring. A day after, The Wall Street Journal editorial board faulted clean-energy targets and restrictions against gas projects for rising prices.

“[The] actual Democratic policy in New Jersey, and nationwide, is deliberate energy scarcity—and the higher prices that go with it,” the editorial board, which is separate from its news operations, wrote.

Energy experts have sought to correct these claims.

“New Jersey has been a clean energy policy leader for decades, and if you look back to 2010, electricity prices were more or less flat for over a decade, rising slower than inflation until the recent PJM capacity market price surge,” said Pierpont in an email.

Lipman at the New Jersey Rate Counsel said that while some solar and energy-efficiency subsidies appear on people’s bills, they did not drive this summer’s sharp price increases, and short-term price bumps from offshore wind have yet to show up on bills because they haven’t been built and connected to the grid.

Allison Fisher, the climate and energy director of Media Matters, said this pattern wasn’t new. Murdoch-owned outlets repeatedly blamed clean energy for higher electricity prices to undercut the Inflation Reduction Act both before and after its passage in 2022, she said.

“Years before this moment, we already knew what the playbook was. So it definitely was not a surprise,” said Fisher.

Sherrill won the gubernatorial election and will take office on January 20, 2026.

Sherrill ran on an “affordability first” energy message, vowing to declare a state of emergency on utility costs and temporarily freeze rates on day one, while fast-tracking cheaper and cleaner in-state power generation and increasing oversight of utilities.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1759299195-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 13:01:35.912379

The event fostered substantive discussions on next-generation solar systems, the strategic value of battery energy storage systems (BESS) in the energy transition, evolving two-part tariff structures, and targeted, forward-looking investment solutions. More than 100 attendees from industry associations, leading companies, and ecosystem partners joined the session to shape the future of clean energy in Vietnam.

Seizing Opportunities, Ushering in a New Era for Residential Solar

In a keynote address, Ms. Shen Lu, national general distributor for Shenzhen Skyworth Photovoltaic Technology Co., Ltd. (“Skyworth PV”) in Vietnam, delivered a comprehensive analysis of the current landscape and future trajectory of Vietnam’s residential solar market. She emphasized Vietnam’s exceptional solar energy resources, noting an average annual sunlight exceeding 2,000 hours, which provides a natural foundation for solar power generation. At present, however, PV applications are mostly seen in large ground-mounted power stations and commercial or industrial rooftop systems, with relatively limited adoption among ordinary households.

Simplifying Complexity, Redefining Home Solar

To address these market gaps, Skyworth PV announced the official launch of its SUN Mate Home Solar 2.0 solution, the result of extensive market research and technological innovation. The core proposition of this new offering is “making clean energy accessible,” effectively transforming complex solar power generation into a product as straightforward and user-friendly as a standard household appliance.

A defining feature of the SUN Mate series is its “plug-and-play” design. Unlike conventional solar installations that require professional design, complex construction, and structural modifications, SUN Mate truly achieves a “three no” principle: no design, no construction, and no modification needed. Homeowners are freed from concerns about complex installation requirements; whether for urban apartment balconies or rural home courtyards, a suitable and simple installation solution is readily available.

In everyday use, SUN Mate delivers equally impressive performance. The system produces power during daylight hours for direct household consumption, significantly cutting grid electricity usage and cost. Through Skyworth’s proprietary smart cloud platform and mobile app, users can monitor real-time generation data and equipment status, and connect with professional customer service when needed. This intelligent management experience—making solar energy “visible, manageable, and affordable”—enables households to adopt solar power effortlessly.

Versatile Designs for Vietnamese Homes

To enable broader clean energy adoption across Vietnamese households, Skyworth PV has engineered three distinct SUN Mate product configurations, each meticulously optimized for specific settings.

The Balcony Model fits modern urban living. Its compact structure and minimalist design enable seamless integration with various architectural styles. The unique bracket-based setup requires no special tools and preserves building structures, making installation possible even for apartment dwellers. Designed to withstand Vietnam’s rainy and windy seasons, the model offers enhanced stability to maintain safety and reliability in adverse weather conditions.

The Awning Model strategically combines power generation with practical shade provision, making it particularly suitable for storefronts or the exteriors of owner-built houses. It not only supplies electricity and cuts energy costs, but also creates comfortable shaded spaces, delivering multiple functional benefits. Its stylish design also enhances a building’s visual appeal.

The Ground Model has drawn widespread attention for its superior adaptability. It supports angle adjustments between 25 and 40 degrees, allowing users to easily position it for optimal power generation based on seasonal variations and sun angles. Suitable for family yards, terraces, or campsites, the unit can also be folded and relocated with ease—bringing portable clean energy wherever needed.

As awareness of clean energy grows and technology continues advancing, residential solar power is transitioning from a premium alternative to an essential household solution.

""Carney’s deal with Danielle Smith is the sellout of the century: scrapping climate legislation for a pipeline that will never be built,"" said Lewis, a veteran journalist and climate activist.
In response to the deal, the minister of Canadian culture, Steven Guilbeault, who formerly served as environment minister under the previous Liberal administration, resigned in protest.
""Filling this pipeline and expansion would require more oil sands mining, leading to more carbon pollution, more tailings, and worse impacts for communities near the tar sands,"" warned Brooks.
""The pipeline to BC would have to cross some of the most challenging terrain in Canada.","First Nations groups backed by environmental and conservationist allies in Canada are denouncing a pipeline and tanker infrastructure agreement announced Thursday between Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney and Conservative Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, calling it a betrayal and promising to fight its implementation tooth and nail.

“We will use every tool in our toolbox to ensure that this pipeline does not go ahead,” said Heiltsuk Nation Chief Marilyn Slett in response to the Carney-Smith deal that would bring tens of millions of barrels of tar sands oil from Alberta to the coast of British Columbia for export by building new pipeline and lifting a moratorium against oil tankers operating in fragile British Columbia coastal water.

While Carney, who argues that the pipeline is in Canada's economic interest, had vowed to secure the support of First Nations before finalizing any agreement with Alberta, furious reactions to the deal made it clear that promise was not met.

Xhaaidlagha Gwaayaai, the president of the Haida nation, was emphatic: ""This project is not going to happen.""

The agreement, according to the New York Times, is part of Carney’s ""plan to curb Canada’s trade dependence on the United States, swings Canadian policy away from measures meant to fight climate change to focus instead on growing the oil and gas industry.""

In a statement, the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs (UBCIC) ""loudly"" voiced its opposition to the memorandum of understanding signed by Carney and Smith.

""This MOU is nothing less than a high-risk and deeply irresponsible agreement that sacrifices Indigenous peoples, coastal communities, and the environment for political convenience,"" said Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, president of the UBCIC. ""By explicitly endorsing a new bitumen pipeline to BC's coast and promising to rewrite the Oil Tanker Moratorium Act, the federal government is resurrecting one of the most deeply flawed and divisive ideas in Canadian energy politics.""

Slett, who serves as secretary-treasurer of the UBCIC, said the agreement ""was negotiated without the involvement of the very Nations who would shoulder those risks, and to suggest ‘Indigenous co-ownership’ of a pipeline while ignoring the clear opposition of Coastal First Nations is unacceptable.""

Avi Lewis, running for the leadership of the progressive New Democratic Party (NDP) in the upcoming elections, decried the agreement as a failure of historic proportions.

""Carney’s deal with Danielle Smith is the sellout of the century: scrapping climate legislation for a pipeline that will never be built,"" said Lewis, a veteran journalist and climate activist. ""We need power lines, not pipelines. Our path is through climate leadership and building good jobs in the clean economy.""

In response to the deal, the minister of Canadian culture, Steven Guilbeault, who formerly served as environment minister under the previous Liberal administration, resigned in protest.

“Despite this difficult economic context, I remain one of those for whom environmental issues must remain front and center,” Guilbeault said in a statement.

""Over the past few months, several elements of the climate action plan I worked on as Minister of the Environment have been, or are about to be, dismantled,” he said. “In my view, these measures remain essential to our climate action plan.”

David Eby, the premier of British Columbia who opposes the new pipeline into his province and was not included in the discussions between Carney and Smith, echoed those who said the project is more dead than alive, despite the MOU, calling it a potential ""energy vampire"" that would distracts from better energy solutions that don't carry all the baggage of this proposed project.

“With all of the variables that have yet to be fulfilled—no proponent, no route, no money, no First Nations support—that it cannot draw limited federal resources, limited Indigenous governance resources, limited provincial resources away from the real projects that will employ people,” Eby added.

Keith Brooks, the program director at Environmental Defence, decried the deal as ""worse than we had anticipated"" and ""a gift to the oil industry and Alberta Premier Smith, at the expense of practically everyone else.""

""Filling this pipeline and expansion would require more oil sands mining, leading to more carbon pollution, more tailings, and worse impacts for communities near the tar sands,"" warned Brooks. ""The pipeline to BC would have to cross some of the most challenging terrain in Canada. The impacts of construction would be severe, and the impacts of a spill, devastating.""

Jessica Green, a professor at the University of Toronto focused on environmental politics, equated the ""reckless"" deal to a ""climate dumpster fire"" and called the push for more tar sands pipelines in Canada ""the energy equivalent [of] investing in VHS tapes in 2025.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62255977&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C166%2C0%2C167,N,,2025-11-29 12:02:29.582741

“The ‘Legacy Education Fund’ is about preparing Texas schools for the future—thinking 10 to 20 years ahead, not just the next budget cycle.
How the Legacy Education Fund would work The “Legacy Education Fund” could operate as an endowment working alongside the existing Permanent School Fund (PSF).
“The ‘Legacy Education Fund’ is about adding new dollars to the system, not just moving the same money,” Popinski said.
Decisions made during the 90th Legislative Session, set to begin in January 2027, could establish a new direction for funding Texas public education.","Texas has one of the nation’s largest and fastest-growing economies, yet its per-student public school funding remains in the bottom 10 nationally. During the 89th Legislative Session, lawmakers approved House Bill 2, providing $8.5 billion in public education funding for the 2025-26 biennium.

Despite billions invested during the 89th Legislative Session, school districts still face many challenges, including school closures, staff layoffs, and budget deficits.

To address this, Raise Your Hand Texas proposes creating a “Legacy Education Fund,” a new endowment that could broaden funding sources and increase resources for schools across the state.

“We can’t keep waiting for each legislative session to patch the same school funding gaps,” said Bob Popinski, dean of policy for Raise Your Hand Texas. “The ‘Legacy Education Fund’ is about preparing Texas schools for the future—thinking 10 to 20 years ahead, not just the next budget cycle. There will be an estimated $28.5 billion in our Economic Stabilization Fund, also known as the Rainy Day Fund. That money could help seed a new endowment fund to support public education in ways our current funding methods cannot.”

Texas schools are under financial pressure

In Texas classrooms, the effects of underfunding are visible daily. Students face larger class

sizes and fewer resources; teachers take on heavier workloads; support staff cover extra duties; and district leaders stretch budgets to cover the essentials. Rising costs, inflation, and new state mandates make the challenge even more difficult.

Despite the Texas Legislature’s recent investment, Texas spends about $3,500 less per student than the national average. The state’s two-year budget cycle adds uncertainty, forcing schools to make long-term commitments without dependable support.

“Districts are constantly stretching resources to cover basic needs,” Popinski said. “Without steady, long-term funding, they’re busy fighting fires and catching up instead of investing in student success.”

The proposed “Legacy Education Fund” aims to address this challenge by providing a reliable, supplemental revenue source.

How the Legacy Education Fund would work

The “Legacy Education Fund” could operate as an endowment working alongside the existing Permanent School Fund (PSF). Funded through an initial investment, the fund’s principal would be invested to generate earnings, which would be distributed to support education across the state. This creates a self-sustaining revenue source that grows over time, providing schools with financial stability.

Currently, funding sources such as lottery proceeds and the PSF help pay for public education through formulas set by the Texas Legislature. However, neither of these increases the total dollars flowing into classrooms; they determine how schools receive funding, not how much funding they receive.

“The ‘Legacy Education Fund’ is about adding new dollars to the system, not just moving the same money,” Popinski said. “It would provide schools with additional funding on top of what they already receive. The goal isn’t to replace existing support but to strengthen it, giving districts a more stable and predictable foundation.”

Benefits for schools

The “Legacy Education Fund” would give Texas schools more than funding. It would provide Texas with:

● Durability: guaranteeing future funding regardless of the political or economic climate

● Diversified funding streams: introducing reliable funding sources beyond current school funding

● Stability: allowing districts to make long-term decisions without worrying about the uncertainty in two-year state budgets

● Competitive investment: fueling economic growth, promoting healthier communities, enhancing quality of life, and setting Texas on the path to match other states’ investments in public school students

● Legacy: establishing an endowment as a permanent promise to Texas kids and the down payment on a quality education

Other states, including Alabama, Colorado, Mississippi, and Connecticut, have established public education endowments funded by general revenue and private contributions. These funds effectively support various school needs—from core expenses to programs, technology, and facility improvements—showing the potential impact a similar approach could have in Texas.

It’s time for lawmakers to take action

During the 90th Legislative Session, legislators have the opportunity to create a different type of permanent, growing funding source that could transform public schools for decades.

As you shop this Small Business Saturday, remember how rulemakers in Washington impact your costs and your choices.","When you’re in line at your favorite small business on Small Business Saturday, you’re probably not thinking about how the rules the government creates affect your purchases. Here in Washington, D.C., it’s easy for policymakers and bureaucrats to lose sight of how poorly crafted rules can impact your costs at the point of sale, or how paperwork burdens hamper the ability of your favorite local shop to provide excellent service and a robust selection of merchandise.

Start with the mountain of paperwork that the boutique or specialty store you’re frequenting faces. These direct costs hurt that store’s margins and take up time for the owner and the staff as they provide a service to you and your community. That, in turn, makes your experience whenever you shop more painful than it should be.

Paperwork comes in lots of forms. For instance, the Internal Revenue Service requires every business with employees, from the largest tech companies to the smallest boutique, to file Form 941, the “Employer’s Quarterly Tax Return,” four times per year.

Chief Counsel Casey B. Mulligan has done extensive research on this form and finds that it is the fifth largest paperwork burden the government puts on citizens, accounting for 470 million hours of time.

Moving to yearly reporting would save small businesses 224 million hours and $20.1 billion annually, freeing up time for your favorite local businesses to increase staffing at the register and lower their prices. That allows these shops to pass those lower costs onto you.

Washington’s paperwork burden does not only come in the form of tax forms. Rules like the Consumer Product Safety Commission Certificates of Compliance require additional paperwork in the form of product registration for every single import and increase the stakes for clerical errors.

If you are buying a German board game for your brother, or a Japanese collectible for your daughter, the small hobby shop that imports your purchase must electronically upload a slew of information for each unique product. If there are any inconsistencies at Customs, the shipment is flagged for additional review. That means delays, rejections, or seizure for the business, and an unhappy Christmas for your family.

These paperwork burdens are so severe that Advocacy has placed both Form 941 and the certificates of compliance rule on our list of Most Wanted reforms. Washington’s choice to bury America’s Main Street under mountains of paperwork affects your time in line and your ability to choose what to buy your family for the holidays.

These problems are only the tip of the iceberg. The stores you frequent also deal with upstream, or indirect costs, from rules. If the government imposes rules that lead to costs on producers of raw materials or manufactured goods, those producers then must pass those costs down to wholesalers, retailers, or consumers. Worst of all, the impact analyses that agencies conduct to demonstrate the costs of these rules on small businesses often do not consider these indirect costs at all.

A rule like the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s Heat Injury and Illness Prevention rule is a good example. The decorations you might pick up for Christmas at your local winter market might become more expensive because the small manufacturers that produce them would be required to meet very specific heat-mitigation requirements. Many of those requirements are burdensome thanks to a one-size-fits-all standard.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations that set fuel emissions standards also drive up the costs of your holiday. If the local tree farm needs to switch to a more efficient vehicle, it costs thousands of dollars, and those costs get passed on to you. Under President Trump, the EPA is removing those regulations, with a potential cost savings in the hundreds of billions of dollars.

As you shop this Small Business Saturday, remember how rulemakers in Washington impact your costs and your choices. Advocacy is here to actively work with regulators in Washington, D.C. to reduce that burden, freeing up small businesses all over the United States, growing the economy, and driving down the cost of your Christmas.",https://advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Advo-A-seal-150x150.png,N,,2025-11-29 13:59:57.326214

Net Power (NYSE:NPWR) is an exciting utilities company with a unique patented technology which could transform the energy markets in the US. Data centers is at the epicenter of electricity demand in the US and because of the attractive production model NPWR and low cost of scaling its a lucrative bet on this.

Technology

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with NPWR.

Is NPWR fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.

NPWR has a patented protected technology which uses natural gas and oxygen for its two inputs. The two elements are combusted which produces CO2 and water. This drives a turboexpander which is what produces the electricity. What makes it so special is that once the water has been moved out and separated the CO2 is returned to the turboexpander which powers it a second time, which as you might guess increases output and efficiency. Once there is too much CO2 produced it is pumped out of the system into underground storages.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that in 2021, methane emissions from natural gas and petroleum systems and from abandoned oil and natural gas wells were the source of about 33% of total U.S. methane emissions and about 4% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.

Natural gas is a much cleaner energy supply, but it can be even cleaner with the proprietary technology that NPWR has. The CO2 that gets pumped out would end up in two different locations, either class II wells where its later used to increase productivity at oil and gas production sites. The second option is class VI cells where it is sealed off and stored for all eternity.

Allam-Fetvedt Cycle

The Allam-Fetvedt Cycle is what enables NPWR to be a large-scale power generation company eventually. Once it went public it came with this technology as a patent and have exclusive rights. It adds on the image you see above here.

In commercial use it would when electricity prices are low produce oxygen with energy and then store this as a liquid. When prices increase this stored oxygen would then be used to produce electricity.

This oxygen storage method makes it one of the most cost-effective and long-duration energy storages in the world. It makes it incredibly attractive for data centers as it provides moderate balancing and higher potential returns too. Testing for this is done at the La Forte site in Texas along with scaling equipment for Baker Hughes.

Looking ahead, we expect to complete Phase 1 of the program this year. Phase 2 will commence later this year and most likely conclude in early 2026. Additionally, design and site preparations are already underway for Phases 3 and 4, which are scheduled for completion in 2026 and 2027, respectively.

During the last quarter it had meaningful progress at the site and plans seem to be on schedule so far. Start-up speed has increased, plant automation added and overall plant performance has gone up.

Pathway

NPWR is on track to deliver 97% carbon capture starting with its Project Permian. It's the company's first expected commercial-scale facility for using its technology. It will begin in the Midland of Texas. The project began construction in Q3 2024 and is expected to be finished and up and running in 2028 hopefully. During this period there has been revision to the cost, the latest pointing to $1.7 - 2 billion, up from the original $750 - 950 million.

The CEO Danny Rice blamed the cause on inflationary impacts on prices and increased interest in building gas-turbines causing bottlenecks.

The cost was a little bit of a surprise take a step back and look at where we can cut costs without cutting safety and reliability

Cost-cutting is where the focus should be right now in scaling its project. It's financially stable with a large cash pile, but raising further capital through equity will negatively impact the share price and investor morale.

We've seen the last couple of years a shift in the market to as much natural gas generation as possible. It's the only thing that can scale to the amount needed and offers affordability

This is what NPWR is playing on. History can teach us that power demand will be explosive during this data center buildout. Between 2000 and 2005 the US power demand increased by 90%, and a further 24% between 2005 and 2009. The forecasts during that period where largely overstated, predicting major power outages which never happened.

Interestingly, between 2010 and 2018 demand was basically flat because of new technological advancements which reduced the consumption at the same time making them more efficient. Some models point to between 200 TWh/year to 1,050 TWh/year by 2030. For context, on the higher end it would represent a quarter of the US annual electricity generation in 2023 (which was 4,178 TWh/year). Most of the assumptions puts 2030 consumption at 325 TWh/year to 580 TWh/year, representing between 6.5 - 12.5% of the USs annual electricity production.

Because of the massive ramp up companies are searching for any opportunity out there. The tech giants like Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon (AMZN) are eying nuclear power to support the buildout. Because gas is the fastest to scale it's also what makes NPWR such a lucrative investment right now, because it's not only a play on increased power demand, but clean power. With 97% carbon capture efficiency it will be more attractive for companies to get their energy from it in order to meet emission quotas.

Technology At Scale

NPWR plans that its power plants will be factory produced modular facilities which directly drives down both costs and increases the rate of scaling.

The company is still in the early stages so they aren't posting too many financial models where revenues might land. But from a 2023 analyst day presentation they presented some compelling cases in terms of scalability. The chart shows the impact of different numbers of plants deployed per year in EBITDA. At 10 on the middle range of 15 per year it would translate into nearly $1 billion EBITDA. Seeing as most utilities companies trade at 11 - 12x EV/EBITDA it makes a compelling case that NPWR might have a lot of upside seeing as its current market cap is just below $700 million, or $282 million in EV.

With the delays which occurred in 2025 due to rising costs it seems that 2028 will now be the year when the first site goes online. NPWR is backed by Occidental Petroleum (OXY) so it made sense the first site would be at one of its assets.

There have been some material changes from this original business plan where it would sell the plants to companies and receive a license fee from this. That is what the chart showed. But because of the rise in data center demand NPWR is changing and looking to operate its assets fully instead, or selling part stakes to private equity to raise cash in the short-term. This should increase liquidity and make scaling both faster and less leveraged.

In the presentation it outlined how a fully stand alone Net Power plant can generate 415 MWs per day with 50 million cubic feet of natural gas inputs per day. This comes out to 550 megawatts of thermal input where 80% becomes power.

In just a few short months, Project Permian LCOE has meaningfully improved from over $150 per megawatt hour to now under $100 per megawatt hour,

During the Q2 call management outlined the cost-reductions made to LCOE (levelized cost of electricity).

With the new integration they also state they are confident in getting below $100 MWh LCOE right out of the gate. We're kind of sitting in a place where if we're starting in that $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion sort of zip code, we feel pretty good about being able to get down to the $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion range -- $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion for the stand-alone net power unit.

Over time NPWR is targeting a lower cost of unit as well, which as stated before, due to the better integration of CO2 among other things, getting below $100 MWh LCOE seems reasonable. It is however promising to see the cost per unit falling so drastically as the company builds more.

Between 2021 and 2023 Texas averaged about $117 MWh in wholesale electricity prices. During 2025 so far the blended rate between all three categories as seen above is $133.2 MWh. This gives NPWR a gross profit of at least $33.2 per MW. It stated that one unit produces 415 MWh/day which is $1.3 million in daily revenues, $39.8 million in monthly revenues and $484 million annually. Based on the LCOE and current market price each unit would run at about 33 - 35% gross margins, $159 million gross profits.

Here is a cost breakdown of what one plant would look like. Assuming the same market price as today net income is $11.5 million. These are rough estimates which is the best I can do until the company actually has started to produce and sell. LCOE is interesting here as it covers all costs associated with producing.

CEO Daniel Rice pointed to it potentially going below $80 eventually as the core Capex in the cycle goes down with time.NPWR is investing $2 billion for the Permian Basin site, which should result in $100 million annual depreciation, laid out over 20 years. As costs come down this should normalize at $60 million instead. Added back in cash flows are $251 million which is strong, showing that investments might eventually pay for themselves.

Here is the bull case scenario for NPWR. Sales have gone to $175 MWh which is driven by increased demand from data centers, increasing population and other. LCOE goes down to $80 MWh as outlined by the CEO. Cost per unit goes down to bringing depreciation to $60 million annually. Overall, FCF of $338 million and net income of $178 million.

NPWR hasn't set a specific plan which outlines how many plants they intend on making in the next 10 years, but the CEO mentions 20 years somewhat frequently along with 10 - 20 units made. During 10 years I'll make the assumption that NPWR will build another 5 to be conservative. The first in 2028 and the rest afterwards. Seeing as NPWR won't realize the bull case model until later on I'll make my projections using the first one for the year 2035.

Revenue $2.42 billion

Operating income $795 million

Free Cash Flow $1.255 billion

Net Income $57.5 million

I'm expecting a certain level of equity financing which will dilute shares over 10 years. Raising between $60 - $70 million annually would today require to raise the outstanding amount by 10% give or take. Once NPWR starts to generate more FCF I see the dilution rate normalizing at 5 - 6% annually. So by year 2035 shares would be 129 million and EPS $0.44. Based on today's price that is a P/E of 7.95. Based on cash flows its $9.72 per share or 0.36x FWD FCF.

The sector averages 20x FWD earnings and 16x FWD FCF. This shows the clear upside in share price NPWR could undergo during the next 10 years if it manages to establish just 5 units.It's a small company which is still in the early days but has a massive run up. Industry tailwinds are strong and not likely to fade. Power demand is here now and it's not waiting, which makes the case for rising electricity costs by 2035 even if supply grows. I'm not new to small caps like this and I'm experienced with the volatility that comes with it.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/us.finance.gurufocus/04dd6a9443291883d9ec4829dc7936ce,N,,2025-11-29 13:01:42.733602

I'm a policy analyst for the Clean Energy Districts of Iowa (CEDI) and an intervenor in Alliant Energy's rate cases. I most recently testified in Docket No. RPU-2025-0003, which involves Alliant’s request for advance ratemaking principles to support up to 1,000 megawatts of new wind generation. My testimony emphasizes customer affordability, transparency, and accountability as key to ensuring that new clean energy investments benefit all Iowans.

The bottom line is that clean energy must be affordable and equitable. If a utility cannot show that new wind projects provide net economic benefits for customers via utility ownership, they should not be financing them through rates paid by customers. Alliant customers should not be paying for any utility investment that benefits shareholders more than ratepayers.

Specifically, here are CEDI's key recommendations on the New Wind project:

• Reduce Alliant’s’ proposed cost cap of $3,020/kW, which is 26% higher than a similar project approved earlier this year.

• Deny recovery of undocumented ‘Owner’s Costs’ lacking supporting data.

• Adopt a lower return on equity (ROE) of 8% to 9% instead of the company’s requested 11.25%, aligning with recent independent assessments.

• Limit future turbine repowering cost recovery to Alliant’s cost of debt, not its full ROE.

• Restrict approval to projects that qualify for federal Production Tax Credits (PTCs) and demonstrate net customer benefits.

• Add a new Resource Evaluation Study principle to improve transparency, stakeholder engagement, and long-term planning.

New data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows Iowa’s coal generation has increased by 46.5% year-to-date, while natural gas generation declined and renewable output rose only slightly. Commercial electricity prices increased about 8% over the same period.

These are trends in the wrong direction. Iowa needs more clean energy, but the investments must be responsible, cost-effective, and fair to customers.

In the 1970s, the United States was implementing this technology to become the world’s manufacturing leader of solar panels (again subsidized by federal grants). But who is the world’s manufacturing leader of solar panels today? China!

This short-sightedness plays out repeatedly. The United States invents new technologies, but it is other countries who mass manufacture them. Think semiconductors, personal computers, smartphones, LCD displays, etc. We don’t support the initial start-up production of our own inventions.

Unfortunately, this seems to be happening again. The Inflation Reduction Act supplied new funds to support solar, wind, and geothermal production. Many innovative projects got started and were on their way to providing new jobs and needed energy production.

Suspending the regime in Alberta was one component of a sweeping energy pact unveiled Thursday between Prime Minister Mark Carney and Premier Danielle Smith. The regulations were suspended on the condition Alberta adopt a stronger industrial carbon pricing regime.

Article content

“We have always said that if a province has an equivalent set of regulations that deliver the same outcomes as the clean electricity regulations, we are prepared to enter into equivalency agreements with those provinces,” Hodgson said in a phone interview.

Article content

Provinces including Ontario, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick have criticized the federal rules, particularly for the constraints they place on building new gas-fired power plants.

Article content

The federal government set a deadline of April 1 for Alberta to come up with improvements to its industrial carbon markets, known as the Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction System, or TIER.

Article content

Alberta’s system will ramp up to “a minimum effective credit price” of C$130 ($93) per tonne, according to the pact. The province will also commit to “globally competitive, long-term carbon effective prices, carbon levy recycling protocols, and sector-specific stringency factors.”

Article content

“We’ll be working through how they will restructure their TIER system,” Hodgson said, adding the TIER must cover the electricity grid strongly enough to get it to net zero by 2050.

Article content

The energy pact rolled back other Trudeau-era environmental policies, including scrapping an emissions cap on the oil and gas sector and contemplating exemptions to a ban on oil tankers along the coast of northern British Columbia. The moves have generated controversy and played a part in the resignation from cabinet of Culture Minister Steven Guilbeault, a former high-profile environmental activist.

Nuclear power will have a major role in creating a low-carbon grid in Alberta and elsewhere in Canada, Hodgson said.

SMX allows industries to authenticate the materials they use regardless of where the refining or processing took place.
Forward-Looking Statements The information in this press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future.","The world has entered a supply chain cold war where data, authenticity, and material truth matter more than speed or scale. Western companies are discovering they cannot compete with state-controlled systems unless they can verify the origin and purity of the materials they depend on. SMX (NASDAQ:SMX) stepped into this gap with molecular-level verification that embeds identity directly into metals, minerals, and industrial feedstocks. It gives Western manufacturers the clarity they have been missing for years.

This matters because global supply chains have long been shaped by countries that control both production and certification. When a single region dominates refining, processing, and verification, the rest of the world has limited visibility and even less leverage. SMX disrupts that imbalance by giving companies a tool to confirm material integrity without relying on distant facilities, opaque documentation or state-managed audit systems.

The shift transforms verification from a vulnerability into a competitive advantage. SMX allows industries to authenticate the materials they use regardless of where the refining or processing took place. It decentralizes truth, allowing companies to build their compliance, manufacturing and sourcing strategies on facts that cannot be manipulated or hidden inside the supply chain.

Why Western Industries Need Proof to Compete

Western manufacturers are operating under extreme pressure. They are expected to scale clean energy systems, produce advanced semiconductors, rebuild domestic industrial capacity, and secure defense-grade materials at unprecedented speed. None of this works without verified feedstock. Solar companies cannot risk mislabeled silicon. EV manufacturers cannot rely on uncertain, rare-earth sources. Defense contractors cannot accept alloys with unconfirmed origins. Proof is now structural, not optional.

Legacy systems cannot meet these demands. Documentation is lost between jurisdictions. Certificates vary by region. Supply chain records lack uniformity. Risk grows with each transfer point. SMX solves this by embedding identity into the material itself, making verification independent of external paperwork or geopolitical bottlenecks. It gives companies direct control over their own certainty.

That shift is already reshaping procurement strategies. Companies are prioritizing materials with built-in authentication over shipments that arrive with stacks of documents. Regulators are favoring supply chains that can demonstrate instant traceability. Investors are gravitating toward companies that adopt self-verifying materials because they represent lower compliance risk and higher operational resilience. SMX is emerging as the verification framework that supports this new industrial landscape.

A New Geopolitical Framework for Material Truth

A new global paradigm is forming around the ability to guarantee material truth. The winners in the next industrial cycle will not be the regions with the cheapest production. They will be the companies and nations that can provide authenticity at the source, long before a component reaches a factory floor. SMX is creating that framework by giving materials a forensic identity that withstands every transformation.

This identity strengthens the entire value chain. Manufacturers gain predictable feedstock. Compliance teams gain clarity that aligns with rising regulatory expectations. Defense and energy sectors gain supply assurance that does not collapse under geopolitical strain. The result is a system where authenticity is built into the material instead of being reconstructed through paperwork vulnerable to manipulation.

The larger implication is clear. The future of strategic manufacturing will follow the regions and companies that guarantee material integrity. SMX is enabling that shift by giving the world a structure where trust is not granted, assumed or outsourced. It is earned at the molecular level and carried forward by every shipment that enters the modern industrial economy.

About SMX

As global businesses face new and complex challenges relating to carbon neutrality and meeting new governmental and regional regulations and standards, SMX is able to offer players along the value chain access to its marking, tracking, measuring and digital platform technology to transition more successfully to a low-carbon economy.

Solar projects must break ground by July to be eligible for tax credits that Congress voted to eliminate years earlier than previously planned.
To date, the group has broken ground on 24 megawatts of solar projects worth more than $20 million that benefit low-income households.","Solar power is surging across the U.S. as costs plummet and companies ramp up large-scale commercial projects, but experts say the green industry faces an uncertain future as the Trump administration scraps federal subsidies that have helped foster growth of the clean energy sector.

Last year, more than 90% of all new U.S. electrical generating capacity came from renewable sources, with solar power accounting for more than 81% — the largest single-year increase from any energy source in two decades, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Nationwide, there are enough solar installations to power more than 40 million homes, with utility-scale solar accounting for 71% of that capacity, says the Solar Energy Industries Association. A typical 100 megawatt solar project produces enough energy to power 17,200 average U.S. homes, according to the industry group.

“This growth is a testament to the power of American innovation,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA’s president and CEO. “We’re building factories, hiring American workers and showing that solar energy means made-in-America energy.”

But Hopper said the growth of the industry will be impacted by the decision of President Donald Trump’s administration to end federal subsidies for solar and other clean energy projects.

The Trump administration’s opposition to solar power creates a “risk driving investment overseas, stifling job creation,” she said, “raising costs on consumers, and handing America’s manufacturing advantage to our competitors.”

“This industry has proven what’s possible when businesses have the certainty to invest,” Hopper said. “If the administration does not reverse its harmful actions that have undermined market certainty, energy costs will rise even further, and the next wave of factories and jobs could be at risk.”

How it works

Solar energy, which was initially developed in the late 1800s, essentially works by converting energy from the sun into power, which produces both electricity and heat.

Solar panels, installed on a rooftop or in a utility-scale array, are generally silicon-based within a metal frame and glass casing. When this material is exposed to photons of sunlight, it releases electrons and produces an electric charge. The current is then converted for use in homes and businesses or to power the electric grid.

The rapid expansion of large-scale solar farms and smaller installations on rooftops in recent years has largely been driven by falling costs for the technology. China, one of the world’s largest solar producers, has pushed the cost of panels down by almost 90% over the past decade, according to energy analysts.

Globally, solar capacity is set to double by 2030, with China, India and other countries leading the charge through massive utility-scale projects and creative financing models.

Meanwhile, major corporations such as Amazon, Tesla and Target are scaling solar quickly to lower their operating costs and reduce their carbon footprint. Amazon is the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewables, with more than 600 wind and solar projects in the works nationwide, according to the company’s website.

As the technology itself improves, wind and solar are offering some of the cheapest and fastest ways to provide electric power, supporters say.

Administrative priorities

Experts say the industry faces darkening skies as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress roll back clean energy tax credits and throw up roadblocks to renewable energy projects, which threatens to leave the United States behind other countries in the shift to solar power and renewables.

Trump has moved to scuttle major wind and solar energy projects since he returned to the White House in January.

Trump’s hand-picked Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued a series of orders earlier this year to restrict solar and wind development, including changing the criteria for evaluating renewable energy projects on federal lands, requiring that the Interior secretary personally approve each project.

“Based on common sense, arithmetic and physics, wind and solar projects are highly inefficient uses of federal lands,” Burgum said in a statement, claiming it will “level the playing field for dispatchable, cost-effective and secure energy sources,” such as “clean” coal and natural gas.

Meanwhile, Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” Act, signed in July, mandates oil and gas lease sales, fast-tracks environmental reviews and opens millions of acres of public land for coal leasing and terminates incentives for solar power, including one that offered homeowners a federal tax credit of up to $10,500 for installing rooftop solar panels.

Many companies with projects in the works are scrambling to install solar panels, wind turbines and batteries the size of shipping containers before federal tax credits expire or become harder to claim. Solar projects must break ground by July to be eligible for tax credits that Congress voted to eliminate years earlier than previously planned.

In August, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pulled the plug on the $7 billion Solar for All program, approved by Congress in 2023 as part of the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act to expand solar power to low-income households.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called it a “boondoggle” that’s “rife with grift” from unscrupulous companies taking cuts from the federally funded grants. The move prompted federal lawsuits from states, labor unions and the solar industry.

Among the companies impacted by the grant freeze is Groundswell, a nonprofit that works in several Southern states, including Georgia, Mississippi and Alabama, which was expecting $156 million. To date, the group has broken ground on 24 megawatts of solar projects worth more than $20 million that benefit low-income households.

“There’s a lot at stake,” Groundswell CEO Michelle Moore said in a statement. “These projects — located in small towns across seven states, all of which were sited in partnership with the local community — now hang in the balance.”

‘No going back’

Environmentalists say, despite the pushback by the Trump administration, the economics of solar are strong and it has proven itself as a valuable renewable energy to help reduce excess greenhouse gas emissions that scientists say are contributing to a warmer planet, fueling devastating storms and rising seas.

“Globally, there is no going back on this,” Kate Sinding Daly, vice president for law and policy at the New England-based Conservation Law Foundation. “Wind and solar are the future of renewable energy. The momentum may be slowed in this country, but it’s not going to be reversed.”

The solar power movement has plenty of critics who argue the full-throttled embrace of clean energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will ultimately drive up consumer costs, cause rolling blackouts and won’t provide enough electricity to meet demands, among other criticisms.

Lisa Linowes, a New Hampshire-based energy policy analyst, argues that states such as California, New York and Massachusetts are pushing through policies aimed at encouraging the expansion of green energy, which are hurting energy consumers, driving up costs and putting increased pressure on the nation’s electric grid.

“The public is largely in the dark about what’s happening with renewable energy,” she said. “The states and environmentalists who are pushing for a net-zero environment are telling everyone that wind and solar are the cheapest forms of electricity. But the reality is it’s cost-prohibitive, and we just don’t have the land for it.”

One way states are trying to accelerate the shift to solar power through net-metering programs, which allow consumers who install rooftop solar on their homes to pay lower rates for electricity for sharing power with the regional grid. Some states require utilities to buy the electricity generated by solar power at retail prices.

But Linowes and other critics say those programs are largely benefiting homeowners who can afford to install rooftop solar, with ratepayers who aren’t benefiting directly from net-metering picking up the tab. Those costs have added to utility bills in regions such as the northeast, which already has some of the highest energy costs in the nation.

“Net-metering is one of the largest portions of a utility bill in Massachusetts and other states with these programs,” Linowes said. “These policies are hurting energy consumers.”

A recent report by the Fiscal Alliance Foundation, Americans for Prosperity Foundation and other conservative groups looked at six New England states’ decarbonization plans and said it would cost the states $815 billion collectively through 2050, with the average household paying nearly $100 more a year for electricity.

Commercial employers would see their costs rise by about $489 per year, while industrial manufacturing customers would see their electric bills increase by an average of almost $5,280 per year, according to the report. The report’s authors called on policymakers to focus on expanding access to natural gas and other cheaper, reliable sources of energy.

“We should be focusing on a common sense and realistic approach to make energy more affordable for everyone — including investing in reliable and affordable energy sources and avoiding money wasted on these rebate programs and subsidies for expensive and unreliable alternative energy,” said Paul Craney, the Fiscal Alliance’s executive director.

There has been a sharp increase nationally in communities’ resistance to host a data center.
Data Center Watch, a company that tracks data center opposition, found from May 2024 to March 2025, local opposition had blocked or delayed a total of $64 billion in data center projects, with six blocked entirely and 10 delayed.
Carbon capture and sequestration is a relatively new technology used to sequester carbon dioxide emissions.
The carbon dioxide will be collected via an absorption process, compressed, and then injected into Class VI injection wells.","Residents of West Virginia are seeking answers to their questions about proposed data centers/ power plants in their communities. These include a 500-acre data center in Tucker County, the 150-acre ammonia plant and 200,000-square-foot data center which are part of the Adams Fork Energy project on the Logan-Mingo county line, and the Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) project in Mason County. The center proposed in Mason County will “include a power plant, hydrogen production facility, carbon dioxide storage facility, and data center complex.”

There are no federal regulations concerning data centers. However, “in April, Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed House Bill 2014, a law designed to ease in-state data center development in part by prohibiting counties and municipalities from enforcing or adopting regulations that limit creation, development, or operation of any certified microgrid district or high-impact data center project.” Morrisey hailed HB 2014 as the economic development highlight of the West Virginia Legislature’s 2025 regular legislative session.

Unlike politicians, citizens in the state are not convinced that these centers will bring significant economic prosperity to the region. There has been a sharp increase nationally in communities’ resistance to host a data center. Data Center Watch, a company that tracks data center opposition, found from May 2024 to March 2025, local opposition had blocked or delayed a total of $64 billion in data center projects, with six blocked entirely and 10 delayed. From March to June of 2025, $98 billion worth of projects were blocked or delayed. There were over 1,600 citizen comments and most were against the gas turbine-powered data center operation in Tucker County.

Citizens are worried about several issues when it comes to data enters: increases in energy costs, increases in water usage, exposure to toxic substances, and loss of jobs due to Artificial Intelligence (AI). Some projections show that data center energy consumption could double or triple by 2028, accounting for up to 12% of U.S. electricity use. About 56 percent of the electricity used to power data centers is sourced from fossil fuels, and for our region that will mean more fracking for methane gas. Significant amounts of water are needed for cooling purposes. “A study by the International Energy Agency estimates for illustration that a 100-megawatt U.S. data center would consume roughly the same amount of water as 2,600 households.” Additionally, these data centers also use large quantities of PFAS-gas or f-gas chemicals in the cooling phase and in manufacturing some semiconductors. These compounds have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease, and a range of other serious health problems. Finally, citizens fear job losses as AI takes over many entry level positions. “Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a May Axios interview that AI could eliminate half of all entry-level, white-collar jobs within the next five years.”

President Trump is considering an executive order directing the Justice Department to override local regulations and state control of data centers and AI.

The project in Mason County is a “Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage,” and will span 2300 acres when completed and will be powered by burning wood chips. The air permit states 106 tons of wood chips per hour will be combusted. The first question that might come to mind is what trees will be cleared to supply 106 tons per hour? Possibly from the Wayne National Forest which is located just across the river in Ohio.

The air permit for Mason County, which has already been submitted to the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection, shows the levels of hazardous air pollutants will be 24 tons per year. This plant, as well as the Mingo County facility, will be employing carbon dioxide capturing technology. According to a review of the permit for the Mason County plant, “The carbon capture unit has the potential to emit VOC and volatile organic hazardous air pollutants (HAPS) from the carbon capture unit. These HAPs emissions are in the form of nitrosamines, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde.” These compounds are classified as probable human carcinogens.

Carbon capture and sequestration is a relatively new technology used to sequester carbon dioxide emissions. The carbon dioxide will be collected via an absorption process, compressed, and then injected into Class VI injection wells. Since these wells will be off-site, pipelines will be used to transport the supercritical fluid from the Mason site to the wells.

Currently, the United State Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for permitting Class VI wells. However, West Virginia is one of a few states that has applied for and received primacy to regulate Class VI wells at the state level. Part of the application process requires documented proof that public participation activities were solicited prior to submission of the permit application.

Carbon dioxide, a known asphyxiant, is a dense gas and considered to be hazardous by the OSHA Hazard Communications Standard (29 CFR). It is physiologically active, and affects circulation and breathing. It can accumulate in topographically low areas under conditions of low wind and can travel large distances when released from a ruptured pipeline. It is injected at 1000 psi and can expand to 500 times its volume when exposed to atmospheric pressures. This was evidenced in the pipeline rupture in Satartia, Miss., which sent 45 people to the hospital. How will the mostly volunteer fire departments in West Virginia be able to handle a pipeline break or a leaking Class VI well?

Once again, the communities of West Virginia are being targeted by big out-of-state industries that will make money at the expense of the environment and citizens’ health. Sadly, as usual, the state politicians are welcoming data centers and new power plants which means more extraction and water usage with a promise of questionable local jobs.

Green Amendments Could Fix That - Atmos Magazine,Atmos,,,,,https://atmos.earth/climate-solutions/the-us-constitution-left-out-nature-green-amendments-could-fix-that/,"It is a system that accepts and legalizes environmental pollution and degradation through regulatory reviews and permits.
Green Amendments further require that environmental rights be protected equitably for all communities, regardless of race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.
Green Amendments empower people to raise their expectations of government and to advocate more firmly and confidently for environmental protection.
Currently, there are three states with constitutional Green Amendments in place: Pennsylvania, Montana, and New York.
Recognizing the need for transformational change when it comes to environmental protection, and inspired by the progress Green Amendments can and do achieve, over 20 additional states are working with Green Amendments for the Generations, the nonprofit I founded, to secure the powerful protections these Amendments offer.","Across the United States, our state and federal constitutions recognize and protect many cherished rights and freedoms: our right to free speech, to peaceably assemble, to the safety and sanctity of our property, and even to bear arms. But in an oversight of history, these constitutions typically do not recognize the right to drink clean water or breathe clean air, or the right to a safe climate and healthy environment. Instead, these fundamental human rights are entrusted to an imperfect political system in which money, power, and special interests often take precedence over justice and basic human needs—and in which partisan advantage is often more important than facts, science, or human life.

That’s why I believe it’s time to add a Green Amendment to every state constitution in the country.

Rather than recognize a constitutional entitlement to a clean, safe, and healthy environment, here in the U.S., we protect our environment through a patchwork system of legislation and regulation. These laws and regulations are created by a political system dominated by money, partisanship, and narrow concentrations of social and economic influence that actually benefit (financially or politically) from environmental degradation. The resulting system of environmental protection is fundamentally flawed.

Under this system, environmental pollution and degradation is something to be managed, moderated, or mitigated after the fact rather than recognized as a harm that can and should be prevented. It is a system that accepts and legalizes environmental pollution and degradation through regulatory reviews and permits. The law also contains many critical gaps in which environmental harms are not addressed until it is too late, or sometimes not addressed at all.

(For an example, look no further than PFAS, also known as forever chemicals: a man-made family of chemicals left unregulated for so long that they now permeate our environment and have found their way into our drinking water, food supply, and bodies, with devastating health and financial consequences.)

This approach means that when these laws fail to ensure needed environmental protections, impacted people generally have little recourse other than to protest or seek better candidates in the next political election, when it is often too late and irreparable damage has been done.

Moreover, this approach of “protection by statute” means that the burdens of environmental pollution—toxic air, contaminated water, and the growing impacts of the climate crisis—often fall most heavily on those whom the political process ignores. Historical and present-day inequities mean that the worst of these impacts are often concentrated in communities of color, Indigenous communities, and/or low-income communities. And the fact that even low levels of pollution disproportionately harm children, including those developing in utero, means that future generations often bear the brunt of this flawed system.

Not only is this approach—which places the burdens of environmental pollution on those it deliberately excludes from the political process—morally abhorrent; it is economically foolish. The near- and long-term effects of exposure to pollution makes us all more vulnerable to disease and economic hardship. Exposure to environmental contaminants causes a range of health harms that include asthma, heart disease, dementia, and cancers of all kinds. The cognitive effects of lead poisoning are perhaps best known, but polluted environments can have a myriad of lasting effects on a person’s learning abilities. The destruction of ecosystems around the country, as well as our climate more broadly, is subjecting our communities to the rising threat of floods, droughts, wildfires, disease, deadly heat, and more.

All of this costs us money through reduced human potential and economic activity, lost property values, resources required for emergency response services, disaster relief, and health care. At the same time, this environmental desecration deprives us of the emotional, physical, and psychological well-being that only time in nature can provide.

Environmental degradation also undermines our fundamental freedoms. Neurotoxins and other environmental contaminants undermine the right to a quality education, and the disproportionate impacts of water, air, and soil pollution undermine the right to equal treatment under the law. The right to fish, hunt, and trap found in many state constitutions is being stymied by the loss of healthy habitat and species decline caused by mistreatment of natural resources. The safety and sanctity of our homes, and the property rights to which we are constitutionally entitled, are undermined when pollution crosses property or state lines or climate change-fueled disasters destroy our towns and cities. And the health impacts of outdoor air pollution, including asthma attacks or heart conditions, limit our other fundamental rights.

As former Pennsylvania state Sen. Franklin Kury famously said, “Freedom of speech will be meaningless if we suffocate on polluted air.”

Constitutional Green Amendments transform this legal paradigm, adding overarching protections that explicitly empower our people and our government to more effectively protect the environment, while proactively preventing its degradation.

Green Amendments, as I have defined them, are constitutional amendments added to the Bill of Rights section of our state constitutions, which recognize and protect the inalienable rights of all people, including future generations, to pure water, clean air, a safe climate, and healthy environments. By virtue of their placement in these Bills of Rights (called a Declaration of Rights in some states) and their carefully crafted language, Green Amendments put environmental rights on an equal constitutional footing with other civil, human, and political rights.

As with these other fundamental freedoms, Green Amendments require all government officials within a state—elected, appointed, and regulatory, as well as those working at the state, county, or local level—to affirmatively consider environmental rights and prioritize their protection in all decision-making. Green Amendments further require that environmental rights be protected equitably for all communities, regardless of race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. And they require that natural resources be protected generationally, helping to ensure that future generations have the healthy environment they need to lead safe and prosperous lives.

Green Amendments empower people to raise their expectations of government and to advocate more firmly and confidently for environmental protection. When there is a legal gap in environmental protection or implementation that results in dangerous environmental harm, these amendments provide explicit constitutional language that can be relied upon to secure needed protection. When government officials fail to fulfill their constitutional duty, or when the laws as written, interpreted, and applied fail to honor the environmental rights of the people or the obligation of the government to protect the state’s natural resources, Green Amendments provide a powerful tool to compel protection in court.

When it comes to the environment, states have a tremendous amount of authority. While the federal government can obligate states to provide a basic level of environmental protection, states have the authority to do more to protect their residents. Passing a constitutional obligation on all government officials within a state to protect environmental rights equitably and preserve natural resources for both present and future generations can secure a higher level of environmental care than that afforded by federal law. While a federal Green Amendment will ultimately be needed in order to ensure our Congress, president, federal judges and regulatory agencies honor and protect our environmental rights, state-level constitutional action is especially meaningful and accessible in the near term.

Currently, there are three states with constitutional Green Amendments in place: Pennsylvania, Montana, and New York. In Pennsylvania, the amendment was used to restore the authority of local governments to protect residential communities from industrial fracking operations and to restore the obligation of fossil fuel fracking operations to comply with environmental protection standards. In Montana, it was the presence of a Green Amendment that allowed 16 youth to successfully restore the right and obligation of government officials to consider the climate-changing implications of their decisions. New York’s amendment is only a few years old, but it is already being used by communities to secure protection of their air, water, and public natural open spaces. Across the board, these amendments are being used to advance and secure people’s rights to drinking water free from toxic contamination, open space and the immense benefit it has for their communities, ecosystems and wildlife that enrich their lives, and farmland that’s free from contaminants that can render crops and livestock unusable.

Moreover, Green Amendments are being used to rein in and mitigate serious consequences that stem from air pollution and are helping corral industries like oil and gas that inflict devastating consequences on our people and environment. At the same time, these amendments provide powerful support to environmentally friendly industries, such as wind and solar, and can boost ecologically supportive development that provides jobs and bolsters economic prosperity.

Recognizing the need for transformational change when it comes to environmental protection, and inspired by the progress Green Amendments can and do achieve, over 20 additional states are working with Green Amendments for the Generations, the nonprofit I founded, to secure the powerful protections these Amendments offer.

The Green Amendment movement is a solution whose time has come, and it’s one that transcends political party, generation, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.

In a moment when many are disillusioned by U.S. politics and our government’s inability to achieve essential environmental protections, the Green Amendment movement is leveraging the most powerful tools our democracy has—our state and federal constitutions—to secure environmental rights, environmental justice, natural resources protection, and generational security. By passing Green Amendments in every state, we can make sure that our environment, our health, and our lives are protected for generations to come.",https://atmos.earth/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ATMOS12_A-Green-Amendment-for-Every-State_SilvanaTrevale_05_hor-1280x720.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 04:57:27.645356

In an effort to improve and prioritise energy efficiency while also reducing costs and emissions, Google is introducing its self-service Energy Assessment Tool (EAT). The platform is engineered to give facility managers the ability to perform preliminary energy assessments without requiring specialist expertise or incurring on-site expenses.

Many manufacturers could achieve substantial cost savings and emissions reductions through energy efficiency improvements, yet they often face barriers. These can include the high cost of engaging energy assessment consultants, limited capital for efficiency projects, and a lack of in-house energy management expertise.

Such challenges frequently prevent the implementation of simple high-impact projects. The EAT aims to break down these obstacles.

Accelerating climate action and cost reduction

To help overcome these challenges, EAT is offered as a free platform for manufacturing facility and plant managers. It is designed to identify energy-saving opportunities and accelerate progress toward both cost reductions and climate action.

The tool provides actionable insights without the need for deep energy management knowledge or expensive on-site assessments.

By inputting basic facility data, users can receive customised recommendations that cover more than 20 system areas, including air compressors, boilers, chillers, and lighting.

“We’re launching a tool that I wish I had access to early in my career as a sustainability leader,"" explains Kate Brandt, Chief Sustainability Officer at Google, on LinkedIn.

“By equipping our partners with the right resources we can accelerate progress reduce costs and build a more efficient and resilient supply chain for everyone.”

To support its adoption across key manufacturing regions, the tool is available in several languages, including Chinese (simplified and traditional), Thai, Vietnamese, and English. Individual supplier energy assessment data is kept secure and confidential.

The EAT is built and managed by a third party and has been reviewed by Google to ensure it meets stringent privacy and security standards. This allows suppliers to decide which partners to collaborate with and what summary data to share, such as total potential savings.

Wider sustainable energy goals

The tool is part of Google's broader strategy to integrate sustainable energy use across its operations and supply chain with a focus on energy, the circular economy, consumer hardware, water and nature.

As a large corporate buyer of clean energy, Google procures substantial volumes of renewable power while also investing in advanced nuclear, enhanced geothermal, and grid-enhancing technologies to support future innovation.

In 2020, Google launched its third decade of climate action, which included a target to reach net-zero emissions across its operations and value chain by 2030. This is supported by an ambition to run entirely on 24/7 carbon-free energy on every grid where Google operates.

Google also works to design out waste and increase material reuse in its data centres, which are among the most efficient in the world.

Taxpayers will foot the bills for the environmental, economic, and health costs from Ohio’s refusal to embrace the real clean, green renewable energy sources: solar and wind.","Dear Editor,

Unlike our neighboring states of Michigan and Illinois, Ohio’s politicians have not embraced the economic and environmental benefits that solar and wind energy provide. Instead, Ohio’s politicians passed Senate Bill 52, where communities can effectively block solar and wind projects, something that communities cannot do when it comes to fossil fuel development.

Ohio’s energy bill HB15, which passed in May of this year, was stripped of several pro-solar provisions, including a community solar program. This program would have helped poor communities access solar energy.

During the past nine months, the Trump administration has mounted a blatant attack on renewable energy by rolling back environmental laws and policies favoring renewables, canceling incentives enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, and halting projects even when in construction.

Just when you think you’ve heard it all, Ohio’s Republican politicians have yet again come up with another way to kill renewable energy projects and promote the non-renewable fossil fuel gas: methane. HB 294 would grant “clean energy status” to methane gas.

This could mean gas projects might get preferential treatment over true renewable energy projects when it comes to permits by the Ohio Power Siting Board.

Unlike solar and wind energy, methane is a climate changing gas itself, and when burned produces carbon dioxide, another climate changing gas. “Sen. George Lang, one of the Republican co-sponsors, said in committee that natural gas is a cleaner energy source than coal.” That’s not saying much. Sen. Mark Romanchuk, a Richland County Republican and co-sponsor, remarked that building the infrastructure needed for solar- and wind-produced emissions, but he conveniently failed to mention the emissions created to construct a well pad and all the infrastructure needed to support the process.

According to a report by the World Nuclear Association, comparison of life-cycle CO2 emissions from all energy sources shows that fracked gas produces the third highest amount of CO2 with 490 grams of CO2 per kW hr. Utility scale solar produces 48 grams, residential solar produces 41 and wind are the lowest life-cycle emitters at 11 grams per kW hr. The life-cycle emissions from fracked gas include those produced from the extraction process which includes the gas (drilling), well pad and road construction, petrochemicals used to frack, compression and transportation of gas to LNG facilities and export transportation out of the country.

Additionally, the fracking process also requires enormous amounts of water and produces millions of gallons or toxic radioactive brine. Harrison County saw 853 million gallons of surface water withdrawn for fracking in 2023. That represents 78% of the total water usage in the county. Wind and solar energy have a significantly lower carbon and water footprint. Calling fracked gas “clean” is laughable.

At the same time politicians are wanting to declare “fracked” gas clean, they are working on legislation (HB 170 and SB 136) to give the Ohio Department of Natural Resources primacy over carbon dioxide capture and sequestration Class VI wells.

If passed, millions of tons of carbon emissions will be injected underneath Ohio land.

Taxpayers will be paying the tax incentives of $85 per ton of industrial CO2 captured and stored, according to the One Big Beautiful Bill.

Both HB 170 and SB 136 tramp on private property rights by allowing “forced pooling,” which means that land owners could be forced into allowing the injection of carbon dioxide under their private property.

The next assault on property owners may be the construction of pipelines to carry carbon dioxide across the state from industrial facilities to the injection wells; planned for Carroll, Jefferson, and Harrison counties. Mid-western states have already seen significant pushbacks from land owners who are being forced to allow pipelines to cross their farms and communities via the use of eminent domain.

Iowa residents have been fighting Summit Carbon Solutions’ pipeline for several years. In addition, Summit Carbon Solutions’ planned route through South Dakota to North Dakota has been blocked as the company was banned from using eminent domain to take property.

Will Ohio’s citizens be dealing with this legal battle as Ohio politicians invite the CCS industry into the state?

Recently, S. 2975, the federal “PIPELINE Safety Act of 2025,” passed by voice vote. It is a bipartisan effort to reauthorize the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration’s safety programs until 2030. This law would also set regulations for carbon dioxide pipelines. Environmental groups worry that the industry has had too much influence and point out the deficiencies that could lead to another accident like the one that occurred in 2020 in Satartia, Mississippi, where 45 people were overcome by CO2 leaking from a ruptured pipeline. These concerns included: lack of odorization of CO2 so releases are detectable by smell; performance-based leak detection and rupture mitigation; contaminant controls to help prevent CO2 related corrosion; and prevention of the conversion of oil or gas pipelines to CO2 pipelines.

Taxpayers will foot the bills for the environmental, economic, and health costs from Ohio’s refusal to embrace the real clean, green renewable energy sources: solar and wind.

The U.S. Energy Association has said, “Wind and solar power are two of the fastest-growing energy sectors in the U.S. and produced as much as 17% of the country’s electricity last year.” Yet, Ohio politicians continue to push “dirty” fracked gas down our throats.

They are either willfully ignorant or out of touch with reality.

The United States electric commercial vehicle (ECV) market was valued at USD 13.88 Billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 55.92 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 26.41%. The market is experiencing robust growth due to rising environmental concerns, stringent emission regulations, and the growing adoption of clean energy solutions.

Businesses are prioritizing sustainability, driving the demand for ECVs across logistics, delivery, and public transportation sectors. Government incentives and subsidies, including tax credits for purchasing electric vehicles, have further propelled market expansion. According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), there were over 12,000 electric medium- and heavy-duty vehicles operating in the U.S. as of Q4 2023. This includes delivery vans, trucks, and buses, reflecting a nearly 35% increase year-over-year in deployment.

The development of advanced battery technologies has enhanced vehicle efficiency and reduced operating costs, making ECVs increasingly attractive for commercial applications. The growing awareness of corporate social responsibility among companies encourages investments in cleaner fleet options. Key trends in the market include advancements in battery technology, such as solid-state batteries offering greater energy density and faster charging times.

The integration of smart connectivity features, including telematics and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, is transforming fleet management and optimizing operational efficiency. Emerging technologies, such as hydrogen fuel cells, are also gaining traction, especially for long-haul commercial applications. The shift toward autonomous electric vehicles is creating opportunities for cost reduction and enhanced safety in logistics operations. Collaborations between automotive manufacturers and technology firms are accelerating innovation, while fleet electrification strategies by major logistics companies are bolstering market growth.

Market drivers

Government incentives and regulations

The United States has implemented a series of policies to accelerate the adoption of ECVs. Incentives such as tax credits, grants, and rebates for fleet operators and vehicle manufacturers reduce the upfront cost of adopting ECVs. Stringent emissions regulations encourage a shift away from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) and federal initiatives like the Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) program mandate fleet electrification, making ECVs essential for regulatory compliance. These measures provide a stable demand for ECVs, particularly among logistics and public transportation operators seeking sustainable and regulatory-compliant solutions. For instance, in 2023 leasing models allowed electric cars to qualify for relaxed commercial vehicle tax credits. Savings were passed to leaseholders, boosting EV adoption. This strategy supported sustained rollouts.

Key market challenges

High upfront costs

The initial cost of electric commercial vehicles remains a barrier despite declining battery prices. ECVs are generally more expensive than their ICE counterparts due to the cost of advanced batteries and associated technologies. Fleet operators often face budget constraints that make the transition to ECVs challenging, particularly for small businesses.

Even with incentives, the total cost of ownership (TCO) calculation, factoring in charging infrastructure and maintenance, can deter adoption. Addressing these financial barriers requires scalable production and economies of scale to further reduce manufacturing costs.

Key market trends

Adoption of electric delivery vans and trucks

The increasing focus on last-mile delivery efficiency is driving the adoption of electric delivery vans and trucks. Companies in the logistics and retail sectors are prioritizing these vehicles for urban deliveries to reduce emissions and operational costs.

According to the North American Council for Freight Efficiency (NACFE), electric delivery vans used by fleets such as FedEx and UPS demonstrated 30% to 50% lower total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to internal combustion vehicles in urban use cases.

“Carney’s deal with Danielle Smith is the sellout of the century: scrapping climate legislation for a pipeline that will never be built,” said Lewis, a veteran journalist and climate activist.
“Despite this difficult economic context, I remain one of those for whom environmental issues must remain front and center,” Guilbeault said in a statement.
“Over the past few months, several elements of the climate action plan I worked on as Minister of the Environment have been, or are about to be, dismantled,” he said.
“The pipeline to BC would have to cross some of the most challenging terrain in Canada.","First Nations groups backed by environmental and conservationist allies in Canada are denouncing a pipeline and tanker infrastructure agreement announced Thursday between Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney and Conservative Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, calling the deal a betrayal and promising to fight against its implementation tooth and nail.

“We will use every tool in our toolbox to ensure that this pipeline does not go ahead,” said Heiltsuk Nation Chief Marilyn Slett in response to the Carney-Smith deal that would bring tens of millions of barrels of tar sands oil from Alberta to the coast of British Columbia for export by building new pipeline and lifting a moratorium against oil tankers operating in fragile British Columbia coastal water.

While Carney, who argues that the pipeline is in Canada’s economic interest, had vowed to secure the support of First Nations before finalizing any agreement with the Alberta, furious reactions to the deal made it clear that promise was not met.

Xhaaidlagha Gwaayaai, the president of the Haida nation, was emphatic: “This project is not going to happen.”

The agreement, according to the New York Times, is part of Carney’s “plan to curb Canada’s trade dependence on the United States, swings Canadian policy away from measures meant to fight climate change to focus instead on growing the oil and gas industry.”

In a statement, the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs (UBCIC) “loudly” voiced its opposition to the memorandum of understanding signed by Carney and Smith.

“This MOU is nothing less than a high risk and deeply irresponsible agreement that sacrifices Indigenous peoples, coastal communities, and the environment for political convenience,” said Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, president of the UBCIC. “By explicitly endorsing a new bitumen pipeline to BC’s coast and promising to rewrite the Oil Tanker Moratorium Act, the federal government is resurrecting one of the most deeply flawed and divisive ideas in Canadian energy politics.”

Slett, who serves as secretary-treasurer of the UBCIC, said the agreement “was negotiated without the involvement of the very Nations who would shoulder those risks, and to suggest ‘Indigenous co-ownership’ of a pipeline while ignoring the clear opposition of Coastal First Nations is unacceptable.”

Avi Lewis, running for the leadership of the progressive New Democratic Party (NDP) in upcoming elections, decried the agreement as a failure of historic proportions.

“Carney’s deal with Danielle Smith is the sellout of the century: scrapping climate legislation for a pipeline that will never be built,” said Lewis, a veteran journalist and climate activist. “We need power lines, not pipelines. Our path is through climate leadership and building good jobs in the clean economy.”

In response to the deal, the minister of Canadian culture, Steven Guilbeault, who formerly served as environment minister under the previous Liberal administration, resigned in protest.

“Despite this difficult economic context, I remain one of those for whom environmental issues must remain front and center,” Guilbeault said in a statement.

“Over the past few months, several elements of the climate action plan I worked on as Minister of the Environment have been, or are about to be, dismantled,” he said. “In my view, these measures remain essential to our climate action plan.”

David Eby, the premier of British Columbia who opposes the new pipeline into his province and was not included in the discussions between Carney and Smith, echoed those who said the project is more dead than alive, despite the MOU, calling it a potential “energy vampire” that would distracts from better energy solutions that don’t carry all the baggage of this proposed project.

“With all of the variables that have yet to be fulfilled — no proponent, no route, no money, no First Nations support — that it cannot draw limited federal resources, limited Indigenous governance resources, limited provincial resources away from the real projects that will employ people,” Eby added.

Keith Brooks, the programs director at Environmental Defence, decried the deal as “worse than we had anticipated” and “a gift to the oil industry and Alberta Premier Smith, at the expense of practically everyone else.”

“Filling this pipeline and expansion would require more oil sands mining, leading to more carbon pollution, more tailings, and worse impacts for communities near the tar sands,” warned Brooks. “The pipeline to BC would have to cross some of the most challenging terrain in Canada. The impacts of construction would be severe, and the impacts of a spill, devastating.”

Jessica Green, a professor at the University of Toronto with a focus on environmental politics, equated the “reckless” deal to a “climate dumpster fire” and called the push for more tar sands pipelines in Canada “the energy equivalent [of] investing in VHS tapes in 2025.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2248007232-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 12:02:42.880368

The DOE had requested proposals Oct. 21 of suppliers interested in selling 1 million barrels of sour crude oil produced in the United States for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The petroleum would be provided to one of the DOE’s SPR sites.

The U.S. government has oil reserves in large underground salt caverns at four sites along the Gulf coast: two each in Texas and Louisiana. President Gerald Ford established the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 1975 to shield the U.S. from oil shortages in an energy crisis.

The DOE announced winning suppliers on Nov. 12 for both contracts totaling $55.7 million. Deliveries are to start from Dec. 1 through Jan. 31 at the Bryan Mound SPR in Texas. The agency stated that six companies submitted 18 offers to supply the crude oil.

“President Trump promised to protect America’s energy security by refilling and managing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve more responsibly,” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, noted in a press statement. “Awarding these contracts marks another step in the important process of refilling this national security asset. While this process won’t be complete overnight, these actions are an important step in strengthening our energy security and reversing the costly and irresponsible energy policies of the last administration.”

The largest contract (for some 600 million barrels) went to Trafigura Trading LLC (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Trafigura Group Pte Ltd). The other DOE contract was signed for 300 million barrels with Energy Transfer Crude Marketing LLC.

With a combined authorized storage capacity of 714 million barrels, the SPRs consist of the:

Bryan Mound—in Brazoria County, 65 miles south of Houston,

Big Hill—in Jefferson County, 26 miles southwest of Beaumont, Texas,

West Hockberry—in Cameron Parish, 25 miles southwest of Lake Charles, La., and

Bayou Choctaw—in Iberville Parish, 12 miles southwest of Baton Rouge, La.

“Decisions to withdraw crude oil in the event of an energy emergency are made by the President under the authority of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act and done through a competitive sale. The SPR is always drawdown-ready, which means it stands ready to release crude oil to the market within 13 days of Presidential direction; this is the time it takes to conduct the sales process, award contracts and to arrange the logistics for oil transportation,” according to DOE.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/692a624bc926253a1cf05745/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-11-28 22:58:13.849635

Leakage and ground-fault protection

Automatic charging interruption under abnormal conditions

Durability testing for long-term high-load operation

With safety concerns increasingly discussed among EV owners, EVDANCE’s emphasis on transparent certification is aligned with broader 2025 consumer expectations.

EVDANCE 2025 Charger Lineup: Three Models for Different Home Setups

12A Level 1 Charger — Universal Compatibility with Standard Outlets

EVDANCE’s 12A Level 1 charger uses the common NEMA 5-15 household outlet, making it ideal for EV owners living in apartments, older homes, or rental properties. It requires no electrician, provides overnight charging, and is available in both NACS (Tesla-compatible) and J1772 versions. Despite being the entry-level option, it meets full UL2594 and ETL requirements for daily home use.

24A Level 2 Charger — Faster Charging Using Existing Dryer Outlets

The 24A portable Level 2 charger is designed for homeowners seeking faster charging without installing a dedicated EV charging station. Supporting both NEMA 14-30 and NEMA 10-30 outlets, the charger is compatible with most dryer connections found in U.S. households. It delivers up to 5.76 kW, adding approximately 20–25 miles of range per hour, and is available for both Tesla NACS and J1772-equipped vehicles.

40A Level 2 Smart Charger — High Power with Full App Control

EVDANCE’s flagship 40A charger connects via a NEMA 14-50 outlet and delivers up to 9.6 kW, providing one of the fastest home charging experiences in its class. A built-in smart app allows users to monitor charging status, schedule sessions for off-peak hours, track energy usage, and review charging history. The unit features an IP66 water-resistant design and a 25-foot cable, offering durability and flexibility for indoor and outdoor use.

Across all models, EVDANCE chargers include intelligent temperature monitoring, surge protection, and rugged enclosures designed to withstand year-round weather conditions.

Black Friday 2025 Promotion: 20% Off + Free Adapter

To support new EV owners preparing their homes for winter charging, EVDANCE announced its most significant promotion of the season:

20% OFF + Free Adapter

Code: 20EVDBLACK

Link: https://evdances.com/discount/20EVDBLACK?utm_source=20EVDBLACK

This promotion applies to all EV chargers across NACS and J1772 versions, and is available for a limited time during the Black Friday period.

An EVDANCE spokesperson commented,

“Our mission is to provide EV owners with safe, certified, and easy-to-use charging solutions. As more drivers make the switch to electric vehicles in 2025, we want to ensure they have access to high-quality chargers backed by industry-leading safety standards. Our Black Friday promotion is designed to help more families upgrade their home charging setup with confidence.”

Industry Trends: Portable, Certified Chargers Becoming the New Standard

According to EVDANCE, interest in portable Level 2 chargers is rising faster than traditional wall-mounted charging stations. As homeowners seek flexible, installation-free solutions that work with existing outlets, the demand for certified portable chargers has surged.

After conducting surveys across the city with a special focus on the west side, which disproportionately experiences the effects of pollution, the city found that Salt Lakers’ top environmental concerns are drought and air quality.
Salt Lake City is in the top three metro areas in the country for urban heat island intensity, with the west side of the city feeling those effects more strongly, Wyffels said.
Seasons in Salt Lake City are getting hotter, Nicholas said.
Utah has also criticized the federal air quality regulations, even disputing Environmental Protection Agency air quality rules in court.","While the federal government steps away from climate agreements, Salt Lake City is reiterating its commitment to become more sustainable ahead of the 2034 Olympic Games with a 2040 deadline to achieve goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.

In an update presented to the Salt Lake City Council on Tuesday, the city’s Sustainability Department highlighted milestones, including a major one — the city’s greenhouse gas emissions fell 11% from 2009 to 2024, said Catherine Wyffels, air quality and environmental program manager at the department.

“This is primarily due to a shift to cleaner energy sources,” Wyffels said in a presentation. “So while this 11% may not seem like much, it’s important to remember that it happened during a period of a lot of growth.”

Per capita emissions also declined 25% in the same period, she said. But there’s still a long way to go to meet the city’s climate goals.

After conducting surveys across the city with a special focus on the west side, which disproportionately experiences the effects of pollution, the city found that Salt Lakers’ top environmental concerns are drought and air quality.

“People are interested in anything they can do in their homes to save under utility bills,” she said. “A lot of support for clean renewable energy for both homes and businesses. People like street trees in their neighborhoods, and then also a lot of support for increased access to transit, walking and biking infrastructure.”

All of those are solutions to the city’s primary climate risks, which according to the Sustainability Department, are driven by rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns.

The report presented to the City Council is still preliminary and is scheduled for an update next spring. Whenever it’s done, the city hopes it can help trace a path to achieve its goal to be 100% powered by renewable energy by 2030 and cutting 80% of emissions by 2040.

Salt Lake City is in the top three metro areas in the country for urban heat island intensity, with the west side of the city feeling those effects more strongly, Wyffels said. Urban development amid continued growth is expected to exacerbate the issue.

The city’s sustainability department also highlighted some achievements including an 80-megawatt solar farm that provides a lot of the city’s municipal energy and has saved around $1.5 million in electricity bills, said Sophia Nicholas, deputy director at the city’s Sustainability Department.

“We have a lot of the solutions at hand. We just need to have the wherewithal, political will, money, to implement them on a global basis,” Nicholas said. “And it is happening actually in other countries, but when you’re looking at our emissions profile in Salt Lake City in particular, about half of it comes from electricity, and that’s why it’s been so exciting to see that we have realized a reduction in our electric grid carbon intensity due to investments in a cleaner grid.”

Despite the progress there are still some issues. Seasons in Salt Lake City are getting hotter, Nicholas said. In the last 50 years, the average temperature in Utah has risen more than 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit, about twice the global average.

“That may not sound like much,” she said during the meeting, “but a few degrees change in the average temperature means our city and our region is and will continue to experience increasing drought, wildfires, flooding, extreme heat days and poor air quality.”

The city met federal air quality standards

For 15 years Salt Lake City and Provo, some of the densest cities in Utah were nonattainment areas for the Environmental Protection Agency’s 24-hour standards for fine particular matter pollution known as PM2.5. This month, however, the federal agency announced both municipalities were finally in compliance.

“The achievement of cleaner air in Utah resulted from extensive planning and collaboration among the public, industry, and various government levels, leading to significant investments and the implementation of 23 new rules targeting emissions from multiple sources,” Bryce Bird, director at the Utah Division of Air Quality, said in a statement.

He pointed to some efforts supported by the state Legislature, including incentives for retrofitting and replacing high-emission wood stoves and diesel vehicles, as well as transit updates and education campaigns.

However, in terms of energy, the state also modified its policy in 2024 to consider energy resources by listing these attributes in order of priority: adequate, reliable, dispatchable, affordable, sustainable, secure and clean. That law worried environmentalists, who said it could lead to the prioritization of coal and move the state away from a strong market of renewables.

Utah has also criticized the federal air quality regulations, even disputing Environmental Protection Agency air quality rules in court.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/120624_Air-Quality_05-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 00:58:23.083099

Coal powered our past, but our future lies in renewable energy – from the wind, from the waves, and from cleanly generated hydrogen. Just as Wales once sent its anthracite around the world, we’re now a net exporter of electricity.

Our 1,200km coastline is ideal for offshore wind generation, with three sites already operational. By 2030, wind will power four million households, creating 29,000 jobs and a £4.5billion economic impact.

We’ve developed the infrastructure to help energy innovators harness our abundant natural resources. Our marine test zones are valuable proving grounds for technologies that could help meet the world’s future energy needs, such as tidal power. And our two freeports, in Anglesey and South Wales, are helping to attract investment with tax incentives, streamlined customs processes and sites ready for development.

Compound semiconductors are vital to artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles, advanced medical devices – even the smartphone in your pocket.

Many of the chips are developed and manufactured in Wales, a nation with 40 years of semiconductor expertise. We’re home to the world’s first compound semiconductor cluster: a tight ecosystem of tech companies and specialist research centres, collaborating under the name of CSconnected.

Its capabilities make Wales a semiconductor one-stop shop, with businesses that span the entire supply chain – from wafer production and chip processing to equipment manufacturing and packaging, all in a concentrated area of South East Wales.

Our approach attracts top global players. In 2025, KLA opened a new 237,000 square foot R&D and manufacturing facility in Newport, supplying chip fabrication equipment to the world. Just five miles away, Vishay operates the UK’s largest semiconductor manufacturing plant.

Life sciences is the umbrella term for the study of living organisms and processes – and the use of this knowledge to improve people's lives.

More than 300 life sciences companies are tackling today’s healthcare challenges in Wales. They represent a vast range of specialisms, from genomics and advanced diagnostics to medical imaging – but all of them benefit from industry networks that tie the sector together.

For 30 years, MediWales has served as an independent life science network for Wales, connecting universities, businesses, care providers and the clinical community. Life Sciences Hub Wales, based in Cardiff, is another beacon of cross-sector co-operation, helping to develop the most promising breakthroughs for frontline use.

The Welsh Government is a vital spoke in our ecosystem, with national programmes in genomics, pathology, imaging and advanced therapies. Wales also has its own devolved National Health Service, granting access to high-quality anonymised healthcare data.

All this has earned Wales a global reputation in fast-moving markets such as medtech, diagnostics, regenerative medicine and cell therapy. It’s now a sector worth £2.8 billion, employing a skilled workforce of 13,000 people.

Wales has one of the fastest-growing digital economies outside London. Our tech sector is worth an estimated £8.5 billion, providing jobs for around 13,000 people. From challenger banks to cybersecurity innovators, it’s a dynamic, collaborative ecosystem.

Our universities are key partners, providing research and development capability, generating spin-out companies, and producing graduates with the skills to keep the sector growing.

More than 30 incubators and accelerators transform ideas into thriving businesses. They include Tramshed Tech, which provides start-ups with flexible workspaces, mentoring and digital skills. The networking community FinTech Wales connects new businesses with both expertise and investment.

Indeed, FinTech is particularly strong in Wales – partly thanks to a buoyant financial services sector that employs more than 63,000 people. We’re a global leader in cybersecurity, too, with active North and South Wales cyber clusters and more than 150 companies developing the capabilities to protect critical computer systems.

Wales manufactures for the world. We export aircraft wings to France, cable systems to Japan, air conditioning units to the Middle East, and many more advanced products and components destined for markets around the globe.

In all, Wales is home to more than 5,000 manufacturing companies, with a workforce of over 150,000 people. Key subsectors include aerospace, automotive, precision engineering and robotics.

While manufacturing is anchored in our industrial heritage, it’s among our most forward-looking sectors. Since 2019, AMRC Cymru in North Wales – part of the University of Sheffield’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre – has been harnessing world-leading research to transform how the industry works.

South Wales is soon to have a new innovation hub of its own. The Global Centre of Rail Excellence will research and test out the technologies to build tomorrow’s railway networks – making transport better, faster and more sustainable throughout the UK and Europe.

Wales has graced the screen in international hits ranging from Doctor Who and Sherlock to His Dark Materials and Sex Education. Behind the camera, our film and TV industry is thriving, with world-class facilities to match our beautiful locations.

More than 90,000 people work in the creative industries, producing an annual turnover of £3.8 billion. They’re supported by Creative Wales, established by the Welsh Government to drive growth in film, TV, music, gaming and digital arts.

Our production facilities, such as Wolf Studios in Cardiff, can accommodate the greatest feats of imagination. They’re served by a constellation of specialists, dealing with everything from lighting hire to set design, post-production and VFX. And digital arts are booming, with games from independent developers like Wales Interactive entertaining millions around the world.",https://www.wales.com/sites/wales/files/styles/o_herostandard_fullwidth_xl_min_2x/public/media-library/2025-11/25893-n131-330-d-web-optimised-1920px.jpg.webp?itok=6w2CC8DS,N,,2025-11-29 05:58:36.860008

Three points of concerns included “unprecedented staffing crisis,” the Congressional Review Act (CRA) and proposed land sales.
The staffing crisis that BLM faces under the Trump administration was said to slows down planning and permitting processes.
“Senators also heard how the Bureau of Land Management is facing an unprecedented staffing crisis due to the Trump administration’s cuts,” Hamby said.
“Congress needs to step up on behalf of our public lands and ensure BLM has the people and funding to do its job and steward these lands for future generations,” Hamby said.","On Nov. 19, a recent Senate hearing regarding the multiple-use mandate of America’s public lands was held by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The core issue discussed was about the challenge of balancing the “multiple-use” mandate (which requires balancing recreation, conservation, timber, grazing, and energy development) with a “sustained yield.”

Many senators and witnesses expressed frustration with the current process, calling it “rigid, slow, and often detached from the intent Congress expressed” and subject to political shifts between administrations.

“Senators heard one consistent message today: Multiple use is hard,” Rachael Hamby, policy director at The Center for Western Priorities, said. “Finding the balance happens on the ground, with the residents, scientists, and small business owners who know the land the best. That’s why it’s so foolish for Congress to use a blunt instrument like the Congressional Review Act to impose land management decisions from Washington.

Three points of concerns included “unprecedented staffing crisis,” the Congressional Review Act (CRA) and proposed land sales.

The staffing crisis that BLM faces under the Trump administration was said to slows down planning and permitting processes.

“Senators also heard how the Bureau of Land Management is facing an unprecedented staffing crisis due to the Trump administration’s cuts,” Hamby said.

Recent use of the CRA by Congress to overturn three specific resource management plans was noted as potentially causing “chaos” and uncertainty in land management, as it calls into question the validity of numerous other land use plans and decisions. Some Republican senators, including Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), have proposed selling off millions of acres of public land to address housing shortages and national debt, a measure that has faced significant opposition.

Ucore Rare Metals is positioning itself as a key enabler of Western supply-chain sovereignty.
This substantial government investment underscores the strategic importance of developing domestic rare earth processing capabilities outside Chinese control.
This approach addresses the fundamental vulnerability in Western supply chains that has become increasingly apparent as China asserts greater control over rare earth exports.
The Department of Defense funding signals both the urgency and strategic priority placed on developing alternative supply chains for these essential materials.","A tectonic shift in the global minerals landscape has crystallized as China’s Ministry of Commerce announced this month that it is expanding export controls over key rare-earth elements and related processing equipment, marking a strategic tightening of Beijing’s dominance. In the face of this disruption, Ucore Rare Metals is ramping up its U.S.-based capabilities to build an independent supply chain of rare earths through its patented RapidSX technology and strategic partners.

Ucore Rare Metals is positioning itself as a key enabler of Western supply-chain sovereignty. In May 2025 the company announced a $18.4 million funding agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense to scale its RapidSX rare-earth separation technology toward commercial production at its Strategic Metals Complex in Alexandria, Louisiana. This substantial government investment underscores the strategic importance of developing domestic rare earth processing capabilities outside Chinese control.

The company has also taken steps to secure feedstock and expand partnerships, which are critical in the rare-earth arena where refining capacity—not just mining—is the choke point. By manufacturing in Louisiana, sourcing from allied feed-stock jurisdictions and avoiding reliance on Chinese equipment and supply chains, the company aligns with the West’s push for resilience in critical minerals. This approach addresses the fundamental vulnerability in Western supply chains that has become increasingly apparent as China asserts greater control over rare earth exports.

Ucore’s broader corporate strategy includes disrupting the People’s Republic of China’s control of the North American REE supply chain through the near-term development of a heavy and light rare-earth processing facility in Louisiana, with subsequent strategic metals complexes planned for Canada and Alaska. The company maintains additional information about its operations and strategic direction available through its corporate website at https://www.Ucore.com. Additional news and updates relating to the company are accessible through their newsroom at https://ibn.fm/UURAF.

The timing of Ucore’s expansion coincides with growing geopolitical tensions and increasing recognition among Western governments that rare earth elements—essential for defense technologies, electric vehicles, and renewable energy systems—represent a critical national security vulnerability when concentrated in a single supplier nation. The Department of Defense funding signals both the urgency and strategic priority placed on developing alternative supply chains for these essential materials.",https://www.citybuzz.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/favicon-65x65.png,N,,2025-11-29 15:00:33.054695

This analysis documents the most significant national developments in 2024 and 2025, outlines precise vulnerabilities and provides realistic mitigation measures for decision makers.

Strategic context

In October 2025 China announced additional controls on rare-earth exports and related processing technologies. This decision briefly tightened the market for rare-earth magnets and separated oxides that are crucial for EV motors and semiconductor equipment. Although Beijing later delayed parts of the policy's implementation, the message was clear: Critical inputs can be restricted with little warnin.

Meanwhile, the United States and its allies have continued adjusting export controls on chipmaking equipment. Any further tightening will directly affect the cost and feasibility of new packaging and test facilities across ASEAN. The strategic environment surrounding high technology has therefore become volatile and has placed pressure on firms hoping to expand into advanced electronics production.

Malaysia: advanced packing ambitions

Malaysia is pursuing one of the most aggressive semiconductor-upgrade strategies in Southeast Asia. Penang's“Silicon Island” project and the new Green Tech Park represent a deliberate shift from assembly to higher-value packaging and design.

Approved semiconductor-related investments reportedly exceeded 70 billion ringgit ($17 billion) between January 2024 and June 2025. Investments include Infineon's silicon carbide expansion and Carsem's advanced packaging facilities for AI-related chips.

Advanced-packaging and testing lines in Malaysia's semiconductor clusters still depend on specialized lithography subsystems, ultra-high-purity precursor chemicals and precision metrology equipment.

These imports are increasingly vulnerable because Malaysia's new export-control regime now requires notifications for high-performance AI chips and equipment, creating possible bottlenecks and compliance burdens.

For example, Malaysia's July 202 directive requires exporters to notify authorities at least 30 days in advance when shipping US-origin high-performance AI chips, signaling that regulatory headwinds may also apply upstream in tool and component supply chains.

Without expedited import lanes, delays in receiving critical equipment would postpone factory commissioning in locations such as Penang, driving up capital costs through extended financing periods.

The Malaysian government must fast-track customs and import lanes for critical equipment, co-finance spare-parts pools for fabs and invest in infrastructure near semiconductor clusters such as high-quality water, power reliability and waste-treatment.

In parallel, public-private training centers should train large numbers of precision-manufacturing engineers.

Indonesia: nickel dominance, battery dream

Indonesia has leveraged its dominant nickel reserves to pull in major EV battery investments. The flagship project is the nearly $6 billion joint venture between Contemporary Amperex Technology Company (CATL) and Indonesia Battery Corporation in West Java.

A June 2025 Reuters report said the facility is scheduled to begin operations by late 2026 with an initial capacity of 6.9 GWh, with an expansion path toward 15 GWh or more. The scale demonstrates Indonesia's ambition to anchor the region's battery ecosystem, but it also highlights the limits of upstream advantage.

Despite controlling the raw material, Indonesia's battery value chain is not yet integrated. The CATL–IBC project will still depend heavily on imported precursor chemicals, cathode active materials and high-precision manufacturing equipment.

The Reuters report noted that while Indonesia has rapidly expanded nickel processing, the country has not built the full suite of midstream capabilities required for stable cell production. Critical reagents and machinery remain tied to suppliers in China, South Korea and Japan.

This dependency introduces substantial strategic risk. A February 2025 C4ADS repor found that Chinese companies control roughly 75% of Indonesia's nickel-refining capacity.

That concentration means that although production occurs on Indonesian soil, operational control, technology flows and strategic decisions often originate in external corporate or policy environments. Any shift in Chinese domestic policy, export priorities or commercial strategy could ripple through Indonesia's downstream battery plans and disrupt cell production timelines.

Given these vulnerabilities, Indonesia must accelerate development of domestic precursor and cathode-material facilities to reduce exposure to foreign suppliers. Battery-plant construction should also be sequenced with upgrades to grid capacity, wastewater management and environmental controls, since these engineering systems remain bottlenecks in several industrial zones.

Manufacturers should also design production lines with modularity so they can switch battery chemistries if global markets or reagent availability change.

Thailand: EV hub conversion

Thailand is moving quickly to convert its dominant automotive industry into an electric-vehicle hub. The Board of Investment's EV 3.5 package, announced in 2025, offers tax incentives, consumer subsidies and import-duty relief through 2027 for manufacturers that commit to local production.

This policy has already shifted investment patterns. BYD opened a $490 million plant in Rayong in mid-2025 with capacity for 150,000 EVs annually, marking one of the largest EV manufacturing commitments in Southeast Asia. Domestic EV registrations also surge to roughly 70,000 units in 2024, up from fewer than 10,000 in 2021.

Despite these gains, Thailand's EV ecosystem remains dependent on imported battery cells, semiconductor components and rare-earth magnets. ASEAN Briefing's September 2025 assessment found that Thailand still lacks mid-stream capabilities such as cathode production, electrolyte processing and advanced battery-testing facilities. This dependence exposes the sector to the same vulnerabilities faced by regional semiconductor clusters.

These components also move through logistics systems designed for traditional automotive supply chains. Laem Chabang Port remains optimized for bulk auto parts rather than high-value lithium-ion cells.

EV assemblers reported delays in 2025 due to congestion and manual customs checks on sensitive components during peak export periods. Even minor slowdowns disrupt just-in-time assembly and raise operational costs.

To protect its emerging EV advantage, Thailand must expand bonded logistics zones for battery components, accelerate port digitization and cooperate with ASEAN partners to harmonize battery standards. Without these measures, Thailand's EV ambitions will remain vulnerable to supply-chain friction and regulatory fragmentation.

Regional Risk Map

Material concentration risk. China's export controls on rare earths and magnets create leverage points. ASEAN must map critical-element dependencies and invest in regional recycling and stockpiles.

Equipment and technology risk. Restrictive export regimes on chip-making tools raise project execution risk. ASEAN governments should establish pooled spare-parts procurement, trusted procurement corridors and diplomatic waiver channels.

Infrastructure and skills risk. All three countries face co-investment needs in power, water, waste and vocational training aligned with advanced manufacturing. ASEAN-level funding mechanisms and mutual recognition of professional certifications would reduce friction. Sign up for one of our free newsletters

ASEAN stands at a pivotal moment. Opportunities to capture semiconductor back-end work, EV battery manufacturing and higher-value electronics are real. Malaysia's move into advanced packaging, Indonesia's downstream battery strategy and Thailand's EV pivot are promising.

They are also fragile. Each depends on imported tools, materials and specialized skills that can be disrupted by geopolitical shifts.

The region's success will depend on how quickly leaders can reduce those vulnerabilities through strategic infrastructure investment, targeted industrial policy, regional standardization and coordinated risk management.

Without these measures, factories across ASEAN will remain profitable in calm markets but exposed during periods of geopolitical tumult.

The two nations also agreed to co-host the first ever International Conference on the Just Transition Away from Fossil Fuels, scheduled for April 2026.
“There is a clear momentum to phase out fossil fuels, and now is the time to capitalise on it,” said Sophie Hermans, the Dutch minister for climate.
This is a major milestone.” Under the North Sea Future Plan, small amounts of fossil fuels will still be able to be extracted at or near existing wells.
Campaigners said that it will result in relatively small amounts of fossil fuels being extracted.","Nations hatched a plan to abandon fossil fuels

After the Cop30 climate summit concluded with zero mention of fossil fuels in the draft text, Colombia and the Netherlands pledged to establish their own roadmap for abandoning oil, gas and coal – with the backing of 22 other nations, including Australia and the UK.

While there was a lack of consensus on fossil fuels at Cop30 – a victory for obstructive petrostates – around a third of nations backed phasing them out. Colombia and the Netherlands were among them, and announced that they would independently establish a roadmap for abandoning fossil fuels. The two nations also agreed to co-host the first ever International Conference on the Just Transition Away from Fossil Fuels, scheduled for April 2026.

“There is a clear momentum to phase out fossil fuels, and now is the time to capitalise on it,” said Sophie Hermans, the Dutch minister for climate. “We must begin to materialise what this phaseout could look like and start a concrete roadmap that allows us to incorporate the new and leave the old behind.”

The breakaway conference comes as critics question whether the Cop process is fit for purpose, having struggled to enact significant change since the Paris agreement was signed at Cop21 in 2015.

Speaking of abandoning fossil fuels …

The UK has become the first major economy to call time on new fossil fuel exploration, confirming that no more licenses for oil and gas drilling will be issued in the North Sea.

“Britain has just made history,” said Greenpeace UK’s co-executive director, Areeba Hamid. “Closing the door to new exploration marks the beginning of the end of oil and gas in this country. The government has shown genuine global climate leadership. This is a major milestone.”

Under the North Sea Future Plan, small amounts of fossil fuels will still be able to be extracted at or near existing wells. The government argued that this would support the UK’s energy transition. Campaigners said that it will result in relatively small amounts of fossil fuels being extracted.

Despite welcoming the announcement, Hamid said that “the current plan – and cash – to support North Sea workers doesn’t go far enough”. She added: “It’s vital they are at the heart of Britain’s transition to a clean-energy superpower, not left behind by it. A £20m jobs package doesn’t cut the mustard.”

Monthly injection shown to relieve severe asthma

People who take daily steroid tablets for severe asthma could soon have a new treatment option after a new jab showed “incredibly encouraging” results in a trial.

For the trial, King’s recruited more than 300 people with severe asthma from 11 countries. Researchers found that 90% of participants who received a monthly tezepelumab injection were able to reduce or stop taking their daily steroid tablets, without any impact on their symptoms. Tezepelumab is an antibody which targets parts of the immune system, reducing lung inflammation.

Scientists are eager to find alternative treatments for managing severe asthma, as long-term daily steroid use can lead to serious health problems, including osteoporosis, diabetes, and increased vulnerability to infections.

“This is an incredibly encouraging development for the future of asthma care that could transform the lives of people with severe asthma,” said Dr Samantha Walker of the charity Asthma + Lung UK.

The study was funded by pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca and Amgen. Further research is planned.

‘Caring businesses’ honoured at UK awards

Businesses that employ ex-offenders to work on environmental projects, train homelessness people to be baristas, and support Palestinian farmers were among the winners of this year’s UK Social Enterprise of the Year award, held on Wednesday.

The annual gong recognises the growing contribution that social enterprises make to the economy and wider society, and celebrates “Britain at its best”.

The Skill Mill was among the winners. It provides environmental jobs for young people involved in the criminal justice system. Other winners included Change Please, which helps lift people out of homelessness by training them to be baristas, and Zaytoun CIC, which supports Palestinian farmers producing food in the West Bank.

“Every year brings its challenges, but 2025 saw a difficult economic trading environment alongside a sometimes unsettling national conversation on what it means to be British which dominated the political landscape,” said Peter Holbrook, Social Enterprise UK’s chief exec. “It’s therefore truly heartening to celebrate businesses built on care and compassion that support the most vulnerable members of our communities, representing Britain at its best.”

Crop yields soar thanks to solar panels – study

Solar farms and agriculture are often billed as rivals when it comes to land use. A new study supports a growing consensus that the opposite is true.

Canadian researchers found that partial shading provided by agrivoltaic systems – solar arrays with crops growing under them – can boost food production, while improving soil health and encouraging nutrient cycling. The benefits increase when the panels are not in use, the study found, meaning decommissioned solar farms could still provide an economic boost to farmers.

Using yield modelling, the study estimated that agrivoltaic shading could boost farm income from potato production by $3.9bn (£2.95bn) in Germany alone. Other studies have reached similar conclusions.

“This agrivoltaic crop yield bump has been shown for dozens of other crops and solar panel combinations all over the world, including basil, broccoli, celery, corn, grapes, kale, lettuce, pasture grass, peppers, potatoes, tomatoes and more,” lead researcher Prof Joshua Pearce from Western University, Canada, wrote for The Conversation.

The panels, he added, help mitigate climate extremes, such as heatwaves, “delivering meaningful value for farmers”.

Learning another language ‘slows brain aging’

Being multilingual could help slow brain aging, research has found, adding to growing evidence that suggests speaking more than one language boosts cognition.

The international study of more than 86,000 people observed just a small gap between brain age and biological age in those who spoke one language. A “modest” advantage was noted for bilingual participants, with major gains seen among those speaking three or more languages.

The study did not assess level of fluency. However, the findings echo the results of similar studies, including one from 2019, which concluded that learning a second language in old age can improve cognition.

World’s most cycle-friendly cities revealed

In the race to make cities more cycle friendly, there’s a clear winner: Utrecht.

The Dutch city was this week crowned the world’s best for biking. The Danish capital, Copenhagen, and Ghent in Belgium ranked second and third respectively. It begs a question: what makes a city cycle friendly?

According to those behind the EU-funded Copenhagenize Index, it’s not just about safe and connected cycle infrastructure. Researchers also assess how equitable cycling is, and the political support behind biking.

The latest index was dominated by nations in northern Europe. The highest ranking UK city was London (33rd), while Portland, Oregon, (35th) was the best performing US city.

Utrecht’s high ranking came as little surprise to Positive News, which road tested its cycle network last year. Here’s how the Dutch city is stepping green living up a gear.

Literary prize launched for refugee writers

A new literary award celebrating refugee and migrant writers launched this week, offering a cash prize and a publishing deal to the winning scribe.

The Footnote x Counterpoints for fiction will spotlight writers whose work has been shaped by migration. It’s open to people currently living in the UK and Ireland.

“Refugees and migrants make hugely valuable contributions to our arts, culture and society,” said Counterpoints Art, which launched the award with Footnote Press. “Within the context of rising xenophobia, it is vital to keep platforming and amplifying these othered narratives in order to emphasise our shared humanity.”

The Footnote x Counterpoints award is the latest literary prize to showcase writers on the margins. Last year, the Bridport Prize launched its Never Too Late Award to tackle ageism in publishing. It’s open to writers everywhere aged 60 or over.

Photo award brings conservation into focus

A chimpanzee relaxing in a tree has scooped top honours in a photography award spotlighting conservation issues.

The sleepy primate was caught on camera in Uganda, home to one of the largest chimpanzee populations. There are estimated to be around 5,000 of the animals in the country, a number that looks set to be revised after Uganda launched its first ever chimp census this year.

The snap, caught by photographer Federica Cordero, is one of a clutch of winners of the Nature in Focus awards. The India-based competition aims to “reveal fresh perspectives on the natural world and shed light on urgent conservation challenges,” said Rohit Varma, the awards’ co-founder.

Chevy Holiday Magic

Starting Monday, December 1st, 2025, Chevrolet is hitting the road with an event called Chevy Holiday Magic. The show is described as a holiday spectacular that will be powered by a caravan of Chevy Silverado EVs. The traveling show will stop in five different cities. While the display is designed to bring Chevy holiday cheer to different parts of the country, it will also be a chance for Chevrolet to demonstrate how EVs can travel long distances, be effective for towing, as well as be used to provide power to displays or homes.

The Silverado EVs will help light up events at each stop along the way. The displays will include illuminating a holiday tree and a light show. The events will be held in conjunction with local Chevrolet dealers and highlight local choirs singing holiday carols. The festivities will include hot cocoa and smores. The displays will show a number of other Chevrolet vehicles as well as the incredible 1987 Suburban that stars in Chevrolet’s holiday ad this year. Chevrolet will also be working with the Toys for Tots chapter in each city to help spread holiday cheer to families in need.

From San Diego to Detroit, the caravan will travel 2,987 miles, with stops in Dallas, Nashville and Atlanta, to demonstrate the truck’s capability to travel long distances.

The 2026 Chevrolet Silverado

According to Chevy, the Silverado EVs get up to 494 miles of range, and the truck’s offboard power can use the truck’s battery to provide electric power to the truck's 11 outlets. That is based on the Maximum Range Silverado Work Truck.

Chevrolet hasn’t released all of the trim levels that will be available for the 2026 models, however it recently announced a new Trail Boss off-roading package for 2026 Silverado EVs. I would expect we will still see the Work Truck, the LT and the RST. The Silverado EV is also available with the Sidewinder feature that allows the truck to have four-wheel steer, or the ability to crabwalk. That perk has been popular on the HUMMER EVs and is also available on the Cadillac Escalade IQ.

Hodgson said critics should not be in a rush to judge Carney’s commitment to fighting climate change.","Hodgson is pushing back against critics who question Carney’s commitment to climate change — a group that now includes Steven Guilbeault, who quit Cabinet on Thursday hours after the landmark Ottawa-Alberta energy agreement was signed.

Those “ingredients” are in the memorandum of understanding that Carney and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith signed in Calgary to great fanfare, including two standing ovations for the prime minister from a business crowd. Nothing is certain without a private sector investor because neither Ottawa nor Alberta say they are interested in underwriting a pipeline with tens of billions of taxpayers’ dollars.

Hodgson said the deal includes a July 1 deadline for any private sector investor pitches that must meet several requirements, including buy-in from the B.C. government and the province’s First Nations groups.

“The proponent has not come forward with a route. They have not come forward with a proposal at this point in time,” said Hodgson.

“They got some work to do,” he added, saying it is “premature” for critics to worry about a new oil pipeline to the B.C. coast.

Carney has spend months rolling back energy and environment policies championed by Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government, starting with Canada’s work on the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.

The MOU did away with an emissions cap on oil and gas, clean energy regulations, rules that punished companies for “greenwashing” and could potential lift a ban on oil tankers off the B.C. coast — policies Guilbeault helped create.

Hodgson said critics should not be in a rush to judge Carney’s commitment to fighting climate change. “I have known him for 25 years,” said Hodgson. “When he has a vision for what needs to happen, he creates KPIs [key performance indicators] — and we better damn deliver them.”

Carney was the U.N. Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance before entering politics this year, winning the Liberal leadership and then a federal election on the pledge that he was best suited to protect Canada’s economy against President Donald Trump’s economic attacks on Canada.

“The prime minister is at the center of some pretty complex geopolitics right now, and is maybe charging a slightly different path based on the realities we find in the world today,” Hodgson said.

“There was a path to get to net zero under the previous government. That path was running into real challenges with a number of provinces. This MOU sets out another way to do it.”

Hodgson pointed out that the MOU affirms Canada’s commitment to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The deal includes a new target to cut methane emissions, a requirement that Alberta and Ottawa reach an agreement on industrial carbon pricing by April 1 that could raise Alberta’s current carbon price from C$95 per ton to $130 per ton, and a focus on developing clean nuclear energy and sharing electricity better across the western Canadian provinces.

Hodgson was optimistic heading into a Friday meeting with British Columbia Premier David Eby, a day after the premier called the pipeline proposal an “energy vampire,” touting instead the billions of dollars worth of fully funded and shovel-ready LNG export projects in his province.

“We have a very constructive and productive relationship with the British Columbia government,” Hodgson said. “It’s not an accident that there are more projects on the major projects list in British Columbia than any other province.”

Carney’s minister said that said that when Eby called to ask for help to ease the effect of Trump’s softwood lumber tariffs on B.C. forestry workers, the government reacted.

“We got on a plane, we came out, we sat down and we talked about the challenges. We said we will come back with solutions,” Hodgson said, citing this week’s announcement by Ottawa of an aid package for steel and lumber.

“We have a very respectful and constructive conversation between our two levels of government,” Hodgson said.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Ffb%2Ffc%2F91cf687247829ad5e6b4dfb7a6f0%2Fcp175382787.JPG,N,,2025-11-28 17:59:26.667809

Not this week.

In the hours between the party-room meeting and Senate question time at 2pm that afternoon, the Greens’ environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, was not fronting the cameras but instead holed-up in the office of her Labor counterpart, Murray Watt, thrashing out a deal to finally re-write the nation’s dated and broken environment protection laws.

Around the same time, the opposition leader, Sussan Ley, was raging on Sky News about the “totally insufficient” offer that Watt had made to secure the Coalition’s support.

The government says it was genuinely prepared to deal with either party as late as Wednesday night, adamant its overhaul of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act would pass the Senate before parliament finished for the year on Thursday.

But the striking contrast between the two in that brief period on Tuesday – the Greens, conspicuous in their silence, and the Coalition, seemingly resolute in their resistance – suggested one side was always more likely.

Whereas the Greens were consistent with their demands throughout negotiations, the opposition continually shifted the goalposts – lobbing new requests at the government as late as 9.30pm on Wednesday, according to government and Coalition sources.

After 72 hours of high-stakes negotiations and tense internal deliberations, in particular among Hanson-Young’s colleagues, Anthony Albanese announced the deal at 8am on Thursday to pass the laws with the Greens.

The agreement included concessions to the Greens to prevent the fast-tracking of coal and gas, removing the exemption for native forest logging within 18 months and tightening a loophole for agricultural land-clearing.

The bill was rushed through the Senate on Thursday night, an abrupt ending to the five-year struggle to act on Graeme Samuel’s blueprint to fix the nature laws.

“The bills were rammed through with almost no time for scrutiny,” the independent senator David Pocock said, decrying the package as only a “partial” win for nature.

The timing could not have been more apt.

Almost exactly 12 months ago, Albanese intervened to scuttle a deal that Watt’s predecessor, Tanya Plibersek, had reached with the Greens and Pocock to create a federal environment protection agency in a frantic conclusion to the 2024 parliamentary year.

This time, Albanese was not only prepared to negotiate with the Greens but offer far more concessions, albeit on a bill that included much more than a federal EPA.

What changed? The political climate for one.

After winning the May federal election and no longer anxious to avoid a campaign backlash in the mining state of Western Australia, Albanese appointed Watt – his “Mr Fix it” – with the imprimatur to negotiate whatever deal was required to pass the laws.

A ‘one-time’ offer to fix nature

Senior Labor sources familiar with negotiations say the Greens under their new leader, Larissa Waters, were “very good to deal with”, contrasting it with obstinance they believe characterised the minor party’s approach under Adam Bandt.

Albanese said as much on Thursday morning, praising the “maturity” of the party he has spent much of his political career fighting.

The prime minister injected himself into the negotiations on Wednesday morning, meeting with Waters, Hanson-Young and Watt in his office to iron-out the remaining sticking points.

Albanese was clear the “one-time” offer would be pulled if the Greens did not grab it this week.

The ultimatum put the Greens in a bind. While reluctant to accept a deal that did not directly combat the climate crisis, party veterans were conscious that any delays would give industry – particularly cashed-up miners – time to water-down or kill the reforms.

But the Greens also had leverage. Labor’s self-imposed deadline to pass the laws this week meant both it and the Coalition knew they could extract more than they otherwise could.

The Greens convened another party-room around midday on Wednesday to debate their final position.

With the government ruling out a so-called “climate trigger”, securing protection for forests, and quickly, became the Greens’ main priority.

The government initial offer of a three-year timeframe to end the exemption was resisted because, in Hanson-Young’s words, “three years to let the loggers get in there and trash our native forest is three years too long”.

Labor eventually agreed to halve that timeframe to 18 months as well as crack down on land-clearing, significantly bridging the divide between the two parties.

Before the final deliberations, the Greens sounded out influential figures in the environment movement to seek assurances they would publicly support them if they agreed a deal.

It was time to make a decision.

‘Know when to hold them, when to fold them’

Even as expectations of a Greens deal grew throughout Wednesday, including among industry lobbyists who wanted an agreement between the major parties, Labor continued to pursue the other option.

At 11am on Wednesday, Watt met with his Liberal counterpart, Angie Bell, the shadow resources minister, Susan McDonald, and Tasmania senator Jonno Duniam – the former shadow environment spokesperson who was pushing hard for a deal.

Watt was prepared to accept some of the opposition’s requests, including constraining the powers of the federal EPA, but wouldn’t cede on others, such a requirement for proponents of heavy polluting projects to disclose greenhouse gas emissions as part of their application.

Multiple sources confirmed Bell raised new demands, complicating the chances of a deal between the major parties and frustrating her own colleagues.

About 4pm and after their party-room meeting, Waters and Hanson-Young made the short walk to the prime minister’s office to finalise the negotiations before Albanese was due at The Lodge for Christmas drinks with press gallery journalists.

As late as Wednesday, the Greens were prepared to oppose the laws if they couldn’t secure a satisfactory deal.

Waters and Hanson-Young left that meeting confident they had.

“[In negotiations] you do have to know when to hold them, when to fold them, and when to play the cards you’ve got to get an outcome,” Hanson-Young said.

As festivities at The Lodge started around 5pm, the official word from the government was that a deal – with either side – was yet to be reached.

That was technically true. Amendments were still being negotiated through the night.

Albanese would need to inform stakeholders, including the Tasmanian premier, Jeremy Rockliff, whose state’s logging industry faces an uncertain future after the deal.

The prime minister had already discussed the prospects of a Greens deal with the Western Australian premier, Roger Cook, who had joined forces with the state’s powerful mining to successfully lobby Albanese to shelve Plibersek’s proposal.

Cook did make another 11th-hour intervention, posting a short video to Instagram appealing to the Coalition to broker a pro-business package with Labor.

The opposition continued negotiations late into Wednesday night, submitting revised demands at 9.30pm.

Senior Coalition figures still believed a deal could be reached as late as Thursday morning.

They were right – it just wasn’t with them.

The fight for climate goes on

“Today, I can announce our government’s landmark environmental law reform will pass the parliament today, heralding a new era for the environment and productivity in Australia,” Albanese said at the Thursday morning press conference alongside Watt and the finance minister, Katy Gallagher.

Waters, Hanson-Young and McKim stood up soon after, heralding the progress for environmental protection while warning the fight to consider climate effects in federal nature laws was far from over.

“This has been a tough negotiation but we’ve managed to deliver some tough blows,” Hanson-Young said.

At her own press conference, Ley decried the “dirty deal” between Labor and the Greens and insisted the Coalition had acted in “good faith” to broker an agreement.

Samuel – who Ley, as Scott Morrison’s environment minister, commissioned for the review that inspired the reforms – had a different view.

“They have manoeuvred themselves into irrelevance on this matter,” the former consumer watchdog said of the Coalition.

“Absolute irrelevance.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56d02fabab278645644cc7cc9676a64c967134eb/0_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6b882d117a2b82c70ac51ae33d7baefd",N,,2025-11-28 16:59:36.191410

Gretchen Whitmer sat down for an unusually transparent financial review on YouTuber Caleb Hammer's ""Financial Audit"" show on Nov. 3.

The headline number that should worry taxpayers: Michigan carries an unfunded pension liability of approximately $27 billion, which is scheduled to be amortized and fully addressed within a 15-year period ending around 2038, roughly five times the state’s annual K-12 school aid fund contribution.

While the pension system improved its funding ratio to 74.83% from 66.3% the previous year, Whitmer said, that gain came primarily from market recovery rather than structural reform.

“Pensions are being phased out as a policy,” Whitmer said on the show, noting that future generations of state employees won’t receive them—a move designed to shrink the liability over time.

The Real Threat: Tariff Chaos and CEO Pessimism

Perhaps more concerning than legacy pension obligations is the current business climate. A staggering 87% of CEOs in Michigan expect a weaker overall state economy over the next decade, Whitmer said during her appearance.

The culprit? Trade policy uncertainty that’s hitting Michigan’s manufacturing and agricultural sectors particularly hard.

“The tariff chaos and unpredictability of trade policies coming out of Washington, D.C.” is creating stress and uncertainty throughout the state economy, Whitmer said. Michigan’s heavy reliance on advanced manufacturing—especially automotive—makes it uniquely vulnerable to tariff fluctuations.

Whitmer advocated for using tariffs “like a scalpel, not a sledgehammer,” suggesting a more targeted approach to trade policy.

The EV Transition Gamble

Michigan is betting big on electric vehicles and battery manufacturing to maintain its automotive dominance. The state pledged $1 billion through its “Make It in Michigan” program for five EV battery-related projects.

“Batteries are the heaviest component, where they are built will become the center of gravity for the long-term dominance in mobility,” Whitmer said, positioning Michigan to be the place where batteries are manufactured.

But this strategy carries risk. The University of Michigan's Michigan Economic Outlook for 2025–2027 projects a 3.9% increase in per-capita income this year, but warns that overall growth will slow. Meanwhile, Michigan ranks 49th nationally in population growth—a major long-term economic headwind, according to the Michigan State Revenue and Economic Outlook published by the House Fiscal Agency.

Controversial Revenue Sources

Michigan’s school aid fund relies on sales tax but also draws from marijuana taxes generating $270 million and gaming taxes. These revenue sources—often called “sin taxes”—are described as the “easiest taxes for legislators to take votes on,” though critics argue they disproportionately affect lower-income individuals, according to Whitmer.

The state also increased its Working Families Tax Credit from 6% to 30%, a form of redistribution that Whitmer said incentivizes full-time work and disproportionately supports families raising children.

For investors watching Michigan’s municipal bonds or companies with significant Michigan operations, the combination of CEO pessimism, slow population growth, and massive unfunded pension liabilities suggests caution. The state’s EV bet may pay off long-term, but the transition period looks increasingly turbulent.

Virginia-based QTS Data Centers on Tuesday announced it will partner with the Building Trades Council of South Central Wisconsin to build a $12 billion data center campus in Dane County. The project will include a $50 million community commitment for the area and will support up to 5,000 trade jobs, officials said.

The project will span up to 1,600 acres, with the first three years focused on constructing five data center buildings across 650 acres in the town of Vienna, a QTS presentation showed. The company will also partner with Alliant Energy to develop 750 megawatts of renewable energy generation. The company said it will pay for all project energy infrastructure.

The DeForest Village Board met Nov. 18 and reviewed a presentation from QTS Data Centers. The developer plans to annex land from Vienna into the village of DeForest, and no action was planned for the meeting, according to the village agenda.

“Before any development may proceed, several public processes would need to occur within the village of DeForest as well as within some State of Wisconsin departments and regional public agencies,” village officials said. “This review and consideration of necessary approvals may occur over the course of many months or more.”

QTS officials said the multibillion-dollar investment will rely on union labor to fill thousands of construction jobs and demonstrate the company’s commitment to local investment and workforce development.

“This partnership with QTS reflects our shared commitment to ensuring that the digital infrastructure our company depends on is built by the highly skilled union workers who live in the very communities it will serve,” said Tracey Griffith, executive director of the Building Trades Council of South Central Wisconsin, in a statement. “When local union members are on the job, projects are built safely and with the exceptional skill and quality our workforce is known for. The economic benefits stay right here at home in Dane County — supporting families, strengthening neighborhoods and driving long-term growth across Wisconsin. By formalizing this partnership, we are investing directly in our workers and in the economic vitality of the communities they call home.”

The labor organization is made of 17 local unions representing more than 6,000 building trades members in Wisconsin, including the North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters, the Wisconsin Laborers’ District Council and the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 139, officials said. All the groups announced support of the project.

“The QTS data center project means nearly a decade of steady work for LIUNA members right here in Dane County,” said Kent Miller, president and business manager of the Wisconsin Laborers’ District Council, in a statement. “Our training center is in DeForest, and this project keeps our members close to home — so they can earn family-supporting wages, be home for dinner, and still make it to their kids’ ballgames.”

“Our joint effort is about more than technology, it’s about people,” said Ryan Hunter, chief operations officer at QTS Data Centers, in a statement. “It allows us to move forward with the full support of Wisconsin’s impressive skilled union workforce, building a campus that strengthens the economy, supports families and sustainably powers the digital infrastructure of the future.”

QTS will work with local officials and establish a $50 million commitment to support education, workforce development and housing initiatives across Dane County, officials said. The company will also partner with Madison College and the University of Wisconsin for workforce and research programs respectively.

Vantage Data Centers, Oracle and OpenAI and Microsoft are working on separate, multi-billion-dollar data centers in different parts of the state. In October, Vantage Data Centers announced it partnered with the Wisconsin Building Trades Council to build the $15 billion Lighthouse data center in Port Washington. That project is expected to see a peak workforce of more than 4,000 skilled construction workers over three years.

The construction team in the Port Washington project includes Maryland-based Whiting-Turner, New York-based Turner Construction, Missouri-based McCarthy and Iowa-based Weitz.

In Mount Pleasant, Microsoft announced it would engage local labor unions on its data center project. The company recently shared plans for a $4 billion expansion, which will be added to its initial $3.3 billion commitment.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/11/Wis.-Data-Center.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 16:59:17.861526

Upper House candidate Deepa Mathew said news buried in the business section of The Australian newspaper revealed that expensive and unreliable energy was making South Australia an unattractive place to invest.

BHP Billiton was fast-tracking big copper mining investments in South America but slow-walking South Australia because of the government's decarbonisation priority and too much red tape.

The Australian reported that BHP was ""cautiously advancing its $20bn-plus investment to dramatically expand copper production in South Australia – a megaproject which could deliver another nation-defining resource play to rival the Pilbara"".

The mega project known as Copper SA was drifting and with BHP putting of a decision on an energy intensive smelter until 2028.

The Australian reported:

""The energy crisis is stark. ABS inflation figures this week show electricity costs in Australia have surged 22 per cent in two years, excluding rebates. Costs here are two or more times higher than in Canada and other countries where BHP operates, and 50-100 per cent higher than in the US.""

Ms Mathew said South Australia was saddled with massive government debt and needed wealth-creating projects like Copper SA so families could once again flourish economically.

""Peter Malinauskas is letting investment slip through South Australia's fingers to South America and that is putting pressure on families.

""It's time for ideology to stop driving energy policy.

""To take the pressure off families, South Australia needs abundant, cheap and reliable energy so industry can invest and create the jobs our kids need.

""Windmills farms and solar factories can't do it and there is no battery in existence that can power a city let along a copper smelter.""

Ms Mathew said Family First would always prioritise cheap and reliable energy like gas, coal and in the future uranium over expensive and ideologically driven windmills and solar factories.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is providing an update on its reconsideration of the final risk management rule for perchloroethylene (PCE) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). As noted in the November 28, 2025 declaration to the court, EPA expects to publish a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to amend the 2024 PCE Rule in or around summer 2026 and publish a final rule in 2027. EPA is also considering options for extending certain compliance dates established by the 2024 PCE Rule, including options involving a more expedited rulemaking process to address compliance date extensions. This reconsideration is being done in accordance with applicable law, Executive Orders, and Administration policies, including Executive Order 14219 “Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the President’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Deregulatory Initiative” and the EPA’s Powering the Great American Comeback Initiative Pillar I: Clean Air, Land, and Water for Every American.

After the 2024 PCE Rule was published, several legal challenges were filed. These petitions for review were consolidated in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The Court previously granted a temporary abeyance while EPA conducts a rulemaking to reassess the challenged rule and ordered EPA to update the Court with its plans for issuing a new rule.

In late July, EPA opened a 30-day public comment period on the 2024 PCE Rule.

It’s a company designed to build many times more, the CEO of the upstart EV maker told the editorial board of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week. To get there, Rivian is banking on its newest vehicle, the R2, a two-row crossover, to be a big hit.

Initial manufacturing of the R2 will start in Illinois, but Scaringe said production will expand to its future factory an hour east of Atlanta when it opens, albeit years later than initially expected, in 2028. Future models, including the smaller R3 and R3X, are expected to follow.

“The more people that experience an EV, it’s like a one-way door,” Scaringe said. “It’s hard to go into an EV and then back to a (gas-powered) vehicle.”

He said Rivian will start customer deliveries of R2 early next year, and soon start vertical construction of the Georgia plant after a ceremonial groundbreaking in September. In a wide-ranging interview with the AJC, Scaringe went into detail about the company’s future, why Georgia is crucial to that success and the future of the auto industry.

Scaringe likes to say that software is as important to modern cars as the nuts and bolts of assembly.

Rivian is designed to do both. That strategy entranced investors while creating its own challenges and setbacks when the pandemic struck, but Scaringe argues it’s a framework made to support more than just a niche automaker.

The need to ramp up production is why Georgia is such a critical cog in Rivian’s machine aimed at rivaling Tesla as a leader of America’s new school of automaking.

“This is an investment you don’t make for one product cycle,” Scaringe said of his company’s planned $5 billion factory an hour east of Atlanta. “You make the investment for many product cycles. It’s a multidecade, multi-billion dollar investment.”

Next year is a vital one for California-based Rivian, which plans to launch R2 at a starting price of $45,000 to target a mass market. The forthcoming Georgia plant is poised to multiply the number of R2s rolling off assembly lines.

Confident it will succeed, Scaringe said the R2 and its iterations will provide the same boost to Rivian that Tesla found with its mid-priced Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover.

Those two Tesla models make up more than 40% of all EV sales this year through September, according to Cox Automotive data. Cox Enterprises, the owner of the AJC, also owns Cox Automotive and a 3% stake in Rivian.

“In something like clothing or cars or goods that reflect your own personality, you tend to see many winners,” Scaringe said. “So having a single player with nearly 50% market share is not a reflection of a healthy market — it’s a reflection of a highly underserved market.”

September was a new high-water mark for EV sales, but it’s expected to be a temporary peak. Federal tax credits worth up to $7,500 for qualifying new EV purchases were revoked at the end of that month, creating a fleeting window of opportunity for the EV curious.

“The training wheels are coming off,” said Stephanie Valdez-Streaty, director of operations management at Cox Automotive. “This shift will test whether the electric vehicle market is mature enough to thrive on its own fundamentals or still needs support to expand further.”

For Rivian, Scaringe said the startup’s history until now has been about learning and growing. He said Rivian’s Georgia investments will show the company is ready for the expanded spotlight.

“We’re a much, much more mature business,” he said. “And we’ve built processes to handle some of these unexpected externalities.”

Learning curve

The path for Rivian hasn’t been smooth.

The company’s 2021 initial public offering was among the largest in U.S. history. The company’s valuation peaked at more than $100 billion, briefly surpassing juggernauts like Ford, an early Rivian investor, and General Motors.

Rivian also courted other deep-pocked investors including Amazon, inking a $1 billion deal to supply the e-commerce giant with 100,000 EV vans.

But Wall Street’s stratospheric expectations soon came back to Earth amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a supply chain that buckled under the pressure and Rivian’s struggles to meet production demands. Scaringe said it was a tough time for his company, which has yet to turn a profit.

Among the challenges Rivian faced were getting components because it didn’t have the deep manufacturing history of traditional automakers.

“It was a combination of learning for the first time, launching multiple products, dealing with a global pandemic and then being last in line to get parts from suppliers,” he said.

Those scars have informed Rivian’s R2 strategy, reframing Georgia’s role in the company’s long-term plans.

When unveiling the prototype R2 in March 2024, Scaringe sent shock waves through the Peach State by pausing the Georgia plant’s development. The decision was cited as a temporary cost-cutting measure and an effort to focus on launching R2 more quickly from the company’s existing Illinois factory.

Within 24 hours of the R2 reveal, Rivian announced it had nearly 70,000 preorders. Scaringe declined to provide any updates to that figure but said “the excitement hasn’t waned.”

Rivian later announced it would resume construction of the Georgia factory in 2026, and will create 7,000 promised jobs.

State and local leaders also provided an estimated $1.5 billion incentive package to recruit Rivian to Georgia. Most of those benefits materialize only if the company meets its job and investment figures by 2030. Rivian will also receive support from a $6.6 billion federal loan.

In recent days, Rivian opened its East Coast headquarters along the Atlanta Beltline, which the company said will employ 500 workers by the end of next year. The back-end research and development work, Scaringe said, is just as vital to Rivian’s success as its mechanical chops.

“We didn’t design the business to be selling 50,000 cars a year,” he said, citing the company’s current production output. “We have a cost structure, particularly on the R & D side, that was set up to be a much, much bigger business.”

Creating leverage

Unlike traditional automakers, Rivian and electrified peers like Tesla have developed a new technology backbone for their vehicles.

Most conventional cars have more than 100 small computers called electronic control units to handle small tasks.

One ECU handles seat adjustments. Another is in charge of side mirror controls. Yet another is tasked with injecting fuel into the engine. Those ECUs are developed by separate part suppliers and often include a mishmash of operating systems.

“It’s a very, very messy architecture,” Scaringe said. “It’s precisely the opposite of what you’d want to have.”

Rivian, along with Tesla, have a handful of more powerful computers called domain control units that handle several tasks. Scaringe said that decision reduces assembly complexity, saves thousands of dollars on computer chips and will pay off once the company reaches a certain scale.

“We have more computer engineers and software engineers at Rivian than we have mechanical engineers by a pretty significant degree,” he said.

For automakers to succeed in the future, Scaringe said, they will have to have a software backbone like Rivian and Tesla. They’ll get there one of two ways — developing it themselves or finding a technology partner.

The company’s technology platform caught the attention of the world’s second-largest automaker, Volkswagen Group.

In June 2024, Rivian and VW announced a joint software partnership worth an estimated $5.8 billion. Rivian agreed to contribute technology to the German auto giant’s fleet of new EVs, while VW’s financial contributions would support Rivian as it ramped up production.

Scaringe said that partnership also gives Rivian newfound leverage when negotiating with suppliers and preparing to launch R2 — both in Illinois and in Georgia.

“(Suppliers) are super excited to work with us because the choice we make in Rivian vehicles is also the choice that goes into Volkswagen vehicles, which is Porsche, Audi, VW, Bentley and a whole host of brands,” Scaringe said. “It’s a complete flip of the nature of that relationship.”

With the groundwork laid — and ground literally about to break east of Atlanta — Scaringe said Rivian’s next chapter is filled with potential.

“Now it’s about execution,” Scaringe said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gmtoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/dc/5dc406a4-6abc-4307-9659-f46a64b94a0f/6929f81557081.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-28 15:59:43.640482

Increased oil exports to Asia would reduce Canada's economic dependence on an unreliable United States, he said.","Critics accuse Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney of betraying the fight against climate change.

Others say he is facing reality and has no choice but boost polluting sectors that are vital to an economy being punished by US President Donald Trump's trade war.

But there is no dispute that since replacing former prime minister Justin Trudeau in March Carney has repositioned his Liberal Party on the environment.

Immediately after taking office, Carney scrapped Trudeau's unpopular carbon tax on individuals.

He then launched a Major Projects Office to fast-track initiatives he said would strengthen Canada's economic sovereignty, creating a bulwark against the impacts of Trump's tariffs.

Mining and natural gas projects -- criticized by some environmental advocates -- were among the early picks.

But the most dramatic development came on Thursday, when Carney struck a deal with the conservative-led energy-producing Alberta province to advance a new oil pipeline, while increasing overall oil and gas production.

""Canada and Alberta are striking a new partnership to build a stronger, more sustainable, and more independent Albertan and Canadian economy,"" Carney said.

""We will make Canada an energy superpower, drive down our emissions and diversify our export markets.”

The deal marked a clear pivot for Carney's Liberal Party and a departure from the policies that defined Trudeau's decade in power.

Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, who loathed Trudeau's policies, said this month that ""the tone of federal government has done a 180 in the last year.""

Steven Guilbeault, a member of Carney's cabinet, who was also Trudeau's environment minister, agreed.

He resigned Thursday, hours after the pipeline deal was signed.

Guilbeault said he entered politics ""to champion the fight against climate change,"" but that key green policies he implemented with Trudeau were being ""dismantled"" under Carney.

- Climate policy 'erosion'? -

Carney, a former central banker, worked on climate issues before joining politics in January, but has emphasized market-driven solutions to environmental challenges.

In 2019, he became a UN envoy focused on mobilizing public and private finance to help achieve the goals of the Paris Accords.

He then joined the massive Canadian multinational firm Brookfield, steering private capital to aid climate action.

The Alberta pipeline plan is in its infancy and may never move forward.

But Carney's memorandum of understanding with Alberta to advance an initiative that involves piping bitumen to Canada's northwest Pacific coast and building a massive port to accommodate oil tankers has drawn outrage.

Carney said the plan could be a win-win.

Increased oil exports to Asia would reduce Canada's economic dependence on an unreliable United States, he said.

And, he stressed, the deal requires oil companies to pay a steep industrial carbon tax, which could help fund cleaner energy sources, while the impact of rising emissions would be offset through carbon capture -- a controversial technology.

Sierra Club Canada's communications chief, Conor Curtis, told AFP there has been an ""erosion of climate policy,"" under the new Liberal government.

""A new oil pipeline is not necessary. We are in the middle of a global transition to renewable energy,"" he said in an interview before Thursday's signing.

- 'Profound disruptions' -

Tim McMillan, the former president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said Carney had no choice but to embrace the oil sector.

""After 10 years of cancelled projects and lowering GDP per capita and standards of living in Canada, we're at a point, especially with the US tariff threats, that Canada needs to look at our strengths,"" McMillan told AFP.

""Oil and gas are at the top of that list.""

Even Guilbeault, a prominent environmental activist before entering politics, acknowledged Carney was in a tough spot, conceding that Trump had triggered ""profound disruptions"" in Canada's key economic relationship.

""Despite this difficult economic context, I remain one of those for whom environmental issues must remain front and center,"" he said.",https://www.rtl.lu/sassets/rtl2008.lu/nt/p/2025/11/29/01/8373dd5278c83919d39c20da5ac6c35b.jpeg,N,,2025-11-28 19:58:30.910684

According to the report, “Power Hungry: Why Gas and Coal Alone Won’t Keep Up with US Power Demand Growth” from Wood Mackenzie, meeting this demand growth through 2030 is the largest challenge faced by the US power sector.

“If more plant retirements are delayed, the value could rise to 67 GW, but significant uncertainty surrounds how many more retirements will be deferred,” Patrick Huang, senior research analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “90 GW of demand growth is well below the 160 GW of US utilities’ large load commitments tracked by Wood Mackenzie, as supply dictates how much demand growth can materialize.”

Huang added that if coal and gas plants ramp up utilization, the existing thermal fleet could meet up to 47 GW of peak demand growth.

This is less than 30% of the large load commitments made by U.S. utilities and will be offset by 98 GW of planned coal and gas retirements (59 GW of peak load contribution lost) through 2030.

Further retirement deferrals could keep 50 GW (30 GW of peak load contribution) online past 2030, but even in this scenario coal and gas generation falls short of meeting total demand growth.

Since keeping old coal and gas units online for longer is expensive and can run against state priorities, delaying retirements for a large portion of the existing fleet will be challenging.

The report notes that manufacturing bottlenecks are a key constraint on new thermal capacity. Gas turbine orders currently face extended lead times, with new gas plant additions limited to 58 GW (49 GW of peak load contribution) between 2025 and the end of 2030. Furthermore, the rising cost of gas turbines will make these additions very expensive in comparison to current wholesale electricity prices.

Remote, northern, and Arctic communities are on the front lines of climate change. For generations, Inuit have led the way in adapting to extreme weather and rapidly shifting conditions – bringing deep knowledge of the land and sea, and a tradition of innovation that strengthens communities across Nunatsiavut. The Government of Canada is committed to supporting that leadership with generational investments in clean, reliable energy that reflect local priorities.

While in Goose Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, the Honourable Rebecca Alty — on behalf of the Minister of Northern and Arctic Affairs and the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources — announced nearly $22 million in federal investments to advance three Inuit-led clean energy initiatives that will harness solar, wind, and tidal power while creating jobs across the region.

Funding for the Nain Wind Energy Project will support the installation of two wind turbines and battery storage to help reduce Nain’s reliance on costly, polluting diesel fuel for electricity. Once operational, the project is expected to displace more than one million litres of diesel every year – cutting emissions, improving air quality, and delivering more reliable and affordable power for the community.

At the same time, a second project led by the Nunatsiavut Government near Rigolet is receiving funding to continue collecting data to identify locations for a potential tidal energy facility.

The Detroit City Council has unanimously approved both the Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) and the revised brownfield incentive package for the construction of Detroit City FC’s new stadium in Corktown, on the city’s southwest side.

Residents divided: opportunity for some, unfinished project for others

The decision came on November 25 after hearing from residents and supporters urging the council to adopt the agreement tied to the AlumniFi Field project. Seven council members voted in favour; council president and mayor-elect Mary Sheffield, along with council member Mary Waters, were absent.

Many locals and DCFC supporters highlighted the potential impact on young people. Youth coach Duane Daniels argued that the stadium could become a place offering purpose and an alternative to violence-stricken environments. Drawing from his own background in tough neighbourhoods, he said he tries to show young people that even dreams of professional football can be within reach.

But not all Corktown residents were convinced. Bill Cheek said the project lacked key details on traffic flow, parking plans and noise management. In his view, the city should have demanded stronger guarantees. Meanwhile, Khari Turner — whose son plays in the club’s academy — stressed that DCFC has built an environment where kids from different neighbourhoods and backgrounds grow together. He added that the new stadium would be more than a sports venue: it would serve as a community anchor and a source of shared identity.

Stadium to rise on former hospital site

The new stadium will be built at Michigan Avenue and 20th Street, on the long-abandoned Southwest Detroit Hospital grounds. The complex had deteriorated badly — nearly two million gallons of water had accumulated in its basement and were pumped out this past summer. AlumniFi Field will hold 15,000 spectators, more than twice the capacity of DCFC’s current home, Keyworth Stadium in Hamtramck.

The full project is priced at $198 million, with $153 million allocated to the stadium itself. A four-storey mixed-use building will go up alongside it, featuring 76 residential units of varying sizes, 8,500 square feet of commercial space and a 421-spot parking garage. Another 680 parking spaces are planned at ground level within the complex.

The housing mix includes at least eight studios, 60 one-bedroom units and eight two-bedroom units. Sixty apartments will be reserved for households earning up to 80% of the Area Median Income (AMI), which for Detroit stands at $56,560 for a one-person household. Another eight units will be reserved for residents earning up to 60% AMI.

$88 million in public incentives and brownfield capture

Although the stadium is privately financed, DCFC is seeking a package of tax breaks and incentives worth $88 million over 30 years. The largest portion comes from the brownfield capture mechanism, projected at around $74 million from future taxes generated by the site. The project is also set to benefit from two commercial incentives worth just under $14 million combined.

According to the current schedule, construction on the stadium will begin in March. Co-owner Sean Mann says the timeline is tight but still achievable, with an eye on opening for the 2027 USL Championship season. Demolition at the former hospital site has already begun, and, as Mann put it, the real wrecking balls are expected in the coming weeks. Construction of the residential building is slated for November 2026 and will take two years. The overall project is expected to create 142 full-time jobs and more than a thousand construction positions during the build phase.

What the CBA includes: 46 commitments over 12 years

Negotiated throughout the fall by a nine-member resident committee and club representatives, the CBA outlines 46 commitments valid for 12 years. They include a one-time $200,000 payment to a low-interest loan fund for local small businesses and $1.2 million in community grants — $100,000 delivered annually to organisations in housing, culture and education.

It also guarantees the distribution of 3,000 free tickets annually to residents of nearby neighbourhoods, hiring preference first for ZIP codes 48216, 48208, 48210 and 48209, and then for all Detroit residents. DCFC will work with Detroit At Work to fill stadium jobs. For the first five years of stadium operations, the club commits to a $17 minimum hourly wage for all stadium employees.

The CBA also includes cultural and symbolic elements: at least $50,000 for art installations and murals referencing the history of Southwest Detroit and the former hospital; limited use of facial-recognition technology; a mentorship program for youth interested in sports-related careers; and a $100,000 investment in a new mini-pitch to be completed by the end of 2028. It also requires that at least 51% of construction workers be Detroit residents and that half of stadium vendors come from the city. Construction work will be restricted to 7 a.m.–6 p.m. from Monday to Friday.

Global EV Adoption: Only Modest Pace in 2025

The electrification of the global automotive fleet continues to progress slowly this year. Data show sales of 14.5 million EVs in the first nine months, with October figures expected to match September levels.

The numbers thus point toward full-year 2025 sales of approximately 21 million EVs. This would represent a 24% market share and a 20% year-on-year growth in unit volumes in our forecast (see chart)

BNEF analysts project slightly higher figures, forecasting 21.9 million EVs and a 25% global market share. Rho Motion, meanwhile, estimates the EV market share at 23% for the January-October 2025 period.

Last year’s market share stood at 22%. An advance from 22% to 23-25% in 2025 would therefore prove disappointing.

Headwinds come from two markets: the United States and China.

United States

Weakness in US sales has been anticipated since President Trump’s inauguration in January. Federal incentives that supported the market for 15 years—including tax credits and leasing credits—expired at the end of September.

This triggered a September spike followed by an October collapse. November and December figures are likewise expected to disappoint. S&P Global projects market share falling to just 7%. Only state-level support in California, the nation’s largest automotive market, along with manufacturer discounting, prevents an even steeper decline.

The US transportation transition has effectively stalled, as the internal combustion engine fleet expands by a net 4 million vehicles annually, substantially outpacing the 1.5 million new EV registrations.

Our forecast indicates a 3% decline in new EV registrations this year (see chart).

China

China is also experiencing the expiration of several EV incentives, including purchase tax breaks and trade-in payments. October figures already showed a modest decline compared to September.

On a positive note, the market is shifting toward higher penetration of pure battery electric vehicles (BEV), while plug-in hybrid registrations (PHEV) contract. Overall EV share of new vehicle sales has already exceeded 50% for several months. BEVs alone command approximately a market share of one third this year.

Saturation levels have been reached in several metropolitan areas. Nevertheless, continued market growth appears assured. Our forecast calls for 15% growth in new registrations for 2025.

EU and Germany

The European Union is recovering from last year’s setback. October figures already surpassed full-year 2024 totals. Our projection indicates a 25% growth in EV registrations for 2025.

Germany shows particularly robust momentum. We anticipate a growth rate of 45% this year. Even so, EV volumes will remain below the 2022 peak.

Rest of World

RoW, i.e. markets outside China, the EU, and US demonstrate highly positive trajectories. Wherever Chinese export initiatives face no import barriers, adoption rates surge dramatically.

This applies particularly to the UK which reached a 38% EV market share in October, along with numerous Latin American, South and Southeast Asian nations.

By September, the RoW volumes had already matched full-year 2024 totals. Forecasts therefore call for a substantial 40% growth in EV registrations.",https://www.energycomment.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/cropped-favicon-23jun-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-28 13:59:22.805129

Budget 2025: Greenpeace’s verdict This Budget offered flickers of progress – but no real plan for the fairer, cleaner future the UK urgently needs.","This was a budget without a vision. Instead of taking the big steps that the country is crying out for, the Chancellor presented a Budget which reads more like she was playing energy policy whack-a-mole – reacting to problems as they popped up without following a coherent strategy. Some hits landed well, others missed entirely, but what’s missing is a vision for permanently lowering bills and accelerating the clean energy transition.

Let’s take a look at a few key areas.

Energy bills

Households across the UK are still struggling with the ongoing cost of living crisis. In this context, any reduction in household energy bills is welcome, and credit where it’s due – the Chancellor has managed to remove £150 a year from bills.

Energy Company Obligation

The Energy Company Obligation (ECO), funds home insulation and energy efficiency programmes. These funds are vital for people in fuel poverty that the programme was targeted towards because, done well, they are the best way of reducing energy bills. But the Chancellor made the decision to scrap the scheme.

This decision will result in 10,000 jobs lost almost overnight, and cause 1 million families to lose the opportunity of insulating their homes in the next four years – which would keep their bills permanently low.

ECO had some problems in delivery, including a very poor record on solid wall insulation, but it needed reforming not scrapping, by beefing up certification to kick out the cowboy builders and getting proper inspection and redress in place. The government will need these systems for ALL its energy efficiency work, so the funding could have gone into those programmes.

Although the end of ECO loses over £3bn for home upgrades this Parliament, the government has boosted other efficiency programmes, namely the Warm Homes Plan, by £1.5bn. We need to see that rolled out quickly for the benefit of both the fuel poor and those who work in the industry.

Renewables Obligation

The Renewables Obligation is a charge that was designed to ensure energy suppliers developed more new renewable energy to supply customers with. Energy suppliers levied that charge on customer electricity bills. In this Budget, the Chancellor made the decision to remove this levy off bills and into general taxation.

This decision means that households with electric heating – who are twice as likely to be fuel poor – will save the most. It will also make it cheaper for people to make the switch to electric vehicles and heat pumps, so this is a good move by the Chancellor, and one we were campaigning for, that will help lower bills and support people to make greener choices.

Paying for nuclear energy

The changes for bills don’t end there, in less optimistic news, the Chancellor has decided to add £28 on to household bills per year by 2030 to pay for nuclear energy. When we can create clean, green energy from renewables, there’s no need to fund astronomically expensive nuclear power and the waste it produces, which still, no one can find a safe way to deal with.

This Budget has endorsed a flawed review that lays the blame for nuclear power delays and cost overruns at the door of planning rules and safety standards. Yet nuclear power is delayed and over-budget in France, Finland, China, USA, and other places that obviously do not have the same regulatory standards as the UK.

In a world of limited money for climate action, nuclear becomes an obstacle to emissions cuts as money that is spent on nuclear power could be better spent on genuinely clean energy, efficiency and storage

Missed opportunity: a strategic reserve for gas power plants

However, the biggest driver of rising energy prices since 2022 has been the international gas price crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. So the Government has missed an opportunity to reduce energy bills by taking gas plants out of the wholesale market and putting them into a strategic reserve.

Gas plants set electricity prices 85% of the time despite providing only 30% of generation over the last year. A strategic reserve with regulated returns would stop them extracting excessive profits during peak demand and prevent gas from dictating prices for all consumers.

They could have also taken this chance to lower leasing costs for offshore wind, helping to bring more affordable clean energy onto the grid and push down bills.

Polluter pays measures

Given the urgency of the crisis, the lack of a single mention of the climate in the chancellor’s speech was striking. The climate and cost of living crises are here on our doorstep and ordinary families are the ones paying the cost.

This budget was a missed opportunity to transfer those costs to the polluters through new taxes and fines on a fossil fuel industry that has consistently been rewarded for trashing the planet and fuelling destructive extreme weather. Nor did the chancellor take the opportunity to fix the gaping hole in the UK’s international climate finance contributions.

Windfall tax

Crucially however, the chancellor resisted a storm of oil and gas industry lobbying, and chose not to ditch or reduce the windfall tax, or Energy Profits Levy (EPL), earlier than the 2030 date forecast. She should be commended for that.

46,000 of you asked the chancellor to keep the levy and we wrote to the chancellor alongside 16 other organisations including fuel poverty groups, tax justice groups and the Fire Brigades Union. Ultimately, our voices overpowered those of the oil and gas industry.

New tax regime

In a separate document also published on budget day, the government introduced a new permanent tax regime for fossil fuel companies operating in the North Sea which will apply to revenues, rather than just profits. This is a good move – or it would be, if the rate set by the government for when the tax starts to kick in were set at a lower rate.

The tax will apply when oil prices rise to $90 per barrel and gas prices rise to 90p per therm (compared to EPL thresholds that are $71.40 per barrel and £0.54 per therm for gas). The government had an opportunity here to introduce a more progressive polluter pays tax on the world’s most polluting industry, instead their future tax regime will only apply during instances of quite substantial price shocks.

Electric vehicles

And it’s not just bills and windfall taxes that are impacted in this budget. The government has decided to introduce a new pay-per-mile tax on electric vehicles from 2028, called the Electric Vehicle Excise Duty. We don’t oppose this tax in principle – it will be necessary once electric vehicles dominate our roads. But 2028 is too early. The transition is still building momentum, and introducing the tax too soon risks slowing the switch to electric. The government should wait until after 2030 when the market is more mature.

The Office for Budget Responsibility states that there will be 440,000 fewer electric vehicle sales between now and 2031 because of this change. This would equate to emissions from the road transport sector being about 670,000 tonnes higher. When road transportation is the sector responsible for the highest emissions in the UK, this is a big climate failure.

However, the OBR also suggested that there would be around 320,000 extra sales from the £1.3bn that the government has put aside to boost takeup, partially offsetting the impact of the pay-per-mile tax.

But we should be cautious about that estimate, because it is well known that a lot of grant money ends up only lowering the purchase cost of cars that would have been bought anyway.

Budget 2025: Greenpeace’s verdict

This Budget offered flickers of progress – but no real plan for the fairer, cleaner future the UK urgently needs. At a moment when families are grappling with high bills and communities are feeling the impacts of extreme weather, the Chancellor chose tactical tweaks over strategic leadership.

Removing regressive levies from bills and keeping the windfall tax in place are meaningful wins – especially thanks to the tens of thousands of people who spoke out. But these steps sit alongside decisions that push the UK in the wrong direction: cutting insulation programmes just when they’re needed most, ploughing money into costly nuclear power, and weakening the incentives to choose electric cars. The missed chance to take gas out of the wholesale market or introduce new polluter-pays measures shows a government still unwilling to challenge the fossil fuel industry that helped create this mess.",https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/E6YY13-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 15:59:52.972914

The companies formalised the cooperation with a memorandum of understanding (MoU) at Xing Mobility’s headquarters in Taiwan.

The partnership brings together Xing Mobility’s immersion-cooled, cell-to-pack battery architecture with Ideenion’s expertise in complete vehicle design and engineering.

The collaboration is intended to address electrification needs across several segments, including high-performance and commercial vehicles, marine applications and stationary energy storage.

Xing Mobility founder and CEO Royce YC Hong said: “We’re bringing Europe’s automakers a truly immersive, integrated battery architecture – coolant is the bloodstream; the veins become the structure. Immersion isn’t just a cooling method; it’s a philosophy of integration that makes EVs lighter, safer, and faster to industrialise.”

At the centre of the initiative is Xing Mobility’s Immersio cell-to-pack system, which does away with conventional battery modules.

According to the company, this configuration allows for higher energy density, better use of space and greater freedom in packaging than traditional battery layouts.

Xing Mobility presented the technology at IAA Mobility 2025 in the Caterham Project V, using the vehicle to illustrate how a module-less structure can contribute to more compact and manoeuvrable electric platforms.

The design employs immersion cooling, in which the coolant directly surrounds the cells and also contributes to the structural integrity of the pack.

Ideenion, which has been active in the automotive sector for more than three decades, has worked with manufacturers such as Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.

Its portfolio covers concept creation, prototype development, testing and validation, as well as limited-series production.

BAIROIL—The remote dirt road through dusty fields of sagebrush that John Cash drove along in June seemed to pass little of economic value. But his car was, in fact, rattling towards the top-producing uranium mine in Wyoming.

In 2022, the Lost Creek Mine became the first of several such sites across the West to restart operations as the U.S. scrambles to reestablish a domestic supply chain for nuclear fuel.

Cash, the CEO of UR Energy, which operates the Lost Creek Mine, believes more mines will come online in the years ahead.

“This [area] is loaded with uranium,” he said amid the vast, arid expanse of Wyoming’s Great Divide Basin. “I promise you right now, if I drilled a hole right here, we would hit uranium.”

Newly revived mines are also humming in Texas and Arizona, their owners hopeful that a boom in demand lies ahead. Ten uranium mines operate in the country today, up from three in 2021, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Agency. Company announcements and public records show dozens of others on standby for reopening or queued up for permitting in Colorado, Utah and New Mexico, with at least four currently fast-tracked for approval under recent executive orders.

“We’re right at the edge of a good little uranium mining boom,” said Travis Deti, executive director of the Wyoming Mining Association. “We’ve been off the playing field for decades on some of this stuff.”

For more than a generation, many of these sites sat dormant, stifled by a cheaper imported supply and modest demand from a stagnant nuclear power sector. However, uranium markets have recently reawakened: Spot prices doubled between 2022 and 2024, driven by global supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tension and lofty expectations for a renaissance of American atomic power.

Lately, a buzzing landscape of nuclear startups has stirred excitement with announcements of ambitious plans for advanced reactors to power artificial intelligence and other heavy industries across the country. But almost all of these companies are waiting for the U.S. to rebuild a nuclear fuel supply chain before they can even power up their prototype units.

“Expectations for uranium demand have been growing,” said William Freebairn, an associate editorial director at S&P Global Commodity Insights. “But this kind of demand is slow to show up.”

Investor appetite for uranium started to increase around 2022, he said, “as climate concerns became more prominent.” Uranium is processed and enriched into nuclear fuel that provides abundant energy without carbon emissions, although it poses other significant health and safety risks.

Presidential administrations since Barack Obama’s have pushed to increase domestic production of uranium fuel to supply the national nuclear sector, but that goal remains years away. President Donald Trump issued a flurry of executive orders this year to streamline permitting, expedite environmental reviews and impose tariffs on imports that compete with American products.

Despite the recent activity, the U.S. still has a long way to go before it could even come close to meeting its nuclear needs with uranium from domestic mines, Freebairn said.

Unlike pit mines, which scrape away acres of earth, most modern uranium extraction projects drill hundreds of wells, inject them with solvents and suck up the mineral slurry they create. This method has a much lighter impact on the surface but can contaminate or deplete freshwater aquifers if improperly managed.

In Wyoming, several hundred wells churn out a modest 28,000 pounds of uranium oxide per month at the Lost Creek mine. The mine is licensed to produce more than 1.2 million pounds of uranium oxide concentrate annually, according to UR Energy, but uranium miners are still waiting for the development of a domestic nuclear supply chain before ramping up production.

Supply chain bottleneck

For now, American uranium production remains a dribble. Despite recent steep increases, total output in 2024 was less than 2% of the country’s peak production in 1981. The U.S. lacks the infrastructure to transform uranium oxide concentrate, known in the industry as “yellowcake,” into the uranium hexafluoride gas used for enrichment. About 99% of the feedstock consumed by U.S. power plants is imported, and much of that uranium is enriched in Russia, despite the prohibition on importing Russian uranium that then-President Joe Biden signed in May 2024. The ban doesn’t fully go into effect until 2028.

“Uranium mining, uranium processing and uranium enrichment have all largely been offshored because they could do it cheaper,” said Rusty Towell, director of the Nuclear Energy Experimental Testing Laboratory at Abilene Christian University. “That whole supply chain was weakened.”

In the U.S., just one commercial plant converts uranium into the gaseous form required for enrichment and only one commercial plant enriches that gas into nuclear fuel at the scale required to fuel power plants. No facility can produce significant volumes of the higher-grade fuel used by new reactor designs — High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium, or HALEU. That also comes primarily from Russia, though the Department of Energy has posted billions in grant funding for private-sector enrichment projects in the U.S.

“The U.S. [government] is moving very fast on this,” said James Walker, CEO of a startup called Nano Nuclear Energy and a former nuclear engineer at the U.K. Ministry of Defense. “Now the pressure is on everybody to ramp up as fast as they can.”

A whole cluster of advanced nuclear startups like Nano eagerly awaits the availability of American HALEU to begin testing their reactors, and they’ll purchase the new enrichment facilities’ product as soon as it becomes available, Walker said.

However, even a booming domestic market for nuclear fuel doesn’t guarantee that American uranium miners will supply the needed raw material. New enrichment projects could continue to import uranium mined overseas — but government policies are making that harder, including with the Biden administration’s ban on imports of Russian uranium.

“We are making investments to build out a secure nuclear fuel supply chain here in the United States,” the announcement of that ban stated.

This year, Trump imposed tariffs on imports from 70 countries, including the top uranium producers: Kazakhstan, Canada and Namibia.

“As long as we’re keeping that foreign uranium from coming in, then I think there is hope for domestic production,” said Brent Elliott, a geologist with the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas. But if “we can get it cheaper somewhere else, then that will more likely be the case.”

A flurry of new mines

In Wyoming, home to the nation’s richest known uranium deposits, three other companies have recently joined UR Energy in ramping up operations. To the south, in far western Colorado, Canadian firm Anfield Energy announced plans in August to begin exploratory drilling at an abandoned, 2000-acre uranium pit mine.

In Utah, Anfield’s Velvet-Wood project received an expedited environmental review that lasted just two weeks due to a March executive order from the White House.

“This approval marks a turning point,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in a press release at the time. “By streamlining the review process for critical mineral projects like Velvet-Wood, we’re reducing dependence on foreign adversaries.”

The reviews of several mines in western New Mexico were also fast-tracked and are expected to conclude in late 2027. They include the Crownpoint-Church Rock and La Jara Mesa projects by Australian miner Laramide Resources, as well as Energy Fuels’ Roca Honda project in the Cibola National Forest.

On federal lands, where many of the reopened mines are located, digs for minerals are still governed by the Mining Act of 1872. Originally passed to draw settlers to the West, it declares all mineral deposits “free and open to exploration and purchase.” The law has enabled some mines to open in areas that are culturally important to tribes, critical habitat for vulnerable species or revered for recreational and scenic values, often over local opposition.

Some of the fast-tracked New Mexico mines border the lands of the Acoma and Laguna pueblos. In the nearby Navajo Nation, the new activity has sparked concern.

The Navajo Nation “continues to be affected — not only from abandoned uranium mines and mill sites — but also from other contaminants,” said Perry Charley, chair of the Diné Uranium Remediation Advisory Commission, at a public meeting in August in Shiprock, New Mexico.

From 1944 to 1986, mining activities left more than 500 abandoned mines and an enormous amount of uranium waste in various regions of Navajo land.

Numerous peer-reviewed studies of the Navajo Nation have shown widespread groundwater contamination by uranium, as well as other elements released by the mining process, including arsenic, vanadium, manganese and lithium.

“Though uranium mining ceased on the Navajo Nation in 1986, the contamination left from these operations still represents a significant danger,” said a study from 2019.

Recent studies have linked proximity to abandoned uranium mines with increased risks of autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases on the Navajo Nation. Uranium concentrations in urine samples of Navajo women are almost three times higher than the national median and are associated with significantly increased risks of preterm births, according to studies in 2020 and 2023.

Navajo people’s cancer diagnosis rate is 6.3 times higher for gallbladder cancer, 3.2 times higher for stomach cancer, 1.9 times higher for kidney cancer and 1.8 times higher for liver cancer than white populations in New Mexico and Arizona, according to a 2023 report from the Navajo Epidemiology Center.

On the eastern edge of Navajo land, at the Church Rock site, a dam failure in 1979 released 94 million gallons of waste fluids into the Rio Puerco, the largest radioactive material spill in U.S. history. Church Rock is among the sites currently undergoing expedited environmental review to resume production.

“These communities are still trying to clean up from the last time this happened,” said Amber Reimondo, the energy director at the Grand Canyon Trust, a nonprofit advocating for protection of the Grand Canyon and Colorado Plateau. “For years, tribes have been reassured that the problems of the past are just that — problems of the past — and that now we have environmental laws that are supposedly protecting them.”

At the Navajo reservation’s western edge, uranium production began last year at the Pinyon Plain Mine, nestled among pinyon pine trees in the Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni National Monument, less than 20 miles from the Grand Canyon’s south rim in Arizona.

The mine operator, Energy Fuels, began trucking its uranium product through Navajo territory in July 2024, but was forced to stop after the tribal government issued an order banning unauthorized transport of radioactive material.

“Anyone bringing those substances onto the Nation should undertake that activity with respect and sensitivity to the psychological impact to our people, as well as the trauma of uranium development that our community continues to live with every day,” former Navajo Nation Attorney General Ethel Branch said in a statement at the time.

Later, the tribal government and Energy Fuels negotiated an agreement to resume transport of uranium from the Pinyon Plain Mine across the Navajo lands.

“Energy Fuels is pursuing an aggressive plan to quickly increase short-term U.S. uranium supply,” company CEO Mark Chalmers said in a press release this year announcing record production at Pinyon Plain.

Energy Fuels did not respond to requests for comment. The company has a long list of mines it’s working to bring back online across Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, according to public announcements.

Groundwater concerns

Permitted in 1986, the 14-acre Pinyon Plain Mine sat dormant for decades, like hundreds of other sites in the country, waiting for uranium prices to rebound. When they did, the U.S. Forest Service cleared it to begin operations for the first time last year, although it last cleared federal environmental review almost 40 years ago. The decision prompted protests from local tribes, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs and Attorney General Kris Mayes.

“We must protect the water supplies,” Mayes said in an August 2024 statement calling for reevaluation of the mine. “The risks are too great to ignore.”

The site contains a single mine shaft extending 1,470 feet down to the uranium deposits, and the company removed millions of gallons of groundwater to access the ore. The mine and others like it pose threats to the region’s network of interconnected aquifers that stretches across the Grand Canyon region, according to research published last year by Karl Karlstrom and Laura Crossey, Emeritus professors of earth science at the University of New Mexico.

“Energy Fuels doesn’t know how much their mining is contaminating the deep aquifer, and USGS doesn’t know, and we don’t know,” Karlstrom said. “Caution is needed.”

In an interview, both researchers said the Pinyon Plain mining plan assumes that two underlying formations holding water, the upper Coconino aquifer and the lower Redwall-Mauv aquifer, aren’t connected. But ample regional science shows that’s not true, they said; water moves between them.

The Redwall-Mauv aquifer feeds springs across the region, some of which provide drinking water for the Havasupai Tribe.

“Current well data are insufficient to rule out a connection between the two aquifers,” wrote the Environmental Protection Agency in a review of the mine following Karlstrom and Crossey’s study. But the agency noted that USGS data from the mine’s well sites show elevated levels of uranium and arsenic contamination, and that it is unclear how or if it will spread.

“The potential for groundwater contamination resulting from operations at the Pinyon Plain Mine site cannot be assessed fully without additional investigations,” the EPA review concluded.

The uranium mining revival has churned up similar concerns in the savannah of South Texas. Encore Energy, based in the Gulf Coast city of Corpus Christi, started production at its Rosita site in November 2023 and its Alta Mesa site in June 2024. In August, it acquired 5,900 more acres adjacent to Alta Mesa, where it plans to begin drilling in October. Another Corpus Christi-based company, Uranium Energy Corp., expects to start mining at its South Texas sites in early 2026.

One rural groundwater conservation district is fighting the renewal of an old, unused mining permit UEC holds for a site in Goliad County.

“We are extremely concerned that UEC’s uranium mining activities will lead to groundwater contamination,” said a request for a hearing on the mine permits filed by the district with Texas’ environmental regulator late last year.

Faultlines and abandoned oil wells connect the mining area to freshwater aquifers, the district claims. Some 30 households, a church and about 400 cattle drink from wells in the area surrounding the mine. Groundwater levels there dropped 15 feet between 2000 and 2022, the district said.

The Goliad site will use about 130 million gallons per year, according to Art Dohmann, vice president of the Goliad County Groundwater Conservation District. But mining is exempt from groundwater permitting requirements under Texas law, he said.

“This may cause more wells in the area to go dry,” the district wrote in comments to the state.

In August, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality voted unanimously to grant the district’s request for a hearing on the permit. UEC did not respond to requests for comment.

Separate state permits authorize UEC to inject up to 105 million gallons of mining wastewater underground for disposal every year at its Goliad site. UEC has four other projects under development in South Texas.

The company, which calls itself “America’s largest and fastest growing supplier of uranium,” also owns sites in New Mexico and Wyoming, where its Christensen Ranch mine began production last summer and its Sweetwater Uranium Complex was selected in August for the fast-tracked approval authorized by President Trump’s executive order.

UEC calls Sweetwater “the largest uranium complex in the U.S.” It encompasses 20,000 acres of exploration and mining rights in Wyoming’s Great Divide Basin, and sits only a few miles from UR Energy’s Lost Creek Mine, where Cash, UR Energy’s CEO, was surveying his company’s project.

Before UEC can even develop the site, the expedited review is expected to take 18 months, according to a federal permitting tracker.

Drilling uranium

On a hot morning in June, three men and a 25-foot-tall winch pulled piping from the ground at the Lost Creek mine in Wyoming. They had just completed a new uranium well.

Cash, a trim man with brown hair lightly graying on the sides, inspected a slab of wood containing samples of wet earth taken every five feet down the well. A chunk he scooped up was a deep green, indicating it probably contained uranium.

“For a geologist, it’s like reading a book,” said Cash, who has a master’s degree in geology and geophysics from Missouri University of Science and Technology.

Lost Creek extracts uranium using in-situ recovery — ISR mining — a process pioneered in Wyoming in the 1960s. Over the eons, water carried uranium off the granite mountains surrounding the Great Divide Basin, burying it in the sandstone. Water is now used to draw it back out. The company drills wells patterned like the five sides of dice and then injects a leachate — water, oxygen, CO2 and occasionally soda ash at UR-Energy’s project, according to Cash — into the exterior four shafts. When that stew is pumped back to the surface through the center pipe, it’s full of uranium.

Wells’ surface impacts bother Cash, he said, looking out over the site. “I wish we could do this with less disturbance.”

But if this were an open-pit mine, a crater would displace the vegetation on the surface and “this would all be gone in perpetuity,” he added. Instead, the company will replant native sagebrush and grasses, Cash said.

Hundreds of wells surrounded the site’s processing facility — a concrete and steel warehouse where employees wearing radiation-monitoring badges oversee chemical processes that turn uranium-filled slurry into yellowcake, the base ingredient of nuclear fuel.

Water that isn’t reused, about 21,600 gallons a day, according to Cash, is treated and disposed of underground.

Lost Creek has detected groundwater contaminated by what the company injects — moving “where it shouldn’t move” — four or five times since 2013, Cash said. If left alone, it could spread to freshwater sources. This is “exceedingly rare,” and each time it has happened, UR Energy has successfully prevented an escape, he said.

Employee and environmental safety are among Cash’s top concerns, but he feels U.S. nuclear regulations often hamper innovation and curb profit margins. He chaffed at the fact that UR Energy was required to install and maintain a full-blown weather station at Lost Creek, and wondered why his company had to take groundwater that was already undrinkable and make it slightly cleaner, but still unpotable, before disposal.

“We need to be protective,” he said. “But we don’t need to be hyper-protective.”

Cash left Lost Creek for another UR Energy project, which would revive the Shirley Basin mine some 80 miles east at the foot of the Laramie Range. On his way that June day, he passed another potential mine, the Lost Soldier project, a claim he isn’t sure the company will ever develop.

“There’s a lot more work we need to do,” Cash said.

The 2025 Sustainability Trends Report highlights a world where the rapid scaling of climate technology often appears at odds with the political headwinds emerging from major world powers.

For manufacturers, the report outlines a period of risk and opportunity. The data points towards a clear direction in the power and transport sectors as clean technologies are scaled quickly and capital follows suit.

Yet global climate politics have entered what the report describes as a “period of retrenchment,” largely influenced by the US. This divergence between technological momentum and political intent is creating a complex environment for businesses to navigate.

US policy reversals and clean tech investment

The report frames 2025 as a stress test of whether global climate action can withstand the disengagement of the US.

According to Generation, the re-elected Trump administration has not only withdrawn from the Paris Agreement but has also moved to strip the federal government of its authority to regulate greenhouse gases.

This action could impair future climate initiatives in the country.

These policy reversals have had a tangible impact on industrial investment. Generation estimates that they have “already triggered cancellations of nearly US$30bn of prospective clean-industry investment in the US,” with further modelling suggesting this figure could reach US$500bn over a decade. This creates a power vacuum that other nations are keen to fill.

The report argues that China is quickly assuming the mantle as the world’s leading force in sustainability, fuelled by its aggressive industrial policy and growing exports of renewable energy technology and electric vehicles (EVs).

Electric vehicle market and manufacturing dynamics

In road transport, Generation sides firmly with the view that electrification is the global North Star.

The report cites International Energy Agency data suggesting electric cars are expected to account for 25% of global auto sales this year.

The contrast between markets is stark. EVs already represent close to 60% of new car sales in China and around a quarter across Europe. The US market is lagging with EVs making up only about 10% of car sales in 2024.

This gap presents challenges and opportunities for automotive manufacturers. Tesla’s once-dominant position began to erode this year, particularly in Europe, where Tesla has suffered double-digit sales declines.

This trend is compounded by the fact that “Chinese brands now offer very affordable models.”

While the passenger vehicle market transforms, decarbonisation in heavy-duty transport is stirring from a small base. The report stresses that infrastructure for high-power charging for eHGVs remains at a “barely-started” stage in most countries.

Industrial decarbonisation and hydrogen hurdles

For years, hydrogen has been presented as a key solution for decarbonising heavy industry. However, Generation believes that, in 2025, the green hydrogen bubble will truly burst.

A substantial share of European projects have been cancelled, with many more shelved as the cost gap between green hydrogen and grey hydrogen produced with fossil fuels remains wide.

The report's authors are blunt in their assessment. They write that the enthusiasm for hydrogen “may have cost us years in which industrial decarbonisation could have been pursued by more practical means” and note that the initial hype was strongly promoted by oil majors.

While hydrogen stumbles, other clean energy sectors are attracting around twice as much investment globally as fossil fuels.

The core message for corporate and financial audiences is that the economics of the transition are pulling one way while politics pushes another. Companies that treat this turbulence as a reason to pause their decarbonisation efforts risk being on the wrong side of what the report calls “the race for the future”.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/04d7a8f6392974fca983138ce7c40053:ddea15a66e79aabc1a6b8b20ca5c3051/gettyimages-1711064473-1.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 13:00:18.411924

Silva further stressed that, from now on, with the vetoes overturned, tragedies will be exacerbated, especially in an increasingly challenging context of climate crisis.

“But in most cases, if you do not have the presence of the State and public bodies setting rules and standards, what you get is a loss of control.
The possibility that each state and municipality will now make its own law is the absurdity of absurdities,” she said.","“All environmental agencies will now be left with their hands tied if this law prevails. Therefore, since it is unacceptable to leave the population completely unprotected, judicial action must be considered—and we are seriously considering it,” she said during her participation in Bom Dia, Ministro, a program run by public broadcaster EBC.

According to the minister, at the very moment society most needs environmental “protection,” Congress has dismantled the legislation meant to ensure it. “It was a demolition of Brazil’s environmental licensing system, a framework that has existed for 50 years at the state level and for 39 years at the federal level, nearly 40 years of consolidation, and one that has prevented hundreds of thousands of tragedies over the decades,” she said.

Silva further stressed that, from now on, with the vetoes overturned, tragedies will be exacerbated, especially in an increasingly challenging context of climate crisis.

Backsliding and loss of control

“The narrative being used—that this is modernization to gain agility—is, in fact, a narrative meant to disguise all these setbacks. These are not setbacks; they are true regressions,” she said.

According to the minister, Congress’s decision may undermine the Mercosur-European Union trade agreement, scheduled to be signed on December 20. “There are already questions arising about whether the environmental commitments that underpin the agreement can be met in light of this change.”

On Thursday, in yet another defeat for the government and amid escalating political tensions, Congress overturned most of Lula’s 63 vetoes to the environmental licensing bill.

All 52 vetoes analyzed were overturned in two voting blocs. With that, much of the new General Environmental Licensing Law (approved by the legislature in July) now takes effect.

Among the most sensitive vetoes for the government that were overturned was the one rejecting the creation of the Licença por Adesão e Compromisso (LAC) for projects with medium environmental impact. It is a self-declared license that does not require review or approval by an environmental agency for a project to proceed.

With the new flexibility, the environment minister noted, developers will be able to obtain a license by simply self-declaring compliance—meaning they themselves assert that they are following the law.

And the beginning is that, ideally, you would not start from here.

Despite its name, the 1999 Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act was designed under John Howard to allow developments to go ahead, usually with conditions attached that may limit the damage to nature.

The law does not prioritise environmental protection. It shouldn’t be a shock that it has spectacularly failed to deliver it. There is a case that the best approach would have been to scrap and replace the act.

Labor instead chose to amend the existing legislation, arguing it could improve it for both the environment and business, which has complained of long delays in approval decisions. It means the deal announced on Thursday is a repair job, not a complete rethink of how to best protect Australia’s unique wildlife and wild places as the country faces what scientists say is an extinction crisis.

It is worth noting there was no need for the changes to be rushed through this year. A committee inquiry is still under way. The Greens cut a deal at least in part because they feared if they didn’t, the government’s offer would evaporate and it would be content to make a much weaker agreement, from an environmental perspective, with the Coalition next year. The deadline was only political.

The result is the changes have not had proper scrutiny. The independent senator David Pocock had a point when he described the process as a farce. It means there are likely to be gremlins in the laws that will not be uncovered for a while.

But let’s look at what we do know.

From an environmental perspective: is this deal an improvement on the existing law? In some key ways, clearly yes.

The creation of a national Environment Protection Agency with the power to enforce compliance and apply beefed-up penalties is a step forward – if well used. The same applies to the creation of minimum national environment standards against which development applications will be assessed.

Plenty about the standards is still not known, though. Only two draft standards have been released, with more to come. As with so much of this, the details will matter.

The commitment to tighten loopholes that made state-sanctioned native forest logging and agricultural land-clearing effectively exempt from national laws is a significant and necessary win for nature. The revamp would have been a joke without them.

This change won’t stop logging or land-clearing, but will boost legal and social pressure on the logging industries in Tasmania and New South Wales. Anthony Albanese basically acknowledged this on Thursday, saying the forest industry was increasingly reliant on plantation timber – it already provides nearly 90% of wood in Australia – and that the government would kick in $300m for a “forestry growth fund” as it moved in that direction.

The Greens’ demand that fossil fuel projects cannot be fast-tracked in the way other developments can – renewable energy and housing, for example – makes obvious sense as far as it goes.

It also makes sense that Labor has dropped a proposal to give states and territories the power to make decisions on large coalmining and unconventional gas projects that affect groundwater or waterways under plans to “streamline decision-making”. Water resources are a national issue, and should have federal oversight.

Here the politics get a little murky. Did Labor actually ever really plan to give up power over what is known as the “water trigger”? At least some of the “concessions” to the Greens – the commitment to axe the logging loophole, for example – were steps the government had said it was prepared to make, but held back for the final negotiations.

Similarly, it’s an open question whether the environment minister, Murray Watt, and those around him really believed an agreement could be landed with the divided and self-destructing Coalition, despite repeated claims that he was prepared to make concessions either way. If a deal was done it was always likely to be with the Greens. They don’t call Watt a political fixer for nothing.

Back on the positives: one of the more contentious issues in the debate over the laws has been whether to include a definition of “unacceptable impacts” that should in theory lead to quick “no” decisions on some developments. It stayed in. Again, the details and interpretation will be crucial.

But there are also problems, and many unanswered questions.

The amended laws lean heavily on the use of offsets, which basically allow some nature to be bulldozed as long as other areas are protected. As Guardian Australia’s Lisa Cox has shown, offset schemes have repeatedly not delivered anything like what has been promised.

The government has proposed a “restoration contribution fund” that will allow developers to kick in cash in return for permission to do some environmental damage. This sort of model, which critics have called a “pay-to-destroy” fund, failed spectacularly in NSW. The negotiations with the Greens have introduced some limits, but many people will be sceptical whether the “net gain” for nature that Watt has promised can be guaranteed.

Non-fossil fuel developments will be able to be fast-tracked, with decisions promised in as little as 30 days and in some cases left to the states. The country needs a rapid rollout of renewable energy, but this timeframe risks squashing the rights of communities to test and object to developments.

The laws also maintain the existing approach of giving the environment minister significant discretion over how the act is used. Experts say this includes in some cases the authority to approve developments they consider in the national interest, and a “rulings power” that could limit legal challenges.

Finally, the laws go close to ignoring what will ultimately be the greatest threat to much of the environment – the climate crisis. Developers will have to disclose their expected emissions, but this information will have no bearing on whether a project goes ahead. As has been said many times before, this defies logic.

It means that – even as conservationists celebrate victories that have been the result of years of dedicated campaigning – the arguments over what more is needed to give Australian nature the protection it deserves will continue.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3cc664724e6376ff66f5f578425e07d3bfbc731/439_0_6880_5504/master/6880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=227b5c08927fb4c29b381881935dee95",N,,2025-11-28 16:00:07.163686

Tony Evers’ Task Force on Climate Change — born from an October 2019 executive order — could hold Wisconsin back from maximizing its potential since it prioritizes climate change over permitting reform,” Tiffany and Hoffman warn.
What’s more, the Keystone State’s new budget, like the recent congressional markup, also underscores the fact that permitting reform can garner bipartisan support and advance even where there is divided government.","It’s been an eventful November for 2028 Democratic presidential hopefuls. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker (D), who put more than $25 million of his own fortune into to his campaign fund this month, traveled to the Lone Star State on November 10 to speak to an annual dinner for the Dallas County Democratic Party, where Pritzker was warmly greeted by leading Texas Democrats. The next day, on November 11, California Governor Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) addressed the global climate conference in Brazil, with his remarks garnering national and international media coverage. Meanwhile, on November 12, Governor Josh Shapiro (D-Pa.) reached a overdue budget agreement with legislative leaders in Harrisburg, one that makes him the first Democratic governor to back away from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a cap-and-trade program comprised of nearly a dozen northeastern and mid-Atlantic states.

While the end of Governor Shapiro’s bid to impose RGGI in Pennsylvania is getting deserved attention, the permitting reforms to which Shapiro agreed are also noteworthy. In particular, Pennsylvania’s new budget expands the number of permits covered by the state’s new Streamlining Permits for Economic Expansion and Development (SPEED) program.

Pennsylvania’s SPEED program, which was authorized by 2024 legislation and launched at the end of June 2025, expedites the review process for certain permits by allowing businesses to pay for private, third-party inspectors to conduct technical reviews. The Commonwealth Foundation, a Pennsylvania-based think tank, notes that the permitting reforms included in the new budget will enable more businesses “to track permits through an online system,” and permits that aren’t processed by the state in a timely manner “would be automatically approved, allowing businesses to start these projects.”

“With the threat of RGGI off the table, a more prosperous future for Pennsylvania’s energy sector can move forward,” said Nathan Benefield, the Commonwealth Foundation’s chief policy officer. “That, combined with ‘deemed approved’ permitting reform, will improve Pennsylvania’s economic outlook.”

As Congress considers permitting reform, such as the federal SPEED Act, state legislative leaders, governors, and 2026 candidates are advocating complementary state-level actions. Take Congressman Tom Tiffany (R-Wisc.), the front-runner to be the GOP gubernatorial nominee in Wisconsin next year, who is now campaigning on the need for permitting reform at both the federal and state levels.

“With rising electricity demand and the need to source more reliable domestic energy and critical minerals, the U.S. must approve and build more power plants, pipelines, mines and export terminals in a timely manner,” Tiffany wrote in a recent op-ed in the Capitol Times, which he coauthored with Gabriella Hoffman, director of Independent Women’s Center for Energy and Conservation. “The U.S. can continue to uphold its strict environmental and labor standards while speeding up the lengthy and litigious permitting process.”

“While permitting reform is viewed as the sole responsibility of the federal government, states like Wisconsin have a responsibility to participate in the process,” Tiffany and Hoffman added, noting that three-quarters of permits authorized under federal law are issued by state governments. “Moreover, the Foundation for American Innovation’s State Permitting Playbook notes places like Wisconsin boast ‘significant autonomy and flexibility in implementing and enforcing environmental laws’ like the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act.”

“Unfortunately, Gov. Tony Evers’ Task Force on Climate Change — born from an October 2019 executive order — could hold Wisconsin back from maximizing its potential since it prioritizes climate change over permitting reform,” Tiffany and Hoffman warn. “The governor’s overreliance on renewables like solar and wind, not reliable energy, won’t meet this moment.”

Back in Washington, days after Governor Shapiro signed into law permitting reform as part of a new state budget, the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources held a full committee markup for three permitting reform bills, including the aforementioned federal SPEED Act. Congressman Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), chairman of the committee, touted the markup as “an important bipartisan step toward lowering energy prices for hardworking Americans and building critical projects.”

“The increasing demand for electricity and critical minerals is fueling new investments, and federal permitting laws must keep up,” Chairman Westerman added in a statement issued after last week’s markup. “The SPEED Act eliminates bureaucratic delays that hinder projects and restores NEPA to its original purpose. The Committee’s bipartisan support for NEPA reform is a victory for government efficiency, economic growth, national security, transportation infrastructure and lower energy bills for Americans. I thank my colleagues for their hard work on the bills we advanced, and I look forward to advancing them through the legislative process.”

The ongoing buildout of AI-dedicated data centers, which are more energy intensive than traditional data centers, translates into increased demand for electricity that, unless accompanied by a corresponding expansion of power generating capacity, will drive up consumer energy costs. Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs Research estimated that power usage for the global data center market would grow 165% by 2030 relative to 2023. While data centers presently consume 55 gigawatts (GW) of power, Goldman Sachs Research projects that 122 GW of data center capacity will be online by the end of this decade.

“As data centers contribute to a growing need for power, the electric grid will require significant investment,” Goldman Sachs Research noted in February, estimating that such an increase in demand would necessitate $720 billion in new spending to expand electricity generation and transmission infrastructure. “These transmission projects can take several years to permit, and then several more to build, creating another potential bottleneck for data center growth if the regions are not proactive about this given the lead time,” noted James Schneider, a Goldman Sachs senior equity research analyst who focuses on US telecom, digital infrastructure, and IT services.

As federal permitting reform awaits further consideration in Congress and ultimately a floor vote, the recent changes included in Pennsylvania’s new budget, along with Congressman Tiffany’s comments on the gubernatorial campaign trail in Wisconsin, demonstrate there are actions that state officials can take in the near term to advance permitting reform that will help achieved the needed expansion. What’s more, the Keystone State’s new budget, like the recent congressional markup, also underscores the fact that permitting reform can garner bipartisan support and advance even where there is divided government.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/691f6523c471f0f86bae02aa/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-11-28 13:00:27.863298

While we’ve picked out some broadly positive points for industry around energy relief, skills investment, R&D backing, and infrastructure support, this is a budget that appears to have “fallen flat” with a number of leaders.

Has this Chancellor damaged her reputation with the business community to the point of no repair? Henry Anson, Director of The Manufacturer, appears briefly on this week’s episode to have his say.

While we rarely go as far to suggest any government policy is moronic, such impassioned criticism is saved for our ‘Made by a Moron’ section. This week – cable cars and Joe’s porcelain bathroom tiles.

The Budget

Wednesday’s Budget addressed the immediate financial pressures facing manufacturers. In response to calls from industry groups like Make UK, the government came forward with plans to cut electricity prices for manufacturing businesses.

From 2027, the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme (BICS), will reduce electricity bills for over 7,000 UK manufacturers by up to 25% for eligible businesses.

But questions are still unanswered over which companies qualify for this relief. So far, “frontier” industries like automotive and aerospace, and supply-chain/foundational sectors such as chemicals have been outlined.

And for the most energy-intensive firms, the existing support under the British Industry Supercharger is being boosted, with discounts on electricity network charges moving from 60% to 90% next year.

But eligibility rules aren’t yet final, with a consultation currently open. Critics of this point out that there are some companies that need energy relief immediately, to the point where they may no longer exist if help doesn’t come until 2027, or even next year.

The Budget continues to back the priorities of the government’s 10-year Industrial Strategy. That means sustained support for advanced manufacturing, clean energy, and associated growth industries.

Defence spending is set to increase, underscored by the government’s earlier commitment to intervene and save British Steel and buy British when it is crucial to national security.

There will also be extending support to the automotive industry’s zero-emission and next-gen technologies via the DRIVE 35 programme, increasing the capital & R&D funding envelope through 2035.

Some positive news was also given on apprenticeships, with the government allocating £725 million for the new Growth and Skills Levy.

Under the new Levy, for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), apprenticeships for people under 25 will be fully funded, meaning training costs will be covered with no co-investment required.

We asked leaders in industry for their reaction

Falling short on growth

Three leading figures from the sector have delivered a damning verdict on the Budget, warning it fails to address the fundamental challenges facing the industry.

Graham Corfield of Aviramp, Jennifer Hughes of Transicon, and Craig Pyser from AMufacture have their say.

Criticism varies from the opinions that taxes won’t lead to growth but will put further pressures on business, through to general economic outlook “remaining flat” within the sector.",https://themanufacturer-cdn-1.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/28103103/Main-Podcast-Cover.png,N,,2025-11-28 16:59:29.817913

“We agree that burying trash forever is not the perfect solution, but I’m often uncomfortable with unsolicited proposals that have no prior operating standard,” County Manager Chris Coudriet said at the commissioners’ Nov. 17 meeting. “I don’t believe that the county should be on the avant garde of how to deal with solid waste.”

However, Neil Williams and Stuart Cooke, behind MEP/EnviRemed Environmental, claim their proposal — essentially turning waste into a gas that can be converted into fuel — is supported by several environmental agencies and working in several locales.

“It’s a chance for the county to lead again, proving that environmental protection and economic strength can go hand-in-hand,” Cooke said.

Cooke — a local who is the brother of Brunswick County Commissioner Marty Cooke — told commissioners he has located two potential sites off N.C. Highway 421 for the proposed gasification facility, as well as a property just over the border in Brunswick County.

The representatives are seeking a contract with the county to dispose of landfill’s trash through gasification. The process uses a combination of electricity and high heat to break down trash to its molecular level — no burning involved — and convert it into syngas. The gas can then be used for fuel, electricity, hydrogen and more.

The process does create a byproduct called “slag,” which looks like glass or rock. Theoretically, this can be used in road-paving or other construction materials.

“The system is fully self-contained — no wastewater, no runoff, no contamination … air emissions are about 100 times lower than the federal standards, making this one of the cleanest waste energy systems in existence,” Cooke said.

He claimed 95% of what would go through its facility — municipal solid waste, hazardous waste, agricultural waste, medical waste, plastics, construction debris and sewer sludge — will be turned into gas. The remaining 5% will be delivered to the landfill.

Conserving landfill space is a draw for New Hanover County, whose landfill has an estimated 23 years left in its lifespan. Both expanding the landfill, if that’s even possible with New Hanover County’s dwindling available acreage, and trucking waste to other sites would come with high costs.

“My initial reaction is that this sounds great; it sounds like a very interesting proposition that I would like to explore further,” Commissioner Dane Scalise said.

Cooke shared his team has been working with the county on a proposal for more than a year — “just so that they could vet us as far as from their foxhole,” he said. The county asked the company to seek guidance from the North Carolina Division of Environmental Quality, which recommended the proposal for New Hanover County.

Commissioner Rob Zapple questioned whether Cooke had that in writing.

“That may be strong terminology,” Cooke countered. “I appreciate the question — what they did was they started skeptical. They brought everybody from all facets of their organization to a meeting that took three months, and we all had a large room, and they took us through the soup to nuts about what we’re proposing for New Hanover County. Based on that meeting, they said: ‘This sounds great, especially for an application like New Hanover County.’”

However, without county staff’s endorsement, the commissioners weren’t comfortable accepting solicitation without further staff research and identification of other solutions. Coudriet and Joe Suleyman, director of the county’s recycling and solid waste department, advocated for a wider call for proposals; additionally, Suleyman said he was concerned about the engineers’ ability to follow through on the proposed plan.

“We have not identified any comparable gasification facilities that process the amount of municipal solid waste being proposed, so the likelihood of success remains uncertain,” he said.

Cooke claimed the facility would be able to process the 1,000 tons coming into the county’s landfill per day, though Suleyman said that number is more like 2,000 in an 2023 interview.

There doesn’t appear to be a facility in the U.S. processing that amount. There is a demonstration plant in Durham, North Carolina, though the facility only processes municipal solid waste.

Cooke pointed to a Dubai gasification plant, the largest in the world, converting 6,000 tons a day to synthetic fuel. Another facility exists in Spain, processing 1,270 tons per day.

The technology is more emergent in the United States. Williams attributed it to a rise in diesel costs 10 years ago, from which the country is still recovering.

Aries Clean Technologies is planning to open a gasification plant to treat municipal wastewater in Linden, New Jersey, while an InEnTec plant converting waste to hydrogen was just finished in Arlington, Oregon. Both will process less than 1,000 tons a day.

These facilities often require high initial investments — the New Jersey gasification facility cost $65 million, $55 million of which were financed with tax-exempt bonds through the Union County Improvement Authority. Operational costs also remain hard to find, as the technology is in the beginning stages in the U.S.

However, the MEP/EnviRemed Environmental representatives said they are not looking for county investment.

“If anything were to happen to us at any time for any reason that we can no longer perform, you still have full control of your landfill,” Cooke said. “Nothing changes. You still continue to be able to operate just exactly as you do today.”

The commissioners and county staff agreed to keep the gasification proposal on the table for potential landfill solutions, Coudriet saying the goal is to identify a plan in the next six months to a year.

What is INA Solar’s current solar module manufacturing capacity? What are the company’s plans for solar cell manufacturing?

At INA Solar, we have always believed that innovation, quality, and scale are the pillars that define a world-class solar manufacturing company. Over the years, we have strategically built our manufacturing capabilities to cater to both India’s rapidly growing renewable energy requirements and the global solar market.

We operate three manufacturing units in Jaipur with a combined solar module production capacity of 5.5 GW. Our most recent facility at Sawarda, Jaipur, adds 4.5 GW of AI and robotics-driven capacity dedicated to high-efficiency TOPCon and mono PERC modules.

We are also investing in advanced architectures, such as TOPCon, M10R, and G12R, supported by a strong in-house R&D team focused on efficiency, durability, and sustainable manufacturing.

To expand upstream, INA Solar is developing a new plant in Madhya Pradesh with 4.5 GW of G12R N-Type TOPCon solar cell manufacturing capacity. Our total footprint is projected to reach 7 GW of modules, 4.5 GW of solar cells, and 18,000 MTA of aluminum frames.

What steps do you believe are essential to prepare India for the proposed ALMM mandate on wafers and ingots by 2028?

The proposed ALMM mandate on wafers and ingots by 2028 provides India with a crucial lead time to build a strong domestic upstream ecosystem. While short-term costs may rise due to limited local ingot-wafer capacity, the transition window enables manufacturers to scale sustainably.

To prepare for ALMM List-III, the essential steps include rapidly building domestic ingot-wafer capacity to reduce import reliance and balancing domestic and global supply during the transition.

We must also design lines that can handle multiple wafer sizes and specs, increase automation, yields, and cost efficiency, and work with MNRE to secure incentives and financing for upstream investments.

How do you view the current state of Indian solar manufacturing? What policy interventions or industry measures are needed to enhance global competitiveness?

India’s solar manufacturing sector has expanded rapidly over the past 18 to 24 months, driven largely by the production-linked incentive (PLI) program and strong growth in module production capacity. However, domestic manufacturing of cells, wafers, and ingots still falls short of market demand. Challenges such as fragmented supply chains and an inverted duty structure continue to put pressure on production costs and working capital for manufacturers.

Several policy interventions are needed to enhance global competitiveness. Addressing the inverted duty structure and input tax credit (ITC) blockage would significantly ease cash-flow constraints for manufacturers. Strengthening PLI support for upstream segments, such as ingots, wafers, and cells, is essential to achieving full value-chain integration. Stable ALMM timelines and consistent procurement rules would reduce uncertainty for investors and developers. Additionally, enabling low-cost, long-term financing for upstream projects and supporting exports through targeted incentives and trade diplomacy would help Indian manufacturers compete internationally.

On the industry side, companies must prioritize backward integration supported by strong global technology partnerships. Building flexible, standardized production lines, adopting higher levels of automation, improving yields, and meeting international certification standards will be critical to long-term competitiveness. Developing supplier clusters and localized ecosystems can help reduce dependency on imports, while investing in R&D and workforce skilling will strengthen technological self-reliance.

How will the recent reduction of GST on solar cells from 12% to 5% affect manufacturers, considering that issues related to the inverted duty structure and accumulated input tax credit persist?

The reduction in GST on solar cells from 12% to 5% is positive for boosting demand and reducing project costs. However, for manufacturers, the benefit is limited because the inverted duty structure remains unresolved.

Input materials, such as glass, EVA, backsheets, and frames, are still subject to a 12%-18% GST, while the final product is taxed at only 5%. This widens the gap between input tax paid and output tax collected, leading to large accumulated ITC, blocked working capital, higher effective production costs, and reduced margins, especially for small and mid-sized manufacturers.

So, while the GST cut supports installations, its impact on manufacturing competitiveness is minimal unless paired with solutions such as input GST rationalization or ITC refund mechanisms.

With ALMM mandates extending to cells, wafers, and ingots, do you foresee a potential shortage of skilled workers across the solar value chain? What measures are needed to develop technical talent at scale?

A talent shortage is likely as ALMM requirements expand to include cells, wafers, and ingots by 2028. India has strong expertise in module assembly, but the talent pool for the upstream stages of the solar value chain, such as ingot pulling, wafering, and advanced cell manufacturing, is relatively limited.

The key skill gaps include crystal growth, wafer slicing, cell manufacturing processes such as diffusion, metallization, and passivation, as well as automation and robotics, equipment maintenance, and advanced quality-control techniques.

To build talent at scale, India needs to establish dedicated solar manufacturing training centres with industry-led curricula tailored to upstream technologies. Strengthening collaboration between academia and industry through specialized electives, laboratory facilities, and apprenticeship programs will also be critical. Upskilling the existing module-line workforce through bridge programs and hands-on training can help create a pipeline of workers ready for more advanced manufacturing roles.

Forming technology partnerships with global leaders, particularly those that include embedded training modules, will accelerate capability building. Additionally, developing national skill standards and offering incentives for companies that invest in workforce development can help drive systematic improvement across the sector.

Frequent policy changes in solar manufacturing are often seen as a source of uncertainty. How do you think investors perceive this volatility, and what actions could help strengthen their confidence?

Yes, frequent policy changes in solar manufacturing creates uncertainty for investors. While the intent is positive, unpredictability in ALMM timelines, BCD/GST changes, and incentive structures affects long-term planning in a capital-intensive sector.

Investors generally view this volatility through several lenses. First, it creates ambiguity about demand because frequent shifts in ALMM and duty timelines make it difficult to forecast market conditions accurately. Second, sudden changes in tariffs or GST rates introduce financial unpredictability, disrupting cost models and affecting expected IRRs. Third, global partners tend to remain cautious when execution timelines or regulatory frameworks change frequently, which affects their confidence in market stability.

To strengthen investor confidence, several actions can be taken. Establishing a clear long-term policy roadmap, ideally spanning eight to ten years, for ALMM, duties, and incentives would provide much-needed visibility. Better coordination among MNRE, the Ministry of Finance, and the Directorate General of Foreign Trade could help prevent conflicting regulations. Providing stable duty and tax structures with multi-year visibility, along with resolved inverted duty issues, would further reduce uncertainty. Ensuring faster and more transparent PLI disbursement through time-bound approvals and payouts would also help.

Which solar module technologies is INA prioritizing? Which technologies are likely to gain prominence in India and globally in the near to mid-term?

INA Solar is prioritizing N-Type TOPCon technology as the next-generation standard for high-efficiency solar modules. Among the currently available technologies, such as PERC, N-Type TOPCon, and HJT, we believe N-Type TOPCon will capture a major market share and remain commercially viable for a longer tenure, owing to its higher efficiency, better temperature coefficient, and compatibility with existing PERC manufacturing infrastructure.

Ongoing technological advancements at the laboratory level are expected to strengthen N-Type TOPCon’s performance and process stability, ensuring continued support for existing infrastructure and protecting investors’ interests.

Within the N-Type family, INA Solar anticipates that G12R will be the leading format for large-scale adoption. Accordingly, the company has chosen to advance with G12R-based N-Type TOPCon technology and is in the process of establishing a 4.5 GW solar cell production facility at Narmadapuram, Madhya Pradesh.

From a broader perspective, N-Type TOPCon is expected to dominate both the Indian and global PV markets in the near to mid-term. At the same time, HJT and perovskite tandem technologies may gain traction over the longer term as manufacturing processes mature and become more cost-competitive.

Project developers often raise concerns about the quality of domestically manufactured solar modules. As a manufacturer, how do you address these concerns?

At INA Solar, we understand that quality is the most important factor for project developers. Our production lines are fully automated and equipped with advanced machinery, ensuring accuracy and consistency at every step. Each module undergoes several levels of inspection, from raw materials to the final product, ensuring that only the best reaches our customers.

We strictly follow internationally recognized standards, such as IEC, BIS, and ALMM, and our in-house testing facilities verify modules for performance, durability, and long-term reliability. Our R&D and quality teams collaborate closely with technology partners to continually improve materials and processes.

By maintaining transparency and traceability throughout production, we ensure our modules deliver the performance and reliability developers expect, demonstrating that Indian manufacturers can meet global quality standards.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Manish-Sir_recent-copy.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 16:59:33.066772

Just days after the official announcement, a group of pastors told WRAL they're worried about their community struggling to make ends meet this winter.

“Families are forced to make choices that they really don’t want to make. Do I take care of my family in terms of food, basic fundamental needs while we continue to see energy prices rise?” said Pastor Robert Walker-Smith with Progressive Missionary Baptist Church of Raleigh.

Congress did allocate around $4 billion for the LIHEAP program nationwide.

COP30 in Belém, Brazil, opened under a shadow of geopolitical absence and dwindling scientific optimism. For the first time, the US did not send a delegation, and both the US’ and China’s (the world’s largest emitters of CO2) heads of state were absent from the negotiations. At the same time, new research published just before the summit suggests that the 1.5°C (and even 2°C) targets are slipping out of reach. Against this backdrop, negotiations became long and tense, and ultimately delivered a shaky deal.

Phasing out fossil fuels: a partial pledge without a concrete roadmap

The summit’s final Belém Package stopped short of delivering a binding, time-bound roadmap for fossil fuel phase-out. While draft decisions had included specific references to said phase-out, the final decision refers only to the ‘UAE Consensus’ from COP28 in Dubai – vague language that lacks specificity and only commits to planning an eventual transition away from fossil fuel usage.

While over 80 countries supported an initiative to draw up a fossil fuel transition roadmap, this was ultimately relegated to an informal process, separate from the formal UN negotiating text. That omission represents a missed opportunity: Africa, which contributes only about 3% of global emissions yet bears disproportionate climate risk, cannot simply leap to a low-carbon future without a clear, financed pathway out of fossil dependency.

Nonetheless, there was grounds for cautious optimism: COP30 established a Just Transition Mechanism, meant to support regions whose economies rely heavily on fossil fuel revenues (among them African oil producers and exporters) through tailored packages for economic diversification, social protection for affected workers, and investment in skills, technology transfer and clean-energy industries.

Access to electricity and clean energy remains a sticking point

In Belém, the Action Agenda (COP30’s implementation-oriented framework that mobilises non-party actors such as businesses, cities, investors, civil society and subnational governments) saw a wave of voluntary commitments. Public utility companies pledged $66 billion annually for renewables, and $82 billion for transmission and storage – important, concrete steps toward closing Africa’s and developing regions’ energy access gaps.

Yet the absence of a firm, legally binding fossil fuel phase-out undermines the clarity and security of the transition. Africa needs not only private and philanthropic pledges but predictable concessional finance and policy guarantees that can support off-grid, utility-scale, and mini-grid clean energy systems for underserved populations.

Just a day after the closing of COP30, this year’s G20 summit hosted in Johannesburg, South Africa, from 22-23 November 2025 (making it the first G20 summit on African soil), emphasised strengthening climate resilience, disaster recovery and adaptation in Africa. G20 leaders endorsed the Mission 300 partnership between the World Bank and the AfDB to provide electricity to 300 million Africans by 2030 and expand access to clean cooking.

The G20’s final declaration also welcomed the voluntary, non-binding G20 Critical Minerals Framework, aimed at strengthening sustainable and resilient mineral value chains and increasing local processing and investment in developing, mineral-rich countries.

Major wins for adaptation finance and the Global Goal on Adaptation

COP30 delivered several major wins on the adaptation agenda:

• Increasing adaptation finance: Parties agreed to ‘at least triple’ adaptation finance by 2035.

• Baku Adaptation Roadmap: The Belém Package formalised a roadmap for 2026-2028, laying the groundwork for greater coherence and implementation until the next Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement.

• Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA): For the first time, a set of 59 voluntary, non-prescriptive indicators was agreed, covering water, food, health, ecosystems, infrastructure, livelihoods, finance, capacity, and technology.

• Tropical Rainforest Forever Fund (TFFF): This Brazil-led initiative, from which African rainforests would benefit as well, launched with $6.6 billion, making it the largest financial instrument of its kind.

However, the financing commitment is deferred to 2035, and the indicators remain voluntary, which risks dilution, uneven application, and under-resourced national plans. Without strong follow-through, Africa may once again be left behind in translating resilience goals into concrete protection for its most climate-vulnerable communities.

Scaling-up and reform of international climate finance architecture reconfirmed

Africa’s loss and damage needs received acknowledgment: COP30 operationalised and confirmed replenishment cycles for the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage, with payouts to affected countries starting in 2026. But for many African states, loss and damage is not future risk, but represents acute reality. This funding window must be scaled rapidly and disbursed with direct access, transparency and speed.

On the wider finance architecture, COP30 reconfirmed the scaling-up of climate finance flows to $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 through the Baku-to-Belém Roadmap. The roadmap outlines five priority ‘Rs’:

• Replenishing grants and concessional capital,

• Rebalancing debt sustainability,

• Rechanneling private finance,

• Revamping capacity,

• Reshaping the global system for more equitable flows.

Crucially for Africa, the Belém Package calls for reform of multilateral development banks, enhanced role for grant-based instruments, blended finance, guarantees and debt-for-climate swaps. These proposals echo the continent’s pre-COP demands for a fairer financial architecture, not only more monetary pledges.

Still, critics warn the roadmap risks being non-binding if not backed by strong accountability mechanisms. To deliver for Africa and other developing regions, the pledge must translate into trustable flows, manageable terms, and accessible structures.",https://mo.ibrahim.foundation/core/misc/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-28 12:00:27.846792

The collaboration utilises a facility powered by wind energy, underscoring a growing trend of using renewable-powered data centres for energy-intensive operations like bitcoin mining and AI.

It also enhances Soluna's portfolio as a developer of renewable-powered data centres and aids Canaan’s expansion in North America by providing access to cost-effective and dependable infrastructure.

“Soluna is thrilled to develop this new partnership with an industry leader like Canaan,” explains John Belizaire, CEO of Soluna.

""This agreement reflects our shared commitment to delivering high-performance computing solutions powered by renewable energy. With Project Dorothy 2 now online and operational, we're doubling down on our mission to make renewable energy a global superpower.”

Prioritising efficiency

The deployment is scheduled for the first quarter of 2026 and will feature Canaan’s Avalon A15 XP miners, representing approximately one exahash per second (EH/s) of computing power.

These miners are designed for operational efficiency, which aligns with Soluna’s sustainability goals. Their installation at the wind-powered Project Dorothy facility reinforces the focus on renewable energy shared by both companies.

Project Dorothy operates primarily using behind-the-meter wind power, meaning it uses electricity generated on-site. The approach avoids transmitting the power through the main electrical grid.

The facility also maintains a connection to the grid, which helps ensure operational stability and constant uptime – allowing consistent performance while managing costs.

“Our partnership with Soluna is another significant step in advancing our North American self-mining strategy,” says Nangeng Zhang, Chairman and CEO of Canaan. “Each of the partnerships that we have entered into brings a new dimension to our efforts to expand within the region, and we are excited to work with Soluna and utilise their cutting-edge data centre.”

Nangeng continues: “The site primarily runs on behind-the-meter wind power but can also draw from the grid to ensure very high uptime. This is a unique advantage that combines reliable operations with compelling cost efficiency.

“Coupling our efficient and resilient Avalon A15 XP miners with Soluna's infrastructure should be a win for both companies.”

Monetising green energy with digital infrastructure

Project Dorothy is a component of Soluna’s larger strategy to build out its renewable-powered digital infrastructure. The company is currently developing over 2.8GW of renewable computing projects.

Each project is designed to monetise surplus clean energy by providing power for high-compute operations such as bitcoin mining and AI.

By matching renewable energy generation with computational demand, Soluna addresses two distinct challenges.

The first is the curtailment of renewable energy, a situation where excess power is generated but cannot be utilised by the grid.

The second is the increasing need for scalable infrastructure capable of hosting energy-intensive digital processes. The Texas facility serves as a practical example of how renewable-powered data centres can meet the computational demands of advanced technologies while supporting sustainability targets.

Strategic partnership for North American expansion

For Soluna, this collaboration with Canaan is an important step in scaling its renewable-powered business model. With its Project Dorothy 2 site now operational, Soluna is using partnerships with technology firms as a central part of its strategy to monetise its growing capacity pipeline.

The agreement also supports Canaan’s goal of strengthening its presence in North America, where demand for efficient blockchain infrastructure is growing.

By partnering with renewable energy operators like Soluna, Canaan secures access to sustainable and cost-effective locations for deploying its advanced hardware.

Both organisations share an objective to demonstrate that energy-intensive digital workloads can be supported by renewable energy at a significant scale.

Their joint effort illustrates how industry partnerships can lead to the development of efficient and environmentally conscious infrastructure.

Through Project Dorothy, Soluna and Canaan show that high-performance computing and sustainability can be compatible objectives, setting a precedent for future digital infrastructure powered by clean energy.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/d87d9c907e4fb006b328833b6444e0bb:da2304cf11e83acdc63425cc2d075b11/soluma.webp.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 12:00:31.645483

Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) introduced legislation on Nov. 20 that would prohibit the use of federal funds or tax credits to support solar panel development on productive farmland. The Protecting American Farmland Act mirrors legislation introduced in the House in May by Rep. Dave Taylor (R-OH). The bills effectively reverse tax and funding support for solar investments created under President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

Solar Arrays Undermining US Farmers

More than mere ideological posturing is at stake. Lucrative government subsidies and tax credits created by the Inflation Reduction Act distorted agricultural markets across many regions of the country as solar developers competed with crop farmers for land purchases and leases. The income from solar field arrays, augmented by government support, far exceeded the earnings of commodity farmers, pushing up land and lease costs.

It is not clear if Biden intended to displace actual farmers for sun-collecting technologies justified by a supposed carbon dioxide-fueled climate crisis, but that has been the effect. Farmers were already struggling with high costs for fertilizers, equipment, and especially land. Driving up land prices and lease costs prioritized solar panels above food production.

For years, greenwashing – when an organization or manufacturer promotes or advertises a product as being more environmentally friendly than it truly is – has employed the misnomer “solar farms” to refer to vast ground-mounted facilities that displace food-growing farms. Greenwashing articles crowed about the benefits to soils and biodiversity from solar installations, and others touted sheep grazing under the shade of solar arrays as a nifty efficiency.

A Greenwashing Ruse

But this has been, as President Donald Trump has rightly called it, a scam. Improved soil health and biodiversity result not from installing solar panels but from ceasing to apply pesticides and glyphosate to the land. Pollinators return, plant diversity soars, and soils are replenished by decaying plant matter. The solar panels have nothing to do with this effect, though one day they will have to be disposed of – an ecotoxic nightmare never discussed in the literature.

The idyllic pics of sheep grazing under the comfort of (likely Chinese-manufactured and US taxpayer-funded) solar panels are a similar greenwashing ruse. It’s not like sheep need housing made of sheets of plastic tech manufactured using massive coal plants: They do fine under trees or wooden structures for shade. Sheep flocks in the United States have been steadily declining for decades, and most Americans don’t even eat lamb. There are not nearly enough sheep in the nation to service the explosion of solar arrays constructed. The idea that solar panels will “coexist” with food production is just a marketing palliative for solar installers, investors, and manufacturers.

One doesn’t see pictures of cows under solar panels because they either don’t fit or they’d rub against and destroy the things. Presumably, that would be called a “solar stampede,” and it wouldn’t be profitable for the investors who are raping US farmland for short-term profits.

Reducing Food Inflation Requires Investment in Farmers

It takes years to reclaim neglected farmland, and very little time to make it unusable with technocratic graft like the Inflation Reduction Act, which even Biden conceded was really about funding renewable energy, not reducing inflation. Food prices increase when farmland prices rise, as farmers pass along rising land and lease costs to commodity prices and in turn to grocery store shelves. Consumers will blame Trump for the result of Biden’s ill-considered renewable energy spending spree.

The Protecting American Farmland Act eliminates several favorable tax benefits for investors in solar projects. However, the changes are prospective: Existing installations are grandfathered and will continue to receive taxpayer subsidies while farmers sit out in the cold.",https://www.libertynation.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2241255015-solar.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 15:00:38.715354

That’s what it means to build power: build organizations to reach people and change political outcomes.","Tom Steyer is a good man, but his new gubernatorial campaign ignores how to build real power

It seems like everyone and his brother-in-law is running for California Governor nowadays, and a week ago we got another one: progressive billionaire and climate champion Tom Steyer. One might think that this should be cause for celebration from environmentalists.

Steyer is a good man. He has poured money into progressive causes and charities, as well as important state ballot measures. He has put the climate agenda front and center. So then what’s the problem?

In short, the problem is power.

It takes time and resources to build power. Elections are not won on Election Day – they are won weeks, months, and years (and sometimes even decades) in advance.

They are not won by individual campaigns for specific offices.

That is especially true in Deep Blue California. Consider me skeptical that a Steyer Governorship will be that much different from, say, a Swalwell Governorship, or a Villaraigosa Governorship, or a Yee Governorship, or a Porter Governorship, or even a Newsom Governorship (although unlike Newsom Steyer will not go out of his way to throw powerless minorities under the bus).

What does it mean to build power? It means building mechanisms that change politics. It means being someone like, say Harlan Crow – whom no one had heard of until it became clear that he has been bankrolling Clarence Thomas for years. More importantly, Crow has built institutions: he founded the Club For Growth, which has made the Republican Party’s central policy dogma advancing tax breaks for billionaires, and which invests in right-wing candidates through the country. He has served on the board of the American Enterprise Institute. The Koch Brothers are famous for doing the same sorts of activities: they founded the Cato Institute, Americans for Prosperity and Citizens for a Sound Economy. And of course they have also bankrolled such climate-denying institutions as the Heartland Institute, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Pacific Legal Foundation, and the American Legislative Exchange Council. Those institutions exist, and are powerful, and wield enormous influence electorally

Now, it’s not like Steyer doesn’t do these things, but not nearly as much. Back in 2013, he began a youth-oriented political organizing institution, NextGen Climate (now NextGen America), but seems to have lost interest in it several years ago. He is not mentioned on its website. A Google search finds only two references to it in the last year – a time when organizing has been incredibly crucial. A mobilize.us search comes up completely empty for the organization. His efforts are mostly one-offs: when the Koch Brothers attempted to repeal California’s climate law through the ballot box, Steyer organized against it and cleaned their clocks.

But then he got distracted, running for President in 2020, spending a quarter of a billion dollars on his campaign, placing seventh in Iowa, and sixth in New Hampshire, and not garnering a single delegate.

Just think about what that quarter of a billion dollars could have done, and still could do, if it were focused not on a particular race.

Let me give an example: precinct chairs.

In Texas – a state where Democrats must become competitive in order to build a pro-environmental majority – precinct chairs are a big deal. They organize voting on a neighborhood level and (try) to get people to vote. As Michelle H. Davis explained last year:

One Texas County in 2018 did an experiment on which voters were contacted and which weren’t.

70% of voters contacted by their precinct chair turned out to vote.

In precincts where there was no chair, and voters weren’t contacted, only 38% of voters showed up to vote.

This is why precinct chairs are paramount in flipping Texas.

There are more than 4,000 GOP precinct chairs in Texas, and roughly 3,000 Democratic ones. So right there, you can see that the Republican Party is out-organizing the Democrats. What’s more, says Davis:

The Republican Party treats precinct chairs as royalty. Precinct Chairs have tons of support and training and are highly regarded within the GOP. Texas Republicans throw balls for precinct chairs and give out awards. Many GOP precinct chair races are competitive, meaning multiple people run for one chair position.

The GOP’s precinct chair strategy also involves rigorous training on recruiting and involving neighbors. Within a precinct, the chair usually has block captains and up to five volunteers, getting the word out about elections and getting to the polls.

The Democratic Party – not so much. And that is why we just keep missing in Texas. We are getting beaten on the ground. As Davis notes, Texas isn’t a red state: it’s a non-voting state. If we can get more people there to vote, we can win.

That would require money. A lot of money. And a lot of money spent the right way – not on fancy consultants who cream off funds spend on television ads, but on actually organizing people on the ground. Hmmmm….where could that money come from? Perhaps from someone who wasted a quarter of billion dollars in 2020, and looks to do the same in 2026.

That’s what it means to build power: build organizations to reach people and change political outcomes. It does not mean to run what looks sadly like a sort of vanity race where the policy and political differences between Democrats lie between the 49-yard lines, and Freud’s notion of the Narcissism of Small Differences will become a central there.

The Koch Brothers and Harlan Crow and Elon Musk and Peter Thiel and the rest of them want to dominate government and turn the country and world into some sort of Ayn Randian dystopia. But they are (or in David Koch’s case, were) thinking about how to do this. They understood that they didn’t need to run for office to do it, and it was better for them not to run for office to do it. Better to own politicians than to be one. Elon Musk didn’t run for office: he bought Twitter and turned it into a supercharger for resurgent American Nazism. The Office doesn’t matter. Power does.

Look, I like Steyer. A lot. As I said, he’s a good man, and not stupid. He’s done a lot of really good work. If he turns out to be the last Democrat standing, I will gladly support him and work for him – I might even do it if he is only one of two last Democrats standing. But the environment will not win this way. The climate will not heal this way. And we are running out of time.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Tom_Steyer_by_Gage_Skidmore-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 13:00:51.037350

Energy affordability was the leading kitchen-table issue for the recent gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey — though the governors-elect’s policies are suspect.
However, during the same period, New Jersey’s electricity generation decreased by 13% while Pennsylvania’s increased by 5%.
And that’s what legislation like the Affordable, Reliable, and Clean Energy Security Act accomplishes: It reflects the voters’ desire to balance cost with reliability and environmental stewardship.","This is no accident: Electricity costs are skyrocketing, and affordability is top of mind for Americans. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reports average retail revenues per kWh increased in 46 states since last August. Those rates vary significantly from state to state, from a 23% increase in Maine to an 8% decrease in Hawaii.

Looking at American households, residential electricity rates alone rose by 6% over the last three months.

And this isn’t a recent phenomenon. The National Center for Energy Analytics points out that, since the beginning of 2010, the average change in residential electric prices increased by 63%.

What’s driving these double-digit increases? Customers are now experiencing the full impact of decades of divestment from reliable energy generation in favor of intermittent and costly substitutes. For decades, states have engaged in a green-tinted race to the bottom, competing over clean-energy credentials. States have increasingly imposed mandates for renewable energy and insisted that intermittent power from the sun and the wind was the most affordable option.

But in practice, this transition gave us higher rates and a fragile grid. Over the last five years, an alarming number of grid crises have rocked communities nationwide. Major events included the California heat wave in 2020, Winter Storm Uri in Texas in 2021, and Winter Storm Elliot in the mid-Atlantic in 2022. Elliot, though mild compared to other storms, revealed weak points in Pennsylvania’s grid.

Faced with no heat in the depths of winter or air conditioning in the height of summer, it didn’t take long for the consensus on clean and green to shift to reliable and affordable.

But rather than present a realistic correction, several elected leaders opted to scapegoat. Last December, five governors sued PJM Interconnection, claiming the grid operator failed to take steps to bring down prices. However, the prices these governors railed against were the predictable result of supply shortages stemming from their misguided policies, such as enforcing costly climate-related mandates and prematurely closing fossil fuel power plants.

Even blue-state governors have reversed course on the “clean is king” myth. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul approved a new gas pipeline through her state “to ensure grid reliability and affordability.” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has touted lower costs as a major goal of the latest energy reform bill that ends the state’s moratorium on new nuclear generation. Energy affordability was the leading kitchen-table issue for the recent gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey — though the governors-elect’s policies are suspect.

Clean and green is no longer the consensus as residents begin to question when the rising rates will end.

In Pennsylvania, the pivot away from carbon taxes to spur clean energy was clear when the recent state budget eliminated the years-long effort to enter the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the multistate compact that caps emissions from power producers and sells “allowances” to them.

But the cap-and-trade scheme proved to be politically untenable. Economic forecasts showed that RGGI would increase electricity bills by 30%. Also, even with RGGI, forecasts showed increased carbon emissions across the PJM grid. Despite his best efforts to keep RGGI alive, Gov. Josh Shapiro relented, agreeing to withdraw his appeal to a lower court’s ruling that rightly stated RGGI was an unconstitutional tax—a noteworthy first for any state considering such a compact.

Clean is no longer top of mind, but affordability is. Poll after poll reveals a growing concern among voters about their ability to afford their utility bills.

Fortunately, Pennsylvania can show the way. In fact, the Keystone State pulled off the unimaginable: It cut emissions while also increasing electricity generation. Pennsylvania’s Independent Fiscal Office found that, from 2019 to 2024, the commonwealth removed seven million metric tons of carbon emissions — roughly the same amount cut by its RGGI neighbor to the east, New Jersey. However, during the same period, New Jersey’s electricity generation decreased by 13% while Pennsylvania’s increased by 5%.

With numbers like that, who needs RGGI?

Pennsylvania demonstrates that “affordability” and “clean” aren’t mutually exclusive terms. It is possible to have the best of both worlds.

And that’s what legislation like the Affordable, Reliable, and Clean Energy Security Act accomplishes: It reflects the voters’ desire to balance cost with reliability and environmental stewardship. Lucky for us, that’s precisely what markets can do.

Central to this shift is the rise of the net-zero factory, a facility designed to operate with zero net greenhouse gas emissions, often powered by renewable energy, optimized for efficiency, and built for sustainability. While fully verified net-zero factories remain rare, a growing number of US-based manufacturers are designing or retrofitting plants to meet these ambitious environmental goals.

From high-tech gigafactories to smart retrofits of legacy plants, US industry is beginning to align production with sustainability. This movement is not only about compliance or public relations, it’s increasingly about competitiveness, operational efficiency, and long-term value. Below are eight standout factories and plants across the United States that are leading the charge in net-zero manufacturing and redefining what sustainable industry looks like in practice.

1. Schneider Electric

The Lexington plant of Schneider Electric in Kentucky has been recognized as a “Sustainability Lighthouse” by the World Economic Forum. This facility uses Internet of Things technology, advanced energy management systems, and predictive analytics to drastically cut energy usage and emissions.

The plant has achieved a 26 percent reduction in energy use, a 30 percent drop in CO₂ emissions, and a 20 percent decrease in water consumption. These metrics align closely with net-zero goals and demonstrate how digitalization can drive sustainable manufacturing practices.

The Lexington factory sets a benchmark for older plants aiming to become net-zero without needing to rebuild from scratch. Its performance shows how retrofitted facilities can lead the way in reducing industrial emissions.

2. Tesla

Tesla’s Gigafactory in Storey County, Nevada, is a high-profile example of a facility designed with sustainability in mind. It produces lithium-ion battery packs and electric drivetrains and is part of Tesla’s broader clean energy ecosystem.

Originally intended to be powered entirely by renewable energy, the factory is surrounded by large-scale solar arrays and is transitioning toward full energy independence. Its modular design allows for continued expansion while maintaining a focus on sustainable operations.

Gigafactory Nevada represents a major step toward creating self-sufficient, low-emission production at scale, one of the defining traits of a modern net-zero factory.

3. Toyota Motor North America

Toyota has committed to reaching carbon neutrality across its operations by 2035. This includes its US-based manufacturing sites, such as Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky and its new battery plant in North Carolina.

These facilities are being retooled to transition to 100 percent renewable electricity. Toyota is also integrating electrified equipment, renewable natural gas, and hydrogen fuel cells into its operations.

As part of its environmental strategy, Toyota is not only focused on reducing emissions but on designing a more circular and resource-efficient manufacturing process. These efforts position its US factories as future net-zero leaders in automotive manufacturing.

4. The US Battery Belt

The rise of the US Battery Belt, a string of lithium-ion battery factories across the South and Midwest, is reshaping the industrial landscape. Over 30 such plants are now in various stages of construction or operation.

Many of these facilities are being designed to use clean energy, with companies like SK On, Panasonic, and Ford committing to sourcing renewable power for their operations. For example, Ford’s BlueOval City in Tennessee will include a massive battery facility developed with SK On and is planned to operate with minimal emissions.

This regional boom in clean battery manufacturing reflects the broader shift toward net-zero manufacturing across the US clean tech sector.

5. Scalable sustainability

Beyond large-scale brand names, many small and medium US manufacturers are adopting lean manufacturing principles that align closely with net-zero goals. These practices include waste reduction, resource optimization, and energy efficiency.

Facilities that follow these strategies, sometimes referred to as “lean and green,” may not advertise themselves as net-zero factories, but they are actively reducing emissions through operational excellence.

6. Broad industry momentum

Nearly 45 percent of US manufacturers have set formal sustainability or net-zero goals, according to recent reports. These facilities span industries such as consumer goods, automotive, aerospace, and industrial components.

While many are in the early stages of transition, their public commitments to reach net-zero by 2030 or 2040 reflect a growing industry consensus. Facilities are upgrading their systems, installing renewables, and embedding emissions tracking to stay on course.

This growing wave of corporate commitments is transforming net-zero from a niche ambition into a mainstream operational standard.

7. New-build factories designed for net-zero

Newly constructed manufacturing sites have a unique advantage, the ability to design for sustainability from day one. Across the US, companies are building plants that integrate renewable energy, smart systems, and high-efficiency infrastructure right from the blueprint phase.

Examples include renewable-powered data centers, hydrogen-ready cement plants, and vertically integrated solar panel production lines. These factories are not retrofitted for sustainability, they are born into it.

Such facilities are essential models for future industrial development as net-zero standards become embedded in planning, permitting, and financing processes.

8. Sector-wide decarbonization

Beyond individual plants, industry-wide efforts are accelerating sustainable manufacturing across the US. Initiatives like the Department of Energy’s Industrial Decarbonization Roadmap and private-public partnerships are enabling cleaner production across multiple sectors.

Large-scale programs are supporting factory electrification, carbon capture, material innovation, and circular production. As these programs scale up, more factories will be supported in making the leap toward net-zero.

Two Gulf Coast megaprojects have already broken ground in 2025, signaling a surge in demand for liquid natural gas (LNG) construction.

Total North American LNG export capacity is forecasted to more than double by 2028.

Global LNG demand is projected to rise 40% from 2024 to 2030, but oversupply is possible by the end of the decade.

The Gulf Coast region is experiencing a surge in construction driven by the development of liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructure. Including, for example, two Texas megaprojects (construction projects worth $1 billion and up) that broke ground this year across the region.

The first megaproject is a $2 billion, 400-mile LNG pipeline aimed at expanding export access while also supporting the state’s growing power plant and data center demands. The second is Sempra’s $14 billion expansion of the Port Arthur LNG production facility.

This investment wave is a response to projected global LNG demand growth of nearly 40% from 2024 to 2030, according to BloombergNEF.

Multiple additional projects worth billions more are targeting construction start dates before the end of 2026, creating potential opportunities for Gulf Coast construction firms.

Drivers Behind the LNG Expansion

US production of natural gas doubled over the period from 2004 to 2024 as it became an increasingly important energy source on the global market. LNG serves as a cleaner alternative to coal and a reliable backup for renewable energy sources.

This graph shows the total yearly dry production of natural gas in the United States from 2004 to 2024, in Millions of Cubic Feet. Image: ConstructConnect

The growth in demand for natural gas on the global stage is largely driven by Asia, with economies like China, India, and Thailand experiencing rapid growth, according to BloombergNEF. Europe also contributes to demand as nations reduce dependence on Russian gas supplies.

Domestically, natural gas is being used to provide power to Data Centers, which have eclipsed $30 billion in construction starts value so far this year, according to the ConstructConnect Data Center Report.

An example of this usage can be seen in Meta’s data center operations in Louisiana, where energy provider Entergy plans to build natural gas power plants to supply energy to the Meta facility.

Future of LNG

Near-term liquified natural gas production and transport investment has been substantial, providing potential opportunities for Gulf Coast-based construction firms.

According to the US Energy Information Administration, North American LNG export capacity is on pace to more than double by 2028. This includes several substantial projects that remain in development, including a multi-billion-dollar Entergy natural gas plant in Louisiana, according to ConstructConnect Project Intelligence.

However, the International Energy Agency estimates the global LNG market will be notably oversupplied by 2030. This suggests the project pipeline may thin some after the near-term buildout concludes.

Firms specializing in LNG work should closely monitor these trends and prepare strategies to diversify their project pipeline or pivot if investment volumes decline.

It was just about two weeks ago that 201 new EV chargers were announced for installation at Michigan apartment complexes. Another EV charger installation project in Michigan was just announced — over 40 fast chargers in Detroit.

The first site is in Canton, Michigan, at a property owned by the real estate developer Dabaja Brothers Development Group. “We started this project because we saw a gap in our community—there was almost nowhere to charge an EV in Canton, and a similar lack of charging across metro Detroit. Together with ChargePoint, we are bringing fast, reliable charging to the community, better enabling us to serve all of our customers,” said Yousef Dabaja, owner/operator at Dabaja Brothers Development Group.

The Detroit area has some charging deserts, and Canton is one of them, hence the new fast charger installation there. Lavonia and Dearborn are two of the other planned sites that will use ChargePoint fast charging stations.

“In total, Dabaja intends to deploy more than 40 ports with more planned across its locations, enabling EV drivers to charge quickly and easily while they shop, dine, or visit local attractions. Each site will feature ChargePoint Express Plus fast charging stations. All stations will be managed by the new ChargePoint Platform, ChargePoint’s next-generation, flexible software solution designed provide real-time insights, monitor performance, adjust pricing, and respond to customer needs.”

While some people don’t think the installation of dozens of new EV chargers is newsworthy, these projects do matter to the people who live locally and travel to and through the areas where the new chargers will be. This fact is true especially in charging deserts. Going from no chargers to even just several means the distance EV drivers must travel to find a charge is decreased significantly, so they have less risk of “range anxiety” and are capable of conveniently driving to more places.

The Cinovec lithium project contributes to European strategic autonomy objectives by establishing domestic production capacity within politically stable EU borders. This geographic positioning addresses supply chain vulnerabilities associated with import dependency from geopolitically distant regions.

Strategic Autonomy Contributions:

• Import Substitution: Reducing reliance on Chinese processing facilities and South American raw materials

• Regional Value Chain: Supporting European battery manufacturing ecosystems through local sourcing

• Technology Control: Retaining processing expertise and intellectual property within EU jurisdiction

• Currency Stability: Euro-denominated transactions reducing exchange rate risks for European manufacturers

Industrial Ecosystem Development

Domestic lithium production enables European battery manufacturers to develop integrated supply chains that reduce transportation costs, improve delivery reliability, and enhance quality control throughout production processes.

The project's location provides direct access to automotive manufacturing centres in Germany, Slovakia, and Poland, creating potential for just-in-time delivery systems that improve manufacturing efficiency and reduce inventory costs.

Geopolitical Risk Mitigation:

• Political Stability: EU regulatory framework protection and legal system reliability

• Transportation Security: Domestic logistics networks reducing maritime shipping dependencies

• Trade Policy Insulation: Protection from international trade disputes affecting lithium imports

• Emergency Reserves: Potential contribution to European strategic materials stockpiling systems

What Challenges Could Impact Project Execution?

Despite strong governmental support and strategic designation, the Cinovec lithium project faces operational challenges typical of large-scale mining developments that could affect timeline and cost projections.

Technical and Operational Risks:

• Construction Cost Inflation: Global equipment and materials price volatility affecting capital estimates

• Skilled Labour Competition: Regional competition for specialised mining and processing expertise

• Environmental Compliance: Evolving EU environmental standards and monitoring requirements

• Technology Integration: Coordination challenges between processing systems and existing infrastructure

Market and Financial Considerations

Long-term lithium price volatility and evolving battery technology could impact project economics over its projected operational lifespan. Solid-state battery development or alternative energy storage technologies might affect demand projections and pricing assumptions.

However, recent market developments have shown significant investor confidence, with some companies experiencing substantial share price increases following positive project announcements.

Regulatory Evolution Risks:

• Environmental Standards: Potential tightening of EU mining and processing regulations

• Community Relations: Ongoing stakeholder engagement requirements and potential opposition

• International Trade: Changes in global trade policies affecting European lithium markets

• Technology Standards: Evolving battery chemistry requirements affecting product specifications

Risk Management Approaches

The joint venture structure with state-controlled CEZ provides stability against political and regulatory risks whilst European Metals Holdings contributes international expertise in managing technical and operational challenges.

Government grant funding reduces financial exposure to construction cost overruns and market volatility during development phases, improving project resilience against external economic pressures.

The company delivered record volumes across its CNG Fuels station network, sharply higher earnings and an upgraded full-year outlook, while confirming it is considering an uplisting or dual listing in 2026.

Dispensed biomethane volumes rose 15 per cent year on year, driven by increased adoption from fleet operators and the first introduction of 6×2 CNG trucks into UK operations.

CNG Fuels generated EBITDA of GBP 2.9 million for the quarter, up 190 per cent on the same period last year, reflecting both stronger utilisation and continuing demand growth as operators shift away from diesel.

While saving money for fossil fuel companies, the delay on the rule could lead to 3.8 million more tons of methane entering the atmosphere, according to the Trump administration’s own estimates.
“After years of scientific work and public engagement, this administration’s decision to delay methane pollution standards implementation yet again is a blatant act of climate denial and disregard for public health.
The EPA’s job is to protect people, not pad the pockets of oil and gas executives,” said Pagel.
“Children in my community and across the nation need a strong and comprehensive oil and gas methane rule as soon as possible,” said Patrice Tomcik, senior national field director for Moms Clean Air Force.","With methane more than 28 times as potent as carbon at trapping heat in the atmosphere in a 100-year period, climate experts agree that reducing methane leaks from oil and gas fields would be one of the fastest and most effective ways of making a measurable impact on planetary heating—but President Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday flatly refused to do so, instead announcing a delay on a requirement for fossil fuel companies to limit methane emissions.

The Biden administration had introduced the requirement for oil and gas firms to begin reducing their emissions this year, but the EPA said companies will now have until January 2027 to comply with the rule. The administration is also considering repealing the requirement entirely.

Lauren Pagel, policy director for Earthworks, called the delay “indefensible and illegal.”

“The Trump administration has once again chosen polluters over people, sacrificing the health of communities and climate to serve the fossil fuel industry,” said Pagel. “Every day national methane rules are delayed means more methane in the air, more toxic pollution in our lungs, and more irreversible climate damage.”

The EPA claimed it was providing companies with a “more realistic timeline” for complying with the requirement, and said the action would “save an estimated $750 million over 11 years in compliance costs.”

Methane can leak from oil and gas wells, pipelines, and other fossil fuel infrastructure, and companies often intentionally release methane through flaring. The fossil fuel industry is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the US, where emissions of methane have risen sharply in recent years as the Biden administration oversaw record production of oil and gas, even as it sought to reduce emissions through the methane requirement and other regulations.

While saving money for fossil fuel companies, the delay on the rule could lead to 3.8 million more tons of methane entering the atmosphere, according to the Trump administration’s own estimates.

“After years of scientific work and public engagement, this administration’s decision to delay methane pollution standards implementation yet again is a blatant act of climate denial and disregard for public health. The EPA’s job is to protect people, not pad the pockets of oil and gas executives,” said Pagel.

In addition to contributing to global heating and the extreme flooding, hurricanes, heatwaves, and other destructive weather events that come with it, methane emissions are linked to higher ground-level ozone pollution made up of tiny particles that can cause respiratory and cardiac problems, cancer, and strokes.

Grace Smith, senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), noted that the methane standards have already been working “to reduce pollution, protect people’s health, and prevent the needless waste of American energy”—progress that will now be reversed by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and Trump.

“The rule released today means millions of Americans will be exposed to dangerous pollution for another year and a half, for no good reason,” said Smith. “Delaying the methane standards threatens people’s health and undermines progress by industry leaders.”

“What’s more, the Trump administration rushed to push through this harmful rule without meaningful transparency or a chance for the public to weigh in,” added Smith. “EDF is already in court challenging EPA’s first attempt to delay these vital protections. We will continue to oppose the rule released today, so that people can breathe cleaner air.”

EDF and the grassroots group Moms Clean Air Force expressed particular concern over nearly 18 million people in the US who live near active oil and gas wells.

“Children in my community and across the nation need a strong and comprehensive oil and gas methane rule as soon as possible,” said Patrice Tomcik, senior national field director for Moms Clean Air Force.

EDF noted that “proven, cost-effective solutions are available to help oil and gas operators meet the standards while reducing waste and monetary losses,” and both large and small producers have expressed support for the federal methane regulation as fossil fuel-producing states have begun implementing the standards.

The rule announced Wednesday, said EDF, “ignores the strong opposition to the rule from members of impacted communities and wide variety of other Americans.”",https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=62254800&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C166%2C0%2C167,N,,2025-11-28 12:00:50.598974

Exxon has already sued the state of California over its new emissions rules, arguing they would mandate that the company “serve as a mouthpiece for ideas with which it disagrees.”","An emergency appeal filed in recent weeks by the US and California Chambers of Commerce, as well as the American Farm Bureau Federation, the Los Angeles County Business Federation, the Central Valley Business Federation, and the Western Growers Association, accuses the Golden State of waging an “open campaign to force companies into the public debate on climate issues” and “pressure [firms] to alter their behavior.”

The letter’s authors complain that lawmakers are attempting to “make sure that the public actually knows who’s green and who isn’t.”

California’s new laws, set to go into effect January 1, 2026, will require larger companies operating in the state to publicly state their “climate-related financial risk,” as well as issue emissions records and public assessments of their environmental impacts.

This follows a growing legal trend that sees businesses fight transparency rules by citing the Constitution’s “compelled speech” protections. Corporations claim that the First Amendment shields them from being forced to speak out on issues and have used the principle to fight emissions disclosures, drug price caps, social media reforms, and a suite of other consumer and public health protections.

Businesses say transparency rules, like California’s, illegally force them into speaking out on what they consider politically controversial topics, essentially arguing that the disclosure rules put words in their mouth.

Experts are warning that if the courts agree with these firms, the effects could be devastating to wide-ranging regulatory efforts.

“Anything can be political and controversial because science doesn’t deal in absolute certainty,” James Wheaton, founder of the public interest law firm the First Amendment Project, told the Lever’s Katherine Li last year.

The Houston, Texas-based company manages the full waste lifecycle through a vast network of collection operations, transfer stations, recycling facilities, and landfills.

Companies valued at $10 billion or more are typically classified as “large-cap stocks,” and WM fits the label perfectly, with its market cap exceeding this threshold, underscoring its size, influence, and dominance within the waste management industry. The company continues to strengthen its competitive positioning through investments in automation, sustainability, and advanced recycling technologies.

This waste management company has slipped 10.4% from its 52-week high of $242.58, reached on Jun. 8. Shares of WM have declined 3.5% over the past three months, slightly lagging behind the VanEck Environmental Services ETF’s (EVX) 3.3% drop during the same time frame.

Moreover, on a YTD basis, shares of WM are up 7.7%, compared to EVX’s 12.4% return. In the longer term, WM has fallen 4.4% over the past 52 weeks, underperforming EVX’s slight uptick over the same time frame.

To confirm its bearish trend, WM has been trading below its 200-day moving average since early September. However, it has remained above its 50-day moving average since mid-November, with minor fluctuations.

On Oct. 27, WM reported weaker-than-expected Q3 earnings results, prompting its shares to tumble 4.5% in the following trading session. While the company's revenue increased 14.9% year-over-year to $6.4 billion, it missed analyst expectations by a slight margin. Moreover, its adjusted EPS of $1.98 climbed 1% from the year-ago quarter, but fell short of consensus estimates by 1.5%. Additionally, the company also lowered its fiscal 2025 revenue outlook to approximately $25.3 billion, placing it at the low end of its previous guidance range. Management attributed the reduced forecast to continued weakness in recycled commodity pricing and slightly lower revenue expectations from WM Healthcare Solutions, which likely added to the negative investor reaction.

Along with electric trucks, FDEP's plans also list trucks powered by ""new diesel,"" compressed natural gas and propane as eligible, lower-emission upgrade options for fleets.
""Only electric vehicles zero out tailpipe emissions.","After initially excluding them, the state now includes electric trucks in Florida's plans for about $48 million specifically meant for projects to reduce harmful emissions. Public feedback prompted the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to revise its initial plans for how to spend the money.

RELATED: Millions of dollars for ""cleaner technology"" shouldn't go to electric vehicles, says Florida proposal

The $48 million is from the state's share of so-called Volkswagen funds, paid by the car company into a mitigation trust fund after allegedly violating the Clean Air Act by selling ""trick"" vehicles designed to cheat federal emissions tests. States received payouts from the mitigation fund based on how many ""trick"" vehicles were registered in each state, according to the EPA.

Florida's total share was $166 million. So far, most of it has gone to electric bus projects. With the state's remaining roughly $48 million, FDEP wants to help public and private fleet operators upgrade to lower-emission freight trucks.

But up until recently, FDEP's plans didn't include electric trucks in the list of lower-emission options eligible for the funds. Now, after FDEP received public feedback on the plans, electric trucks are on the list.

Stan Cross is director of electric transportation for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, one of several electrification stakeholder groups that urged FDEP to revise its plans. He said he's happy to see EV eligibility preserved.

""Electric transportation stakeholders were clear in our comments: not including electric vehicles as eligible for Volkswagen settlement funding amounted to government meddling in the free market,"" Cross said. ""Now that EVs are eligible, public and private fleet operators can choose the alternative fuel technology that best suits their needs.""

Along with electric trucks, FDEP's plans also list trucks powered by ""new diesel,"" compressed natural gas and propane as eligible, lower-emission upgrade options for fleets. Cross said EVs are the best option.

""Only electric vehicles zero out tailpipe emissions. All the other alternative fuels still pollute,"" Cross said. ""EVs are also the most affordable vehicles in the long term, because electricity is the cheapest transportation fuel and EVs have the lowest maintenance costs.

""So an EV might be the best tool for the job, and having EVs eligible for the funding empowers fleet operators to make that decision.""

Fleet operators of vehicles used in community service, disaster management and emergency response functions will get funding priority, according to FDEP.

RELATED: Florida makes millions available for lower-emission garbage trucks

To date, nearly 70% of Florida's Volkswagen funds have gone to electric school bus and transit bus projects, and just under 8% to electric vehicle charging infrastructure (EVCI) projects. Neither category will be funded with the state's remaining $48 million, according to FDEP's finalized plans.

Some of the public comments submitted to FDEP urged the state to continue to use Volkswagen funds to support electric bus and EV-charging projects. But FDEP ""determined that it is in the interest of the state, the public, and the intended beneficiaries of the Volkswagen Settlement"" not to do so.

Projects previously funded in both categories — electric buses and EV charging infrastructure — proved to be more lengthy and expensive than initially anticipated, according to FDEP. There were ""long lead times needed to purchase eligible electric buses that meet fleet operators' needs."" And for EV charging sites, some projects weren't finished until more than three years after the date of the grant award to complete.

As of October, there are more than 4,000 EV-charging stations in Florida, including 42 EVCI projects funded by money from the Volkswagen settlement.

""We would have liked to see funding still made available for charging infrastructure, but are happy to see that electric vehicle eligibility is preserved,"" Cross said. ""Getting vehicles on the road that are driving on affordable and clean electricity is important and should be a top priority for the state.""

Compared to other states in the Southeast, Florida ranks first for EV sales, according to SACE's latest annual report.

In August, FDEP's draft plans estimated the state had nearly $41 million of Volkswagen funds left to spend. Between the state's remaining project funds and interest accrued on those funds, Florida's actual remaining balance is more than $48 million, according to the state's new, finalized plans.

Florida has been slower than many other states to spend its Volkswagen dollars, according to energy industry members. The state plans to wrap up the fund by 2027.
