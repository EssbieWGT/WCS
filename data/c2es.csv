But now, that incentive might be getting tossed out the window, and the fallout could hit GM and Ford like a freight train, while Tesla quietly wins the long game.

A new budget proposal from House Republicans is looking to end the federal tax credits that helped EVs find their place in American garages. If it goes through, not only would it pull the rug out from under new and used EV buyers, but it would also throw a wrench in the plans of two legacy automakers who bet big on the electric future.

The fine print: How the credit worked

The EV tax credit was something you claimed when filing your federal income taxes the following year. It knocked up to $7,500 off your tax bill, but only if you owed that much in the first place. You didn’t get a refund check for the difference, and you couldn’t roll it over. It wasn’t generous, just helpful.

To qualify, the vehicle had to be built in North America and meet strict sourcing rules for battery materials. Plus, there were income caps for buyers. The rules weren’t simple, but they made EVs more accessible and helped move the market forward. That system could vanish now.

The controversial proposal

Under the GOP-backed plan, the $7,500 credit for new EVs and the $4,000 credit for used EVs would both be eliminated. It would also pull support for clean energy production and EV battery plants, undercutting the incentives that drove recent investment in domestic manufacturing.

Lawmakers pushing the change are calling it a fiscally responsible move. But for automakers like GM and Ford, it’s more like watching the floor fall out just as they finally got their EV plans off the ground.

General Motors and Ford have poured billions into battery facilities, new EV platforms, and ambitious timelines. GM’s Ultium platform and Ford’s massive BlueOval campuses were designed with the tax credit in mind.

If those credits disappear, so does a big chunk of that consumer motivation. GM and Ford are still racing toward profitability on their electric lineups. Without the credits, they might find themselves in a slower lane than they can afford to be in.

Tesla, naturally, is grinning

While other companies scrambled to adjust to sourcing requirements and final assembly rules, Tesla had already built most of its production right here in the U.S. They’ve got more control over their supply chains, fewer international dependencies, and a huge head start on turning a profit from their electric fleet. They also have enough breathing room to cut prices aggressively… with or without government help.

So while legacy automakers may scramble to make their business models work, Tesla will keep selling cars, with or without Uncle Sam’s backing.

Leasing: the one loophole that might survive

There is, however, one potential escape hatch, and it’s not very glamorous: leasing.

Under the current rules, commercial buyers (like leasing companies) can still access the full $7,500 credit. Many of them pass the savings on to consumers through reduced monthly payments. That’s part of why EV leasing has exploded lately —because it’s one of the few ways regular drivers can still benefit without jumping through hoops.

Unless this new proposal shuts that down too, it might become the last bridge between consumers and affordable EV access.

If the tax credit dies, the impact will be immediate. EV sales are likely to surge briefly — a final rush from buyers trying to cash in while they still can. But once that grace period ends, expect a cool-down. Mass-market EVs will become harder to sell, and automakers counting on rapid adoption will be forced to rethink their timelines.

If you’re planning to buy an EV, better act fast — because in 2026, that $7,500 discount may be just another part of the electric dream that disappeared in a cloud of exhaust. Meanwhile, Elon Musk? He’s already five exits ahead.",https://eladelantado.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gm-ev-charging.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 13:09:17.801880

The overturned waivers block the state’s mandate to phase out all gas-powered cars by 2035 and tighten emissions on certain trucks. The House voted on the waivers last month.

The vote was 51-44, with only Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan siding with Republicans.

Under the federal Clean Air Act, California has historically been able to create its own stricter emission standards compared to national standards with the approval of the Environmental Protection Agency, which gives the state waivers for each approved policy. Other states have had the option to adopt California’s more stringent policies.

Washington is one of 17 states to do so, meaning its ability to enforce certain vehicle policies is jeopardized by the federal government’s latest decision.

There are questions of legality about the federal government’s use of the Congressional Review Act, which was cited to revoke the waivers. The Senate parliamentarian, a nonpartisan staffer who interprets Senate’s rules, and the Government Accountability Office, both concluded it was an illegal use of the act. While the determinations are only advisories, the staffer’s and office’s guidance are traditionally followed.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta has said the state will challenge the action in court, but in the meantime, public health groups, environmental agencies and government officials in Washington are worried how the decisions will hinder the state’s ability to meet its emission goals.

By 2050, Washington must cut gas emissions by 95% of 1990 levels. The most recent data from the State Department of Ecology shows that transportation is the largest contributor to statewide emissions, at almost 40%.

“The Senate’s action to waive California’s vehicle emissions standards will drastically impact Washington’s ability to combat climate change, will hurt human and environmental health, and will set economic and job growth back,” wrote Michael Mann, executive director of Clean and Prosperous, a climate policy research organization. “Ultimately, this is a step backward that will increase air pollution and delay the transition to cleaner, more affordable sources of transportation fuels for Washington businesses and drivers.”

All their efforts are starting to pay off now, as Kenya’s electric motorcycle sales seem to be taking off.
The share of electric motorcycles rose to 3.6% in 2023 from 2.8% in 2022 and 0.5% in 2021.
Now imagine if, say, five players out of the over thirty players in Kenya’s electric motorcycle sector also push to add 5,000 electric motorcycles in the next 2 years or so.
Back to ARC Ride: ARC Ride says the move to add 5,000 electric motorcycles will directly result in over 100,000 metric tonnes of CO2 per year being saved as electric mobility replaces petrol motorbikes.","Several Kenya-based firms have done a magnificent job of building the country’s electric motorcycle industry from scratch starting about 7 years ago. After going through the various stages of early pilots, further pilots, multiple iterations, and pivots, a number of them found the sweet spot and then graduated into early commercialization phases of their products. These firms had to dig deep in their research and development phases to produce electric motorcycles that can manage the demands of the boda boda industry and at the same time handle the local terrain as well as rough road conditions. This is because for their products to take off, they really needed to make products that are robust enough to match or exceed the fossil-fueled products that are currently on the market.

That meant they could not just bring off-the-shelf products and components from overseas, but they really had to adapt their designs for these conditions. After that, the next thing was to show that these new electric motorcycles had a lower total cost of ownership. Then the next step was to forge strategic partnerships with partners that are already in the distribution and financing ecosystem for traditional motorcycles. This would unlock important channels that align with their route to market strategies.

All their efforts are starting to pay off now, as Kenya’s electric motorcycle sales seem to be taking off. In 2023, there were 70,691 motorcycles sold in Kenya. 2,557 of these were electric. That means 3.6% of motorcycles sold in 2023 in Kenya were electric. That is almost 4%. So, we did not expect it to be long before the market share reached the critical 5%, which is generally viewed as the tipping point indicating the start of mass adoption. The share of electric motorcycles rose to 3.6% in 2023 from 2.8% in 2022 and 0.5% in 2021. 2024 was even better — market share surged to 7.1%. The KNBS Economic Survey Report (2025) shows that 68,804 new motorcycles were registered Kenya in 2024. Of these, 4,862 motorcycles were electric according to data presented by the Electric Mobility Association of Kenya (EMAK). That is where the 7.1% market share comes from.

Several firms are already positioning themselves for an even bigger 2025. One of these firms is ARC Ride. ARC Ride, an e-mobility battery-as-a-service (BaaS) provider, recently announced $5 million of financing from British International Investment (BII), the UK’s development finance institution and impact investor, to provide affordable, reliable, and clean e-mobility solutions for rapidly developing cities in Kenya.

E-mobility is crucial to Kenya’s climate goals. Kenya is aiming for a low-carbon transport system by 2030. The transport sector, responsible for 13% of Kenya’s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, sees electric vehicles (EVs) as key to reducing emissions and improving air quality.

However, due to limited access to charging facilities and appropriate financing solutions, EV adoption has been slow. ARC Ride is addressing this challenge by providing affordable and user-friendly BaaS solutions. The company has already installed 170 charging stations in Nairobi. This reduces the upfront cost of electric two-wheelers (E2Ws) and enables quicker battery swaps.

BII’s financing will enable ARC Ride’s initial rollout of 5,000 E2Ws and accelerate the expansion of E2W BaaS infrastructure. By building Africa’s first and largest automated battery swapping network, it is also establishing the industry standard for battery swapping of E2Ws both for ARC Ride and other manufacturers, which is important for more EV adoption. Remember that about 4,800 electric motorcycles were sold in Kenya last year across all operators. So, ARC Ride making 5,000 electric motorcycles available will give the sector a massive boost! Now imagine if, say, five players out of the over thirty players in Kenya’s electric motorcycle sector also push to add 5,000 electric motorcycles in the next 2 years or so. We could be getting 25,000 electric motorcycles per year in the medium term! Back to ARC Ride: ARC Ride says the move to add 5,000 electric motorcycles will directly result in over 100,000 metric tonnes of CO2 per year being saved as electric mobility replaces petrol motorbikes.

Daniel Wilcox, Economic Counsellor, British High Commission Nairobi, said: “There is enormous potential for green manufacturing in Kenya to drive economic growth and job creation. The UK is a long-term partner for long term growth in Kenya — and this investment will support Kenya’s climate ambitions, support hardworking Kenyans and their jobs, make Nairobi not only a healthier place to live, and a more attractive place to do business. This investment compliments the UK’s effort in supporting the decarbonisation of the Nairobi transport systems — long may Nairobi remain the green city in the sun!”

Seema Dhanani, Head of Office, Kenya and Coverage Director, East Africa at BII said: “In Kenya, a Boda Boda is more than just a motorbike; it’s a crucial part of the transportation system, helping millions of people to commute. That is why electrifying Boda Bodas is essential for creating a green and sustainable future for the country. As the UK’s DFI, we are backing modern technology and innovative companies such as ARC Ride to accelerate the transition and have a transformative impact on people and the planet.”

Joseph Hurst, CEO of ARC Ride, said: “This strategic partnership between ARC Ride and BII marks a significant milestone in our ongoing efforts to expand scale and expand our Pan African footprint. Together, we will ensure millions of clean kilometres will be driven. Putting more money in the pockets of our riders whilst protecting the environment.”

To show just how much traction the electric mobility industry has got in Kenya now, Roam, the Nairobi-based electric mobility manufacturer, has been named Kenya’s fastest-growing company and among Africa’s top 40 in the 2025 Financial Times and Statista ranking of Africa’s Fastest Growing Companies. The firm placed 35th overall on the continent — the highest among 11 Kenyan businesses on the list — and emerged as the leading electric mobility manufacturer featured.

Compiled by the Financial Times and data firm Statista, the ranking assessed over 130 companies across Africa based on their compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and absolute revenue growth between 2020 and 2023. Roam posted an 86.4% CAGR and 547.8% revenue growth, solidifying its position at the forefront of Africa’s clean technology movement.

Founded in 2017, Roam designs and manufactures electric motorcycles and buses tailored for African markets. In recent years, the company has launched Roam Hubs — charging and battery rental stations — in Nairobi, Kiambu, and Machakos counties; partnered with ride-hailing platforms like Uber and Bolt to make electric motorcycles more accessible for boda boda riders; and collaborated with Italy’s Energica to advance local EV engineering. Roam also completed a record-setting 6,000-kilometre electric journey from Nairobi to Stellenbosch in 2024, positioning Africa as a rising hub of innovation.

Roam’s appearance on the FT list places it ahead of prominent Kenyan firms, including M-KOPA, a digital asset financing platform and key Roam partner, and Quickmart Supermarket, which collaborates with Roam on charging infrastructure expansion. Others featured include Victory Farms, TPS Serena Hotels, KCB Group, and Co-operative Bank. This year’s ranking reflects a shift toward more diversified economic growth in Kenya. While fintech and traditional sectors remain strong, Roam’s hardware-first, impact-focused business model highlights the continent’s growing capacity in advanced manufacturing and climate tech. Kenya ranked third overall in company representation, behind South Africa and Nigeria.

Roam’s success also comes amid a global contraction in venture capital funding and rising macroeconomic headwinds. Its steady growth bucks the trend that has challenged high-profile African startups like Jumia and Gro Intelligence in recent years, reinforcing investor confidence in Kenya’s clean energy and industrial potential.

Habib Lukaya, Roam’s Field Operations Manager: “This recognition is not just a milestone for Roam—it is a moment of pride for Kenya. It shows that local manufacturing can thrive, creating jobs and delivering affordable, high-quality electric motorcycles made in Kenya, for Africa. We are building an industry, and with this momentum, we are expanding our footprint to reach more riders and communities across the continent.”

So, we can say it’s been a good week for Kenya’s electric mobility sector. I’m sure we will keep getting these kinds of developments and even bigger ones in the near future.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ARC-Ride-electric-motorcycle-battery-swapping-charging-station.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 13:09:32.686419

The manufacturer said last week the 2026 edition of RAV4 will be available with Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) or Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) powertrains.

The 2026 RAV4 models are expected to be available in the fall. Suggested retail prices are to be disclosed closer to the dealership rollout.

“At Toyota, customer choice is paramount,” said David Christ, group vice president and general manager of its Toyota division.

“With three distinct styles, two highly efficient electrified powertrains, and available front- or all-wheel Drive, the (2026) RAV4 offers something for everyone and is ready to take on all of life’s adventures.”

Toyota reported in January it sold just more than 1 million Toyota and Lexus electrified vehicles in the U.S. during 2024, comprising 43.1% of 2.33 million vehicles sold.

There were a record 883,426 Toyota electrified vehicles sold, up 56.1% year over year, while total Toyota sales were up 4.2%.

RAV4 has been the best-selling SUV in the U.S. for eight consecutive years, with HEV sales up 29.3% and PHEV sales up 19.3% over 2023.

Triad plant update

The RAV4 transition to hybrid vehicles comes as production of lithium batteries is under way at the mammoth Toyota Battery Manufacturing N.C. plant in Randolph County.

The plant represents the largest single economic capital investment in North Carolina history, as well as Toyota’s first in-house overseas battery manufacturing facility.

Shipments are projected to begin in June, the automaker told civic and elected officials during a reception May 18.

Don Stewart takes over June 6 as the plant’s manager, as well as group vice president for Manufacturing Region 7 that includes the Liberty plant.

Stewart said Toyota is nearing 2,000 plant employees. Toyota‘s latest workforce goal is reaching at least 3,000 by the end of 2025 and 5,100 at full production.

Stewart said the manufacturer continues to test production lines for the lithium batteries being produced for hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles. The outcome of those trials will determine the timing of shipments.

The Liberty plant will feature at full production 14 production lines: 10 dedicated to battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; and four to hybrid electric vehicles.

The Biden-era Clean Power Plan marks the third major attempt by the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. It follows the Obama administration's original Clean Power Plan, which required power plants to shift toward lower-carbon sources of electricity.

""Many have voiced concerns that the last administration’s replacement for that rule is similarly overreaching and an attempt to shut down affordable and reliable electricity generation in the United States, raising prices for American families, and increasing the country's reliance on foreign forms of energy,"" the EPA spokesperson said. ""As part of this reconsideration, EPA is developing a proposed rule.""

The spokesperson did not provide further details about the draft plan but said it will be released after an interagency review and once it is signed by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

""President [Donald] Trump promised to kill the Clean Power Plan in his first term, and we continue to build on that progress now,"" the spokesperson quoted Zeldin as saying. ""We are seeking to ensure that the agency follows the rule of law while providing all Americans with access to reliable and affordable energy.""

The first Trump administration's Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule formally rescinded and replaced the Obama-era regulation.

The only currently known technology capable of achieving such reductions is carbon capture and sequestration, which has not yet been deployed at that scale.

The rule quickly came under legal challenge from a coalition of Republican-led states, utility companies, and coal industry stakeholders. Critics said that carbon capture is not economically viable or technologically mature enough to be used at the nation's roughly 200 coal plants. They also pointed to logistical problems, such as the extensive infrastructure needed to pipe captured carbon dioxide into underground storage sites that are located hundreds of miles from the plants.

Herein lies the bitter irony: attempting to improve security in the short term could undermine efforts to address the climate threat, which itself is a long-term security risk.
Solar energy company 1Komma5 deliberately avoids using Huawei inverters, despite the higher cost of alternatives.
On one hand, dependence on China does create a real strategic risk.
The issue of Chinese solar inverters is just a small part of a larger mosaic of technological and geopolitical competition.","The recent discovery of hidden cellular communication components in Chinese-made solar inverters installed in American energy farms raises troubling questions about the balance between national security and economic development. This phenomenon comes as no surprise to those following U.S.-China relations in recent years, but it sharpens a strategic dilemma that few are willing to confront openly.

The case reported last November, when solar inverters in the U.S. were remotely disabled, demonstrates the depth of the problem. Whether it was a deliberate ""test run"" or a technical malfunction, the practical result is identical: a foreign entity is capable of disrupting critical energy infrastructure at the push of a button. When it comes to the power grid, the consequences could be catastrophic - from paralyzing healthcare systems to shutting down security facilities.

However, addressing this risk is much more complex than simply replacing Chinese equipment with Western alternatives. China has become a superpower in manufacturing components for the renewable energy industry, with price advantages and production capabilities that have no competitors. Chinese companies, led by Huawei, dominate the global market not only through low prices but also through enormous technological investments and years of specialization.

Complete disconnection from Chinese technology would severely impair Western nations' ability to meet ambitious climate goals. Solar inverters, which constitute a central part of renewable energy systems, would significantly increase in price and slow down the adoption rate of green technologies. Herein lies the bitter irony: attempting to improve security in the short term could undermine efforts to address the climate threat, which itself is a long-term security risk.

But confronting this phenomenon need not be binary. Instead of choosing between the extremes of complete trust in foreign technology or its total rejection, more sophisticated security and defense mechanisms can be developed. A balanced strategy would include several layers:

First, developing independent testing and verification capabilities that can identify suspicious components before installation. Thorough hardware and software testing can reveal ""backdoors"" and undocumented communication mechanisms.

Second, creating a network architecture based on the principle of isolation and separation. Even if a particular component is compromised, a well-distributed electrical system can prevent systemic collapse and limit damage to isolated areas.

Third, developing local manufacturing capabilities for critical components. While it is unlikely that Western countries can compete with China across the entire production chain, they can certainly invest in developing independence in strategic segments.

Germany's experience provides interesting insights in this context. Solar energy company 1Komma5 deliberately avoids using Huawei inverters, despite the higher cost of alternatives. This decision reflects an understanding that long-term security is worth a certain economic premium.

It's important to note that dependence on Chinese technology is not a problem unique to the U.S. Europe, which leads the transition to renewable energy, is even more exposed. Britain has already begun a comprehensive review of Chinese technology in its energy infrastructure, a sign that awareness of the risk is growing.

The real challenge is not just technical, but also political. Public discourse focusing on the ""Chinese threat"" tends to drift into populist rhetoric and sometimes misses the complexity of the problem. On one hand, dependence on China does create a real strategic risk. On the other hand, a complete disconnect from the Chinese market would exact a heavy economic and environmental price.

What is needed is a sober approach based on more sophisticated risk management. Western countries need to develop standards and guidelines that require transparency and verification of critical components, regardless of their country of origin. At the same time, they should accelerate investments in security technologies that can address potential threats.

The issue of Chinese solar inverters is just a small part of a larger mosaic of technological and geopolitical competition. How we deal with this challenge will affect not only the security of energy infrastructure but also our ability to balance national security considerations with economic and environmental needs. The right path is not a dichotomous choice between dangerous dependence and expensive isolationism, but finding a middle path that combines strategic independence with supervised global cooperation.",https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2016/07/13/7132451/7132451_0_0_1000_563_0_large.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 13:09:36.718799

India’s renewable energy sector has seen remarkable growth over the past decade, with installed green energy capacity surging to 232 GW from 75.52 GW in March 2014, . This threefold increase signifies the country's emergence as a global leader in clean energy. Notably, solar power has driven much of this transformation. Solar energy capacity has grown exponentially from just 2.82 GW in 2014 to over 108 GW in 2024. Wind energy capacity has also more than doubled, rising from 21 GW to 51 GW over the same period. Large hydro power plants also contributed to this growth. Tariffs for solar power have dropped by 80 per cent over the decade, with current rates as low as Rs 10.95 per unit at Neemuch, significantly boosting affordability and adoption. India’s solar manufacturing capabilities have similarly expanded. In 2014, solar module production capacity stood at a modest 2 GW. By 2024, this has jumped to 90 GW, with projections estimating 150 GW by 2030. Solar cell production now stands at 25 GW, and wafer production at 2 GW—up from negligible levels a decade ago. The government targets solar cell and wafer capacities of 100 GW and 40 GW, respectively, by 2030, with fully integrated production capacity expected to reach 24 GW. Biopower capacity has also seen steady growth, increasing by 42 per cent from 8.1 GW in 2014 to 11.5 GW in 2024. The compressed biogas sector, once limited to a single project with an 8 tonnes per day (TPD) capacity, now boasts 150 projects with a combined capacity of 1,211 TPD. In the rooftop solar segment, the PM-Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana has made a substantial impact, supporting 13.3 lakh households. Of these, approximately 12 lakh installations have been completed in just ten months. India added 25 GW of renewable energy capacity in 2024 alone, marking a 34.63 per cent rise from the previous year's 18.57 GW. To meet its ambitious target of 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, the country must continue adding around 50 GW annually. In line with these goals, four renewable energy implementing agencies have issued tenders for approximately 44 GW for the fiscal year 2024–25. As of April 2024, India has become the world’s third-largest producer of electricity from wind and solar energy, surpassing Germany and consolidating its position as a key player in the global clean energy transition.

This support encompasses both sovereign and non-sovereign operations, reinforcing Egypt’s standing as the Bank’s second-largest regional member country shareholder—after Nigeria—and the third-largest overall.

Speaking to Daily News Egypt, Diaw revealed that AfDB’s current portfolio in Egypt totals $2.045bn, with private sector operations accounting for $800m, or 39%. The Bank is currently involved in 13 active private sector projects: seven in the power sector, three in finance, and one each in healthcare, industry, and agribusiness.

Key Projects in 2025

AfDB is advancing four major initiatives in Egypt for 2025:

Minapharm Expansion and Renovation Program

Approved in March 2025, this project aims to scale up Egypt’s pharmaceutical capacity by producing biosimilar monoclonal antibodies for oncology and autoimmune diseases—addressing a critical gap in Africa’s healthcare landscape.

JELES

Set for board approval in June, Jobs, Entrepreneurship, and Livelihood Enhancement Support (JELES) will promote youth employment by supporting startups, MSMEs, and inclusive value chains across Egypt.

Partial Credit Guarantee for Samurai Bond

Expected to go before the board in September 2025, this $400m equivalent guarantee (in Japanese yen) will back the issuance of a $500m sustainable Samurai bond, helping Egypt secure more favorable financing terms amid global economic uncertainty.

Large-Scale Solar PV and Battery Storage Project

A private sector-led initiative in southern Egypt, this project will combine solar generation with battery storage and a high-voltage substation to deliver dispatchable clean energy, strengthen grid reliability, and enhance frequency and voltage control.

Sector Focus and Strategic Priorities

Finance is now the largest segment of AfDB’s Egypt portfolio, representing 31%, followed by energy (21%), multisector (19%), agriculture (10%), water and sanitation (9%), and transport (8%). The social and industrial sectors account for just 1% each.

Highlighting Egypt’s prominence in pharmaceuticals—MENA’s largest market with revenues exceeding $56bn—Diaw emphasized AfDB’s investment in critical health infrastructure. In March 2025, the Bank approved a €15m senior loan to Minapharm Pharmaceuticals. It is also conducting due diligence on what could become Africa’s first facility for producing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for small molecules, with a board decision expected by year-end.

Diaw added that the Bank is in discussions to support medium-sized pharmaceutical companies through local commercial banks. Over the past three years, AfDB has funneled $293m to Egyptian banks, mainly to finance SMEs, with future funding tied to performance evaluations.

Looking ahead, AfDB is prepared to back Egypt’s green hydrogen ambitions as part of its broader energy transition and regional hub strategy.

Regional Development Vision

Under its 2022–2026 Country Strategy Paper, AfDB prioritizes enhancing Egypt’s competitiveness through private sector-led growth and job creation, especially for youth.

Beyond Egypt, the Bank is a cornerstone of the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA), a joint initiative with the African Union Commission and NEPAD. AfDB is engaged in 56 PIDA projects spanning transport, energy, water, and ICT.

As part of its 2024–2033 Ten-Year Strategy, AfDB aims to accelerate infrastructure connectivity, eliminate trade barriers, harmonize regulations, and bolster the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).

Mon, Feb 24, 2025 Atoms for Appalachia: The role of nuclear energy in economic development Report By Lauren Hughes Advanced nuclear technologies can drive economic security and energy security within Appalachian states.","On Friday, US President Donald Trump signed four executive orders related to the rapid deployment of next-generation nuclear technologies in the United States. Overall, the orders represent a policy outlook on nuclear energy that has remained relatively consistent for nearly a decade. However, there are a few key breaks from precedent, especially in that the orders encourage commercial nuclear fuel recycling and decrease the independence of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

New reactors and national security

“Deploying Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security” is the most comprehensive of the four. It aims to speed the deployment of advanced reactors at Department of Defense facilities, in order to provide power for military installations and for operational energy. The executive order notes that the regulatory pathway will be through the United States Army and ambitiously calls for one reactor to be operational at a “domestic military base or installation no later than September 30, 2028.” It also calls for the deployment of advanced reactors at Department of Energy facilities, and it directs the US secretary of energy to designate artificial intelligence (AI) data centers that “are located at or operated in coordination with Department of Energy facilities . . . as critical defense facilities, where appropriate.”

In a departure from what has been the US government’s de facto stance toward commercial nuclear fuel recycling in the United States (assuming that it refers to commercial reactors), this order calls for the US secretary of energy to “identify all useful uranium and plutonium material within the Department of Energy’s inventories that may be recycled or processed into nuclear fuel for reactors in the United States.” There are currently no domestic commercial fuel recycling facilities in the United States, and the partnership outlined in this order between the Department of Energy and industry will likely be a boon to US reactor companies looking to use recycled fuel, especially as competitor countries stand up their own recycling capabilities. The order then goes on to direct the Department of Energy to provide high assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) for commercial reactors that are authorized to deploy at the department’s sites. This will add to the demand signal for HALEU fuel and strengthen the domestic nuclear fuel supply chain.

Importantly, the order excludes the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy from the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for construction of advanced reactors on some federal sites. It also notes that there may be additional categories that will be excluded from adhering to NEPA. The Department of the Interior already has a number of categorical exclusions for NEPA (for example, for geothermal exploration) but does not yet have any listed for nuclear reactors. The rest of this order touches on interagency coordination, civil nuclear exports, and employee clearances.

Changes to the NRC

At first glance, the next executive order, “Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,” appears more measured than news reports had predicted over the past few weeks. It mentions a reduction in force for the commission, but it notes that “certain functions may increase in size consistent with the policies in this order, including those devoted to new reactor licensing.” At the same time, the order directs the NRC to finalize a revision of its regulations and guidance documents, and this revision must be concluded within eighteen months. It also directs an eighteen-month deadline for final decisions on construction and operation applications for any type of nuclear reactor. It is difficult to see how an understaffed agency will be able to complete more work in less time.

Although the new executive order does not explicitly mention White House oversight of the NRC, it does note the involvement of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and especially the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in reorganizing the NRC. These measures, combined with the February 18 executive order “Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies”—which already decreased the independence of the NRC—could likely reduce the NRC’s workforce and lessen its standing among global nuclear regulatory authorities. This could happen even as the White House directs it to hasten its regulatory processes to expedite the licensing and deployment of next-generation nuclear technologies.

The question of new testing

A third order, “Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy,” directs the national laboratory system to reform its process for ensuring that reactor developers are able to test their reactors quickly and effectively. However, the document does not explicitly direct the national laboratory system to construct new test reactor facilities. The first Trump administration signed into law the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Capabilities Act in 2017, which addressed the need for a fast-neutron test reactor and resulted in the start of the Versatile Test Reactor (VTR) project at Idaho National Laboratory.* But Congress later defunded this project. Although the new order does not explicitly call for the construction of a new testing facility, its direction to increase capacity for testing new reactors may lead Congress to look again at the VTR project.

The broader nuclear base

Finally, “Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base” addresses well-trodden issues, such as workforce development and the restarting, completion, uprating, or construction of nuclear power plants. It also calls for a new report to address the fuel cycle, especially regarding high-level waste management, fuel recycling (including commercial recycling), isotopes, and enrichment and conversion. This new report would follow the Nuclear Fuel Working Group’s 2020 report “Strategy to Restore American Nuclear Energy Leadership,” which focused on the front-end of the fuel cycle as well as civil nuclear exports. The order also notes that the US secretary of energy shall update the department’s “excess uranium management policy to align with the policy objectives of this order and the Nuclear Fuel Security Act” of 2023, which was signed into law by US President Joe Biden.

Based on these new executive orders and earlier announcements, the second Trump administration’s policies toward nuclear energy seem largely aligned with the policies of the Biden administration and the first Trump administration. The major shift that is reflected in this set of executive orders is the desire to conduct a reduction in force across government agencies and to weaken the independence of regulatory authorities, including the NRC. In the new orders, the Trump administration has articulated ambitious goals for rapid deployment of next-generation nuclear technologies; however, reducing personnel and funding for the NRC and the Department of Energy, along with weakening the NRC’s independence and global credibility, will make it challenging to realize the full potential of the US nuclear energy industry.

August 2023: Evading tariffs US Department of Commerce investigation concludes that Chinese solar manufacturers are circumventing solar tariffs by shipping their products through South-east Asia.","– On a humid day in February, a small group of workers huddled in front of a large solar panel factory in Thailand’s biggest manufacturing hub in the eastern coastal province of Chonburi, home to some of the world’s top solar panel producers.

The men and women, mostly in their 20s , were all hoping to land a job on a production line assembling solar cells into panels destined for export.

They knew they might not hold the job for very long after reading former employees’ complaints on social media about work being regularly cut when orders were low.

But the company promised fair pay and, needing work, they were willing to take the risk.

That risk is growing, with Thailand’s solar industry now caught in an escalating trade war between the US and China, with Thai solar workers paying the price.

Large Chinese companies dominate Thailand’s solar manufacturing industry, which produces solar cells and panels for export to the US market.

But as Washington erects trade barriers to protect its home-grown solar sector from a rising tide of cheap Chinese imports, Thailand’s industry is being squeezed.

Solar manufacturers that rely heavily on Chinese components in South-east Asia’s second-largest economy are now facing nearly 400 per cent tariffs on their products exported to the US.

Analysts say the tariffs threaten to hurt Thailand’s manufacturing sector and its workers, and could have a knock-on impact on solar roll-out in the country.

But the changing trade landscape also creates an opportunity for producers to find new markets, including by accelerating solar deployment and the energy transition across South-east Asia.

The heat of the solar trade war

For more than a decade, the US has waged a tariff war on growing imports of cheap Chinese solar panels, which it says harm its domestic industry.

China’s mass production of solar cells and modules has enabled the expansion of clean energy globally.

The cost of solar panels has declined by 90 per cent in the past decade. But China’s subsidised and cut-price solar production has also led to accusations of unfair trade practices.

In response, Chinese manufacturers have relocated their final production stages to neighbouring Asian countries, in an attempt to avoid the US import tax, turning South-east Asia into a major solar panel assembly hub and export base.

As Chinese exports of solar components to Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and Cambodia boomed, so did US imports of South-east Asian solar panels.

By 2023, 80 per cent of US solar module imports came from those four countries. Nearly a third of that came from Thailand alone.

But, in recent months, several Chinese manufacturers with factories in South-east Asia have suspended some of their operations in the region, after the US announced a string of anti-dumping duties on solar imports from the four countries in a bid to close the loophole.

Thousands working in Thailand’s solar factories – most of whom had left the agricultural north of the country to seek better-paying employment in an industry which promised decent jobs – were put on leave or suddenly dismissed.

Climate Home News analysed local media reports and social media posts relating to worker dismissals at three leading solar manufacturers with factories in the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), the country’s largest manufacturing zone: Chinese companies Trina Solar – one of the world’s largest solar photovoltaic manufacturing companies – and Runergy, and Canadian Solar, which has long conducted most of its manufacturing operations in China.

Climate Home found that close to 8,000 full-time staff and subcontracted workers were either temporarily or permanently dismissed in 2024 after a two-year US tariff waiver on solar products from South-east Asia expired.

An industry losing its grip on its biggest export market

In April, US trade officials unveiled hefty tariffs of at least 375 per cent on imports of solar cells from Thailand.

The US International Trade Commission, a bipartisan government agency, is due to make a final decision about the tariffs in June.

In private, analysts say they are likely to be approved.

The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (Ieefa), a US-based think-tank, recently found that any price increases beyond 250 per cent would make most South-east Asian imports “untenable”.

“Any company in any country where the combined tariffs are greater than 250 per cent will likely see their orders decline or get cancelled,” Mr Grant Hauber, strategic energy finance adviser for Asia at Ieefa, told Climate Home News.

In 2024, US officials investigated a complaint from American manufacturers that companies with factories in South-east Asia were dumping subsidised and unfairly cheap products on the US market.

Their tariff deliberations over the past year have rocked Thailand’s solar industry.

“There has been a broad suspension of operations among Chinese companies in South-east Asia, including Thailand, with many closures likely to be permanent,” said Mr Zhu Linxiao, a research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.

“The region risks losing a significant share of its solar manufacturing capacity due to the loss of access to the US market.”

Agreeing, BloombergNEF’s Thailand energy transition analyst Forbes Chanthorn said: “Thailand’s solar manufacturing industry faces some serious challenges. It is losing its grip on some of its biggest export markets without any short-term alternatives in sight.”

And the situation could go from bad to worse as US President Donald Trump threatens an additional 37 per cent import tariff on all goods from Thailand – one of the highest rates in Washington’s planned universal tariff onslaught, now paused until June. If applied, this would push the tariffs on Thailand’s solar cells up to 426 per cent.

In an interview, Ms Charuwan Phipatana-Phuttapanta, a solar expert at Thailand’s Energy Ministry, acknowledged that the tariffs will impact employment in the country’s solar industry.

Workers fall victim to tariffs

Spanning three provinces on Thailand’s eastern coast, the EEC is key to the government’s plan to transform the area into an economic powerhouse.

Enticed by generous tax breaks and cheap labour, international companies have flocked here to manufacture everything from air-conditioners to batteries for electric vehicles and solar panels for the regional and global markets.

Several leading Chinese solar manufacturing companies set up shop in the EEC nearly a decade ago. Soon, Thailand’s solar exports to the US soared.

But, in June 2024, a two-year US tariff waiver on solar products from South-east Asia – introduced by then President Joe Biden to boost solar deployment in the country – came to an end.

Companies in the region importing silicon wafers from China to make solar cells for export to the US became subject to tariffs.

In the days that followed, several manufacturers slowed down or suspended operations, letting go of staff to adjust to the new tax regime, Rayong Labour Protection and Welfare office director Amnuay Ngamnet , the Labour Ministry’s local representative, told Climate Home.

Videos posted on TikTok in recent weeks show deserted carparks and unusually quiet grounds around some solar factories.

“No matter how good you are, if life stumbles, you cannot succeed. Goodbye,” one solar worker posted on the social media platform with a photo of a dismissal letter.

Amnat, whose name has been changed to avoid jeopardising his job prospects, was among thousands affected.

Like many others, the 39-year-old left his home town in the agricultural north-eastern region in 2022 to find a better-paying job at a solar plant in the EEC.

“It seemed like a promising industry. I hoped to spend years there,” he told Climate Hom e . “But it didn’t turn out that way.”

Amnat worked as a subcontractor at a few Chinese solar factories, eventually landing a staff position at Runergy, which manufactures solar cells and modules.

He worked six days a week and earned approximately 25,000 baht (S$980) a month, way above the average income for unskilled workers.

But, in October 2024, he was dismissed along with “almost all of the employees” at the factory, according to local media reports.

Amnat told Climate Home the retrenchment affected nearly 3,000 workers.

Runergy did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

That same month, Runergy opened its first module manufacturing plant in the US to keep supplying the American market – one of a number of solar companies hoping to benefit from tax credits under the US’ Inflation Reduction Act.

As a permanent employee, Amnat was compensated with 75 per cent of his monthly wage, a lifeline during the three months it took him to find another job. But others were not so lucky.

Thousands of workers hired as subcontractors and benefiting from fewer rights were left without work or pay overnight as companies suspended some of their operations.

At risk of labour rights violations

“After leaving the solar company, my girlfriend was left unemployed for two months. It was difficult for us,” a TikTok user, who had complained about the dismissals on social media, told Climate Home.

The subcontracting company employing her made her sign a dismissal letter absolving it of paying the compensation she was entitled to, he explained.

Mr Bunyuen Sukmai, a local labour lawyer and rights activist, told Climate Home “most workers are not aware that the practice violates their rights”, despite being routinely deployed.

In the workers’ housing estate in Chonburi province, a few kilometres outside the industrial zone, the offices of subcontracting companies are flanked by hair salons and restaurants. A steady stream of job seekers fill in application forms and scan QR codes to follow job announcements on social media.

“Subcontractors are usually the first to be affected by industry changes. They usually receive lower benefits and are most at risk of having their rights violated,” said Mr Bunyuen.

But legal cases over unfair dismissal are rare, as few workers have the resources to go down the judicial route, he added.

A representative of Trina Solar in Thailand declined to respond to questions. Canadian Solar did not respond to Climate Home’s repeated requests for comment.

However, in a letter dated June 2024 and shared on social media, Canadian Solar said it had paused operations at one of its factories to make changes to its production line and improve machinery.

“Due to the current economic conditions and trade competition, the company needs to adjust to the market situation and the direction of the domestic and international economy,” it said.

It added that it had “great confidence in the potential and economic conditions of Thailand”, where it intended to continue operating.

In search of new markets

Some large Chinese panel-makers have already started setting up production lines in Indonesia and Laos, which are not currently affected by the US solar import duties.

The Middle East has also emerged as a growing destination for Chinese solar investments, including for the production of key solar components such as polysilicon ingots and wafers.

“These efforts are designed to forge a supply chain completely outside of China, serving the Middle East, the US and other markets that may be subject to tariff risks,” Mr Zhu wrote in a recent report for the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.

To continue operating in Thailand, analysts say large solar manufacturers will need to seek new export markets outside of the US.

In the short term, exports could be redirected to the European Union and India. The Thai government is racing to finalise a free trade deal with the EU, where demand growth for solar equipment may be stronger than in the US, said Ms Laura Schwartz, a senior Asia analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft.

“However, over half of China’s solar cell and module exports already go to Europe, so Thai exports would face stiff competition,” Ms Schwartz told Climate Home. And Indian solar developers will have to use locally made solar cells in government projects from June 2026.

However, Ms Christina Ng, director of the Energy Shift Institute, a think-tank focused on Asia’s energy transition, said that the tariffs could also mark “a turning point” for South-east Asia’s solar industry, which could focus on supplying emerging markets in Africa and South America, and urgently accelerate the region’s own solar deployment.

Thailand is dependent on natural gas for electricity generation, but the government has set out plans for 51 per cent of its electricity to come from renewables by 2037, with most of the additional renewable power expected from solar.

Only around 3 per cent of Thailand’s electricity currently comes from solar.

Thai companies assembling solar modules in the country are already calling for more incentives to expand a home-grown supply chain.

Mr Krit Pornpilailuck, chief executive of Solar PPM, fears Chinese solar manufacturers that cannot export their goods to the US “will flood the South-east Asian market and plunge the price” of modules.

To protect the industry, Mr Krit wants to see more support for Thai manufacturers to produce solar cells and other upstream components domestically.

Ms Charuwan, the government’s solar expert, said: “Thailand has more than six million tonnes of solar-grade quartz reserves that could be used to produce polysilicon – the key ingredient to produce solar wafers.”

But developing the resources would require “technical expertise and high investment”, she added.

The Energy Shift Institute’s Ms Ng said: “This is a chance for (manufacturers) to move up the value chain – from being seen as mainly low-cost assemblers to becoming leaders in more advanced clean energy technologies.

“If the region takes this moment seriously and diversifies, it won’t just weather the disruption; it will emerge more resilient and competitive.”

Residential energy workforce gap analysis

The Clean Energy Transition Institute (CETI) in partnership with Kinetic West, BW Research Partnership, and Uncommon Bridges conducted a residential energy workforce gap analysis for the Washington State Department of Commerce (Commerce). The report includes a landscape analysis of the current residential energy efficiency workforce with a focus on six priority occupations: electricians, insulation workers, plumbers, construction and building inspectors (including energy auditors), carpenters, and HVAC/refrigeration mechanics and installers. Additionally, the report included an outcomes analysis for historically underrepresented populations in this workforce, workforce development engagement strategies and recommendations for Commerce to prepare the workforce to make residential building improvements to meet the state’s emissions goals.

Are we ready? | Digital Trends,Nick Godt,,,,,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/robotaxi-news-readiness/,"Welcome to Digital Trends’ weekly recap of the revolutionary technology powering, connecting, and now driving next-gen electric vehicles.
A ride in a robotaxi—just you and a machine at the wheel.
And, of course, U.S.-market leaders, such as Alphabet’s Waymo, Amazon’s Zoox, and soon Tesla’s robotaxis, are increasingly deploying automated-driven wheels on city streets.

A ride in a robotaxi—just you and a machine at the wheel. Tempting? Terrifying? I haven’t taken one yet, so I can easily picture myself nodding serenely on the outside, while my inner backseat driver screams in silence at every unexpected turn.

Recommended Videos

If you’re also hesitant about the new technology, you’re not alone: According to an MIT/JD Power survey, 83% want more safety data before taking the plunge, and 86% want the ability to take over the steering wheel—just in case tech takes a wrong turn.

It didn’t help that the year kicked off with the story of a tech entrepreneur almost missing his plane in Phoenix, Arizona after his robotaxi experienced a glitch and looped 8 times around a parking lot.

That being said, overall consumer confidence in the technology has steadily increased over the past few years, coinciding with rising numbers of safety studies. And, of course, U.S.-market leaders, such as Alphabet’s Waymo, Amazon’s Zoox, and soon Tesla’s robotaxis, are increasingly deploying automated-driven wheels on city streets.

Waymo

Just this past week, Waymo received approval to further expand its operations around the San Francisco Peninsula, including San Jose. With a fleet of over 1,500 vehicles already operating in California, Arizona, Texas and Florida, the company is the undisputed robotaxi leader in the U.S., delivering over 250,000 rides per week.

Before you start your first ride inside one of Waymo’s Jaguar I-Pace EVs, you’ll receive a walkthrough of the vehicle and app, including how to start the ride, lock/unlock doors, and contact support—building comfort from the start.

Once seated inside, you’ll find a screen in front of you displaying a live map and the vehicle’s exact location. This real-time information helps you understand what the car is doing and where it’s going. Studies show these “situational awareness displays” can ease anxiety and reduce feelings of powerlessness—just like the in-flight maps on airplanes. If your backseat driver tendencies are still kicking in, audio and visual cues let riders know what the car is about to, such as ‘slowing for a pedestrian’ or ‘waiting to make a left turn’, to reinforce trust in the vehicle’s decision-making.

For Waymo, as with most other manufacturers of robotaxis, ensuring safety starts with using expensive navigational technology: Waymo’s vehicles rely on pre-mapped roads, sensors, cameras, radar, and lidar (a laser-light radar). This largely explains why Waymo was able to receive an early nod from safety regulators and take the lead in the U.S. market.

Tesla

Tesla, which is set to launch its own robotaxis in Austin, Texas in June, has taken a different, less expensive, approach: Its self-driving technology relies on multiple onboard cameras to feed AI machine-learning models which, in turn, help the car make decisions. That technology has so far remained under much tighter scrutiny from regulators.

At this stage of the game, automakers continue to test different blends of navigational tech, and eventually, the results will have to speak for themselves. But it’s interesting to note that just one month before the launch of its own robotaxis, Tesla’s head of Autopilot and AI Software, Ashok Elluswamy, made a stunning admission: “Technically, Waymo is already performing,” Elluswamy said during an interview with an Indian podcaster. “We are lagging by maybe a couple of years.”

Zoox

Zoox, Amazon’s self-driving unit, has also been making headlines this past week, announcing it will soon begin testing self-driving cars in Atlanta. The fleet will consist of retrofitted SUVs with human safety operators, marking the company’s seventh testing location.

Stepping into a Zoox, maybe the first thing you’d notice is the absence of a steering wheel and then, the seating arrangement: Four individual seats arranged in a symmetrical, face-to-face configuration—two seats on each side—without a traditional front or back.

According to the company, this setup fosters a lounge-like atmosphere, encouraging conversation among passengers and eliminating the hierarchy often associated with front and back seats in conventional vehicles. Each seat offers equal space, comfort, and access to features, ensuring no passenger is prioritized over another. In your personal seat, you’ll find amenities such as cupholders, wireless charging pads and touchscreens that allow you to control music, climate settings, and lighting.

Personally, I’d say the absence of a steering wheel and the chance to chat face to face in a lounge-like environment should help me forget about my backseat driver tendencies.

Lithium-ion batteries contain a wealth of valuable materials that really should be recycled, because it’d be a shame to discard the lithium, manganese, cobalt, nickel or even something as basic as copper.","Lithium-ion battery manufacturing is dominated by one country: China. According to a report from analytics firm Rho Motion, in 2023, the large Asian nation accounted for more than 80 percent of global production capacity. Last year, the two largest companies building these energy-storage systems were CATL and BYD, two Chinese concerns, followed by LG Energy Solution. Combined, these three companies accounted for more than 60 percent of the total market. But what about battery recycling, is the story any different?

This Should Be No Surprise

In short, no, it’s not, because China also dominates in this area as well, which makes sense. Lithium-ion battery manufacturing and recycling go hand in hand. Kind of a chicken-and-egg situation, you can’t really recycle batteries at scale if there’s not a sizable supply of second-hand batteries to recycle.

According to a post from Rho Motion, it’s estimated that in 2025 China will “account for 78 percent of battery pre-treatment capacity and 89 percent of black mass refining capacity,” some 3.6 million metric tons of the former and 2.5 million of the latter. Visualizing this in the form of a chart makes it much easier to see just how dominant China is projected to be in the battery-recycling field.

More Electric Vehicles = More Batteries To Recycle

Providing a robust pipeline of batteries to recycle, the country is expected to dominate in battery manufacturing. Rho Motion estimates China will account for around 85 percent of global battery manufacturing in 2025, roughly a 5 percent increase compared to 2023.

Lithium-ion batteries contain a wealth of valuable materials that really should be recycled, because it’d be a shame to discard the lithium, manganese, cobalt, nickel or even something as basic as copper. Before these substances can be reclaimed, used batteries must first be mechanically broken down, shredded into a material called black mass.

After that initial stage, the black mass is refined to create pre-cathode active material (pCAM), or further treated to produce cathode active material (CAM) that can be used in new lithium-ion batteries. This is how recycling companies can close the loop, reclaim the valuable materials found in batteries, so they don’t go to waste.

They’ll be the ones with the right industrial strategy that invests in people, places smart bets, and aligns policy incentives with long-term intent.","Governments around the world are scrambling to adopt the right industrial strategy to stay competitive in the global race for the jobs of tomorrow.

In the United States, the Trump administration’s tariff strategy is primarily aimed at bringing manufacturing back to the country. In Australia, the newly re-elected Albanese Labor government is placing a AUD $ 20 billion+ bet on green manufacturing to reindustrialize the nation. Meanwhile, in the UK, the Starmer government has launched a 10-year AI Opportunities Action Plan, focused on scaling compute infrastructure and making Britain a global hub for AI-driven jobs.

With the World Economic Forum forecasting that nearly as many jobs will disappear as will be created in the coming decade, the stakes could not be higher. In a world shaped by technological disruption, geopolitical realignment, and climate volatility, no single lever is enough.

What matters is the alignment of skills, sector focus, and smart incentives, which ought to be the building blocks of any serious strategy for job creation and industrial renewal.

These are the three questions every government must answer to compete for the next wave of jobs.

1. Education Is the Foundation of Industrial Strategy—Do You Have It Right?

This question comes first for a reason. No matter which industries a country prioritizes—or how much capital it attracts—none of it sticks without the right talent.

Education systems are the foundation that determines whether a country can attract, retain, and grow the industries of tomorrow.

Ireland’s rise from a struggling, high-emigration economy in the 1980s to a high-income innovation hub is one of the most striking industrial policy success stories of the modern era.

While often credited to low corporate tax rates, what also kept companies like Apple, Google, and Pfizer there and growing was talent. Firms like Intel, Meta, and Alphabet have consistently cited Ireland’s skilled workforce as a key reason for their success.

By contrast, one of the most high-profile failures of the past decade—the $10 billion Foxconn deal in Wisconsin—collapsed in part because the local workforce reportedly lacked the specialized skills needed to support advanced manufacturing.

There are many ways to upskill a population, both in the short and long term. In markets with clear potential, the private sector is already stepping in. In South Africa, Microsoft and Google have launched large-scale training programs in AI and digital skills, viewing widespread youth unemployment as an opportunity to build a future-ready workforce.

Such initiatives are tailored to meet real and immediate job demand. As Evan Jones, CEO of Collective X, puts it: “We’re not just skilling for the sake of it—we’re skilling for absorption.”

Collective X is a public-private partnership tackling South Africa’s digital skills gap at scale. It manages a R500 million ($28 million) outcomes-based fund that only pays training providers when learners are placed in real jobs. To date, over 500 organizations have signed on.

But while short-term technical bootcamps may fill immediate gaps, they’re no substitute for long-term talent strategy. That starts with reforming higher education.

According to the World Economic Forum’s 2025 Future of Jobs Report, the fastest-growing roles—from AI engineers to renewable energy technicians—require not only technical skills but also adaptive capabilities such as analytical thinking, creativity, and complex problem-solving. These are precisely what traditional lecture-based university models struggle to deliver on a large scale.

To stay competitive, universities must evolve from passive knowledge providers and rethink not only what students learn, but also how they learn.

One promising approach is peer-to-peer learning, a student-driven, project-based approach that fosters collaboration, initiative, and effective communication. Paired with co-designed curricula and digital platforms, it helps bridge the gap between academic theory and real-world readiness.

Countries that embed these models into their higher education systems have a better chance of attracting investment and retaining talent at home.

2. What Industry Anchors Your Industrial Strategy—And What Are the Trade-Offs?

Some countries, such as the U.S., can afford to bet on multiple high-growth sectors. However, even the U.S. faces trade-offs, including talent, infrastructure, and political bandwidth. No country can do everything well.

In a world of limited resources and global competition, focus matters. That means setting priorities, making trade-offs, and resisting the urge to chase everything because trying to do it all often means doing none of it well.

India’s Special Economic Zones (SEZs) offer a cautionary tale. Meant to boost exports across dozens of sectors, many fell short of their targets. A World Bank report blamed “policy fragmentation, lack of sector focus, and poor coordination.” Some zones became real estate plays; a few built lasting industrial strength.

By contrast, one often-overlooked sector with real potential is the creative economy. When Bill Gates recently named the three job categories most resilient to AI—pharma, energy, and coders—music, film, and live events didn’t make the cut.

Yet countries like Nigeria and Kenya are leaning into the creative economy as potential job creators. Nigerian artists now top global charts, Nollywood is among the world’s largest film industries, and Kenyan animators and storytellers are gaining traction across the continent.

A range of ancillary industries and services will be needed to support this momentum. UNCTAD estimates that Africa’s creative economy could generate up to 20 million jobs by 2030, particularly for young people and women. One example: Move Afrika, a touring platform backed by Global Citizen, created over 1,000 jobs during its stop in Kigali and increased local sourcing from 75% to 90% in just 18 months (Disclaimer: I work for Global Citizen).

However, transforming the creative economy into a genuine engine of job creation will require a proper policy framework—modern copyright laws, fair digital revenue-sharing, and robust intellectual property protections. This is especially urgent as broad exemptions to copyright are being proposed in several jurisdictions, threatening the ability of artists and creators to earn a living, and, by extension, generate jobs.

This is precisely why the Music and Entertainment Development Initiative (MEDI) was launched: to provide governments with the data needed to justify innovative policy frameworks and unlock the full economic potential of their creative economies. MEDI is mapping music ecosystems across 22 African countries and will provide targeted policy recommendations to support growth, from intellectual property (IP) reform to infrastructure and investment.

Not every country needs to chase AI labs or hyperscale data centers. The point isn’t to mimic Silicon Valley. Instead, the countries that win and retain jobs won’t be the ones that try to do everything—they’ll be the ones that do something well.

3. What Policy Incentives Will Drive Your Industrial Strategy Forward?

Even with the right sectors and skills in place, nothing moves without investment.

That’s where smart incentives come in. Today’s investors are seeking predictable, de-risked environments in a world that is increasingly messy and ever-changing. That means:

Stable procurement pipelines. India’s solar auction system is a standout example of a bright and stable policy. Launched in 2010 under the National Solar Mission, it invited developers to bid competitively for utility-scale projects backed by 25-year power purchase agreements. As a result, costs dropped, investor confidence surged, and solar jobs nearly tripled. According to IRENA, the sector grew from just over 110,000 jobs in 2010 to more than 318,000 by 2023, spanning manufacturing, installation, and maintenance.

Targeted subsidies and industrial strategy incentives. In Collie, Western Australia, the state government took a proactive approach to transitioning from coal to clean energy and green manufacturing. A flagship project is the Collie Green Steel Mill—a $400 million facility that will produce low-carbon rebar using renewable-powered electric arc furnaces. It’s expected to create 500 construction jobs and 200 long-term roles.

To support the project, the government committed:

AUD 2.7 million for feasibility and approvals via its Industry Attraction Fund

AUD 134 million through the Collie Industrial Transition Fund for infrastructure and site development

Long-term industrial strategy policy certainty and investor confidence. Even the best incentives fall flat if investors don’t believe they’ll last. As strategist and investor Taufiq Rahim explores in his new book, Trump 2.5, today’s industrial strategies—particularly in the U.S.—are increasingly shaped by short-term political cycles and populist pressures. Investors—and foreign governments eyeing an opening—need to pay close attention to where policy continuity might hold, where it might fracture, and what that means for capital flows.

As a case in point, just a few years ago, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act was poised to help catalyze a boom in clean energy investment, with 142,000 renewable energy jobs added in 2023 alone. But that momentum now risks being reversed following the House’s passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

One climate tech founder recently warned that his entire business—built around a $85-per-ton carbon capture credit—could be “vaporized overnight” if the credit disappears or is diluted, as now seems increasingly possible.

As a counterpoint, after years of stagnation, nuclear energy appeared to be making a comeback in the U.S., driven by rising demand, concerns over grid reliability, bipartisan support, and net-zero goals. But with the passage of the House version of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” prospects have once again become mixed.

That’s a challenge—because, like all major energy infrastructure, nuclear projects require coordinated, credible policy that investors can count on for years. The timelines are long, the risks are high, and without lasting policy commitment, capital stays on the sidelines.

As nuclear-focused investor Arthur Hyde put it to me recently: “All energy infrastructure is long-lived. Timelines are a red herring. The real question is who offers credible, coordinated policy over time.”

Ultimately, the countries that win the new industrial era won’t be the ones with the loudest rhetoric. They’ll be the ones with the right industrial strategy that invests in people, places smart bets, and aligns policy incentives with long-term intent. The industrial strategy playbook is there. To those with the discipline to follow it, will go the spoils.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68332004d5cfd55d8b2acea7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-05-25 11:05:06.871093

It also includes ways to support nuclear energy, such as restarting closed nuclear power plants, increasing power production at current nuclear power plants, completing suspended reactor construction, building new advanced reactors, and preparing improvement measures related to the nuclear fuel supply chain.
The first intention of the U.S. to expand nuclear power generation is to revive the nuclear power industry and create quality jobs.
This month, the Belgian and Swedish parliaments passed a bill to abolish the nuclear power plant bill and fund the construction of new nuclear power plants.
Candidate Kim said in his pledge that he would increase the proportion of nuclear power generation to 60% (35% of large nuclear power plants and 25% SMR) by smoothly pushing for six large nuclear power plants under construction or planned.","After European countries such as Italy, Denmark, Belgium, and Sweden scrapped their nuclear power plant policies one after another, the United States also started building 10 more large nuclear power plants. Stable power supply is essential for high-tech industries such as artificial intelligence (AI) data centers and semiconductors because nuclear power plants are the best alternative for now.

U.S. President Donald Trump signed four executive orders on the 23rd (local time), including the revitalization of the nuclear industry's foundation to foster nuclear technology. The executive order instructed the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to prioritize the construction of 10 new large nuclear reactors that are in design completion by 2030. It also includes ways to support nuclear energy, such as restarting closed nuclear power plants, increasing power production at current nuclear power plants, completing suspended reactor construction, building new advanced reactors, and preparing improvement measures related to the nuclear fuel supply chain.

""It's the nuclear age,"" Trump said. ""We're signing a huge executive order today. This will make the United States 'real power' again.""

The executive order also includes reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to meet the actual needs of the industry, aiming to quadruple nuclear power generation capacity over the next 25 years. This includes a decision to permit a new nuclear power plant within 18 months, the Associated Press reported, citing a government official. ""The move will put back more than 50 years of excessive regulatory clock on the nuclear industry,"" said Interior Minister Doug Burgum, an ""energy tsar.""

President Trump also signed an executive order easing restrictions related to testing three new experimental reactors, with the goal of operating them in July next year.

The first intention of the U.S. to expand nuclear power generation is to revive the nuclear power industry and create quality jobs. Westinghouse, a Pennsylvania-based U.S.-based nuclear power plant company, reportedly had more than 50,000 employees during its heyday in the 1970s and 1980s, but now has fewer than 10,000 employees.

The second is to respond to the power demand of AI data centers. According to the PWC, power usage in data centers around the world is expected to more than double in a short period of time from 460 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2022 to 1050 TWh in 2026. Stable power supply is essential enough to require one nuclear power plant to operate one semiconductor plant.

Prior to the United States, European countries are also scrapping their nuclear power plant policies one after another. The Italian government, the world's first de-nuclear power plant country, approved a bill to reintroduce nuclear power plants to parliament at the end of February. This month, the Belgian and Swedish parliaments passed a bill to abolish the nuclear power plant bill and fund the construction of new nuclear power plants.

In Taiwan, where the proportion of the semiconductor industry such as TSMC is high in Asia, a bill to increase the life of nuclear power plants from 40 years to 60 years passed the legislative court on the 13th.

However, even though Korea says it will support the AI and semiconductor industries, it has been idling away as politicians have made nuclear power plants a political issue.

Lee Jae-myung, presidential candidate of the Democratic Party of Korea, said in a TV debate on the 23rd, ""Nuclear power plants are cheap right now, but if you convert waste disposal costs or risks into costs, they may be extremely expensive energy."" At the same time, he emphasized the expansion of new and renewable energy such as solar and wind power.

On the other hand, Kim Moon-soo, candidate for People's Power, said in a discussion, ""The heat wave requires a lot of electricity for the use of air conditioners and the AI industry, and preparing a lot of cheap, stable and clean nuclear power is the core of the national energy strategy. We will also do renewable energy such as tidal power and wind power with nuclear power at the center."" Candidate Kim said in his pledge that he would increase the proportion of nuclear power generation to 60% (35% of large nuclear power plants and 25% SMR) by smoothly pushing for six large nuclear power plants under construction or planned.

Experts say that the U.S. and South Korea should strengthen cooperation in nuclear power plants to enter the global nuclear power market as a ""KOR-US.""",https://wimg.mk.co.kr/news/cms/202505/25/news-g.v1.20250525.09e8ad0c152243a9ba83caa28da293f0_P2.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 12:09:59.157387

They emitted about 1.5 billion metric tons of emissions in 2023, which is more than the total greenhouse gas emissions produced by most countries.
“If they’re successful with regard to power plants, they’re pretty much going to be successful with everything else,” he said.","Wearing his red “Make America Great Again” hat, Mr. Trump leaned into his aggressive agenda to purge diversity, equity and inclusion programs from the government, military and virtually every facet of American life, in making his pitch that the nation was worth fighting for again.

He took credit for building the military “better than ever before,” saying it had bolstered its recruitment numbers, morale and commitment to protecting America first. He drew applause from guests at times, such as when he discussed the issue of transgender athletes playing in female sports and hiring on merit over diversity.

At the outset of his second term, he issued a spate of executive orders targeting programs and policies that aimed to help address systemic racism, which he deemed divisive and unpatriotic.

He claimed that his predecessors had “subjected the armed forces to all manner of social projects and political causes, while leaving our borders undefended and depleting our arsenals to fight other countries’ wars.”

“All of that’s ended. It’s ended strongly,” he said. “They’re not even allowed to think about it anymore.”

Mr. Trump’s crusade against diversity has been particularly pronounced in the military, where there has been an aggressive erasure of the valor of Black people, women and other groups, down to eliminating and obscuring content honoring those buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

Mr. Trump has also sought to overhaul the military by making its ranks less diverse. He removed a Black four-star general as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and dismissed high-ranking women. He also banned transgender people from serving in the military.

His defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News host who served in the Army National Guard, has been among the most aggressive champions of Mr. Trump’s campaign. At his first staff meeting, he proclaimed: “I think the single dumbest phrase in military history is ‘our diversity is our strength.’”

Academics at West Point, a historically apolitical military academy that is run by the Department of Defense, was recently caught in the crossfire of Mr. Trump’s culture war.

To comply with Mr. Trump’s and Mr. Hegseth’s orders, the institution targeted books about race and gender for removal, disbanded a dozen affinity groups, scrubbed curriculums and dropped classes. Faculty members have publicly criticized what they see as a dangerous infringement on the school’s academic freedom, and one even quit.

In his commencement address, Mr. Trump did not address the turmoil on campus directly, but boasted about how he had “liberated our troops from divisive and demeaning political trainings.” He also trumpeted how, in his administration, appointments and promotions are not based on politics or identity.

“We’re a merit-based country again,” he said.

Mr. Trump’s remarks drew a stark contrast with the speech he gave when he spoke on the campus during his first term, as the country was in the midst of a reckoning over its racist history following the killing of George Floyd, a Black man whom the world watched cry for his mother as he lay dying under a white police officer’s knee.

In that 2020 speech, Mr. Trump urged West Point’s graduating class to “never forget” the legacy of soldiers before them, including those who had fought a bloody war to “extinguish the evil of slavery.”

“What has historically made America unique is the durability of its institutions against the passions and prejudices of the moment,” Mr. Trump said then. “When times are turbulent, when the road is rough, what matters most is that which is permanent, timeless, enduring and eternal.”

This year, Mr. Trump extolled the starkly different cultural reckoning he was leading.

“We’re getting rid of the distractions,” Mr. Trump said, “and we’re focusing our military on its core mission: crushing America’s adversaries, killing America’s enemies and defending our great American flag like it has never been defended before.”

“The job of the U.S. armed forces is not to host drag shows, to transform foreign cultures,” he continued, before seeming to misspeak by adding, “but to spread democracy to everybody around the world, at the point of a gun.”

Mr. Trump also rambled at times as he took shots at his opponents and told stories about his famous golf buddy Gary Player and how the real-estate developer William Levitt came to have a “trophy wife.”

He also spent considerable time praising the achievements of the graduates — he brought several of them onstage — and told them that they were graduating at a “defining moment” in the Army’s history, and were “respected more than any army anywhere in the world.”

Mr. Trump, who never served in the military and avoided the Vietnam War by citing bone spurs in his foot, touted projects that he hoped the new officers would be excited about, including new “brand-new, beautiful planes,” and the Golden Dome missile defense shield initiative that he unveiled earlier this week.

“In a few moments, you’ll become graduates of the most elite and storied military academy in human history,” Mr. Trump said. “And you will become officers in the greatest and most powerful army the world has ever known. And I know, because I rebuilt that army, and I rebuilt the military.”

But in the United States, the power sector was the second biggest source of greenhouse gases, behind transportation, according to the most recent data available on the E.P.A. website. And globally, power plants account for about 30 percent of the pollution that is driving climate change.

The E.P.A. sent the draft to the White House for review on May 2. It could undergo changes before it is formally released and the public is given the opportunity to offer comments, likely in June.

The proposed regulation is part of a broader attack by the Trump administration on the established science that greenhouse gases threaten human health and the environment. Scientists have overwhelmingly concluded that carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases from the burning of oil, gas and coal are dangerously heating the planet.

“Fossil fuel power plants are the single largest industrial source of climate destabilizing carbon dioxide in the United States, and emit pollution levels that exceed the vast majority of countries in the world,” said Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, an environmental group.

She called the proposed regulation “an abuse of the E.P.A.’s responsibility under the law” and added, “It flies in the face of common sense and puts millions of people in harms way to say the single largest industrial source of carbon dioxide in the United States is not significant.”

The draft reviewed by The New York Times said the agency “is proposing to repeal all greenhouse gas emissions standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants.” That would include Biden-era requirements that existing coal-fired units capture carbon pollution before it leaves the smokestack and store it, and that require some new gas plants use technologies that pollute less.

“We are seeking to ensure that the agency follows the rule of law while providing all Americans with access to reliable and affordable energy,” Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, said in a statement.

Mr. Zeldin’s spokeswoman, Molly Vaseliou, declined to offer more information about the plan other than to say “the proposal will be published once it has completed interagency review and been signed by the administrator.”

The Trump administration is methodically uprooting policies aimed at curbing climate change, and the E.P.A. is at the epicenter of that effort. In recent weeks, Mr. Zeldin has shuttered offices responsible for regulating climate and air pollution, and has launched the repeal of more than two dozen regulations and policies.

The agency is feeling pressure from the White House to finalize its deregulations by December, according to two people briefed on internal discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to describe them. That would be an extraordinarily fast pace. Rewriting regulations can typically take more than a year.

One target is a 2009 E.P.A. finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health. That determination underpins most federal climate regulations, and repealing it would erase the agency’s legal authority to regulate carbon pollution from power plants, vehicles, oil and gas infrastructure and other sources.

Mr. Zeldin said deregulation would drive “a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion.”

In proposing to lift regulations on power plants, the E.P.A. points to the fact that the U.S. share of global power sector emissions represented about 3 percent of worldwide greenhouse gases in 2022, down from 5.5 percent in 2005. So, it argued, even if American power plants erased all their greenhouse gases from the power sector, the risk to public health would not be “meaningfully” improved.

But in the U.S., power plants were responsible for about 25 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in 2022. They emitted about 1.5 billion metric tons of emissions in 2023, which is more than the total greenhouse gas emissions produced by most countries.

Just a year ago, when the Biden administration announced tough new limits on pollution from existing coal-fired power plants as well as some new gas-burning plants, the E.P.A. said the restrictions would mean that by 2035 the nation would annually avoid up to 1,200 premature deaths, 870 hospital visits, 1,900 cases of asthma, 48,000 school absences and 57,000 lost work days.

Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University, noted that solving climate change means undertaking a large number of seemingly small measures, like curbing emissions from automobiles, oil and gas wells, air travel, landfills, buildings and more.

“Just because there are multiple contributors to a problem doesn’t mean we should excuse all but the top one,” Dr. Oppenheimer said. “Just because a polluter’s emissions are decreasing doesn’t mean that they aren’t still far too high.”

Attorneys who represent utility companies said they agree that the sector is a small part of the global climate problem. “The argument is a solid argument,” said Jeffrey R. Holmstead, who served in the E.P.A. during both Bush administrations and now represents utility companies as a lawyer for the firm Bracewell.

But he wondered if it would hold up under a legal challenge. “I just don’t know if you’re contributing 3 percent of greenhouse gas emissions the court will say ‘that's not significant’ when there’s hardly anybody that contributes more than that.”

Only China releases more pollution from its power plants than the United States.

The E.P.A. plan is likely to face lawsuits once it is finalized. If it survives, it could block future administrations from regulating carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, eliminating a tool that Democratic administrations have relied on to tackle climate change. It also could make it easier to unravel other climate regulations, some experts said.

“If the administration is going to do this, it is the strategically smartest way,” said Jonathan Adler, a conservative law professor at Case Western University. “If they’re successful with regard to power plants, they’re pretty much going to be successful with everything else,” he said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/25/multimedia/25trump-news-header-swap-kzjf/25trump-news-header-swap-kzjf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 11:06:02.294026

It aligns with national and global sustainability goals and is expected to play a critical role in accelerating the deployment of decentralised renewable energy solutions.
Speaking at the event, the REA boss stated that the programme aims to empower young Nigerian graduates from across the six geopolitical zones, enabling them to become part of the renewable energy sector.
He emphasised the need for Nigerians to turn the challenge of energy access into an opportunity, which is precisely what the RESCOs seek to achieve.

The Managing Director/CEO of the Rural Electrification Agency (REA), Engineer Abba Aliyu, made this announcement over the weekend in Abuja during the launch of the Next-Gen Renewable Energy Service Company (RESCO) Programme.

This transformative initiative is designed to engage, empower, and equip Nigerian youth with the skills and opportunities needed to thrive in the energy and technology sectors through skill development, mentorship, and strategic empowerment platforms.

Tribune Online reports that the programme is a forward-thinking platform aimed at building capacity, fostering innovation, and encouraging collaboration among RESCOs to scale up clean energy access across Nigeria. It aligns with national and global sustainability goals and is expected to play a critical role in accelerating the deployment of decentralised renewable energy solutions.

Speaking at the event, the REA boss stated that the programme aims to empower young Nigerian graduates from across the six geopolitical zones, enabling them to become part of the renewable energy sector. He explained that the pioneer cohort of 120 participants will undergo a paid three-month classroom education at the National Power Training Institute of Nigeria (NAPTIN), followed by a nine-month internship with selected Renewable Energy Service Companies.

He emphasised the need for Nigerians to turn the challenge of energy access into an opportunity, which is precisely what the RESCOs seek to achieve.

“We need to turn this challenge into an opportunity. Rather than seeing it as a crisis, we should view it as an opportunity—an opportunity to address the access gap, an opportunity to localise investment in renewable energy, and an opportunity to create a talent pipeline to tackle this challenge.

“To make Nigeria the renewable energy hub of Africa, several factors must be put in place. First is financing. We need sufficient funds to develop the necessary infrastructure and drive localisation efforts.

“And to date, we have secured a substantial amount of financing. Under the leadership of Mr President, the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) obtained approval for the largest public sector renewable funding in the world—a $750 million fund. Beyond this, discussions are ongoing for additional co-financing of $200 million, as well as potential funding of around $700 million for the Desert to Power initiative.”

Aliyu added: “In terms of localisation, through Mr President’s deliberate policies, our country now has a photovoltaic (PV) panel manufacturing capacity of 600 megawatts, up from just 110 megawatts.

“In Lagos, LPV operates at 100-megawatt capacity and is now fully functional. Here in Abuja, JRV has a 250-megawatt capacity, Oxano has 120 megawatts, and GridConnect is on the verge of completing a 150-megawatt capacity in Idu, Abuja. So, we are changing the narrative when it comes to localisation. Additionally, we now have more than 50 renewable energy service companies, compared to only 10 in the past.”

The Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, speaking through the Ministry’s Director of Renewable and Rural Power Access, Dr Sunday Owolabi, encouraged the renewable energy sector to continue investing strategically in human capacity and leadership. He described the programme as “a strong example of how government, industry, and development partners can collaborate to unlock new opportunities for innovation and impactful sustainable energy developments in the country.”

The Minister of Youth Development, Ayodele Olawande, while launching the programme, urged the graduates to explore opportunities within the renewable energy sector, adding that the Federal Government would always provide an enabling environment for them to succeed.",https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/1001012608-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 10:02:38.061641

The 389-page bill, approved by a narrow 215-214 vote, will likely inflict severe consequences on working families and job growth in the renewable energy sector. All Democrats opposed the measure, while just two Republicans, Representatives Davidson and Massie, voted in favor of protecting American jobs.

This legislation seeks to repeal several clean energy credits first established under President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which generated substantial revenue through stricter tax enforcement on the wealthy.

$3.7 Trillion Tax Cut for Wealthy Elites Risks Higher Energy Costs for Families

These credits included incentives for electric vehicle manufacturing that encouraged investment and job creation across the country. Analysts warn that scrapping these credits could lead to higher electricity prices and increased reliance on fossil fuels, adversely affecting air quality and public health.

Moreover, the bill is projected to add approximately $3.7 trillion to the national debt due to its significant tax cuts directed at the wealthiest Americans. In stark contrast to the Inflation Reduction Act, which was revenue-positive, the current Republican proposal is expected to worsen the fiscal deficit, channeling funds away from working families and towards affluent interests.

Additionally, the legislation targets pollution regulations established by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), raising concerns about potential health risks and escalating energy costs for ordinary Americans. With new regulations on the horizon and the trend towards electric vehicle manufacturing shifting to countries like China, many fear the loss of American jobs in this sector.

Sources mentioned that during the UPA regime, India was almost absent in the solar manufacturing scene, with a meagre 2 GW of solar module production in 2014.

In 2024, India transformed into a global leader, with solar module manufacturing skyrocketing to 90 GW and by 2030, the nation will reach an impressive 150 GW, they said.

In 2014, India had almost zero domestic production of solar cells and wafers, which was a stark failure of the previous government's policy, official sources said.

Today, India has built a strong foundation with 25 GW of solar cell production and 2 GW of wafer production.

India has planned solar cells and wafer capacity of 100 GW and 40 GW, respectively, by 2030, which is aimed at reducing dependence on imports and becoming a self-sustaining powerhouse.

Even in fully integrated production, the country has reached 3.2 GW in 2024, with a target of 24 GW by 2030.

Similarly, the biopower generation capacity has increased by 42% from 8.1 GW to 11.5 GW over the last 10 years.

The Compressed Biogas (CBG) sector expanded from a single project with 8 tonnes per day (TPD) CBG generation capacity in 2014 to 150 projects with a cumulative capacity of 1,211 TPD in 2024.

The PM-Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana has gained significant traction, benefitting almost 13.3 lakh households, with nearly 12 lakh installation in the past 10 months, sources stated.

India has added a record 25 GW of renewable energy capacity in 2024, which is 34.63% higher than the 18.57 GW achieved in the previous year.

India has set an ambitious target of having 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, which requires the addition of about 50 GW of green capacity per annum in the next five to six years, they stated.

Four renewable energy implementing agencies (REIA), SECI, NTPC, NHPC and SJVN, have collectively issued RE power procurement tenders of around 44GW in fiscal year 2024-25.

Earlier in April, India became the world’s third-largest producer of electricity from wind and solar energy in 2024, overtaking Germany.

Eliminating energy standards will likely be met with legal challenges, as their supporters say doing so is illegal.","To comply with an executive order from President Donald Trump, the U.S. Energy Department is preparing to eliminate rules that conserve water and improve energy efficiency.

The President claims that such rules make household appliances less effective and more expensive. However, this stance conflicts with government data and industry expertise.

What's happening?

As The New York Times reported, the Energy Department is focusing on 47 regulations the Trump administration believes are increasing costs and lowering Americans' quality of life.

These regulations address everything from faucets to microwaves, air conditioners, and, oddly, even people trying out for sports teams organized for another gender.

However, energy-efficiency experts say that eliminating these regulations would actually drive costs up for American consumers. Without them, running household appliances would become more expensive, draining more natural resources and adding more pollution to our environment.

Andrew deLaski, the Appliance Standards Awareness Project's executive director, said in the Times report, ""If this attack on consumers succeeds, President Trump would be raising costs dramatically for families as manufacturers dump energy- and water-wasting products into the market.""

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency plans to eliminate Energy Star certifications for home appliances and other clean energy programs.

Why are water and energy regulations important?

Regulations like the 47 on the Energy Department's list described as ""burdensome"" and ""costly"" are crucial because they ensure that our planet's resources are used sustainably. They are particularly essential right now as our changing weather patterns create new environmental challenges that threaten the lives of all species.

Scientific data proves that renewable energy is among the best ways to lower American families' energy costs. Energy-efficient appliances can help reduce home energy bills by 30% or more.

According to government scientists cited by the Times, efficiency standards saved American households an average of $576 in 2024 while reducing U.S. energy consumption by 6.5% and public water use by 12%.

What's being done to protect efficiency regulations?

Climate activists and supporters of energy efficiency aren't giving up on these important regulations without a fight. According to the Times' sources, laws prohibit the government from becoming more lenient on standards already in place.

Eliminating energy standards will likely be met with legal challenges, as their supporters say doing so is illegal. Even if approved, the process would likely take months or even longer to implement.

In the meantime, you can do your part to conserve resources while saving money within the comfort of your private home. Energy-efficient appliances like washers and dryers can cut utility bills and contribute to less waste and pollution.

You can take your personal actions a step further by contacting your elected officials and encouraging their support for regulations that protect our clean water and energy supplies.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/energy-efficiency-regulationsimage-recH8iqR6Lql1M6zt.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 09:02:54.395645

However, the development of EV infrastructure is far from even across all states.

While some states are racing ahead with robust charging networks, others are dragging their feet, leaving EV drivers with few options.

Which brings us to the matter at hand: which US states have the best (and worst) EV infrastructure?

VISIT SBX CARS – View live supercar auctions powered by Supercar Blondie

The US currently has more than 192,000 public charging ports, with around 1,000 added every week, according to the Department of transportation.

While that might sound impressive, it falls short of national goals.

The White House previously announced a target of 500,000 chargers by 2026, which is out of reach at this point.

Looking forward, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory projects the need for more than two million chargers by 2030, which may seem like a huge number.

However, given how companies like BYD are developing EVs so affordable, it’s clear the demand is there.

So how do we measure which states are ahead of the game, and which are falling behind?

Enter the HERE-SBD EV Index, a metric developed by mapping company HERE and automotive research firm SBD Automotive.

It scores states on four key areas:

Charger power – Faster chargers are better. The higher the wattage, the quicker the charge.

Charging points per mile of road – It’s not only about how many chargers a state has, but how well they’re spread out.

EV market share – A higher share of EVs show stronger adoption.

EVs per charger – Fewer EVs per charger means it’s easier to find an available spot.

So what are the top 10 states for EV infrastructure?

1) Delaware – 79.4

2) Washington, DC – 72.5

3) Massachusetts – 64.2

4) Nevada – 64.2

5) Connecticut – 63.7

6) New York – 62.3

7) California – 61.8

8) Vermont – 60.8

9) New Jersey – 60.3

10) Rhode Island -60.3

These are the states leading the charge (literally), with most of the top performers in the northeast, and a few out west.

And what about the bottom 10?

51) Alaska- 19.6

50) Arkansas – 33.3

49) Idaho – 35.3

48) Nebraska – 37.3

47) Minnesota – 40.7

46) Mississippi – 40.7

45) Kentucky – 42.1

44) Michigan – 42.1

43) Kansas – 42.2

42) Illinois – 42.2

These states lag in both availability and power. Alaska, for example, has almost no utility rebates or incentives for EV charging.

On the other hand, Arkansas has better coverage, but the incentives for a Level 2 charger is only $500, compared to the national average of $3,488.

While rebates aren’t part of the EV index score, there’s a clear connection. States with generous incentives often score higher.

For example, Washington, DC offers a 50 percent tax credit up to $10,000 for Level 2 chargers, plus utility programs that cover installation costs.

New York offers over 19 different rebate programs, some targeted at specific communities or building types.

Even at-home charging can help ease the strain on public infrastructure, as 56 per cent of the US offers residential rebates, averaging $534.

Perhaps EV owners should use this hack to charge their cars from ‘literally’ anywhere, while the infrastructure develops.

While the US still has a long journey to reach 500,000 public chargers by 2026, progress is being made.

The study indicates that expanding incentive programs and investing in more chargers will be key to keeping up with rising demands.

After all, most American auto executives seem to think that cheap Chinese EVs entering the US market is only a matter of when, not if.",https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Your-paragraph-text-13.webp,N,,2025-05-25 09:03:02.300442

The U.S. plans to cut Energy Star. Could that raise costs for Canadians?

Energy Star, a popular program that highlights energy-efficient appliances from furnaces to dishwashers, is reportedly on the chopping block in the U.S.

It and other divisions that oversee climate change and energy efficiency would be eliminated as part of the Trump administration's reorganization of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Washington Post and the New York Times reported earlier this month.

That could affect the labels Canadians rely on to know what products will help them save on energy bills, say observers such as Sarah Riddell, policy research associate with the non-profit Efficiency Canada.

""They can see … just with that one symbol that it's going to be one of the top performers in terms of energy efficiency,"" she said.

But will that symbol still exist after the U.S. program is gone?

While Energy Star Canada is administered by the Canadian government, it relies on U.S. standards, certification and testing for many products — and it's not clear how it will operate without the U.S. program.

Girls and young women need better access to mental health care, StatsCan report suggests

When Emma Bockner was eight, she was prescribed medication for ADHD. Then as a teen, she started experiencing problematic substance use.

""There were a lot of things that happened in my childhood that left me with feelings of inadequacy,"" said Bockner, 26, who lives in Richmond Hill, Ont. She's survived emotional and sexual abuse and struggled with an eating disorder.

When Bockner graduated from high school, she saw her friends moving on with fulfilling lives, as she found herself with a part-time job, often sitting in her room alone, drinking and doing drugs.

""It took me about six months to get into treatment, a couple of months to get into a group home,"" Bockner recalled.

Waitlists for mental health and substance use services are one of the deterrents for girls and young women in Canada looking for professional help, a new report from Statistics Canada suggests.

The report looked at access to mental health and substance use health supports among girls and women aged 15 to 29 using 2022 data, the most recent available.

Of these girls and young women, nearly four in 10 met the criteria for at least one of generalized anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, social phobia, or alcohol and substance dependence, said Kristyn Frank, a senior researcher with Statistics Canada's health analysis division in Ottawa.

In comparison, fewer than two in 10 in Canada's general population met the criteria for a mental health or substance use disorder that same year, the report found.

""There definitely is something going on with young women and girls in terms of mental health and substance use increasing during the pandemic,"" Frank said.

'Rifts in families': Alberta parents seek better talk on vaccines as measles outbreak grows

As the measles outbreak grows in Alberta, some parents are feeling the strain. They're trying to keep kids safe and navigate touchy vaccine conversations with friends and family, whether they support them or not.

Jillian Carter lives in Lethbridge, where the vaccination rate for seven-year-olds last year ranged from 47 per cent in the surrounding county to 80 per cent within the city.

Her first child is an eight-week-old infant who is too young to be vaccinated. So Carter leaves her at home when she shops for groceries, goes out less, covers her daughter's bucket seat when she enters a building and generally avoids meeting new people socially.

""It does make it hard to branch out into like other communities, knowing that your child's safety is at risk when you don't know where other people are standing [on vaccines],"" she said.

""You find your people and you know your people. But it's also something that does make you a little bit scared leaving the house with a newborn.""

Measles was once eradicated in Canada, but it's coming back after a drop in vaccination rates. In Alberta, the outbreaks started in March and have since grown to 505 cases.

The highly contagious disease typically causes a fever and cough, then a rash. This can normally be managed at home, but in some cases, it brings serious complications such as ear infections, pneumonia and encephalitis, which can lead to lasting brain damage.

As of this week, Alberta had one child with measles in intensive care.

CBC News stopped by a popular playground at Henderson Lake in Lethbridge recently to talk with parents about how this is affecting them and their families.

So big that you could have actually bought a brand-new Tesla Model 3 with the money you lost and still have change left over.
The Tesla Model S will likely lose 63% of its price over the next five years, which is yet another reason to choose its smaller, younger brother, the Model 3, instead.
A direct rival to the Tesla Model S, the Lucid Air is a large EV sedan with spectacular range, aimed at the upmarket.
Still, if you're looking for something with a good chance of holding its value better than that, the Tesla Model 3 wins out here.","The Tesla Model 3 has long dominated the EV sales charts, hitting a sweet spot of affordability, brand recognition, and convenience (through that Tesla Supercharger network) that has made it an all-around good option for a wide range of buyers. But things have changed in the last several years, with Tesla sales dropping in 2024, and now there are a number of good EV options on the market — some catering to specialized markets and some competing for that all-rounder sweet spot.

As a buyer, that's great for you. With a wider set of options, though, come tougher choices. If you're choosing between a couple of cars you like, or if you're trying to stay smart with your money, one important deciding factor will be the car's likely resale value. Even if one car has a higher sticker price, if it holds its value better than the competition, it can actually wind up cheaper in the long run.

Predicting where resale values will be in the future is hard, particularly in an industry going through such major disruptions. To help you out, we've examined estimates from several market-watchers, including Kelley Blue Book, iSeeCars, and others. We averaged their 5-year depreciation estimates for new cars, either MY2024 or MY2025. Forecasts vary, but the Tesla Model 3 ought to lose around 57% of its value over the next five years. Listed below are some popular EVs that depreciate faster than that, which might make you give the compact sedan a second look.

All things considered, the excellence-in-engineering Porsche Taycan remains the performance EV to beat. Someone must have told the Stuttgart-based maker that electric cars were boring, which it took as a challenge, because the Taycan features ballistic acceleration on top of Porsche's signature handling excellence. Plus, the interior is nice.

What's not nice? It's expected to lose about 61% of its MSRP after five years of use. Very fast, very fun use, yes, but that's still a lot of pennies to lose in that timeframe. And because sticker prices start around $100,000, plus a $2,250 destination fee, that ends up being a pretty big hit. So big that you could have actually bought a brand-new Tesla Model 3 with the money you lost and still have change left over. Of course, if you're the kind of person who can afford to buy one in the first place, you might also be the kind of person who won't miss that kind of money.

The Model S, the oldest model in Tesla's 2025 line-up, is both a larger sedan than the Model 3 and a more luxurious experience. It's the car that put the EV-only manufacturer on the map, and for a lot of people, it's still the first thing they think of when you mention the brand. That said, time has not been kind to the Model S, and sales have flagged as interest shifted to the cheaper Model 3 and the crossover Model Y. Even Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said they mostly keep it on the production line for ""sentimental reasons.""

Since fewer people are buying them new, maybe it's not a surprise that fewer people are estimated to buy them used, pushing resale prices down. The Tesla Model S will likely lose 63% of its price over the next five years, which is yet another reason to choose its smaller, younger brother, the Model 3, instead.

A direct rival to the Tesla Model S, the Lucid Air is a large EV sedan with spectacular range, aimed at the upmarket. Still, while the high-end trims can set you back over $250,000, the cheapest basic Pure trim has a more earthly MSRP of around $64,000 plus a destination fee of $1,500. Given that even the low-end model can purportedly go 420 miles on a single charge while still sending 430 horsepower to the rear wheels, it's no wonder the relatively new car, first introduced for model year 2022, is making waves. Air waves. Because it's the Lucid Air — you get it.

Sadly, while the car is quick, its depreciation just might drop quicker. The sale price of the Air Pure is estimated to plummet somewhere around 65% in the next five years, which is really not a great number. In fairness, the Air hasn't even been around for five years yet, so the crystal ball is murkier than ever on this one. Still, if you're looking for something with a good chance of holding its value better than that, the Tesla Model 3 wins out here.

Where some electric carmakers are looking to reinvent the wheel, sometimes literally, like Tesla did with the yoke, BMW has more or less gone in the completely opposite direction. Its EVs look, both inside and out, relatively similar to its internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, beaver-tooth grill and all. So instead of buying ""an electric BMW,"" you're just getting a BMW that happens to be an electric car you actually want to own. It's tasteful, it's comfortable, and when you put your foot down, it can give you a kick in the pants, too (tastefully and comfortably, of course).

Sadly, the most Bimmer-of-all-traits has followed it from gas engines to electric motors: Its worth sinks like a stone on water. A BMW i4 is estimated to depreciate around 65% over five years. But, hey, if you were looking at that blue and white badge in the first place, resale value may not have been your first priority anyway.

The Nissan Leaf has been on the market since 2010, ancient history for a non-Tesla EV. It's still going strong, though, as one of the cheaper options on the market, with an MSRP starting around $28,000 plus a $1,140 destination fee. Of course, for that money, you're also getting less than a lot of the other entries on this list, such as a shorter range at 149 miles and less power at 147 hp. It's a cute little thing, though, with decent space for its class and a small footprint. All in all, it's great for a town car.

Sadly, it won't be hanging on to as much of that sticker price as you might like. Over five years, guesses are that the Leaf will fall about 61%. Of course, given that it's so cheap to begin with, that doesn't work out to a huge amount of actual dollars. Other options on this list will lose more in depreciation than the Leaf even costs brand new.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/these-new-evs-all-depreciate-faster-than-a-tesla-model-3/l-intro-1747678229.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 11:06:16.290269

With sleek exterior lines and a surprisingly spacious interior, it delivers more than just visual appeal—it’s also one of the most fuel-efficient sedans in Chevrolet’s lineup.

Powered by a 1.5L turbocharged 4-cylinder engine paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), the Malibu offers smooth acceleration and great mileage. According to EPA estimates, the 2025 Malibu achieves around 29 MPG in the city and 36 MPG on the highway. This makes it an excellent option for daily commuters or families looking for a fuel-conscious ride without moving into a hybrid or electric vehicle.

Despite its focus on efficiency, the Malibu doesn’t compromise on comfort or features. Higher trims include amenities like heated seats, wireless smartphone integration, and advanced driver-assistance systems.

Chevy Equinox: Compact SUV with Everyday Efficiency

The 2025 Chevy Equinox is a compact SUV that strikes a balance between fuel efficiency and utility. As more drivers gravitate toward SUVs for their cargo space and elevated ride height, the Equinox stands out as a fuel-efficient choice in a competitive segment.

Equipped with a 1.5L turbocharged engine and a 6-speed automatic transmission, the Equinox delivers an EPA-estimated 26 MPG city and 31 MPG highway in front-wheel-drive (FWD) models. All-wheel-drive (AWD) versions offer slightly lower numbers but maintain respectable efficiency.

What sets the Equinox apart is its blend of efficiency with versatility. With seating for five, flexible cargo configurations, and Chevy Safety Assist standard across trims, it’s a great all-around choice for urban families or solo adventurers looking to save at the pump without sacrificing practicality.

Chevy Bolt EV: All-Electric Efficiency Leader

When it comes to pure electric power and maximum efficiency, the 2025 Chevy Bolt EV leads the pack. With rising fuel costs and growing environmental concerns, fully electric vehicles are becoming a more attractive option for mainstream buyers—and the Bolt delivers exceptional range and zero-emissions driving.

The 2025 Bolt EV offers an estimated EPA range of 259 miles per full charge, making it one of the most practical EVs for everyday driving. While it doesn’t use traditional gasoline, its efficiency equivalent is about 120 MPGe combined, meaning it costs significantly less to operate compared to gas-powered counterparts.

In addition to excellent range, the Bolt EV includes DC fast-charging capability, which can provide up to 100 miles of range in about 30 minutes. It’s an ideal choice for eco-conscious drivers looking for a low-maintenance, high-efficiency commuter car.

Chevy Traverse: Full-Size Capability with Competitive MPG

For those who need a larger SUV but still want reasonable fuel efficiency, the 2025 Chevy Traverse is worth a closer look. With three rows of seating and room for up to eight passengers, it’s a strong choice for growing families, road-trippers, or anyone needing generous interior space.

Despite its size, the Traverse’s 3.6L V6 engine is optimized for highway cruising and long-distance driving. The 2025 model is expected to achieve around 18 MPG in the city and 27 MPG on the highway, which is competitive for a vehicle in its class.

In addition to solid fuel economy, the Traverse benefits from refined handling, an updated infotainment system, and an array of standard safety features. For families needing both space and fuel efficiency, the Traverse represents a smart compromise.

Chevy Silverado 1500: Truck Power with Fuel-Saving Technology

Pickup trucks aren’t typically associated with fuel efficiency, but the 2025 Chevy Silverado 1500 aims to change that perception. With a range of powertrain options, including fuel-efficient turbocharged engines and diesel variants, the Silverado offers surprising mileage for a full-size truck.

One of the most efficient configurations is the 3.0L Duramax® Turbo-Diesel, which delivers an EPA-estimated 24 MPG city and 29 MPG highway in two-wheel-drive setups. These numbers make it one of the most fuel-efficient trucks on the market, without sacrificing towing capacity or hauling capability.

Even the 2.7L turbocharged gas engine, newly refined for 2025, offers strong performance while improving fuel efficiency over previous models. Chevy’s advanced cylinder deactivation and start-stop systems further help reduce fuel use during city driving or when idling.

Whether you’re using it for work or play, the Silverado 1500 shows that muscle and mileage can go hand in hand.

Conclusion

Fuel efficiency is more than just a buzzword—it’s a practical necessity in today’s driving environment. Fortunately, Chevrolet continues to meet that demand across its diverse vehicle lineup. From the all-electric Bolt EV and the efficient Malibu sedan to family-ready SUVs like the Equinox and Traverse, and even the hardworking Silverado 1500, Chevy offers something for every lifestyle without forcing drivers to compromise on performance or utility.

As you’re considering your next vehicle purchase, comparing MPG ratings can be just as important as horsepower, tech features, or cargo space. Fuel savings can add up quickly, especially for those who drive long distances or face rising gas prices. If you’re ready to find the right balance of power and efficiency, take test drives, and get expert advice.",https://techbullion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-05-25-at-15.55.28_2fe9ad20.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 13:09:28.732972

But as he prepares to take over from one of the world's most influential investors, Abel now oversees a huge fossil fuel empire and defends coal power, even as the climate crisis worsens.

What Happened: Abel started at CalEnergy in 1992, according to the Los Angeles Times. Working with geothermal plants at the Salton Sea and China Lake that produced clean electricity, he rose through the ranks, ultimately becoming president.

Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share.

In 1999, CalEnergy purchased MidAmerican Energy, and soon, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway became a major investor. This deal marked Buffett's entry into the energy sector and brought Abel into his inner coterie.

Despite his start in clean energy, at the company's annual meeting in Omaha, Abel responded to a question about Berkshire's coal pollution, which is ranked worst among major U.S. firms for nitrogen oxide emissions according to a Reuters investigation, by stating that utilities like MidAmerican were molded by state policies.

""We had to recognize we implement public policy across these states,"" he said. Abel also said that coal plants were still vital to grid stability, particularly in Iowa, where five coal units are still operational.

See Also: The team behind $6B+ in licensing deals is now building the next billion-dollar IP empire — invest early at $2.25/share.

Why It Matters: Abel's comments, alongside Berkshire's lobbying record, indicate that the company is reluctant to hasten a transition to clean energy.

Grassroots environmental organization Sierra Club criticized Abel's response, saying: ""Berkshire has teams of aggressive lobbyists and lawyers who fight against any regulation on the state and federal levels that would incentivize transitions to clean energy.""

As per data compiled by OpenSecrets.org, Berkshire spent $65 million lobbying the federal government in the last ten years. It has called for the loosening of air pollution regulations and filed lawsuits against federal and state environmental policies.

The company has also delayed closures of its coal plants in Utah and Wyoming, and is asking the Trump administration to block pollution-control mandates put in place to protect air quality in national parks.

While California has almost eliminated coal from its power mix, Berkshire's PacifiCorp still operates six coal plants across the Western U.S. A PacifiCorp spokesperson told the LA Times that coal retirement timelines are not firm commitments, and said they are subject to change.

Meanwhile, according to Bloomberg, Berkshire's investment in Occidental Petroleum stock has not turned out to be a successful bet, with analysts estimating that the company suffered around $4.5 billion in losses.

As Abel steps into Buffett's role, the contrast between his earlier involvement in clean energy and current coal-friendly stance raises questions about the future path of one of America's most impactful companies.

The Your View column on respect by Jim Ludlow that ran in The Morning Call on May 13 was cogent and made a strong case for how our respect for others is earned based mostly on their actions.

Respect is a powerful social force that has been used for millennia across all parts of the world to maintain order and adherence to cultural norms and civil interactions. It can shape and guide our behaviors. Respect can take many forms, including the admiration that comes when one does something valuable for the community. Respect can also mean having a positive regard for someone just for being a fellow human being.

Recognizing that we all have human needs and vulnerabilities can bring forth a respectful empathic response when we encounter others regardless of their personal or societal accomplishments. As such, we can respect the right of others to just be who they are.

Returning wallet was act of kindness

Was the letter printed recently in The Morning Call about a lost wallet being returned by an unknown person unusual? Yes indeed; we are so used to reading, ‘I don’t like this or that, him or her, this or that.’ We were always taught if you don’t have anything nice to say — then be quiet. Not in this day and age, sad to say, we always have something to say. Probably best not said if we think twice or even three times. It was wonderful to finally read something with so much gratitude for a stranger. It was so refreshing I just had to write. Giving back the wallet was awesome, unfortunately not as common as we would hope and pray for. Thank you for publishing such a heartfelt letter to show there are still awesome and honest people in this world. God bless them.

Letting white South Africans immigrate ignores racial past

The subject of this letter is President Trump’s decision to allow 59 white South African citizens to immigrate to the United States while denying nonwhite immigration from other countries.

As a teenager I was a shortwave radio (listening) enthusiast and Radio South Africa was easily received in the United States. RSA regularly featured positive reporting on the South African government’s policy of apartheid, under which the nation’s white minority population stole resources from and oppressed the majority (greater than 85%) Black citizens. The RSA broadcasts were widely one-sided and nonfactual in an effort to justify apartheid. I kept some of the RSA broadcast transcripts and publications as a reminder of the horrors of minority rule by governmental segregation and discrimination.

Sadly, it seems that the current U.S. administration favors immigration based on skin color while ignoring the horrors executed for decades by the minority white rulers of their home country.

Trump administration pushes double standard

How ironic that President Trump has pledged we will no longer lecture Middle Eastern countries on how to live when every single day he and his cabinet members tell U.S. citizens how to live. They dictate what medical procedures women can have, what books we may or may not read, how many dolls and pencils our children may be given and what proven medicines and vaccines we should avoid. Talk about a double standard.

US debt out of control

On May 26, 2023, The Morning Call published my letter which expressed my concern that the representatives of our republic were not taking William Shakespeare’s advice, expressed in his play “Hamlet” by Lord Polonius, to “Neither a borrower nor a lender be.” I reported that the national debt clock was showing that as of May 19, 2023, the debt was almost $32 trillion, and was increasing at a rate of about $1 million every 40 seconds. As of May 19, 2025, the national debt was about $37 trillion and increasing at a rate of about $1 million every 20 seconds.

On May 16, 2025, Moody’s downgraded the U.S. credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, due to concerns about raising government debt and the potential for future debt increases.

Any bets on when the poor and those in the middle class who do not start to save now, will be in the soup kitchen lines?

The IRA’s clean energy incentives are doing exactly what they were designed to do: stimulate economic development, create high-paying jobs and reduce energy costs through innovation.
Texas has always led on energy, and it doesn’t need to choose between being an oil and gas giant or a clean energy leader.
Turning our backs on the clean energy investments already flowing into the state would be a costly mistake with lasting consequences.","Texas has long been recognized as an energy powerhouse. While that legacy is often associated with oil and gas, Texas is also a leader in America’s big clean energy transition with wind farms in West Texas, solar manufacturing in Austin and next-generation battery storage projects across the state.

But that progress — and the tens of thousands of jobs that come with it — is now under threat.

Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, clean energy development has surged across Texas. This has added more than 29,000 new clean energy jobs in the state and attracted $14.51 billion in new private investments, according to a recent report from Climate Power. Projects like the T1 Energy G2 Solar Manufacturing Campus and Infinitum Electric’s advanced variable speed drive facility have solidified Texas’ role in building the technologies that will power our future.

But the Trump administration’s escalating war on clean energy, through tariffs and efforts to roll back the IRA’s tax incentives, is already harming Texas workers and communities.

In February, the Texas-based Rayburn Electric Cooperative learned the Trump administration had frozen its federal grant for a 160-megawatt battery storage system, a project that would be a critical improvement to the state’s grid reliability. That same month, Houston clean hydrogen startup Syzygy Plasmonics announced plans to lay off more than half its workforce, citing financial uncertainty driven by changing federal policies.

Then in April, news broke that a $1.2 billion federal grant for Occidental Petroleum’s air capture facility in Ector County was likely to be revoked by the Trump administration. This project represented not just a milestone in carbon removal technology but a major investment in West Texas, with broad implications for local jobs and economic growth.

Unfortunately, these are not one-offs. According to a recent Climate Power report, Texas has already seen 1,673 jobs and $4 billion in clean energy investments lost or threatened due to the Trump administration’s relentless assault on clean energy.

This is a setback for climate progress and bad economic policy. Repealing clean energy tax incentives stalls job creation, deters private investment and ultimately raises costs for Texas families and businesses. It also leaves our grid more vulnerable at a time when resilience is crucial.

Texas Republicans — many of whom represent districts that are reaping the benefits of this clean energy boom — should take a hard look at what’s at stake. The IRA’s clean energy incentives are doing exactly what they were designed to do: stimulate economic development, create high-paying jobs and reduce energy costs through innovation. Undermining these policies risks sabotaging one of Texas’s most dynamic and most promising industries.

This moment demands pragmatism, not politics. Texas has always led on energy, and it doesn’t need to choose between being an oil and gas giant or a clean energy leader. Turning our backs on the clean energy investments already flowing into the state would be a costly mistake with lasting consequences.

Let’s put long-term prosperity above short-term politics. Leaders in Austin and Washington must fight to protect the policies that are working. The stakes are too high and the opportunities too great for Texans to walk away now.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul and Equinor had announced the policy shift in statements Monday night, saying construction on the massive Empire Wind project would be able to resume following a month-long stoppage.

An Equinor spokesman told AFP last week that the company might abandon the project if a solution were not found soon.

Trump, who has repeatedly expressed opposition to wind energy -- claiming turbines are unsightly and dangerous -- signed a series of executive orders targeting the sector shortly after returning to the White House in January.

Those included a temporary freeze on federal permitting and loans for offshore and onshore wind projects.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced in mid-April that his department was ordering construction halted ""immediately"" on the Empire Wind project, saying predecessors in the administration of former president Joe Biden had not performed ""sufficient analysis.""

In a social media post Monday night, Burgum did not mention Empire Wind but praised Hochul for ""her willingness to move forward on critical pipeline capacity.""

Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil industry executive, have emphasized the need to streamline pipeline permitting, calling the issue a major impediment to natural gas development.

""Energy Dominance is the foundation of America's economic and national security,"" Burgum said on X.

""Americans who live in New York and New England would see significant economic benefits and lower utility costs from increased access to reliable, affordable, clean American natural gas.""

A Department of Interior spokesperson confirmed on Tuesday that the wind project halt had been lifted.

Hochul thanked Trump in her statement, calling the project ""critical"" in terms of jobs and clean power.

""New York's economic future is going to be powered by abundant, clean energy that helps our homes and businesses thrive,"" Hochul said.

Decades later, Vistra bought its Illinois coal plants betting they could still profit from selling their electricity.
Executives at Southern and the TVA already are backing off plans to retire coal plants or extending previously announced closure dates.
It is unclear whether the Illinois coal plant owners will follow suit.
During Trump’s first term in office, 79 coal plants closed and 13,000 industry workers lost their jobs.","For nearly four decades, owners of the Baldwin power plant in southern Illinois managed to avoid the most stringent requirements of the federal Clean Air Act.

The gargantuan coal burner, built during the early to mid-1970s, became the nation’s largest source of sulfur dioxide, which creates acid rain and lung-damaging soot. It also was among the top emitters of climate-changing carbon dioxide, smog-forming nitrogen oxide and brain-damaging mercury.

After Baldwin’s owners kept the Randolph County plant running for years while skipping the installation of modern pollution controls, a 2005 legal settlement with the U.S. Justice Department forced them to begin reducing noxious emissions that contribute to dirty air in Chicago, and other downwind cites as far away as New York.

Yet the coal plant remains one of the biggest polluters in the Midwest.

By 2020, competition from cleaner, less-expensive energy sources prompted the current owner, Houston-based Vistra Corp., to announce it would close Baldwin this year, and retire the rest of its Illinois coal fleet by 2027.

Now Vistra is hedging its decisions.

In November, the company said it would keep Baldwin running until 2027. Then last month, in an attempt to revive the nation’s dwindling coal industry, President Donald Trump threw a lifeline to Vistra and a few dozen other energy companies, encouraging them to apply for exemptions from the latest federal limits on soot, mercury and other toxic air pollution.

Vistra took Trump up on his offer, getting at least a two-year break from tougher regulations at Baldwin and six of its other coal plants: Kincaid south of Springfield, Newton in Jasper County, three in Texas and one in Ohio.

Howard Learner, president and CEO of the nonprofit Environmental Law and Policy Center, noted that regulators during the 1970s exempted dozens of coal plants like Baldwin from the toughest provisions of the Clean Air Act after utilities said they wouldn’t be running much longer. Decades later, Vistra bought its Illinois coal plants betting they could still profit from selling their electricity.

“Like others before them, they’re kicking the can down the road to keep running Baldwin and these other plants as long as they can,” Learner said. “People in Illinois and other Great Lakes states shouldn’t have the suffer the pollution consequences just because President Trump gave them a ‘get-out-of-jail-free’ card.”

Others benefiting from Trump’s exemptions include NRG’s Powerton coal plant near Pekin in Tazewell County, scheduled to close in 2028, and several owned by Southern Company and the Tennessee Valley Authority, two of the biggest energy companies in the Southeast.

Executives at Southern and the TVA already are backing off plans to retire coal plants or extending previously announced closure dates. They have told shareholders they are motivated by opportunities to cash in on a projected need for more electricity to power data centers.

It is unclear whether the Illinois coal plant owners will follow suit. Vistra and NRG told the Chicago Tribune they plan to adhere to previously announced retirement dates.

“But they have an escape hatch that goes all the way up to the president,” said John Walke, a senior clean air attorney at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council. “In our view, President Trump is breaking the law by abusing his authority, which appears to be designed to bide time while his administration attempts to roll back the regulations altogether.”

All told the 69 coal plants Trump exempted from the Mercury and Air Toxics Rule emitted 2,650 pounds of mercury into the atmosphere in 2023, the last year for which federal records are available. The plants accounted for about 10% of all industrial mercury emissions during the period.

Just a teaspoon of the toxic metal can contaminate a 20-acre lake. If certain types of fish are a large part of a mother’s diet, studies have found, mercury passed to her baby in the womb can irreversibly damage the developing brain.

The exempted coal plants also are responsible for nearly half of sulfur dioxide emissions and about a third of nitrogen oxide pollution from the nation’s electricity generators, according to federal records.

Under regulations from former President Joe Biden’s administration, now targeted by Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress, the power plants are required to improve the performance of mercury-reducing equipment, and in some cases upgrade filters that screen soot from billowing out of smokestacks. The more stringent standards effectively limit emissions of other toxics, including benzene, lead and arsenic.

For the first time, coal plant owners must install equipment to constantly measure mercury emissions, similar to what they already do for carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated last year the regulations will provide up to $3 billion in health benefits by 2037, while costing industry up to $330 million.

Republican attempts to roll back the mercury rule and dozens of other environmental regulations come as lower prices for natural gas have prompted many investor-owned companies to abandon coal. Prices for renewable energy have dropped so dramatically that it now costs 45% less to build a new wind farm than operating a coal plant with the same capacity, according to the investment firm Lazard.

During Trump’s first term in office, 79 coal plants closed and 13,000 industry workers lost their jobs. Last year coal plants generated just 15% of the nation’s electricity, the Energy Information Administration reported, down from nearly half in 2011.

Despite economic realities, Trump touts coal as a linchpin of his second-term policies.

“We’re bringing back an industry that was abandoned despite the fact that it was the best, certainly the best in terms of power, real power,” Trump said last month while flanked by coal miners and corporate executives wearing hard hats at the White House.

Though he has said it should be up to states to protect the environment, Trump ordered the Justice Department to target clean energy laws enacted by Illinois and several other states.

“American energy dominance is threatened when state and local governments seek to regulate energy beyond their constitutional or statutory authorities,” Trump said in his missive.

If the Illinois Climate and Equitable Jobs Act survives Trump’s promised legal challenge, the coal plants owned by Vistra and NRG would need to shut down by 2030 at the latest.

Gov. JB Pritzker, a prominent Trump critic, has vowed the president’s actions won’t survive court challenges.

Asked for comment, a Pritzker spokesman directed the Tribune to the governor’s interview last month with David Roberts, a clean-energy podcaster.

“We’re continuing to make progress even now, even with the headwinds that the federal government is putting in our way,” Pritzker told Roberts. “And let’s face it, all of what they’re doing is irrational. It truly makes no sense. We’re creating jobs, we’re growing our economy, in part, based on our focus on climate.”

With the Trump Clean Air Act exemptions, Vistra and NRG would still be able to sell electricity from their coal burners for a few more years without spending more money on pollution controls or improving those already in place. It also is possible they could lobby the Illinois General Assembly to extend the 2030 deadline, a common tactic in Springfield.

The result would be more toxic emissions and climate-changing pollution endangering everyone on the planet.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ctc-trump-coal-plants-mercury08_229196016.jpg?w=1024&h=751,N,,2025-05-25 07:02:55.631515

Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota shepherded the process by which the Senate was about to subvert the Senate Parliamentarian’s ruling that the EPA waivers were not subject to the Congressional Review Act (CRA).

Senator Thune maintained that the waivers were within the CRA parameters because they were effectively rules and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin had sent them with the suggestion that Congress nullify them.

The measure, which releases automakers from gearing up to produce electric-only vehicles in California and 11 other states, now goes to President Donald Trump’s desk for signing.

The release of the House bill on Thursday sent solar shares tumbling, with Sunrun losing more than one-third of its market value.","The troubled, $20 billion US residential solar market’s future rests on whether Senate Republicans will challenge their brethren in the House of Representatives and change provisions of the massive tax and spending bill that executives and analysts alike say would devastate the industry.

The bill passed by the House this week would strip away tax credits for companies that lease rooftop solar systems as well as homeowners who buy them outright. The industry is already reeling from tariffs on imported equipment, high interest rates and reduced state incentives in California, the nation’s biggest residential solar market. One major rooftop solar company — Sunnova Energy International Inc. — is laying the groundwork for a bankruptcy filing, and analyst Philip Shen at Roth Capital Partners warned the bill as written would effectively shut down the industry, starting next year.

Now, solar executives’ hopes rest on moderate Republican senators, some of whom have already said they don’t favor gutting clean-energy incentives. But given the party’s slim majority in the House, it’s unclear how willing they will be to change the bill and risk alienating fiscal hardliners in the lower chamber.

“the nation’s biggest residential solar company.

The industry has been struggling despite subsidies from former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. High interest rates have made it more expensive for companies to raise capital and for customers to finance solar panels. California cut the amount of money solar homeowners receive for electricity they supply to the power grid, lengthening the amount of time needed to recoup the cost of their systems.

In addition, the US International Trade Commission voted this week to move toward slapping tariffs on solar equipment from four Southeast Asian countries that provide the bulk of imported cells and panels, with levies ranging from 34% to 3,521% depending on the country and manufacturer involved. The vote was the culmination of a trade probe, and the US has already been collecting preliminary duties for months.

US residential solar installations fell 20% last year, according to BloombergNEF data. If the federal tax credits go away, the market will see a further 18% drop over the next ten years, said BNEF analyst Pol Lezcano.

The release of the House bill on Thursday sent solar shares tumbling, with Sunrun losing more than one-third of its market value. Equipment sellers Enphase Energy Inc. and SolarEdge Technologies Inc. also fell. Solar executives blasted the bill for essentially repealing much of the IRA, which President Donald Trump has called the “green new scam.” Former Sunnova CEO John Berger, in an interview on Bloomberg Television, said ending the solar tax credits for homeowners would be “patently unfair and un-American.”

Israel-based SolarEdge recently opened manufacturing plants in Texas and Florida, lured by the IRA’s incentives. “Removing the credits prematurely removes the business certainty necessary to continue the US investments SolarEdge has made,” a company representative said in an emailed statement.

The impact on installation companies — many of them smaller, mom-and-pop operations — could be severe, if homeowners decide they can no longer afford going solar. Leon Keshishian, CEO of Civic Renewables, called the potential loss of tax credits “a killer” that could force him to cut staff at his company, which installs residential systems in Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida. “It’s going to be incredibly challenging,” he said.

The loss of tax credits for solar leasing could be particularly damaging, since leases account for about 70% of new solar installations, said Joseph Osha, a clean energy analyst for Guggenheim Securities. “It’s pretty dire,” he said.

Solar industry leaders vowed an aggressive lobbying push in the Senate to change legislation that they say would result in economic upheaval and hundreds of thousands of job losses.

“We urge the Senate to reject the strident House approach and pass a reasonable energy policy for the American people,” Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said at the trade group’s annual convention in Phoenix.

One nascent technology that is gaining traction is underwater turbines, also known as tidal or marine current turbines, with new projects popping up in various countries.

Scientists have long been optimistic about the potential for underwater turbines to produce vast amounts of clean energy, however, to date, the technology has been little used, compared to conventional renewable energy operations such as wind and solar farms. The power of underwater currents is vast and untapped but harnessing it can be complicated.

Underwater turbines are designed to harness the kinetic energy produced by currents or tidal flows and convert it into electricity. The water passes through the turbine blades making them rotate, which drives a generator to produce electricity throughout the day and night. They work similarly to traditional wind turbines, only underwater. There are two main types of tidal turbines, tidal stream systems that require a fast flow of water and tidal range systems, which capture the potential energy difference between high and low tides.

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) announced plans to explore the potential of underwater turbines, aiming to make them more efficient and cost-effective. The DoE highlighted the lack of understanding about how the technology would interact with the underwater environment. Further, the high cost of hydrokinetic turbines had long deterred developers from rolling out the technology at the commercial level.

The DoE’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) previously provided funding for 11 projects with $38 million in grants in 2020, to develop cost-effective underwater turbine technologies. The technology was known as Submarine Hydrokinetic and Riverine Kilo-megawatt Systems – or SHARKS. The projects were targeted at producing marine technologies capable of generating electricity at an end cost of under $0.05 per kilowatt-hour, which was around one-sixth of the cost of existing underwater turbines.

The SHARKS projects developed two types of underwater turbines – Tidal Power Tug and Manta. The Tidal Power Tug, created by Aquantis, is a second-generation floating tidal energy converter. It was deemed ideal for gulf stream currents along the U.S. East Coast, which create multiple circular flows called gyres. Manta was developed by the California-based SRI International Research Institute. It used a lightweight foam and fibreglass kite with a small generator moored to the seabed. It is equipped with a motor to redirect and deflate the machine to avoid a collision with ships and storms. It is better suited for powering small and isolated communities.

Over the last five years, there has been a larger rollout of underwater turbines in several locations around the globe. In January, U.K.-based tidal energy company Proteus Marine Renewables (PMR) launched a tidal turbine project in the Naru Strait, Japan, which made it “the first to operate such devices in two countries”, according to the company. PMR’s AR1100 turbine is expected to produce 1.1 MW of power, helping to decarbonise the electricity supply on the Goto Islands.

Philip Archer, the Managing Director of PMR Operations Japan, stated, “Deploying the AR1100 in Japan is a testament to the dedication and expertise of our team working in collaboration with local professionals.” Archer added, “The result reinforces tidal energy’s potential as a dependable renewable source in Japan. Our next immediate focus is the commissioning of the turbine, Japan’s first-ever MW-scale grid-connected tidal system, and the subsequent testing and accreditation phase.”

In March, Normandie Hydroliennes (NH) began developing a commercial-scale tidal energy pilot project called NH1, off the coast of Normandy, which is expected to supply thousands of households with clean electricity if successful. The project will use four turbines to turn the Raz Blanchard tidal flow, the strongest tidal stream in Europe. The company was awarded funding from the EU’s Innovation Fund, which provides financing for research and development into innovative clean technologies. The company hopes to begin producing clean electricity from the project starting in 2028.

There is significant potential to develop more projects within the Raz Blanchard tidal flow, and NH1 may be the first of many. The Channel Sea current is one of the world’s most powerful, with a development potential of around 5 GW to 6 GW, meaning it could produce between 15 and 18 terawatt hours and supply electricity to 8 million people, according to NH. Katia Gautier, the director of the company, stated, “Being selected by the Innovation Fund is a major recognition of our work and the impact that our technological system, the innovative Proteus AR3000 horizontal axis turbine, can have on decarbonisation and the energy mix.”

While underwater tidal turbine technology is in its infancy, the influx of investment seen in the industry in recent years has given hope to many energy companies looking to roll out the technology on a commercial scale. If various pilot projects show promise, it could encourage greater investment in the sector, which could lead to a widescale deployment of the turbines in tidal streams worldwide, to produce vast amounts of clean electricity.

Three export terminals that captured half of the U.S. crude oil export industry have formed around Ingleside on the Bay, turning the Texas Coastal Bend town into an unlikely fenceline community.

This is the first story of a three-part series produced by The Xylom and co-published by Drilled, Floodlight, and Deceleration.

On Jan. 6th, 2024, nine minutes before midnight, the police department in Ingleside, Texas, uploaded on Facebook a now-deleted public advisory about a local oil spill.

“Flint Hills-INGLESIDE is reporting a release at one of their tanks. They have reported that it is all contained onsite — but the odor is pretty strong.”

Overnight, the roughly 700 members of Facebook group Citizens of the City of Ingleside on the Bay were whipped into a frenzy. This is a group that usually posts about scavenger hunts, Girl Scout cookie sales, and carpenter requests.

“I just walked outside to my backyard and I’m smelling the gaseous odor. Is anyone else experiencing this?” asked Diane Vega.

“Burning eyes!!!” replied Lynne Porter, who was then weeks away from retiring from her position as the Assistant Superintendent of the Ingleside, Texas, Independent School District.

“It was horrible last night also. We turned off the fans on our HVAC to decrease the probability we would have the odor in our house,” said town pharmacist Idana Merrick.

Ingleside on the Bay is a small seaside town with 614 residents in San Patricio County, Texas. It is a semi-enclave of Ingleside — on which it relies for certain basic services — and has a front-row seat to the north shore of Corpus Christi Bay, which Mount Rushmore sculptor Gutzon Borglum described as “the most beautiful bay on the Texas coast.” Until recently, residents could squint on a good day and see the skyline of Corpus Christi, the self-proclaimed “Gulf Coast Capital” with over 300,000 residents, ten miles across the Bay.

By all measures as of the last decennial census, Ingleside on the Bay is the opposite of the stereotypical frontline community: over 80% of the town’s residents are white as of the last decennial census; most have health insurance to deal with the immediate and long-term impacts of the polluted air they breathe, the polluted shoreline they walk on, and the polluted water they fish and swim in. Every resident I’ve talked to is semi-retired; some have multiple properties and can move out of town at a moment’s notice.

As a result of being a demographic outlier compared to other more notable fenceline communities, in each of the past three Presidential elections, Ingleside on the Bay’s precinct went for Donald Trump by at least a fifty-point margin.

But Ingleside on the Bay, which, according to the Zillow Home Value Index, has the second-highest home values in the Corpus Christi metro area, has become America’s crude oil export capital almost overnight. Residents still couldn’t believe their fate.

“Before I signed on the dotted line, we drove over there with my realtor and said, ‘Are you planning on doing anything?’ No, they weren’t going to expand, they weren’t going to do anything,” recalls Suzi Wilder, an RV park owner and Ingleside on the Bay City Alderman.

“Well, they didn’t tell us they were going to sell!”

Within a two-mile radius of Ingleside on the Bay’s City Hall are three such massive crude oil export terminals. Immediately east of aquamarine waterfront mansions is Enbridge Ingleside Energy Center, the largest crude oil storage and export terminal by volume in the U.S. The site of the spill, Flint Hills Resources Ingleside Terminal, is on Enbridge’s right. Beyond Flint Hills is Gibson South Texas Gateway, America’s second-largest crude oil export facility. Together, they make up nearly half of all U.S. crude oil exports – an estimated over 700 million barrels in 2024.

For the past six years, the U.S. has produced more crude oil than any other country at any point in history. More than a third of that is transported through a crisscrossing network of pipelines to crude oil export terminals, where the oil is loaded into tankers and exported to various countries.

Ingleside’s three facilities are putting the U.S. the closest it has been to becoming a net crude oil exporter for the first time since the early seventies, a longtime goal of energy independence advocates. But the economic, health, and environmental costs are grave: toxic air and water, dead sea animals, physical restrictions from accessing the water for fishing or recreation, pungent odors, nausea, and even asthma.

How do I submit a public petition if I am affected by Enbridge’s crude oil export operations?

Public petitions related to Enbridge’s Title V permit renewal should be submitted to the TCEQ, Enbridge, and the EPA. Instructions on submitting a public petition to the Environmental Protection Agency are available at the EPA website: https://www.epa.gov/title-v-operating-permits/title-v-petitions

According to the Texas Clean Air Act, “The petition shall be based only on objections to the permit raised with reasonable specificity during the public comment period, unless you demonstrate that it was impracticable to raise such objections within the public comment period, or the grounds for such objections arose after the public comment period.”

Public petitions should be submitted during the petition period to the TCEQ and Enbridge at the following addresses:

Locals are putting up a last stand: If they succeed, they will be the first in Texas to do so. If they fail, Ingleside on the Bay may well end up a ghost town — one more of the countless casualties from cycle after cycle of oil and gas exploitation.

“Ingleside on the Bay is our slice of heaven that you’re willing to turn into hell for a profit,” said Kelley Burnett, who captains the local dolphin boat tours.

“This is not just about our health, but our livelihood.”

AirPods in her ears to block out the noise, Lynne Porter runs along Bayshore Drive just four days after the Jan. 6th spill.

Since she moved from down the bay three years ago, what Porter sees, smells, and breathes in has worsened dramatically. Now she requires an inhaler to get through her day, yet she still insists on keeping her pace along the water’s edge: she’s been a runner her whole life.

Porter’s route turns back at the Brass Turtle Lodge a few feet away from a chicken-wire fence that demarcates the town’s easternmost boundary from McGloin’s Bluff, a buffer zone from Enbridge. On that day, she runs into her neighbor Cyndi Valdes, who was the Coastal Watch Association’s Executive Director at the time.

Looking through the fence across McGloin’s Bluff, all 909 feet of Cap Port Arthur looms. The 156,600-ton oil tanker would depart Enbridge on the morning of Jan. 15th, 2024, taking a 19-day voyage along the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic to Valero’s Jean Gaulin Refinery, in Levis, Canada, where the St. Lawrence River narrows. Porter and Valdes both notice fumes from crude oil loading permeating the air.

Students at MIT looked at the Risk Screening Environmental Indicators around Corpus Christi for The Xylom. They found that in the last few years, toxic pollution risk dramatically shifted from the south shore, where Corpus Christi and Nueces County is located, to the north, where Ingleside on the Bay and San Patricio County is located.

The Risk Screening Environmental Indicators data, published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, “account for the size of a chemical release, the fate and transport of a chemical within the environment, the size and location(s) of potentially exposed populations, and a chemical’s relative toxicity.” Higher RSEI scores indicate higher potential for risk-related impacts.

The 2022 RSEI score in Nueces County declined almost 30% from its peak in 2018, whereas San Patricio County’s increased nearly seventeenfold from 2018, exceeding Nueces County for the first time.

Valdes joined Ingleside on the Bay Coastal Watch Association as its first Executive Director in March 2023, the same month Enbridge and the Norwegian chemical company Yara announced Project YaREN, a nearly-$3 billion ammonia facility built on the last slice of undeveloped land, NS Ingleside’s old fire station.

Under her leadership, the nonprofit renamed itself the Coastal Watch Association to reflect the opening up of its membership to nearby townspeople, put up a highway billboard warning locals of the potential health risks of Project YaREN, and joined the Coastal Action Network, a grassroots coalition serving marginalized and fenceline communities across the Coastal Bend.

However, Ingleside on the Bay residents are learning what their new allies already knew: regardless of race, ethnicity, political leaning, or educational background, money is always a big part of the uphill climb for fenceline communities.

The Coastal Watch Association has successfully sought grants worth tens and hundreds of thousands from national philanthropies like the Rockefeller Family Fund, the Environmental Defense Fund, and Beyond Petrochemicals, many of which are fearing the possible retaliatory revoking of tax-exempt statuses by the Trump administration due to their support of environmental causes.

Yet, the crude oil that passed through the three export terminals in 2023 alone was worth roughly $50 billion, or more than the entire GDP of the state of Wyoming, the largest coal producer in the U.S. In June 2023, Gibson forked over $1.1 billion in cash to purchase the South Texas Gateway from Buckeye. Enbridge additionally closed a $200 million purchase of Flint Hills Ingleside from a Koch Industries subsidiary in November as part of an arms race with its competitors along the Gulf Coast. (For the purpose of clarity, the Flint Hills Resources Ingleside Terminal assets purchased by Enbridge, where the oil spill occurred, are referred to as “Flint Hills Ingleside” in this story.)

***

How did we calculate the crude oil export capacity figures at Ingleside on the Bay?

There is no publicly available database tracking how much crude oil each terminal exports every day. As a result, The Xylom used the companies’ self-disclosures to estimate crude oil export capacity figures.

S&P Global Commodities at Sea data shows that Enbridge Ingleside Energy Center exported an average of 1.1 million barrels of crude oil per day in July 2024, more than a quarter of the 4.2 million-barrel daily national average that month.

The South Texas Gateway Terminal accounted for approximately 12% of the United States’ total crude oil exports in 2023 year-to-date, or roughly 489,000 barrels per day.

Flint Hills Ingleside has not disclosed its crude oil export numbers, but local media reported in 2018 that it would be able to export 380,000 barrels of oil every day by 2019.

U.S. crude oil exports fluctuate from month to month, but are generally within the 4 million barrels per day range. At an estimated 1.97 million barrels a day, Enbridge, Gibson, and Flint Hills make up nearly half of all U.S. crude oil exports.

***

San Patricio County residents opposed to oil and gas, who number at most in the thousands, now also have to grapple with foreign corporations hoping to take a slice of the pie. The first owners who built the export terminals, Moda, Oxy, and Buckeye, are all based in Houston; angry residents wishing to picket at their headquarters could get there in a few hours. Enbridge and Gibson, the new owners in town, are based in Calgary, Canada. Yara even signaled that Project YaREN would take advantage of U.S. subsidies and cheap natural gas to make low-carbon “blue” ammonia and export it exclusively to Europe.

“When Oxy had it, we didn’t have any problems. Then Moda came, we had more problems the more ships were coming. And then Enbridge comes in? All hell breaks loose!” says Wilder, the City Alderman.

Port Corpus Christi and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have spent nearly half a billion dollars deepening the La Quinta Channel to match the width of the Corpus Christi channel and allow two vessels to pass by each other.

“So they can come in here, dump the oil, and get back out and make more money,” Charlie Boone, the President of the Coastal Watch Association, quips.

Residents were promised that dredging would not affect views or access to the Bay. However, a six-foot-tall spoil island formed outside resident jetties, even blocking the Corpus Christi skyline. White foamy gunk started floating on the water. Dead sea turtles and grounded seabirds washed ashore.

“We used to have tons of crabs, but we don’t have crab life anymore. The fish are a lot less,” says Wilder, who has lived yards from the chicken wire fence since 2016. “I remember calling Cindy, ‘You better see this!’ We had so much weight here. Not at all this year.”

Wilder told me that when she was on the beach during one Fourth of July Weekend, her silver ring immediately turned black after rubbing it in the sand, indicating an abnormal presence of strongly oxidizing substances.

Flint Hills’ 2024 spill ultimately totaled around 2,900 barrels of oil. When reached for comment, Jake Reint, Flint Hills’ Vice President of Public Affairs, pushed back against San Patricio County Emergency Management’s characterization of the incident as an “oil spill”; however, the EPA also used the term in a 2024 order.

Although the oil was contained on land and did not enter the Bay, Porter and Valdes say they are alarmed by this being the second spill during that week that affected their health. The first: A truck hit a valve at the Shamrock Terminal at Port of Victoria on Jan. 3rd, 2024, releasing an estimated 500 barrels of waste oil containing crude oil, solvents, and mercaptan, a colorless, flammable, and foul-smelling gas.

The sulfurous odor swept 60 miles downwind.

“My husband normally doesn’t call me when I’m out of town,” Porter recalls. “When he calls me, he says, ‘Something’s badly wrong. It smells horrible. It’s in my eyes. I can’t breathe! The dogs are reacting, they wouldn’t go out, they’re all huddled together.’ ”

The EPA wasn’t notified about the spill for over 24 hours. Shamrock Products didn’t issue a press release until three days later, on Saturday, Jan. 6th, just as residents were busy confronting the Flint Hills oil spill.

“Now if we had a major mishap. How the hell are they going to contain it?” Wilder asks.

The next day, Valdes drives me near the Brass Turtle Lodge to meet up with Wilder, the City Alderman.

Wilder used to live in nearby Taft, close to a crop duster airfield. She suspects that her skin cancer was connected to being exposed to the chemicals daily. Recently her skin cancers have multiplied, requiring biopsies every three months to monitor the condition. Wilder has even asked Valdes to accompany her to get surgery.

Despite her elected position giving her access to representatives from Enbridge, Flint Hills, and Gibson, Wilder doesn’t mince words regarding her personal views of her neighbors.

“They do come speak, but they don’t tell the truth,” she says, as an Odfjell tanker slowly passes behind her. “They sugarcoat everything and blow smoke up where the sun don’t shine. So it’s kind of sad.”

Driving along Sandpiper Drive and turning right into Starlight Drive, Ingleside on the Bay City Hall comes into view. A single-story, steel-clad structure, it doubles as the fire station. The town can’t afford to pay firefighters to man the couple of firetrucks sitting at the back; they can’t afford the personal protective equipment to deal with chemical fires or hazardous spills either.

Starlight Drive meets Main Street, an unlit two-lane road and the only land escape route. Turning right at the intersection leads to the main entrances of Enbridge, Flint Hills, and Gibson. A mile down the left is the Marine Spill Response Corporation.

To become a customer of the Corporation, a company must sign up for the Marine Preservation Association (MPA), a nonprofit consortium of over 1400 oil and gas company members that funds the Corporation. The Corporation is activated to clean up large-scale oil spills upon member request, or occasionally, the U.S. Coast Guard. Municipalities, which cannot be members by default, could only deploy the Corporation’s services after they prove they could foot the bill — a heavy lift for Ingleside on the Bay’s minuscule tax base, especially in a life-or-death situation.

And it’s not like Ingleside on the Bay could get help from its neighbors. Wilder recalled attending a recent State of the County meeting, where two towns each brought one truck operated by one firefighter. If fighting chemical fires or hazardous spills is a nonstarter, what about evacuating the kids, asks Porter, who still prioritizes her former students.

“They are not [evacuating]!” Valdes retorted. “They’d have to shelter in place, so they’d be dead.”

In an email response to The Xylom, Jake Reint, Flint Hills’ Vice President of Public Affairs, wrote, “Flint Hills has partnered with the Refinery Terminal Fire Company, which provides services to protect local industry and the community from hazardous fire incidents at the Ingleside Terminal. Additionally, our Helping Heroes program offers grants to emergency responders in San Patricio County.”

Instead of turning left and taking the direct route to our next location, Valdes turns right at Main Street. Valdes and Wilder wanted to show me how the lack of monitoring and enforcement has emboldened Flint Hills and Enbridge’s operations.

“I’m starting to smell Flint Hills, aren’t you?” Valdes asks me.

Immediately, it’s as if the lights in the room are dimmed: rows and rows of crude oil storage tanks, some made of concrete, some fitted with aluminum geodesic domes, line the horizon. The obelisks of the petrochemical industry juxtapose in stark contrast with the seemingly undisturbed vegetation and sandy bluffs in the future expansion and buffer zones.

“I try not to go down here,” Valdes gestures. My head began thumping. Truck after loaded truck passes us under the dull grey sky outside Enbridge, Flint Hills, and Gibson.

Wilder turns left onto Farm-to-Market Road 2725, which parallels the water. The Falcon Refinery Superfund site comes into view. Twenty years have passed since the EPA began evaluating how contaminated the abandoned refinery is; there is no timetable for when remedial action will start.

For residents, it’s a sobering reminder of how long-lasting the negative environmental effects of petrochemical facilities could be, even decades after their closure.

“That’s the thing with this industry,” concludes Wilder. “They’re not out to protect this town.”

PERTH, QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA, May 25, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Offshore wind energy will play a very important role in Australia's future. On the one hand, due to the need to replace more polluting sources of energy generation in line with the Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) initiative launched by the Australian government to facilitate the energy transition, but also from an economic point of view, since the commitment to the construction of offshore wind farms could mean a contribution of more than $40 billion to the country's GDP between 2027 and 2040, according to forecasts made by the Clean Energy Council.

Although there are still no offshore wind farms under construction -as opposed to the 90 onshore wind farms already in operation in the country-, 12 feasibility licenses were granted last year in the Gippsland region (Victoria), the most favorable region for the installation of this type of infrastructure -along with Newcastle, in New South Wales and Gladstone, in Queensland-, as a step prior to the start of the installation works. However, the inadequacy of the country's port infrastructures to meet the necessary requirements for loading and unloading materials onto barges and the marshaling of wind turbine components -jackets, transition pieces and turbines- continues to be one of the main obstacles to the proper development of these wind farms.

In this regard, Sarens, world leader in heavy lifting, engineered transport and crane rental services, is calling on public and private entities in the country to make a firm commitment to the renovation of port infrastructures, providing them with the necessary facilities to carry out the loading and unloading of materials in the necessary conditions of safety and efficiency.

With two offices in Australia (in Brisbane, Queensland and Perth, Western Australia), Sarens has a technical staff highly specialized in the tasks required for the installation of offshore wind farms in any of the coasts of the country, with the necessary capacity to advise its clients to identify their needs in terms of machinery and transport solutions, as well as in the necessary modifications and adaptations to be carried out in the points where the projects are developed. In addition to having a complete fleet of local machinery, Sarens has different alternatives spread around the world that can be mobilized at any time to meet any requirement of its customers, regardless of the complexity or the load that needs to be moved.

Offshore wind energy is expected to be a major source of job creation in the expansion areas, with more than 8,000 new jobs per year from 2030 onwards, with more than 19,000 jobs created in peak construction and more than 7,000 in the operation of the farms. Once all the farms planned for the next few years are operational, it is estimated that more than 23 GW of production will be contributed to the national energy system, which could supply renewable energy to more than 20 million homes, according to PWC's forecasts in its report “Australia's pathway to energy transition is blowing in the wind”.

Sarens has extensive international experience in the assembly and maintenance of wind farms. It has participated in various installations in France such as Fécamp, Saint Nazaire, Provence Grand Large and in the lifting and transport work for the foundation bases of the new offshore wind farm in Saint Brieuc, located off the Brittany coast. During this project, Sarens successfully transported loads weighing over 1150 tons. More recently, Sarens has been actively involved in the reception and loading operations of monopiles and transition pieces for 176 turbines for the Coastal Virginia Offshore wind farm in the US and the marshalling and installation of 62 monopiles in the Moray West offshore wind farm, each weighing up to 2000 tons, the largest and heaviest XXL monopiles ever to be handled in the UK.

While the initial focus was on the range-extended variant that will be sold in Europe as the CX-6e, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has now revealed a number of details about the fully electric model.

On the styling front, the design isn’t much of a surprise as it looks virtually identical to the range-extended crossover. As such, it features split lighting units and a fully enclosed grille, as well as digital side mirrors, flush-mounted door handles, and plenty of plastic body cladding.

More: Mazda’s New Electric SUV Packs Six Screens And A Range-Extender Powertrain

That much we were already aware of – the real news is the release of performance specifications. According to the Chinese ministry the EZ-60 will have a 255 hp (190 kW / 258 PS) electric motor that enables the crossover to hit a top speed of 115 mph (185 km/h), a lithium iron phosphate battery, and a curb weight of up to 4,806 lbs (2,180 kg).

Many details are still unknown, but Mazda has previously said customers can expect a CLTC range of around 373 miles (600 km). For comparison, the rear-wheel-drive Tesla Model Y delivers 368 miles (593 km), while the all-wheel-drive version manages 447 miles (719 km) under the same, highly optimistic Chinese driving cycle. Mazda also revealed the BEV variant of its crossover will have a 47:53 front/rear weight distribution as opposed to the 50:50 setup found in the range-extended model.

That’s not a lot to go on, but Mazda recently revealed they have received more than 18,000 pre-orders since the EZ-60 debuted last month. Bear in mind, though, that those numbers never translate into actual sales – they are just an indication of the public’s interest. Moreover, anyone could place a pre-order by paying a deposit that started at just ¥10 ($1.39), or practically pocket change.

Regardless, the EV should feature a classy cabin with a 3D heads-up display and a 26.45-inch screen. We can also expect an AI ​​assistant, a 23-speaker audio system, and zero-gravity front seats with eight massage modes.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Mazda-EZ-60-EV-234trgf-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 07:03:28.212510

Based on global best practices, CERC now proposes the Virtual Power Purchase Agreement as a fresh tool for meeting RCO targets.
Consumers can enter into long-term VPPAs with RE generators directly, via power traders, or through OTC platforms registered with CERC.
The RE generator sells the power at the market rate, and if there’s a gap between that and the agreed VPPA price, the difference is settled bilaterally.","In order to accelerate the transition towards clean energy, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) has released draft guidelines for Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (VPPAs), enabling greater renewable energy (RE) consumption by commercial and industrial consumers.

To support 2030 mission, the Centre notified mandatory renewable energy consumption obligations (RCOs) in October 2023 under the Energy Conservation Act, 2001. These obligations apply to various consumer categories viz. including electricity distribution licensees, open-access users, and captive consumers, who must source a minimum share of their power from clean energy. Falling short leads to penalties, unless the gap is bridged through Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs).

Based on global best practices, CERC now proposes the Virtual Power Purchase Agreement as a fresh tool for meeting RCO targets.

VPPAs are financial contracts between RE generators and consumers (or 'Designated Consumers' as defined under the law) in which the consumer pays a pre-agreed price, the VPPA price, for the electricity generated. However, instead of physically receiving the electricity, the RE generator sells it on power exchanges, and the price difference between the market and VPPA rates is settled between the parties.

SEBI has clarified that since VPPAs are bilateral Over-the-Counter (OTC) contracts and are non-tradable and non-transferable, they fall outside the Securities Contracts Regulation Act’s ambit, putting them firmly under CERC’s regulatory scope.

The draft guidelines are applicable to all parties entering into VPPAs and come into force from the date they’re notified in the Official Gazette. Consumers can enter into long-term VPPAs with RE generators directly, via power traders, or through OTC platforms registered with CERC.

Once registered under REC regulations, RE generators are permitted to sell electricity on power exchanges, such as in the Day-Ahead Market (DAM) or Real-Time Market (RTM). The RECs generated from this sale are then transferred directly to the consumer, who can use them either for RCO compliance or to claim green credentials. However, these RECs cannot be traded.

One key clause says that VPPAs are non-tradable and non-transferable. The RE generator sells the power at the market rate, and if there’s a gap between that and the agreed VPPA price, the difference is settled bilaterally. This creates a win-win, RE developers get revenue certainty, and buyers meet their green obligations without complex physical delivery logistics.

The RE capacity linked to a VPPA will be eligible for RECs upon registration. Once RECs are transferred, the consumer must inform the REC registry so the certificates can be extinguished, meaning they’ve been used and can't be traded further. These RECs serve as proof of clean energy use, helping entities fulfill their RCO commitments or boost their sustainability image.

Disputes under the VPPA framework are to be resolved mutually by the contracting parties as per their agreement. This maintains flexibility while ensuring accountability.

If adopted widely, VPPAs could make the energy world smarter, rules clearer, and help speed up climate action.",https://www.energetica-india.net/images/noticias/8Z4OXVaje4qcuDsImrGcNzcE0DBUKNcHmUVpviJoNlXRSg5mVMbyR.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 09:02:17.795210

Clean energy advocates said the bill walks back the largest government investment in clean energy in history.
At least four Republican senators, led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have urged continuation of energy tax credits, including support for traditional and renewable energy sources.
Republican-led states and Congressional districts have benefited from billions of dollars in clean energy manufacturing investments spurred by the Biden-era subsidies.","The multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed by House Republicans early Thursday would gut clean energy tax credits that Democrats approved three years ago while supporting increased mining, drilling and other traditional energy production.

A marathon session that began Wednesday resulted in 1,100-plus page legislation that curbs billions of dollars in spending across food assistance, student loans, Medicaid and action to address climate change.

The bill, which now heads to the Senate, repeals or phases out more quickly clean energy tax credits passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act during former President Joe Biden's term. Biden’s climate law has been considered monumental for the clean energy transition, but the House bill effectively renders moot much of the law's incentives for renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Clean energy advocates said the bill walks back the largest government investment in clean energy in history.

“In a bid to cut taxes for billionaires and provide a grab bag of goodies to Big Oil, the majority in the House took a sledgehammer to clean energy tax credits and to the protection of our public lands,"" said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“These credits are delivering billions of dollars in new investments in homegrown American energy -- creating jobs, lowering energy costs and addressing the climate crisis that is fueling floods, fires and heat waves,'' Goldfuss said.

President Donald Trump celebrated the bill’s passage, calling it “arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country.” Trump appealed to the Senate to pass the measure as soon as possible and send it to his desk.

The Senate hopes to wrap up its version by early July. At least four Republican senators, led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have urged continuation of energy tax credits, including support for traditional and renewable energy sources. Republican-led states and Congressional districts have benefited from billions of dollars in clean energy manufacturing investments spurred by the Biden-era subsidies.

Full-scale repeal of current credits ""could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,'' the senators said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.

""A wholesale repeal, or the termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing ... job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy,” the senators wrote in the April 9 letter. The letter was also signed by GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas.

In a win for House moderates and some Western lawmakers, the House bill strips language that would have allowed the sale of hundreds of thousands acres of public lands in Utah and Nevada. Opponents argued the sales would have opened the door for more oil and gas drilling.

What was gutted in the bill

The House bill takes an axe to tax credits for rooftop solar installments and eliminates electric vehicle tax credits after 2025, with a one-year exception for EVs manufactured by automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 cars that qualified for the credit.

Credits for solar and electric vehicles, which reduce harmful emissions, help to boost demand for the technologies and drive down their cost.

House Republicans also tightened tax credit restrictions for projects associated with foreign entities, including China — an added blow to domestic clean energy expansion since China dominates much of the supply chain.

The bill slashes a three-year phase-down schedule previously proposed, and instead cuts off projects that don’t start construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage. Those projects would also have to start operating before 2029.

“This bill threatens the clean energy industry at a time when it’s proving to be not only economically beneficial — lowering costs, creating jobs and fueling local economies — but also essential to America’s energy future,"" said Andrew Reagan, president of Clean Energy for America, an industry group.

The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry, applauded the bill as a step to “restore American energy dominance.”

“By preserving competitive tax policies, opening lease sales” for oil and gas drilling and advancing permitting reforms, the legislation “is a win for our nation’s energy future,” API President Mike Sommers said in a statement.

No sale of public lands

At the behest of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke and some other Republicans, lawmakers stripped a provision that would have sold or transferred about 460,000 acres (186,155 hectares) of federal land in Nevada and Utah to local governments or private entities.

The proposal exposed sharp divisions between Western Republicans who say the federal government controls too much of their states and others such as Zinke, a former Interior secretary in Trump’s first term whose state is protective of access to lands for hunting and recreation.

“At the heart of the matter is that public land that’s in the federal estate belongs to everybody,” Zinke told The Associated Press Thursday. “To suggest that you’re going to sell land to pay off the debt, I think that’s misguided and, quite frankly, disingenuous.""

The land sales had been inserted in the bill following a late-night committee vote, despite earlier pledges from Republican leaders that the sales were off the table.

Supporters said they would generate revenue and ease growth pressures by creating room for more and cheaper housing in booming Western cities such as Las Vegas, Reno, Nevada, and St. George, Utah. Those communities are hemmed in by federal property, which makes up 80% of the land in Nevada and 63% in Utah.

A spokesperson for Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, who sponsored the bid to sell federal lands in his state, said his office was “exploring all options” to make the transfers happen.

Housing advocates had cautioned federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing, and some of the parcels to be sold were far from developed areas.

Tracy Stone-Manning, president of the Wilderness Society and a former director of the Bureau of Land Management under Biden, said she appreciated Zinke’s work to prevent the public lands sale.

But she said the bill was still a “big giveaway” to the private sector. “By opening hundreds of millions of acres to drilling, mining and logging to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, this bill harms the tens of millions of people who like to hike, recreate or find solace in the outdoors,” she said.

Trump targets Biden's climate policy

At the same time the bill slashes support for clean energy, it paves the way for oil, gas and coal.

Through the bill, natural gas pipeline developers can pay a $10 million fee for expedited permitting, and applicants for a potential liquefied natural gas export site can pay a $1 million fee to be deemed in the “public interest,” circumventing what is usually a regulatory challenge.

But news of Amazon's decision on Becker sparked criticism from Republican Sen. Andrew Mathews, who said Walz's proposal to end the sales tax exemption was ""the final straw.""","Amazon has paused its plans to open a large data center near Xcel Energy Center's Sherco site in Becker, Minnesota.

The pause was confirmed by Xcel Energy, and comes in the wake of discussions in the Minnesota Legislature to end a sales tax exemption on electricity consumed by data centers in the state.

Xcel told Bring Me The News that Amazon had communicated it is ""pausing those plans because of factors independent of our readiness to serve the site’s electricity needs.""

In a statement Amazon spokesperson Duncan Neasham said: ""We are constantly evaluating new locations based on customer demand. We sincerely appreciate the support we’ve received from both the public and state and local officials as we continue to evaluate this location.""

Amazon had bought a 350-acre site next to Sherco, with Xcel in the process of decommissioning its coal-fired plants and proceeding with long-term plans to build a huge solar farm on the property.

Major tech companies are investing huge sums into power- and water-hungry data centers as it seeks to cope with the expansion of cloud computing and the proliferation and advancement of artificial intelligence.

But their development has sparked backlash in parts of the country, such as in Farmington, Minnesota, where a proposed $5 billion data center park has been criticized by nearby residents who have concerns about power and water consumption and noise pollution.

The pause from Amazon comes as state lawmakers consider a series of regulations on data center construction, including the removal of some tax incentives for tech giants.

MPR News reports one of the measures proposed by Gov. Tim Walz and the DFL would be to end the sales tax exemption on the electricity used by large-scale data centers, and described Amazon's pause in apparent reaction to that as ""pretty bad lobbying.""

In an interview, Walz said that Minnesota has highly generous incentives for data centers, before adding: ""But we have to balance our budget. And I think a lot of Minnesotans are saying, 'Well, you couldn't do a tax cut to my sales tax, but you could do a tax cut to (Amazon founder) Jeff Bezos?'""

But news of Amazon's decision on Becker sparked criticism from Republican Sen. Andrew Mathews, who said Walz's proposal to end the sales tax exemption was ""the final straw.""

""I’m incredibly frustrated that a major economic lifeline for the Becker community has effectively stalled,"" he said.",https://bringmethenews.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjEyNjQ3ODYwMDQxMTY0Mjk3/sherco-plant-xcel-energy.jpg,N,,2025-05-25 02:00:19.762304

A training program at a local community college promises renewal and provides training for students from disenfranchised communities

This story is part of a collaboration between the Institute for Nonprofit News’ Rural News Network and Canary Media, South Dakota News Watch, Cardinal News, The Mendocino Voice and The Maine Monitor, with support from Ascendium Education Group. It is reprinted with permission.

DECATUR, IL. — A fistfight at a high school football game nearly defined Shawn Honorable’s life.

It was 1999 when he and a group of teen boys were expelled and faced criminal charges over the incident. The story of the “Decatur Seven” drew national headlines and protests led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who framed their harsh treatment as blatant racism. The governor eventually intervened, and the students were allowed to attend alternative schools.

Honorable, now 41, was encouraged by support “from around the world,” but he said the incident was traumatizing and he continued to struggle academically and socially. Over the years, he dabbled in illegal activity and was incarcerated, most recently after a 2017 conviction for accepting a large amount of marijuana sent through the mail.

Today, Honorable is ready to start a new chapter, having graduated with honors last week from a clean energy workforce training program at Richland Community College, located in the Central Illinois city of Decatur. He would eventually like to own or manage a solar company, but he has more immediate plans to start a solar-powered mobile hot dog stand. He’s already chosen the name: Buns on the Run.

“By me going back to school and doing this, it shows my nephews and my little cousins and nieces that it is good to have education,” Honorable said. “I know this is going to be the new way of life with solar panels. So I’ll have a step up on everyone. When it comes, I will already be aware of what’s going on with this clean energy thing.”

After decades of layoffs and factory closings, the community of Decatur is also looking to clean energy as a potential springboard.

Located amid soybean fields a three-hour drive from Chicago, the city was long known for its Caterpillar, Firestone Tire, and massive corn-syrup factories. Industrial jobs have been in decline for decades, though, and high rates of gun violence, child poverty, unemployment, and incarceration were among the reasons the city was named a clean energy workforce hub funded under Illinois’ 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA).

Decatur’s hub, based at Richland Community College, is arguably the most developed and successful of the dozen or so established statewide. That’s thanks in part to TCCI Manufacturing, a local, family-owned factory that makes electric vehicle compressors. TCCI is expanding its operations with a state-of-the-art testing facility and an on-site campus where Richland students will take classes adjacent to the manufacturing floor. The electric truck company Rivian also has a factory 50 miles away.

“The pieces are all coming together,” Kara Demirjian, senior vice president of TCCI Manufacturing, said by email. “What makes this region unique is that it’s not just about one company or one product line. It’s about building an entire clean energy ecosystem. The future of EV manufacturing leadership won’t just be on the coasts — it’s being built right here in the Midwest.”

The Decatur CEJA program has also flourished because it was grafted onto a preexisting initiative, EnRich, that helps formerly incarcerated or otherwise disenfranchised people gain new skills and employment. The program is overseen by the Rev. Courtney Carson, a childhood friend of Honorable and another member of the Decatur Seven.

“So many of us suffer significantly from our unmet needs, our unhealed traumas,” said Carson, who was jailed as a young man for gun possession and later drag racing. With the help of mentors including Rev. Jackson and a college basketball coach, he parlayed his past into leadership, becoming associate pastor at a renowned church, leading a highway construction class at Richland, and in 2017 being elected to the same school board that had expelled him.

Carson, now vice president of external relations at the community college, tapped his own experience to shape EnRich as a trauma-informed approach, with wraparound services to help students overcome barriers — from lack of childcare to PTSD to a criminal record. Carson has faith that students can overcome such challenges to build more promising futures, like Decatur itself has done.

“We have all these new opportunities coming in, and there’s a lot of excitement in the city,” Carson said. “That’s magnificent. So what has to happen is these individuals who suffered from closures, they have to be reminded that there is hope.”

Richland Community College’s clean energy jobs training starts with an eight-week life skills course that has long been central to the larger EnRich program. The course uses a Circle of Courage practice inspired by Indigenous communities and helps students prepare to handle stressful workplace situations like being disrespected or even called a racial slur.

“Being called the N-word, couldn’t that make you want to fight somebody? But now you lose your job,” said Carson. “We really dive deep into what’s motivating their attitude and those traumas that have significantly impacted their body to make them respond to situations either the right way or the wrong way.”

The training addresses other dynamics that might be unfamiliar to some students — for example, some male students might not be prepared to be supervised by a woman, Carson noted, or others might not be comfortable with LGBTQ+ coworkers.

Life skills are followed by a construction math course crucial to many clean energy and other trades jobs. During a recent class, 24-year-old Brylan Hodges joked with the teacher while converting fractions to decimals and percentages on the whiteboard. He explained that he moved from St. Louis to Decatur in search of opportunity, and he hopes to become a property manager overseeing solar panel installation and energy-efficiency upgrades on buildings.

Students take an eight-hour primer in clean energy fields including electric vehicles, solar, HVAC, and home energy auditing. Then they choose a clean energy track to pursue, leading to professional certifications as well as a chance to continue at Richland for an associate degree. Under the state-funded program, students are paid for their time attending classes.

Marcus James was part of the first cohort to start the program last October, just days after his release from prison.

He was an 18-year-old living in Memphis, Tennessee, when someone shot at him, as he describes it, and he fired back, with fatal consequences. He was convicted of murder and spent 12 years behind bars. After his release he made his way to Decatur, looking for a safer place to raise his kids. Adjusting to life on the outside wasn’t easy, and he ended up back in prison for a year and a half on DUI and drug possession charges.

Following his release, he was determined to turn his life around.

“After I brought my kids up here, I end up going back to prison. But at that moment, I realized, man, I had to change,” James told a crowd at an event celebrating the clean jobs program in March.

James said that at first, he showed up late to every class. But soon the lessons sank in, and he was never late again. He always paid attention when people talked, and he gained new confidence.

“As long as I put my mind to it, I can do it,” said James, who would like to work as a home energy auditor. Richland partners with the energy utility Ameren to place trainees in such positions.

“I like being out in the field, learning new stuff, dealing with homes, helping people,” James said, noting he made energy-efficiency improvements to his own home after the course.

Illinois’ 2017 Future Energy Jobs Act (FEJA) launched the state’s clean energy transition, baking in equity goals that prioritize opportunities for people who benefited least and were harmed most by the fossil fuel economy. It created programs to deploy solar arrays and provide job training in marginalized and environmental justice communities.

FEJA’s rollout was rocky. Funding for equity-focused solar installations went unspent while workforce programs struggled to recruit trainees and connect them with jobs. The pandemic didn’t help. The follow-up legislation, CEJA, expanded workforce training programs and remedied snafus in the original law.

Melissa Gombar is principal director of workforce development programs for Elevate, a Chicago-based national nonprofit organization that oversaw FEJA job training and subcontracts for a Chicago-area CEJA hub. Gombar said many community organizations tasked with running FEJA training programs were relatively small and grassroots, so they had to scramble to build new financial and human resources infrastructure.

“They have to have certain policies in place for hiring and procurement. The influx of grant money might have doubled their budget,” Gombar said. Meanwhile, the state employees tasked with helping the groups “are really talented and skilled, trying their best, but they’re overburdened because of the large lift.”

CEJA, by contrast, tapped community colleges like Richland, which already had robust infrastructure and staffing. CEJA also funds community organizations to serve as “navigators,” using the trust and credibility they’ve developed in communities to recruit trainees.

Richland Community College received $2.6 million from April 2024 through June 2025, and the Community Foundation of Macon County, the hub’s navigator, received $440,000 for the same time period. The other hubs similarly received between $1 million and $3.3 million for the past year, and state officials have said the same level of funding will be allocated for each of the next two years, according to the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition.

CEJA hubs also include social service providers that connect trainees with wraparound support; businesses like TCCI that offer jobs; and affiliated entrepreneur incubators that help people start their own clean energy businesses. CEJA also funded apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs with labor unions, which are often a prerequisite for employment in utility-scale solar and wind.

“The sum of the parts is greater than the whole,” said Drew Keiser, TCCI vice president of global human resources. “The navigator is saying, ‘Hey, I’ve connected with this portion of the population that’s been overlooked or underserved.’ OK, once you get them trained, send their resumes to me, and I’ll get them interviewed. We’re seeing a real pipeline into careers.”

The hub partners go to great lengths to aid students — for example, coordinating and often paying for transportation, childcare, or even car repairs.

“If you need some help, they always there for you,” James said.

In 1984, TCCI began making vehicle compressors in a Decatur plant formerly used to build Sherman tanks during World War II. A few decades later, the company began producing compressors for electric vehicles, which are much more elaborate and sensitive than those for internal combustion engines.

In August 2023, Gov. JB Pritzker joined TCCI President Richard Demirjian, the Decatur mayor, and college officials for the groundbreaking of an Electric Vehicle Innovation Hub, which will include a climatic research facility — basically a high-tech wind tunnel where companies and researchers from across the world can send EV chargers, batteries, compressors, and other components for testing in extreme temperatures, rain, and wind.

A $21.3 million capital grant and a $2.2 million electric vehicle incentive from the state are funding the wind tunnel and the new facilities where Richland classes will be held. In 2022, Pritzker announced these investments as furthering the state goal of 1 million EVs on the road by 2030.

Far from the gritty industrial environs that likely characterized Decatur workplaces of the past, the classrooms at TCCI feature colorful decor, comfortable armchairs, and bright, airy spaces adjacent to pristine high-tech manufacturing floors lined with machines.

“This hub is a game changer,” said Keiser, noting the need for trained tradespeople. “As a country, we place a lot of emphasis on kids going to college, and maybe we’ve kind of overlooked getting tangible skills in the hands of folks.”

A marketing firm founded by Kara Demirjian – Richard Demirjian’s sister – and located on-site with TCCI also received clean energy hub funds to promote the training program. This has been crucial to the hub’s success, according to Ariana Bennick, account executive at the firm, DCC Marketing. Its team has developed, tested, and deployed digital billboards, mailers, ads, Facebook events, and other approaches to attract trainees and business partners.

“Being a part of something here in Decatur that’s really leading the nation in this clean energy initiative is exciting,” Bennick said. “It can be done here in the middle of the cornfields. We want to show people a framework that they can take and scale in other places.”

With graduation behind him, Honorable is planning the types of hot dogs and sausages he’ll sell at Buns on the Run. He said Tamika Thomas, director of the CEJA program at Richland, has also encouraged him to consider teaching so he can share the clean energy skills he’s learned with others. The world seems wide open with possibilities.

“A little at a time — I’m going to focus on the tasks in front of me that I’m passionate about, and then see what’s next,” Honorable said. He invoked a favorite scene from the cartoon TV series “The Flintstones,” in which the characters’ leg power, rather than wheels and batteries, propelled vehicles: “Like Fred and Barney, I’ll be up and running.”",https://i0.wp.com/hechingerreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC_0029-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1700&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-25 02:00:22.626472

New Source Of Baseload In Owings Mills, Maryland, an engineer and inventor with a slew of patents to his name, Key Han, dreams of a different kind of VPP, one which could, if widely deployed, provide a new source of baseload power.
Indeed, he said in an interview, “It would be a huge new source of baseload.” Han’s technology converts variable energy inputs into constant speed outputs.
If you have enough of these simple, low-cost generators installed, you have created a new baseload source, a virtual power plant of a different and exceptionally reliable kind,” Han said.","Virginia is the first state to formally press for the creation of a virtual power plant. Glenn Youngkin, the state’s Republican governor, signed the Community Energy Act on May 2, which mandates Dominion Energy to launch a 450-megawatt virtual power plant (VPP) pilot program.

Virginia isn’t alone in this endeavor, but it is certainly the most out front. There are many incipient VPPs clustered around utilities across the country.

A virtual power plant is the ultimate realization of something that has been going on for a long time as utilities have been hooking up various power sources, managed conservation and underused generation, known as distributed energy resources (DER). These, according to even small utilities, can contribute up to and possibly over 10 percent electricity to a utility system.

Organized and formalized and with enough coverage, DER becomes a VPP. Sometimes the terms are used interchangeably.

A virtual power plant not only depends on managed conservation and underused generation but also on some imaginative use of resources, like hooking up transportation fleets to discharge their batteries onto the grid when they aren’t in use. Electric school buses are frequently cited as playing a role in future VPPs. Conservation and solar roofs with related batteries are the backbone of DER and VPPs. Eventually, they are expected to be common to most utilities or consortia of utilities.

New Source Of Baseload

In Owings Mills, Maryland, an engineer and inventor with a slew of patents to his name, Key Han, dreams of a different kind of VPP, one which could, if widely deployed, provide a new source of baseload power.

Han, CEO and chief scientist at DDMotion, has pioneered speed-converter technology which, if widely deployed, would produce inexpensive, reliable energy in sufficient quantity to be described as baseload. Indeed, he said in an interview, “It would be a huge new source of baseload.”

Han’s technology converts variable energy inputs into constant speed outputs. For example, the flow of water in a stream is variable but with his speed-converter technology, the energy in the flow can be captured and converted to a constant speed output.

With his technology, grid-quality frequency can flow from many sources without extensive civil engineering or major construction, he told me. In particular, Han cited non-power dams, like the ones in New England which were built in the 19th century to drive the textile mills.

“A simple harnessing module with a generator behind the spillway coupled with my technology can produce frequency that is constant and ready to go on the grid. If you have enough of these simple, low-cost generators installed, you have created a new baseload source, a virtual power plant of a different and exceptionally reliable kind,” Han said.

Another use of the same DDMotion technology would remedy what is becoming a growing problem for wind and solar generators: the lack rotating inertia. Inertia is essential for utility operators to fix sudden changes in frequency caused by changes in generation or consumption (50 cycles in Europe and 60 cycles in the United States).

Lack of inertia has been blamed for the widespread blackout on the Iberian Peninsula and is becoming an issue for utilities with a lot of solar and wind generation, so called inverter power. This refers to the grooming with an inverter to power to grid-quality alternating current from its original direct current.

Solution For Inertia Problem

Here, again, his technology can inexpensively resolve the inertia problem for wind and solar generation, Han said. Either using a mechanical system or an electronic one, wind and solar systems could provide rotating inertial.

Increasingly, utilities are looking for untapped sources of power which can be bundled together into VPPs.

Renew Home, a Google-financed company, claims 3 gigawatts of electricity savings, which it says makes it the leader in VPPs. It relies on managing end-use load primarily in homes with load shedding of high energy-consuming devices during peaks. This is accomplished by using special thermostats and smart meters.

Industry experts believe artificial intelligence will be a key to extracting the most energy out of unconventional sources as well as fine tuning usage.

VPPs are here and many more are coming.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6831e9e3ccf84eaeb7ff51cd/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-05-25 10:02:57.878173

One House Republican, Dan Newhouse from Washington State, told me that 40% of his constituents are currently enrolled in Medicaid.","SCOTT DETROW, HOST:

House Republicans muscled through President Trump's massive tax and spending bill this week. The early morning vote came together in part because of a final personal push from Trump himself. The legislation still has a long road to go before it can become law, but the vote this week sends a clear message about where the Republican Party is today. So what does this all mean for Trump and the Republicans' agenda, and what does it tell us about how they're governing? We'll talk it through with NPR congressional correspondent Deirdre Walsh. Hey, Deirdre.

DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.

DETROW: Remind us again, what is in this package?

WALSH: So this bill includes $3.8 trillion in tax cuts, 1.5 trillion in spending cuts and roughly 300 billion for defense and border security programs. In terms of the cut, the bulk of those come from changes to the Medicaid program. That's the health care program for low-income, elderly and disabled people. Adults without dependents need to meet new work requirements, and others will have to meet new eligibility roles. An early estimate from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that because of these changes, at least 3.6 million people could lose their health care coverage. The bill also includes cuts to food assistance programs and a $4 trillion increase to the country's borrowing authority. That's to avoid a default on the nation's debt later this summer.

DETROW: Deirdre, for months, we have been talking about the huge divisions in the House Republican Caucus, the fact that they have such a narrow majority. And that really endangered this bill, and yet it passed.

WALSH: Scott, it really came down to one factor, and that's President Donald Trump. As we've seen in previous high stakes votes in the House of Representatives, where there is a very narrow margin - three votes right now - the president is the closer. You know, I talked to one House chairman who told me he expected Speaker Johnson to get the bill 90% of the way, 90 yards down the field, but then he said Trump was going to have to barrel through the final 10 to get it over the finish line, and that's really how it played out.

We saw Trump come to the Hill on Tuesday. Even though there were these divisions between moderates and conservatives, he didn't really get into the details, but he made it clear they needed to get in line. When things started to blow up the next day, folks went to the White House, and they did get in the line. In the end, only two Republicans voted no. One voted present.

DETROW: Were there any major changes to the bill as all of this played out?

WALSH: No, I mean, really minor changes, but it really came down to a political calculation for House Republicans. They do not want to get sideways with Trump or the Republican base. They could risk a primary challenge, a mean tweet, threatening to take them out in their next campaign.

DETROW: Let's go from mean tweets to policy.

(LAUGHTER)

DETROW: The substance of this bill - what does it say about where the Republican Party is today?

WALSH: I mean, it is clear that it is Trump's party. He campaigned on renewing his 2017 tax cuts that will expire at the end of this year. Back then, in 2017, he was working with people like House Speaker Paul Ryan, who was pushing really hard to have major changes, structural changes, to mandatory spending programs like Medicaid, Medicare.

Trump took those kinds of things off the table this time around. He really focused on sort of smaller items that he targeted to political constituency. He campaigned on removing taxes on tips and overtime to get at working-class voters in places like Las Vegas, and that really helped his party get a lot of new supporters this time around. Those items are in the bill, no tax and overtime, but they expire at the end of Trump's term. The rest of the spending cuts are permanent.

And I will just say, as a whole, the Republican Party over years has been focused on reducing the deficit. Not so much in the House Republican package - we do talk a lot about these spending cuts, but in the grand scheme, this bill adds trillions to the debt.

DETROW: Trillions - so this heads to the Senate. What do we expect there?

WALSH: There are going to be changes, and it's possible, at the end of the day, the sort of one thing that brings the Republican Party together - extending these tax cuts - could be sort of the one thing that ends up sort of being the easier thing to get done along with money for the border. Medicaid cuts could be a problem for some Senate Republicans, and there are other conservatives in the Senate who just dismiss the House Bill as really not serious on slashing spending. Senate Majority Leader John Thune talked this week about this whole fact that the U.S. credit rating was downgraded due to ballooning deficits.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JOHN THUNE: A lot of our colleagues have made it very clear that in order for a bill to get through the House and the Senate and on the president's desk, it has to make a meaningful dent in the out-of-control spending we've seen over the past several years.

WALSH: But again, Scott, I think it's going to end up coming down to President Trump, again, bridging these divides.

DETROW: This is certainly going to be one of the biggest things, if not the biggest thing, that Congress does this term. That means it's going to be a big issue in the midterm. It's curious how the Democrats are responding to all of this.

WALSH: I mean, even before the House vote happened, we saw protests in districts across the country, targeting swing House Republicans focused on the impact of Medicaid cuts. There are a lot of districts where Republicans say their constituents rely on Medicaid. One House Republican, Dan Newhouse from Washington State, told me that 40% of his constituents are currently enrolled in Medicaid. And it's pretty clear Democrats are making this the central 2026 issue. Here's just some of what House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries said right before the vote.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HAKEEM JEFFRIES: This day may very well turn out to be the day that House Republicans lost control of the United States House of Representative.

WALSH: Democrats are really hoping that this is a rerun of the 2018 midterms. Back in 2017, Republicans focused on repealing and replacing Obamacare. There was a lot of backlash. They hope that happens again.

Q: Our ambitious dream is to reach 500 giga watt of renewable capacity.
For instance, a 1,000 mega watt renewable project may not be fully scheduled throughout the day due to incomplete transmission infrastructure.
Of the 33 giga watt, 24 giga watt were solar and 4.3 giga watt were wind, which is a strong outcome.
If India’s peak demand was 250 giga watt last fiscal, and if it grows at 6%, that is 15 giga watt of additional demand annually.","Mohit Bhargava, Senior Advisor at the IECC, University of California, Berkeley, and former CEO of NTPC Green and Sumit Kishore, Executive Director at Axis Capital, assess India’s current position, discuss the evolving energy landscape, and outline the opportunities and risks for both policymakers and investors in the push toward a greener future.

India has set an ambitious target — 500 giga watt (GW) of renewable energy capacity by 2030. But as of the end of 2024, the installed base stands at around 210 GW, prompting concerns about whether the pace of growth is fast enough.

While project announcements continue, a significant chunk of the capacity—some 40 GW — is reportedly stalled due to delays in signing power purchase agreements (PPAs).

“Yes, speed is probably not at the level we expect,” says Mohit Bhargava, Senior Advisor at the IECC, University of California, Berkeley, and former CEO of NTPC Green. “Transmission remains one of the biggest challenges today... If you check the CTU website, you will find a long queue for grid connections, and the earliest availability is now around 2029.”

Despite these hurdles, Sumit Kishore, Executive Director at Axis Capital, points out that FY25 saw the highest-ever annual capacity addition of 33 GW, led by solar. “Over the next two, three years, what is very important is that power demand growth, if it revives itself, you would basically find everything else falling in place,” he said.

In this wide-ranging conversation, Bhargava and Kishore assess India’s current position, discuss the evolving energy landscape, and outline the opportunities and risks for both policymakers and investors in the push toward a greener future.

This is the edited excerpt of the interview.

Q: Our ambitious dream is to reach 500 giga watt of renewable capacity. At last count, some notes I read suggested that by the end of 2024, we were roughly at about 209–210 giga watt. Some argue the pace is slow. What are the major challenges? I read somewhere that around 40 giga watt of capacity has stalled because power purchase agreement (PPAs), are not being signed quickly enough. What is your assessment of our progress toward this 500-giga watt target, and what are the main hurdles?

Bhargava: Yes, speed is probably not at the level we expect to achieve our overall objective of 500 giga watt by 2030. There are multiple challenges, and these have been discussed at various levels. A few of them include land acquisition, transmission evacuation, and execution challenges in getting PPAs off the ground, as you mentioned.

In fact, there has been a lot of focus on the support being provided. One report suggests the government is again pushing the coal-based power agenda. So the question arises — has the government taken its foot off the pedal for renewables? I don't believe so, but the challenges remain.

Q: Is there a threat that we will miss the 500-gigawatt target by 2030? I don’t sense a strong urgency in your response. Are we moving at an acceptable pace?

Bhargava: I would say we are moving at a reasonable pace, but there is always room for improvement. 500 giga watts is an excellent ambition, and I am quite hopeful we will end up pretty close.

However, transmission remains one of the biggest challenges today. The pace at which the evacuation system is being developed is not aligned with renewable energy producers’ expectations. If you check the CTU website, you will find a long queue for grid connections, and the earliest availability is now around 2029.

Even for operational capacity, there are challenges in pumping the full amount of power. For instance, a 1,000 mega watt renewable project may not be fully scheduled throughout the day due to incomplete transmission infrastructure. We need to move quickly on transmission.

Q: There are questions about whether the government has taken its foot off the pedal, but you don’t think so. Sumit, your thoughts on what Mr Bhargava said?

Kishore: Despite on-ground challenges, India added almost 33 giga watt of capacity in FY25 — an increase of nearly 28% year-on-year. That is the highest capacity addition in a single fiscal. The previous peak was 30 giga watt in FY16 during the thermal boom. Of the 33 giga watt, 24 giga watt were solar and 4.3 giga watt were wind, which is a strong outcome.

Last fiscal, peak demand grew just 2.7%, which was weak. Post-COVID, India saw just 4.2% power demand growth — the weakest in years. This weak demand, along with falling battery and solar module prices, gave discoms time to finalise procurement. As a result, there is now over 40 giga watt of renewable LOAs pending PPA signing.

This fiscal again, so far, April, power demand was just 2.2%, May power demand is down 2% year-on-year so far and peak demand is at 231 giga watt in May, so far. At the end of May last year, it was 250 giga watt. So you are in a summer season where peak demand is down on a year-on-year basis. The execution challenges have been evergreen. They will remain. But over the next two, three years, what is very important is that power demand growth, if it revives itself, you would basically think find everything else falling in place.

In FY26, the biggest risk is the addition of over 8 giga watt of coal capacity, even with a six-month delay versus the CEA target. If this coincides with weak demand and strong RE addition, discoms may delay PPA signings further.

Q: Now, from the listed universe's perspective—how does this environment affect companies like Waaree Technologies and Premier Energies? There is strong short-term demand, but what about two years down the line, with so much capacity coming up?

Kishore: India’s power demand is a secular growth story. Over the last 15 years, demand grew at a CAGR of 5%, and it could accelerate over the next five years due to new drivers like data centres, EV charging, and green hydrogen.

If India’s peak demand was 250 giga watt last fiscal, and if it grows at 6%, that is 15 giga watt of additional demand annually. To meet this with lower PLF renewables and some thermal, we would need about 37.5 giga watt of new capacity annually. Therefore, there is a long runway. We should not be overly skeptical.

Q: Sumit, if someone wants to play the renewable theme from a portfolio perspective — not just short-term — what is your advice? Should they look at integrated players like Tata Power, or exchanges, or something else?

Kishore: Across the board, power sector capex has risen meaningfully, driven by green growth. Companies with visibility on PPA signings and EBITDA compounding in the next 2–3 years stand out — like JSW Energy, which has seen organic and inorganic growth, and Tata Power, with an integrated model spanning IPP capacity, solar equipment manufacturing, and EPC.

Privatisation of discoms, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, is a major catalyst—for companies like Tata Power, Torrent Power, and CESC.

Even power exchanges are benefiting, with coal availability and flat international prices. While evening prices spike, average exchange rates are down 15–20% year-on-year, attracting discoms and C&I customers.

Exchange volumes rose despite weak demand, and this trend is likely to continue. Short-term power supply penetration in India has grown from 3–4% to over 9%, and could reach 15–20% in the next few years, following trends in Europe.

Q: Sumit, you said not to be too skeptical—but in stock markets, skepticism is the default! I get your broader point. My concern was about Waaree and Premier — solar module makers. Are we heading for overcapacity?

Kishore: That is a separate point. Yes, India already has excess solar module assembly capacity — over 70 giga watt annually. We are likely to achieve self-reliance in solar cells soon, and backward integration into wafers is gaining ground.

Players who diversify their clean energy offerings will maintain better margins and profitability, even as industry-wide RoCE normalises due to oversupply of the module manufacturing value chain.

India must also find new export markets like the Middle East. Given US-China tensions, local manufacturing in the US could help. India stands to gain from this shift.

Q: One quick final word to Mr Bhargava — on labour availability. Is that a constraint for the sector?

Bhargava: It is always a challenge. The renewable sector is labour-intensive, especially during the execution phase. Also, I would like to add to Sumit’s point—he missed NTPC Green, my former company, which is also doing well.

The renewables story is strong. On peak power demand — you mentioned evening spikes — that is where RE + storage tenders become crucial. Storage projects can be set up within 12 months, unlike coal plants which take five to six years.

So yes, the government is acting, but we need faster action, especially state-level clearances and PPAs, to bring these projects online. On labour, with construction activity booming, manpower availability remains a concern.

Governors from 11 Democrat-led states said on May 23 that they’re launching an “affordable clean cars” coalition to promote non-fossil-fuel-powered vehicles after Congress voted to block California from setting stricter car emission standards than federal rules.

“The Affordable Clean Cars Coalition—led by the U.S. Climate Alliance—will sustain America’s transition to cleaner and more affordable cars, support U.S. automotive manufacturers and workers, and preserve states’ clean air authority,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office said in a Friday announcement.

The climate alliance said in a statement of its own that the coalition states will work together to defend their regulatory authority under the Clean Air Act, expand access to low-emission vehicles, push for tougher rules to further reduce vehicle emissions, and advocate for low-carbon fuels.

Governors from California, Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington—all states that have adopted California-style low-emission vehicle rules or similar programs—are part of the coalition.

“We will continue collaborating as states and leveraging our longstanding authority under the Clean Air Act, including through state programs that keep communities safe from pollution, create good-paying jobs, increase consumer choice, and help Americans access cleaner and more affordable cars,” the 11 governors said in a joint statement, after Congress on May 22 voted to rescind California’s latest federal waiver allowing it to set tougher emissions standards than national rules.

California has long received federal waivers allowing it to set tougher standards under the Clean Air Act, influencing national vehicle design due to its large market. Republicans have long said that the rules are too costly and burdensome for automakers.

Advocating for greater consumer choice and fewer regulatory burdens on businesses, Republicans proposed a resolution that would deny California the federal waiver and also eliminate tax credits for electric vehicles enacted under the Biden administration.

The Senate passed the measure on May 22 in a 51–44 vote, following House approval last month. The resolution is now expected to be signed into law by President Donald Trump.

Rep. John Joyce (R-Pa.), the resolution’s sponsor, said that the initiative will protect consumer choice by ensuring all Americans can access vehicles that suit their needs, preferences, and budgets.

“American consumers, not out-of-touch politicians, should decide what vehicle best fits their individual needs,” Joyce said in a May 1 statement, when the resolution cleared the House. “Since I arrived in Washington, I have led this fight to protect consumer freedom and save the American auto industry from dangerous environmental regulations.”

At the time, Joyce urged his Senate colleagues to support the measure “to save our auto industry and protect the freedom of the open road.”

The resolution drew controversy because it aimed to overturn a waiver—rather than a regulation—which the Government Accountability Office said isn’t something Congress can repeal using the fast-track process under the Congressional Review Act. Democrats accused Republicans of misusing the Act, noting that the Senate’s own rules expert had advised that the waiver didn’t qualify for this type of vote.

Newsom said California would sue if the repeal were enforced.

“Republicans went around their own parliamentarian to defy decades of precedent,” Newsom said in a statement. “We won’t stand by as Trump Republicans make America smoggy again.”",https://i.ntd.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/id1066112-1.downloadKO.jpg.webp,N,,2025-05-24 23:00:47.840227

But in Maryland, state regulators are mounting an unprecedented challenge that could slash that hike in half.

The Maryland Public Service Commission and more than 80 legislators have joined in a complaint alleging that the setting of energy prices by grid operator PJM is flawed and artificially inflated by arcane auction rules.

At the heart of the dispute is PJM Interconnection, the regional power grid operator that manages electricity distribution for 65 million people across 13 states, including Maryland.

Every few years, PJM runs a capacity auction—an elaborate process where power plant operators bid to guarantee they’ll be ready to supply electricity when demand peaks. This year, the auction delivered an astonishing result: wholesale capacity prices jumped more than 800%, the steepest hike in PJM’s history.

But Maryland’s Office of the People’s Counsel (OPC) and the Public Service Commission (PSC) say the results weren’t just shocking—they were fundamentally flawed.

According to a formal complaint filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the OPC accuses PJM of artificially inflating the auction price by excluding two large Maryland power plants—Brandon Shores and Wagner—from the supply pool. Although those plants were slated for retirement, PJM reversed course and ordered them to stay open under “Reliability Must-Run” (RMR) agreements, citing the need for grid stability.

However, PJM did not include those plants’ output—more than 2,000 megawatts—in the auction. That omission, regulators argue, distorted the perceived balance between supply and demand and created the illusion of a shortage.

“If they would have been included in the capacity market… it would have decreased the clearing price of the auction by four to five billion dollars,” said Maryland People’s Counsel David S. Lapp. “That four to five billion is a difference between a customer paying $15 or $16 a month, versus $5 or $6 a month. So that adds up.""

PJM, in a written statement, defends its actions, calling the auction results “just and reasonable” and arguing that the process followed existing rules. PJM also pointed to surging electricity demand—driven in part by the explosion of data centers—as a key driver of higher prices.

""Higher prices are being driven by decreasing electricity supply due primarily to historic state and federal policy, and in increase in demand due primarily to the proliferation of data centers, electrification and the onshoring of U.S. manufacturing,"" PJM said in its statement. ""The regional market is sending a price signal that should incentivize investment in generation resources.""

PJM says Maryland needs additional energy infrastructure, according to PJM.

The state has seen the retirement of 6,000 MW of generation resources since 2018, with only 1,600 MW added during that time frame.

Even so, Maryland’s challenge is gaining traction. More than 80 state lawmakers have signed onto the complaint, joining the PSC and OPC in urging FERC to intervene and reset the auction outcome.

Exelon, the company that owns Pepco, BGE, and other regional utilities, says it aims to keep customers informed about why energy bills are going up. In a statement sent to WUSA, an Exelon spokesperson said:

“Exelon and its Maryland utilities – BGE, Delmarva Power and Pepco – welcome all constructive discussion on how to support Marylanders facing rising energy costs driven by insufficient electricity generation and growing energy demand. We continue to work with elected and regulatory officials, PJM Interconnection, generators, and customers to be part of a path forward that supports the area’s growing energy needs and manages bill impacts, while continuing to provide safe, reliable and resilient energy to our customers. We also continue to do extensive outreach through direct customer engagement and community events to keep our customers informed about why energy costs are going up, what they can do to manage their energy use, and how they can access energy assistance resources.”",https://media.wusa9.com/assets/WUSA/images/9c915c5a-57b6-4c40-809a-ab6cf52715e9/20250524T033337/9c915c5a-57b6-4c40-809a-ab6cf52715e9_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 23:00:52.365136

Scientists at Japan's Atomic Energy Agency have developed a first-of-its-kind rechargeable flow battery that uses depleted uranium as its active material, according to a recent article in IEEE Spectrum. JAEA's prototype demonstrates a promising ability to provide stable energy output, especially when paired with solar or wind.

This innovation could be a game-changer for energy grids, cities, and communities that are looking for affordable, low-waste solutions to power homes and businesses while reducing harmful pollution. The battery gives a second life to nuclear waste — of which there are more than 826,000 tons stored in the U.S. — and may also offer a safer, more stable long-term energy storage solution to boot.

JAEA's design is a type of flow battery, which stores electricity in two tanks of liquid electrolyte solution. The uranium-based version uses a uranium solution as the negative electrode and an iron solution as the positive electrode. With a voltage of 1.3 volts per cell, the prototype successfully lit up an LED through ten charge cycles, a sign of stability that researchers say lays the foundation for scaling up.

This battery transforms radioactive waste into a functional energy tool, reducing reliance on more expensive and resource-intensive materials, supporting clean energy growth, and cutting the pollution that contributes to health issues like asthma and heart disease.

The next version of the battery is being designed to hold 30,000 kilowatt-hours — enough to power 3,000 homes for a day in Japan — and would use 716 tons of depleted uranium. If successful, it could help nations with nuclear power plants reduce storage costs for nuclear byproducts and enhance grid reliability.

Companies like Form Energy and Ambient Photonics are also working to reinvent how we store power from renewables. For homeowners looking to cut energy bills and avoid outages, solar panels combined with backup batteries can offer big savings. Pairing panels with solar charging is cheaper than relying on the grid, and EnergySage can help you compare vetted installers and save up to $10,000.

The moves include a substantial overhaul of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, including examining staffing levels and directing the Energy and Defense departments to work together to build nuclear plants on federal lands.
The orders also seek to reinvigorate uranium production and enrichment in the United States.
The CEO of US nuclear power operator Constellation Energy, Joseph Dominguez, said the president’s actions would help normalize the regulatory process.
Republicans, who are less concerned about global warming, support it because they say nuclear power plants could strengthen US energy security.","WASHINGTON: United States President Donald Trump on Friday ordered the nation’s independent nuclear regulatory commission to reduce regulations and fast-track new licenses for reactors and power plants, seeking to shorten a multi-year process to 18 months.

The requirement was part of a batch of executive orders signed by Trump on Friday that aim to boost United States nuclear energy production amid a boom in demand from data centres and artificial intelligence.

Licensing for reactors in the US can take over a decade at times, a process designed to prioritize nuclear safety but which has discouraged new projects.

“This is going to turn the clock back on over 50 years of overregulation of an industry,” United States Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who heads the White House Energy Dominance Council, said in the Oval Office.

The moves include a substantial overhaul of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, including examining staffing levels and directing the Energy and Defense departments to work together to build nuclear plants on federal lands.

The administration envisions the Department of Defence taking a prominent role in ordering reactors and installing them on military bases, a senior White House official said.

The orders also seek to reinvigorate uranium production and enrichment in the United States.

The CEO of US nuclear power operator Constellation Energy, Joseph Dominguez, said the president’s actions would help normalize the regulatory process.

“We’re wasting too much time on permitting, and we’re answering silly questions, not the important ones,” Dominguez said during the signing event.

The US and other nations have ramped up nuclear power regulation in recent decades, partly in response to reactor incidents like the meltdown at the Chernobyl plant in the former Soviet Union in 1986, and the partial meltdown at the Three Mile Island plant in the United States in 1979.

Developers are also now looking to deploy advanced nuclear technology like small modular reactors (SMRs) that could potentially be built quickly and at less cost than traditional plants, but which may pose new safety challenges.

“Reorganizing and reducing the independence of the NRC could lead to the hasty deployment of advanced reactors with safety and security flaws,” said Ernest Moniz, former US Energy Secretary and a nuclear physicist supportive of the industry.

“A major event would, like those in the past, increase regulatory requirements and set back nuclear energy for a long time,” he said.

Trump had declared a national energy emergency in January as one of his first acts in office, saying the US had inadequate supplies of electricity to meet the country’s growing needs, particularly for data centers that run artificial intelligence systems.

Most of Trump’s actions have focused on boosting fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas, but administration officials also support nuclear power, which in recent years has attracted growing bipartisan support.

Some Democrats endorse nuclear because the plants do not emit planet-warming greenhouse gases, even as environmentalists have raised concerns about radioactive waste and reactor safety.

Republicans, who are less concerned about global warming, support it because they say nuclear power plants could strengthen US energy security.

Cost and competition, however, have been a major impediment to new nuclear projects, and it is unclear whether Trump’s orders will be enough to overcome them.

NuScale SMR.N, the only U.S. company with an SMR design approved by regulators, axed its project in 2023 on rising costs and competition from plants that burn plentiful natural gas.

Vogtle, the last US reactor to come online, meanwhile, was about $16 billion over budget and delayed by years.

The Loan Programs Office, which the administration wants to use to finance reactor projects that banks are not willing to support, has been hit hard by Trump’s job layoffs.",https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/trump-sign.gif,N,,2025-05-25 03:02:15.574799

The announcement was made during the Rising Northeast Investors Summit 2025, organized by the Ministry of Development of Northeastern Region, with top political and business leaders in attendance.

This marks one of the largest private sector investments in the region, spanning sectors such as oil and gas, refining, power, renewable energy, data centres, and critical mineral exploration. The move signals a strategic pivot by the group to tap into the region's rich natural reserves and rising economic momentum.

""Today, the states of the north-east are growing in double digits. The opportunities are growing even faster,"" said Vedanta chairman, Anil Agarwal. ""Vedanta is fully committed to investment in the region which has the most amazing natural resources potential, from oil and gas to critical minerals and an exceptional pool of talented human resources.""

Of the total outlay, INR 50,000 crore had already been earmarked earlier this year for Assam. The latest commitment adds INR 30,000 crore for five other states—Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Tripura, Meghalaya and Mizoram. Assam, which holds nearly 27 per cent of India's crude oil reserves, has already seen production success through Vedanta's subsidiary, Cairn Oil & Gas, at the Hazarigaon field—the first Discovered Small Field (DSF) to become operational in the Northeast.

Cairn sees the region as a critical asset in its onshore portfolio. ""North-east is also a big opportunity for us where we have identified a lot of blocks,"" said Nick Vaid, a senior executive at Cairn. ""We are producing from a small area in Hazarigaon, but we think that in our onshore portfolio this is the place where the biggest value creation could happen.""

In mineral resources, Vedanta has secured graphite and vanadium blocks in Arunachal Pradesh, which hosts India's largest graphite reserves and substantial vanadium and rare earth element deposits. The company emphasized that, ""Once explored, these critical mineral blocks will provide vital raw materials to India's hi-tech manufacturing and clean energy sectors.""

Additionally, the company has commissioned a 300 circuit kilometre transmission system, enabling 1,000 MW of power transfer between Assam and Meghalaya—a significant boost to regional grid reliability and industrial growth.

The bill extends the 2017 Trump tax cuts, preventing a $4.5 trillion tax increase if they had expired over the next year.
Workers received the promised “no tax on tips or overtime,” and interest on loans for American-made cars.","The budget passed by the U.S. House of Representatives last week was a test for how forceful the GOP could be in delivering real reform to trim the deficit and substantially decrease spending — both threats to the nation’s future solvency.

Americans voted for President Donald Trump and a GOP-led Congress to right the nation’s books. This “One Big, Beautiful Bill” is the defining chance to do that.

What passed was disappointing on both fronts.

The political reality of Republicans’ razor-thin majority in the House is that compromises were going to have to be made in the passage of any bill.

But the chamber passed legislation that is expected to add roughly $3.1 trillion to the ballooning debt over the next decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

Spending cuts related primarily to Medicaid, food stamps and clean energy and some revenue increases in other areas amount to roughly $1.6 trillion in savings over 10 years. But with $4.6 trillion being added through tax cuts and spending increases in defense, the judiciary and immigration enforcement, more spending cuts were needed.

Last week, Moody’s Investors downgraded the United States’ credit rating from AAA to Aa1 — which puts America below Germany, Switzerland and Canada. Fitch and S&P Global had previously done so, but Moody’s had held out.

Moody’s decision was due to “the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,” it said in a statement.

That means borrowing costs will go up, increasingly weighing on the entire national economy.

The current $37 trillion national debt amounts to roughly $323,000 per taxpayer and nearly 123% of U.S. GDP.

The bill extends the 2017 Trump tax cuts, preventing a $4.5 trillion tax increase if they had expired over the next year. Workers received the promised “no tax on tips or overtime,” and interest on loans for American-made cars. The bill also includes welfare and Medicaid reforms that preserve the notion that able-bodied American adults should work by moving up the work requirement to 2026.

But it’s hard to celebrate tax relief with the debt and deficit crisis looming.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/21/PDTN/83765690007-ap-25140499339186.jpg?crop=7516,4228,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-24 22:02:28.634317

So, what brings Ola Electric back to the fundraising table so soon after its massive IPO raise?
The project remains exposed to “risks of timely execution of subsequent expansion phases, demand/offtake, supply chain and technology obsolescence.” This is a potential risk for Ola Electric.
This is undoubtedly one of the biggest challenges for Ola Electric, given its emphasis on owning the full stack for EVs.
Ola Electric had cited “temporary” backlog in registrations due to the termination of contracts with registration agencies as the reason for the mismatch.","In August 2024, Ola Electric listed on the stock markets to much fanfare, and raised more than INR 5,500 Cr to invest towards future growth and building out its full electric vehicle stack. A few days after that, Bhavish Aggarwal outlined Ola Electric’s grand plans, peppered with some suspect claims — this is important as we will see later.

But not even a year after that IPO, Ola Electric is now considering raising fresh funds, as it looks to get back on track after months of slow growth, mounting regulatory scrutiny over sales claims and a major dip in the stock price. The Bhavish Aggarwal-led company has also lost its top spot in the EV market.

According to data from the government-run Vahan portal, Ola Electric slipped from leadership position in the electric two-wheeler segment in April 2025 to TVS Motor. The Bengaluru-based company registered 19,709 vehicles last month, down 42% year-on-year with 21.46% market share.

Ola Electric’s Second Raise In 10 Months

In this current situation, Ola Electric’s board has approved the plans to raise INR 1,700 Cr in one or multiple tranches through non-convertible debentures (NCDs) and other eligible debt securities. However, it did not disclose other specific details, including the intended use of proceeds.

So, what brings Ola Electric back to the fundraising table so soon after its massive IPO raise?

The answer to this is not clear. But what we can say is that Ola Electric has not even utilised the full proceeds from its IPO as of March 2025, according to ratings agency ICRA.

For one, more than half of the INR 5,500 Cr raised in the IPO has been left in fixed deposits and bank accounts, earning nearly INR 54 Cr in interest income for the company in 10 months.

Of the quantum raised, INR 1,200 Cr was specifically to be used for expanding the capacity of Ola Electric’s battery cell manufacturing plant from the initial test capacity of 1.4GWh to 5GWh by February 2025. The company claimed it would further increase capacity to 6.4GWh by April 2025.

ICRA claims that the commencement of commercial production is delayed. The project remains exposed to “risks of timely execution of subsequent expansion phases, demand/offtake, supply chain and technology obsolescence.”

This is a potential risk for Ola Electric. Under the production linked incentive scheme for cell manufacturing, the company is bound to increase operational capacity to 20GWh by the end of 2026. Failing this, it could lose out on its share of the INR 18,000 Cr PLI scheme.

Incidentally, Bhavish Aggarwal’s tall claims last August, soon after the IPO, included the ambition of building the world’s largest 100 GWh Gigafactory in India. Thus far, the company has struggled to come close to even 5% of this number. This is undoubtedly one of the biggest challenges for Ola Electric, given its emphasis on owning the full stack for EVs.

Ramping up the cell and battery manufacturing is key for Ola Electric, as the company’s plans to increase its profit per unit sold hinges on its in-house cells and batteries.

Taking all of this into account, ICRA has downgraded Ola Electric’s credit rating to BBB+ (NEGATIVE) from A (NEGATIVE) for short-term loans and bank guarantees, which does increase the risk for investors even for NCDs.

Ola’s Bikes Hit The Road

Incidentally, the timing of the fundraise coincides with Ola Electric’s first deliveries of its Roadster motorcycles. The model had already featured in its February sales data, even though the deliveries have been delayed for two months.

In relation to its sales and distribution model, Ola Electric has been mired in a slew of controversies for allegedly operating more than 90% of its outlets without necessary trade certificates and discrepancies in its February 2025 sales figures.

The confusion emerged from the fact that Ola claimed that it sold over 25,000 electric two wheelers in February 2025, however the government’s VAHAN portal showed only about 8,600 registrations for the same period. Ola Electric had cited “temporary” backlog in registrations due to the termination of contracts with registration agencies as the reason for the mismatch.

Since March 2025, it has moved to an in-house registration model, and has shut all its regional warehouses across India. The EV maker now plans to leverage its 4,000 retail stores across the country to maintain vehicle inventory, spare parts, accessories, and last-mile deliveries.

Ola Electric expects its EBITDA margin to get a 10 percentage point boost, and roughly INR 30 Cr in monthly savings from this “redesigned” distribution network. It’s very likely that the company will have to rethink its distribution model going forward as it moves into new vehicle categories.

Incidentally, even as Ola Electric has lost some sales momentum in recent months, and as we wait for its Q4 numbers next week, its closest rival Ather Energy reported a 17% year-on-year drop in Q4 FY25 loss last week. Revenue grew by nearly 30% YoY to INR 676.1 Cr, driven by higher sales volumes and improved margins.

The EV market is also maturing with the emergence of newer players like River, Oben Electric and others, which are quickly gaining traction as well.

A second major fundraise so close to the IPO does raise questions about whether Ola Electric had accounted for the post-listing hiccups in its planning and roadmap. For Ola Electric, the next nine months will be highly critical as the company looks to meet its FY27 breakeven target, which is looking increasingly over-optimistic as of now.

Honasa Shines Brightest

Mamaearth parent Honasa’s shares further soared by more than 25% this week to end at INR 330.20 on Friday, a day after the company reported a small bump in revenue (13.3%) to INR 533.6 Cr in Q4 FY25. However, Honasa’s bottomline suffered and profit declined by 18% to INR 25 Cr.

Incidentally, Honasa has been on a rally since the start of this year. The stock has gained 8% in value after losing over a third of its value in the past 52-week period. In large part, the investor faith has come as a result of Honasa’s long-term strategic bet to revamp its offline distribution model, which has been in the works since last year.

In FY25, the company had 1.2 Lakh unique outlets where its products were sold, compared to just 45,000 in Q1 FY25. More than anything, Honasa’s back-to-back quarters of profits after a drop into the red previously has enthused investors.

As more automakers flood the market with new models, competition is heating up – and Cadillac wants in. GM’s luxury brand is making a serious push to grow its EV presence, and a part of its strategy includes luring customers away from other automakers.

According to one General Motors executive speaking to CNBC, around 80 percent of new Cadillac EV buyers are coming from outside the brand. A closer look at the data shows that roughly one in 10 of those newcomers is switching over from Tesla.

Review: Is Cadillac’s New Vistiq The Baby Escalade You’ve Been Waiting For?

The Lyriq, Cadillac’s main weapon in its EV quiver, is a huge part of this conquest. It boasts a starting price of under $60,000 and is eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit, at least for now. It features a huge 33-inch curved OLED display, lots of luxury, and decent range too. Unsurprisingly, about 25 percent of Tesla owners trading in for a Cadillac are choosing the Lyriq.

“We see the opportunity to increase the conquest rate for Tesla, absolutely,” Brad Franz, Cadillac director of global marketing, told CNBC. The portfolio is the key,” he continued. “We’ve always had good interaction with Tesla customers, but in the past, that’s been in that 10% to 15% range [for Lyriq]. So, certainly, we’re seeing a good jump in conquest rate.”

Are Some Tesla Owners Just Done With Tesla?

Interestingly, at least one analyst believes that this is less about how perfect the Lyriq is for Tesla owners and more about getting out of the Tesla ecosystem altogether. “People leaving Tesla cars now, they’re, in my opinion, making a very deliberate choice to get out of that car. If your priority is to get out of the Tesla ASAP, then they’re not, technically, cross-shopping Tesla for their next car,” said Joseph Yoon, Edmunds’ consumer insights analyst.

That trend might not slow down anytime soon either. Tesla is facing a myriad of concerns at a brand level. At the same time, Cadillac is offering a stronger EV portfolio than ever before. “Cadillac is leading the way with our EV lineup,” Franz said. “We’re really poised for success. We’re going to take this portfolio, now that Vistiq is rounding out the SUV portfolio, and become the No. 1, tier-one EV luxury brand.”

What Buyers Are Actually Comparing

Data from Edmunds shows that Lyriq shoppers are also eyeing models like Cadillac’s own Optiq, the Acura ZDX, Ford Mustang Mach-E, and BMW iX. Just behind those are the Kia EV9 and GM’s own Chevy Blazer and Equinox EVs. Tesla buyers, on the other hand, tend to stay loyal, often looking at other Teslas when they’re ready for something new. Depending on the model, they may also consider options from Honda, Hyundai, Kia, or occasionally, the Equinox EV or Hummer EV.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tesla-Cadillac-Carscoops-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 22:02:32.598938

During cross-examination of Grubb and other Georgia Power executives at the March hearing, energy lawyer Bobby Baker said the utility’s demand forecast has increased 27-fold since 2022.
“Doesn’t that raise some red flags for y’all, an enormous jump?” Baker asked the Georgia Power witness panel.
“Hasn’t the company consistently overestimated load growth?” Baker said the costs of overbuilding generating capacity would fall squarely on Georgia Power customers.
But Fernando Valle, director of forecasting and analytics for Georgia Power, defended the utility’s forecasting track record.","ATLANTA — Starting May 27, Georgia Power executives will defend the mix of energy resources the utility intends to rely on for generating electricity against critics who say the plan relies too much on fossil fuels and not enough on renewable power.

The state Public Service Commission (PSC) will hold a second round of hearings expected to last several days on Georgia Power’s 2025 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). The first round of hearings over three days in late March gave company witnesses a chance to outline how they propose to meet a massive increase in demand prompted by the growth of power-hungry data centers across the state.

The new IRP calls for Georgia Power to continue operating coal-burning plants at Plant Bowen near Cartersville and Plant Scherer near Macon, providing about 4,000 megawatts of electricity. A megawatt is enough electricity to power about 750 homes. The Atlanta-based utility also plans to upgrade existing natural gas units.

On the renewable side, the IRP proposes to add 4,000 megawatts of generating capacity from a combination of utility-scale and rooftop solar projects as well as battery storage.

But consumer watchdog and environmental advocacy groups argue Georgia Power could and should add more renewable energy to the utility’s portfolio beyond the 4,000 megawatts and do away with its aging fleet of carbon-emitting coal and gas plants.

“By arbitrarily capping solar development in its Integrated Resource Plan, Georgia Power has sidelined one of the most cost-effective resources available in favor of expensive fossil gas infrastructure,” said Patrick King II, Georgia policy advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council. “This approach ignores more sensible pathways that would cut emissions, lower financial risk, and save bill payers money.”

But Georgia Power executives say the soaring demand for electricity to serve “large-load” customers including data centers makes retaining the coal and gas plants critical. The 2025 IRP estimates the utility will need an additional 8,200 megawatts of electrical generating capacity during the next six years, an increase of more than 2,200 megawatts above projections in an updated IRP the commission approved a year ago.

“We need these units,” Jeff Grubb, Georgia Power’s director of resource planning, testified during the hearings in March. “They’re an economical way to serve the load growth that we have.”

Grubb warned that if the company doesn’t keep those plants operating, it would need to build more expensive new generating capacity by 2032.

A key disagreement between Georgia Power and the IRP’s critics is over whether the utility really needs that much additional generating capacity.

During cross-examination of Grubb and other Georgia Power executives at the March hearing, energy lawyer Bobby Baker said the utility’s demand forecast has increased 27-fold since 2022.

“Doesn’t that raise some red flags for y’all, an enormous jump?” Baker asked the Georgia Power witness panel. “Hasn’t the company consistently overestimated load growth?”

Baker said the costs of overbuilding generating capacity would fall squarely on Georgia Power customers.

But Fernando Valle, director of forecasting and analytics for Georgia Power, defended the utility’s forecasting track record.

“The load forecast has always incorporated the best available information we have at the time of the forecast,” he said. “Predicting the future is inherently uncertain.”

Grubb said Georgia Power customers also would be on the hook if the company underestimates how much generating capacity will be needed.

“Under-forecasting is a bigger risk than over,” he said. “We don’t want to be short.”

If finalized, this rule would end EPA regulation of greenhouse gases from power plants, and put on ice greenhouse gas regulation of other stationary sources under the Clean Air Act.
Rather, the EPA is saying that fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United States to not contribute ""significantly"" to global greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.
So, it argued, even if American power plants erased all their greenhouse gases from the power sector, the risk to public health would not be ""meaningfully"" improved.
And, as U.S. emissions decline as a share of global emissions, the significance of domestic power plants will decline over time.","A draft of the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed regulation to undo the Biden Administration's regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants is undergoing White House review. If finalized, this rule would end EPA regulation of greenhouse gases from power plants, and put on ice greenhouse gas regulation of other stationary sources under the Clean Air Act.

The EPA is not seeking to undo the Biden power plant rules by challenging the EPA's 2009 endangerment finding. Though urged by some, this would have been foolhardy. Rather, according to this New York Times report, the EPA appears to be taking a more strategic approach along the lines of what I suggested in this post last week.

From the NYT story:

In its proposed regulation, the agency argued that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from power plants that burn fossil fuels ""do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution"" or to climate change because they are a small and declining share of global emissions. Eliminating those emissions would have no meaningful effect on public health and welfare, the agency said.

The key word in the statutory language is ""significantly."" The EPA is not claiming that climate change does not pose a threat, nor is the EPA claiming that greenhouse gases do not contribute to climate change. Rather, the EPA is saying that fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United States to not contribute ""significantly"" to global greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.

In proposing to lift regulations on power plants, the E.P.A. points to the fact that the U.S. share of global power sector emissions represented about 3 percent of worldwide greenhouse gases in 2022, down from 5.5 percent in 2005. So, it argued, even if American power plants erased all their greenhouse gases from the power sector, the risk to public health would not be ""meaningfully"" improved.

As global climate change is a global concern--and is driven by global concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, it does not matter that power plants are a large share of domestic emissions. And, as U.S. emissions decline as a share of global emissions, the significance of domestic power plants will decline over time.

If the EPA goes ahead with this approach, the final rule will certainly be challenged. A key question in such litigation will be whether reviewing courts accept the EPA's definition of what it means for a category of sources to contribute ""significantly"" to a type of air pollution. Absent Chevron deference the EPA's interpretation of the the statutory language will not carry much wait, but courts may be convinced that this is nonetheless a question upon which courts should respect agency expertise and accommodate the EPA Administrator's exercise of discretion. But as noted above (and as I told the Times), if the EPA is successful with such a rule, it will effectively end the regulation of greenhouse gases from stationary sources under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2021/11/the-volokh-conspiracy.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 20:05:53.796440

A marathon session that began Wednesday resulted in 1,100-plus page legislation that curbs billions of dollars in spending across food assistance, student loans, Medicaid and action to address climate change.

The bill, which now heads to the Senate, repeals or phases out more quickly clean energy tax credits passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act during former President Joe Biden's term. Biden’s climate law has been considered monumental for the clean energy transition, but the House bill effectively renders moot much of the law's incentives for renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Clean energy advocates said the bill walks back the largest government investment in clean energy in history.

“In a bid to cut taxes for billionaires and provide a grab bag of goodies to Big Oil, the majority in the House took a sledgehammer to clean energy tax credits and to the protection of our public lands,"" said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“These credits are delivering billions of dollars in new investments in homegrown American energy -- creating jobs, lowering energy costs and addressing the climate crisis that is fueling floods, fires and heat waves,'' Goldfuss said.

President Donald Trump celebrated the bill’s passage, calling it “arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country.” Trump appealed to the Senate to pass the measure as soon as possible and send it to his desk.

The Senate hopes to wrap up its version by early July. At least four Republican senators, led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have urged continuation of energy tax credits, including support for traditional and renewable energy sources. Republican-led states and Congressional districts have benefited from billions of dollars in clean energy manufacturing investments spurred by the Biden-era subsidies.

Full-scale repeal of current credits ""could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,'' the senators said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.

""A wholesale repeal, or the termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing ... job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy,” the senators wrote in the April 9 letter. The letter was also signed by GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas.

In a win for House moderates and some Western lawmakers, the House bill strips language that would have allowed the sale of hundreds of thousands acres of public lands in Utah and Nevada. Opponents argued the sales would have opened the door for more oil and gas drilling.

What was gutted in the bill

The House bill takes an axe to tax credits for rooftop solar installments and eliminates electric vehicle tax credits after 2025, with a one-year exception for EVs manufactured by automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 cars that qualified for the credit.

Credits for solar and electric vehicles, which reduce harmful emissions, help to boost demand for the technologies and drive down their cost.

House Republicans also tightened tax credit restrictions for projects associated with foreign entities, including China — an added blow to domestic clean energy expansion since China dominates much of the supply chain.

The bill slashes a three-year phase-down schedule previously proposed, and instead cuts off projects that don’t start construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage. Those projects would also have to start operating before 2029.

“This bill threatens the clean energy industry at a time when it’s proving to be not only economically beneficial — lowering costs, creating jobs and fueling local economies — but also essential to America’s energy future,"" said Andrew Reagan, president of Clean Energy for America, an industry group.

The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry, applauded the bill as a step to “restore American energy dominance.”

“By preserving competitive tax policies, opening lease sales” for oil and gas drilling and advancing permitting reforms, the legislation “is a win for our nation’s energy future,” API President Mike Sommers said in a statement.

No sale of public lands

At the behest of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke and some other Republicans, lawmakers stripped a provision that would have sold or transferred about 460,000 acres (186,155 hectares) of federal land in Nevada and Utah to local governments or private entities.

The proposal exposed sharp divisions between Western Republicans who say the federal government controls too much of their states and others such as Zinke, a former Interior secretary in Trump’s first term whose state is protective of access to lands for hunting and recreation.

“At the heart of the matter is that public land that’s in the federal estate belongs to everybody,” Zinke told The Associated Press Thursday. “To suggest that you’re going to sell land to pay off the debt, I think that’s misguided and, quite frankly, disingenuous.""

The land sales had been inserted in the bill following a late-night committee vote, despite earlier pledges from Republican leaders that the sales were off the table.

Supporters said they would generate revenue and ease growth pressures by creating room for more and cheaper housing in booming Western cities such as Las Vegas, Reno, Nevada, and St. George, Utah. Those communities are hemmed in by federal property, which makes up 80% of the land in Nevada and 63% in Utah.

A spokesperson for Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, who sponsored the bid to sell federal lands in his state, said his office was “exploring all options” to make the transfers happen.

Housing advocates had cautioned federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing, and some of the parcels to be sold were far from developed areas.

Tracy Stone-Manning, president of the Wilderness Society and a former director of the Bureau of Land Management under Biden, said she appreciated Zinke’s work to prevent the public lands sale.

But she said the bill was still a “big giveaway” to the private sector. “By opening hundreds of millions of acres to drilling, mining and logging to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, this bill harms the tens of millions of people who like to hike, recreate or find solace in the outdoors,” she said.

Trump targets Biden's climate policy

At the same time the bill slashes support for clean energy, it paves the way for oil, gas and coal.

Through the bill, natural gas pipeline developers can pay a $10 million fee for expedited permitting, and applicants for a potential liquefied natural gas export site can pay a $1 million fee to be deemed in the “public interest,” circumventing what is usually a regulatory challenge.

So far, their work shows the potential to cut electricity use up to half at large facilities, including Wenatchee High School in Wenatchee, Wash, Chelan PUD said on May 16.

The Advanced Energy Management Program is a paid internship that provides real-world training in energy efficiency.

The interns – all sophomores at Wenatchee High School – use data from Chelan PUD’s advanced metering system to identify opportunities to reduce energy in the buildings.

The students also conduct on-site visits, scouring unoccupied classrooms, kitchens, attics and hallways searching for equipment that is running unnecessarily, equipment failures, thermostat settings adjustments, and lighting control opportunities.

Over the last six months, the students audited about 10 facilities, including JC Penney, North Central Educational Service District, Town Toyota Center, Confluence Technology Center, Foothills Middle School and several Wenatchee elementary schools.

""The results are a win-win-win. Students receive on-the-job training and a part-time job. Their clients save money on their electricity bills, maintenance and operations. The saved energy increases the PUD’s capacity to sell surplus electricity and help keep rates low in Chelan County,"" the utility said.

The internship is funded by a partnership between Advanced Energy Management, Wenatchee School District and Chelan PUD. Chelan PUD pays 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour saved.

“These students are developing skill sets that could change the trajectory of their lives, whether they choose a career in energy or another field,” Wenatchee High School Advisor Taunya Brown said. “They’re writing proposals, creating spreadsheets and charts, and presenting professional case studies. Their work is impressive.”

At Wenatchee High School, the students suggested turning off the school’s big air handlers, fans and other equipment when the building is unoccupied. The changes reduced energy use by 54%. If the school can sustain those energy savings, it could save the district about $2,282 a week, or over $100,000 a year.

Three major Arizona utilities are exploring new nuclear power plant construction to meet increasing energy demands, and are evaluating the impact of these orders.

While the orders intend to encourage a ""nuclear renaissance,"" experts suggest they may not fully address the financial risks associated with large nuclear projects.

Four new federal executive orders designed to boost nuclear power projects nationally could have impacts in Arizona as three of the state's largest utilities explore building a new power plant to meet rising energy demand.

The orders, signed on May 23 by President Donald Trump, ease regulations on nuclear power projects, which could help speed up the construction of such reactors. They also unlock options for building reactors on federal land, direct the U.S. Department of Energy to prioritize funding for nuclear projects, and aim to mitigate fuel supply chain difficulties by promoting domestic uranium mining and enrichment.

That could help address some challenges facing Arizona Public Service Co., Salt River Project and Tucson Electric Power as they evaluate emerging nuclear technologies and their potential to meet demand statewide. The utilities announced in February that they would look at small, advanced nuclear reactors, as well as large ones.

""We will be reviewing any new information from the Trump administration to see how it might impact our proposed plans to explore adding nuclear generation in Arizona,"" utility officials said in a joint statement. ""As you know, the utilities have been monitoring emerging nuclear technologies and have a shared interest in evaluating their potential to support growing energy needs in the state.""

But a pro-nuclear expert recently told the Arizona Corporation Commission that drafts of the orders indicated they were unlikely to substantially remedy the questions currently surrounding large nuclear projects — even though they were accompanied by a press release from the White House pledging a ""nuclear renaissance.""

That expert, Bob Coward of MPR Associates, said he had not personally seen drafts of the orders — but those who had largely believed that they didn't do enough to limit the expense of such reactors and the financial risks that could emerge during their construction. That means those factors likely remain hurdles that the utilities will need to navigate to build a nuclear energy plant in Arizona.

""Most people who are in the industry who have seen them appreciate the federal government interest in helping to advance nuclear energy,"" said Coward, who has worked on electric generating plants worldwide and formerly served as president of the American Nuclear Society. ""Most believe those executive orders are unlikely to provide the help that they're seeking.""

Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives also recently moved to slash clean energy tax incentives. If passed by the U.S. Senate and signed by Trump, that legislation could deal a serious blow to advanced nuclear development nationwide.

The pros and cons of nuclear

Arizona's energy needs are projected to spike in coming decades amid continued population growth, demand for increased capacity at power-hungry data centers and the rise of U.S.-based advanced manufacturing.

APS and SRP already get electricity from the Palo Verde Generating Station located in Tonopah, about 55 miles west of downtown Phoenix.

That nuclear plant produces more energy than any other in the country — enough to power about 4 million homes and businesses in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas. About 30% of the state's energy needs are met by nuclear generation, most of which happens at Palo Verde.

That's part of why nuclear has quickly emerged as a politically popular energy option. It is almost entirely free of carbon emissions and can provide large-scale, reliable electricity. Other forms of clean energy, such as wind and solar power, are often considered intermittent — although that challenge can be mitigated with battery storage infrastructure.

But building nuclear reactors is a lengthy, expensive and risky process. Any nuclear plant that may be built by APS, SRP and TEP is likely 15 or more years out, and other large nuclear projects have struggled to finish on time, within budget, and without facing serious supply chain conundrums.

The push toward nuclear energy has also been met with opposition by some consumer advocates. Because advanced nuclear projects are so expensive, some worry about the impacts building such reactors could have on ratepayers.

Diane Brown, executive director of the Arizona Public Interest Research Group, urged utility regulators to compare the costs of nuclear to other clean energy options and ""ask detailed questions about how it does or does not stand up.""

""When we go around and talk to individuals and ask them if they would be willing to pay more on their bill for nuclear, the answer is no,"" she said.

Plus, nuclear generation produces radioactive waste that requires specialized disposal. The U.S. does not currently have a permanent repository for such contaminated material.

For decades, some federal officials had eyed Yucca Mountain, Nevada, as an option for such a facility. The site is located in a remote area about 80 miles northwest of Las Vegas. But that proposal quickly turned controversial, and the repository was never built.

""We're talking about waste that's highly radioactive and dangerous for hundreds of thousands of years,"" said Sandy Bahr of the Sierra Club, adding that nuclear plants are ""expensive and generally not good for ratepayers."" ""So, always something to think about.""

Can nuclear be successfully 'de-risked'?

The opportunities and challenges posed by nuclear power were on full display at a recent workshop on the topic hosted by the commission.

Utilities and their state regulators — all of whom are currently Republicans — appeared eager to embrace nuclear energy.

But doing so is easier said than done. Leaders of Georgia Power Co., one of the largest power companies in the country, found that out firsthand when they embarked on a journey to build new reactors at the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant.

The reactors were the first to be built in the U.S. in decades. They were initially projected to cost $14 billion and be completed by 2017. The final bill was well above $30 billion, and construction ended just last year.

Officials with APS, SRP and TEP are eyeing a slightly different approach. They're not aiming to be the first to build — but rather follow other early adopters and learn from their experiences. Brian Cole, vice president of resource management at APS, told regulators that the utilities want to be ""fast followers.""

That is part of a broader planning strategy that the utilities hope will help them avoid pitfalls. Tom Cooper, senior director of future system assets and strategy at SRP, said his focus is on ""de-risking"" — looking at when the nuclear power industry is fully matured and could feasibly provide reliable, affordable and sustainable energy.

""It has a lot of promise,"" he said. ""But in order to turn it into an actionable item for our customers, we have to de-risk it, and that's what we are about.""",https://www.azcentral.com/gcdn/-mm-/b23742284601d98a6caa4920f83f5628c218c8b6/c=0-425-3592-2455/local/-/media/2014/12/09/Phoenix/Phoenix/635537492626806643-palo-verde-power-plant2.jpg?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp,N,,2025-05-24 19:08:22.394215

The World Heritage Centre can treat around 70 seals at a time and has 12 intensive-care units for animals with serious injuries who are able to recover in special enclosures which offer a calm environment.

The new building, which cost over €40 million, with financing provided by local and regional governments as well as charitable organisations, tells more than just the story of the seas.

Landmark ruling should encourage more cities to ban fossil fuel ads

A ban on fossil fuel adverts in The Hague has been upheld by a Dutch court, in an “historic ruling” that campaigners hope will embolden other cities to take action.

In a decision last September, The Hague became the first city in the world to write into law a ban on ads that promote fossil fuels, including petrol cars, air travel and cruise ships.

Scientists say they can now calculate the trillions in climate damage caused by fossil fuel giants

Experts believe the research could help bolster climate laws and make polluters pay for their role in global warming.

It is part of an effort to make it easier for people and governments to hold companies financially accountable, like the tobacco giants have been.

Mazhar Botanic Garden is a natural remedy to Cairo’s notorious air pollution

The garden plays a pivotal role in protecting rare and endangered plant species globally.

Alongside protecting biodiversity, it promotes environmental sustainability by increasing carbon dioxide absorption rates.

Mazhar Botanic Garden surpasses the Orman Garden in its ability to absorb pollutants, removing the equivalent of four times the amount absorbed by Orman from Greater Cairo.

Scientists generate electricity from falling droplets

Rain could one day become a source of clean electricity, according to a group of scientists in Singapore.

Their experiments have been able to generate power from water droplets falling through a tube. They say this could be a model for harnessing larger amounts of electricity from falling rain in the future.

The group collaborated with climate researchers to stage the gig, and it broke the world record for the lowest carbon emissions ever produced by a music event.

Five lions traumatised by war in Ukraine settle in to their 'forever home' at UK sanctuary

Five traumatised lions rescued from the war zone in Ukraine settled into a new home in England after an international effort to bring them to safety.

Male African lion Rori and lionesses Amani, Lira and Vanda arrived in March at the Big Cat Sanctuary after a 12-hour journey by road and ferry from temporary homes at zoos and animal shelters in Belgium.

Renewables stepped up to meet surge in energy demand from rising temperatures in 2024

Record temperatures around the world contributed significantly to the annual 0.8 per cent rise in global CO2 emissions to 37.8 billion tonnes.

But the deployment of solar and wind energy, nuclear, electric cars and heat pumps since 2019 now prevents 2.6 billion tonnes of CO2 each year, according to the IEA. That’s equivalent to 7 per cent of global emissions.

More good news from the report includes how the expanding supply of low-emissions sources covered most of the increase in global electricity demand in 2024.

Scientists were in Antarctica when a giant iceberg broke free. Here’s what they found in its shadow

Giant sea spiders, ice fish and octopuses are among the surprisingly abundant creatures scientists have found in a stretch of sea that used to be covered by ice.

An international team onboard the Schmidt Ocean Institute’s Falkor (too) research vessel were on a trip around Antarctica earlier this year, studying “the interface between ice and sea” when a rare opportunity suddenly opened up.

On 13 January, an iceberg the size of Chicago named A-84 broke away from the George VI Ice Shelf, one of the massive floating glaciers attached to the Antarctic Peninsula ice sheet.

EVs set to save Europe 20 million tonnes of CO2 this year

One in five new cars sold in the EU this year will have zero tailpipe emissions. How did we get here? A surge in the uptake of electric cars will save Europe 20 million tonnes of CO2 this year, according to analysis from campaign group Transport & Environment (T&E).

That’s equivalent to the emissions pumped out by eight coal power plants and represents one positive trend within a notoriously difficult to decarbonise sector.

How a fish doorbell in the Netherlands is helping with migration

‘Fish doorbell season’ officially began on 3 March for the fifth year in a row. This camera shows live footage, allowing viewers to let the lock keeper at the Weerdsluis lock know when fish are waiting to swim upstream so they can open the gate.

Linda Voortman, alderwoman for Utrecht, says each year the fish doorbell is received with enthusiasm by the people of the city and far beyond.

“In fact, last year there were almost three million unique visitors who together helped thousands of fish through the Weerdsluis gates in Utrecht,” Voortman says.

Scientists discover more about how sea otters come to the rescue of undersea forests

It’s well known that sea otters help make kelp forests more abundant, by eating the sea urchins that nibble away at the plant. But scientists were puzzled as to why the impact of otters on kelp – particularly along the coastlines of islands in Southern California and British Columbia – varied by location.

Now, new research has found that sea otters’ level of influence on how quickly kelp forests grow back depends on what other species the mammals interact with.

Czechia's €1m dam built for free by beavers

A family of beavers made global headlines earlier this year when they built a dam exactly where authorities had been planning one in Czechia, saving taxpayers around CZK 30 million (€1.2 million). The project had been held up by bureaucracy but they cut the red tape overnight.

These industrious animals are doing good work across Europe with England approving releases into the wild in February. But how do they know where to build their dams?

In a world that relies on plastic, the time it takes to break down is a major problem. But scientists at the University of Hawaii have found a possible solution - marine fungi.

Researchers at the University of Hawaii (UH) in Mānoa believe it is a “promising and largely untapped” solution to the removal of plastic waste from both on land and in our waters.

‘Humans helping humans’: Tree surgeons are the unsung heroes when storms cut off power

Dubbed the storm of the century, Storm Eowyn produced record-breaking gusts of 184 km/h and made headlines worldwide. At its peak, it left 750,000 homes without electricity. The west of Ireland was hit especially hard.

Tree surgeons came to the rescue, clearing fallen trunks, logs and branches to allow emergency crews who flew in from around Europe to help Ireland’s Electricity Supply Board (ESB) in restoring power.

Activist hopes 48 hours of non-stop tree-hugging will inspire others to love nature

Truphena Muthoni attempted a new world record with a tree-hugging marathon. The 21-year-old hugged a single tree in a public park in downtown Nairobi, Kenya for almost 48 hours.

The Kenyan revealed that she wants to set the record to help others understand the link between nature and good mental health.

Tree-hugging has been a protest activity by environmentalists for almost 300 years, and there are now even world championships in the pastime.

India doubles tiger population in a decade due to conservation efforts

India doubled its tiger population in a little over a decade, a study found in early February. It has done so by protecting the big cats from poaching and habitat loss, ensuring they have enough prey, reducing human-wildlife conflict, and increasing living standards for communities near tiger areas.

In the early 2000s, experts were warning that tigers could soon go extinct. But over the last 25 years, India's national animal has seen a remarkable recovery.

Tucked beyond the Arctic Circle, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault sits proudly in a former coal mine and stores fruit and vegetable seeds from all over the world.

Holding over 6,297 crop species, last year saw the highest numbers of depositing genebanks and the highest number of newcomers in the history of the vault, proving that cooperation on conserving seeds is flourishing.

How the Scottish whisky industry is inadvertently tackling overfishing

A love of the oceans inspired one man to create a sustainable alternative to Omega-3 supplements for both humans and farmed fish.

Previously, Omega-3 has relied on wild fish, which takes vital food from coastal communities. The solution also cleans up a problem within Scotland’s most popular industry.

Whisky wastewater usually ends up in the ocean, but the company MiAlgae uses nutrient-rich byproducts to create dried algae powder through a giant renewable-powered fermentation process. This is then used as aquafeed for farmed fish and pet food.

Tile whipping: The eco-friendly sport taking over the Netherlands

The Dutch have created a national sport out of tile-whipping to help make the Netherlands ‘climate-proof’.

Tile whipping - or ‘tegelwippen’ - sees residents try to remove the most paving slabs from their gardens, ensuring that urban spaces are greened and rewilded. This also eases pressure on drainage systems.

Winning communities receive a golden shovel with prizes going to the ‘whipper of the month’.

How deaf educators put tricky climate change terms into sign language

Researchers at the University of Edinburgh wanted to ensure a new generation could be part of climate conversations.

This was no mean feat, but British Sign Language has now expanded its vocabulary to include terms such as greenhouse gases, carbon footprint, and sustainability.

‘Keep at it’: At 74, anti-whaler Paul Watson continues to fight

After being released from prison and into the care of the French government, Paul Watson, the founder of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a direct action group focused on marine conservation activism, spoke to Euronews Green in early January.

Watson, who began protecting whales in 1974, highlighted that very few nations still hunt whales, with Norway, Iceland and Japan the only exceptions, and is increasingly confident about the future of these gentle giants.

And so Watson should be, as Euronews Green reported on multiple sightings of the magnificent humpback whale seen by people living along the UK coast - likely due to humpback whale populations having recovered extensively over the past half a century after whaling bans.

Scientists transform waste into batteries that could power grid

Scientists discovered a way to turn previously useless industrial waste into a vital material used in batteries that could power our future.

Discovered by scientists at America’s Northwestern University, the redox flow batteries use a chemical reaction to pump energy back and forth between electrolytes.

They could be an invaluable solution for energy storage on the scale of an electricity grid and help smooth out the current issue of troughs and peaks in wind and solar supply.

Tiny British island is now home to the world’s most remote EV charger

The island of St Helena in the British Overseas Territory has installed the world’s most remote public EV charger in its capital Jamestown.

In a trial supported by Norwegian charging company Easee and Japanese car brand Subaru, the hope is that by improving the infrastructure for electric vehicles, more people on the island will ditch their petrol and diesel-powered vehicles and adopt EVs.

Italy, Albania and UAE agree deal to share renewable energy

Three countries signed a clean energy cooperation deal that means they will share wind and solar energy across the sea.

The UAE is lending its technology and expertise to develop Albania’s renewable energy. Some of the energy produced from these new technologies will then be transferred to Italy via an underwater cable across the Adriatic Sea.

Researcher fired for refusing to fly wins monetary compensation

Sticking to your morals does eventually pay off, at least for the Italian climate researcher Dr Gianluca Grimalda, who was fired by his employers for refusing to fly back from a research trip.

In a bid to follow his beliefs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by avoiding flights and instead adopting slow travel, the researcher went viral on social media when he publicly shared his story in early 2024.

Grimalda filed a lawsuit for unfair dismissal, and in January, a settlement was agreed. €75,000 of the severance payment will be donated to environmental and climate protection and climate activism.

Solar grazing: Why sheep are the perfect partner for photovoltaics

Dubbed nature’s best lawnmowers, farmers in the USA are waking up to the benefits of keeping sheep on solar farms.

Known as agrivoltaics, solar farms now realise the benefits of making good use of the ground underneath solar arrays. Not only is it grazing sheep and other livestock, but also growing crops, and keeping bees.

Euronews Green shares some of the European projects that have been doing this for ages - and the benefits are numerous.

Dutch court orders government to cut nitrogen pollution by 2030

A Dutch court ruled that the government was failing to address critically high levels of nitrogen oxide pollution, mostly from farming and transport, in a case brought by Greenpeace.

Nitrogen pollution degrades soils and inadvertently fertilises trees, grasslands and tolerant species, putting them at high risk.

This is a huge win as nitrogen pollution is the third most influential driver of human-caused biodiversity loss after habitat destruction and greenhouse gas emissions.

Oil and gas workers will be helped to find green jobs in the UK

The UK is helping oil and gas workers switch to green energy careers by providing them with a ‘skills passport’ so that people working in the fossil fuel industry can make informed decisions about their jobs and future.

Research has found that around 90 per cent of fossil fuel workers have skills that are relevant to the clean energy transition.

The UK government has announced that regional skills investments worth almost £4 million (€4.7m) will help people make the move into clean energy jobs.

This is the main reason why China is taking action and has decided to use cleaner procedures to produce energy and that is nuclear energy.
Say goodbye to coal, hello nuclear energy!
As you can see, no petrol or any other bad material is involved in the nuclear energy.
What is your take on the Chinese investment on nuclear energy?","China is developing nuclear energy to generate electricity! The negative impacts of the energy currently used is worrying experts and a huge part of the society. With passage of time, electricity is getting more produced polluting our environment. However, this might change thanks to China and its new way of obtaining energy. More countries and companies are aware of the damage they make to the planet Earth and they are investing in new and sustainable ways to make everything work.

New energy to supply China

China is one of the countries that makes more negative impacts to the environment because they are millions of citizens and they consume a lot of energy for their everyday life actions like switching on lights, using computers, the air conditioning or even factories to produce the products they (and we) will later make use of.

This pollution is due to the use of energy coming from petrol and coil which are so harmful for the air we breathe and the planet Earth. This is the main reason why China is taking action and has decided to use cleaner procedures to produce energy and that is nuclear energy.

Say goodbye to coal, hello nuclear energy!

This nuclear energy uses natural resources like uranium and when this material breaks, through the process called nuclear fission, emits a huge amount of heat. When this happens water boils due to the previous heat, it creates vapor which moves a turbine and this is the one that generates electricity. As you can see, no petrol or any other bad material is involved in the nuclear energy.

China is planning on building 10 new nuclear reactors which are the place where the process of obtaining electricity happens. This is not a cheap project for China since it costs $27 billion, but China does believe it is the energy for the future.

Advantages and… dangers?

With the introduction of this new energy, we couldn’t see the characteristic black smoke fabrics produced because now fabrics will be much healthier for us. As mentioned before, nuclear energy is so beneficial for the environment as no gases are emitted and there will be less risk for the increase of global warming. Another positive aspect is the fact that this energy is able to work all day and generate a lot of energy able to supply the many people in China.

On the other hand, there are some risky possibilities. In case an accident happened in a nuclear power plant we could experience something similar to what happened in Chernobyl. Also, building a nuclear fabric is very expensive and it takes a long time to make it happen.

What about the rest of the world?

China may have paved the way for other countries to start doing the same way or, at least, thinking about the improvement of their energy strategies. Environment and energy have always been a popular debate, but China has been the first one in taking action – bearing in mind it is one of the most polluting countries. Do you think China could become the leading country on nuclear energy and be the main supplier for the rest of the countries?

Nowadays we couldn’t live without electricity, we need it for almost everything we do in our daily lives, so witnessing the different projects that countries like China are presenting creates a sense of hope at high levels of global warming times. As far as we know, this new energy has more pros than cons if properly used. So, let’s see how it goes.

“These are just massive headwinds for US manufacturing clean energy, which was already facing a tough global environment,” said Alex Jacquez, a former special assistant to Biden for economic development and industrial strategy, in an interview.

The dynamic appears particularly acute for green energy manufacturers, as well as for multinational manufacturers with facilities both in the US and elsewhere.

Both are set to eat some proverbial spinach alongside the range of goodies clearly on offer in the 1,000-plus-page package.

Overall though, the focus from many is on tax provisions in the bill that could boost company bottom lines, like an increase in the pass-through deduction as well as tax credits for things like depreciation, interest payments, and factories.

“In short, this is a manufacturers’ bill,” said Jay Timmons, the National Association of Manufacturers president, touting the tax credits in particular that will be implemented if they are eventually signed into law by the president.

Yet some were quick to point out that other subsectors will face challenges. None more so than green energy, with the bill set to include a rollback of clean energy credits implemented during the Biden administration for things like the making of solar panels and electric vehicles.

“These are just massive headwinds for US manufacturing clean energy, which was already facing a tough global environment,” said Alex Jacquez, a former special assistant to Biden for economic development and industrial strategy, in an interview.

Passage of the bill as it is could lead to “much lower levels of ongoing investment,” he added, as well as outright project cancellations “for sure.”

And markets may agree, to an extent. Clean energy stocks were down this past week, with solar stocks especially hard hit after the bill advanced.

Overall, the bill has a range of provisions for factory owners, most notably a new plan for 100 per cent expensing for structures that could be felt quickly.

This would allow companies to immediately deduct the costs of building new factories and updating existing ones, with the credit currently set to be in force from 2025 through 2028.",https://www.gdnonline.com/gdnimages/20250524\20250524223700WebsiteSize(27).jpg,N,,2025-05-24 22:01:33.543345

Tallgrass and GreenView also negotiated directly with the top level of the Navajo government about the project, most recently Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren.
All but two were in favor, and six specifically mentioned the GreenView natural gas pipeline.
In fact, solar projects are growing across the Navajo Nation as part of a federal program to electrify Native lands.
She said that when she asked regulatory agencies on the Navajo Nation what would be required for changing the long-debated hydrogen pipeline to natural gas, they hadn’t heard of it.","The company at the center of a controversial green energy project connecting New Mexico and Arizona has changed plans for a key component: A much-debated pipeline that would have carried climate-friendly hydrogen will instead carry natural gas, and possibly a natural gas-hydrogen blend at a future date. Unlike hydrogen, natural gas, blended or not, contributes to climate warming both in its production and when it is burned for energy.

The pipeline is part of a much larger project by Tallgrass Energy Partners LP that would create a hydrogen economy centered in Farmington in the northwest corner of New Mexico. Plans include hydrogen production, a massive hub to inject carbon deep underground, repurposing a mothballed coal-fired power plant as a hydrogen-fired power plant, and pipelines connecting the various parts. The plans also included one pipeline to carry hydrogen across the Navajo Nation to markets in Arizona and farther afield.

Tallgrass decided to change what would be delivered in the pipeline earlier this year, and the news surprised many. Starting in 2021, the company, working through its subsidiary GreenView, carried out a public relations campaign along the proposed pipeline route through the Navajo Nation, hyping the green benefits of hydrogen. Switching to natural gas or a gas-hydrogen blend would dramatically reduce or eliminate those benefits.

Tallgrass and GreenView also negotiated directly with the top level of the Navajo government about the project, most recently Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren. But when asked about the change to natural gas, Bidtah Becker, chief legal counsel for the president’s office, said, “It clearly was a decision that had been made long before we were informed.”

Many embraced the project in a region that has seen declining oil and gas production and associated revenues from the surrounding San Juan Basin, as well as the closure of a large coal-fired power plant and its mine. The project also drew sharp skepticism on and off the Navajo Nation, where more than a century of industrial mineral extraction and production has failed to produce widespread economic benefits to residents.

Unlike fossil fuels, many see hydrogen as a miracle fuel. It produces only water vapor as a byproduct when run through an electrolyzer to make electricity and it produces no climate-warming carbon dioxide when burned, though it does emit other noxious air pollutants.

However, common methods of producing hydrogen use natural gas as a feedstock, creating large quantities of climate-warming carbon dioxide that need to be permanently buried underground — which is difficult, expensive and often unsuccessful — if the fuel is to be considered climate friendly.

Steven Davidson, vice president of government and public affairs at Tallgrass, said the change “does not indicate a departure from our commitment to clean hydrogen production and [carbon dioxide] sequestration. Instead, we are strategically positioning the project to meet both current and future energy demands.”

The change would make a pipeline capable of carrying natural gas and a blend of natural gas and hydrogen in the future, Davidson said: “In short, definitely no deviation from our focus on clean hydrogen as a decarbonization solution.”

That solution includes working with the Navajo Nation, he added. “We have invested four years of our time and resources in true partnerships to invest with the Navajo people,” he said. “We are a group of one in that respect.”

Joe Romm, a senior research fellow at the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Center for Science, Sustainability and the Media and a former acting assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, is doubtful about the project’s overall prospects.

“In the real world, you don’t see [projects] like this happen a lot, something so complicated,” he said. So big hydrogen projects are the result of “powerful backers. And the most powerful is the oil and gas industry.”

The complication starts with transporting blended gas.

“Blending doesn’t make a lot of sense. You can’t blend a lot” because the chemical nature of hydrogen “will basically tunnel through and destroy normal steel and a lot of other things,” Romm said.

By comparison, long-distance natural gas pipelines have been around for decades (though they aren’t risk-free).

Then there is the basic math of the most common method of making hydrogen from natural gas: steam methane reformation. According to researchers at Texas A&M University, it requires 3.16 kilograms of natural gas and another 9.74 kilograms of water to make a single kilogram of hydrogen. That process also creates 8.47 kilograms of climate-warming carbon dioxide. The formula doesn’t include the fuel needed to power the process or the energy needed to sequester the carbon dioxide to keep the hydrogen’s green credentials.

That carbon sequestration hub would be another sticking point because carbon capture projects are hard. “You can’t find a successful major carbon capture and storage [project],” Romm said.

Furthermore, natural gas production itself is an inherently leaky process, and the methane in the gas is 80 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.

With all of these complications inherent in hydrogen production and transport, Romm said, “Just pipe the natural gas.”

The pipeline change came at roughly the same time that a member of the Arizona Corporation Commission asked the commission to study building more natural gas pipelines and storage facilities for the state. Among other duties, the commission oversees pipeline safety and power utilities.

Nick Myers, the Arizona commission vice chair, said he hadn’t heard of the GreenView pipeline project when he asked the commission to study such projects. “To the extent I may have been informed, but don’t remember, it was only in passing,” he said. “I would love to talk to someone just to be in the loop.”

Tallgrass’ Davidson said, “We were not involved in the [commission’s] decision.” But, he added, “It’s not surprising,” considering that AI data centers alone are projected to consume up to 16.5% of the state’s power grid by 2030.

“None of the [other] pipelines that are proposed to be built into Arizona, to the best of our knowledge, provide any value to the Navajo Nation,” Davidson added.

So far, Myers’ February memo to the commission has prompted 17 letters on possible new natural gas infrastructure in Arizona. All but two were in favor, and six specifically mentioned the GreenView natural gas pipeline.

One of those letters was co-authored by New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon (D-Albuquerque), who promoted and regularly voted in favor of fossil-fuel-friendly legislation during the state’s two-month legislative session earlier this year. She also cosponsored legislation that set up a framework for the state to manage carbon sequestration projects such as the planned CarbonSAFE hub in northwest New Mexico that’s part of Tallgrass’ overarching hydrogen project. (Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed the bill into law on April 7.)

Dixon’s co-author of both the letter and the legislation was state Sen. William Sharer (R-Farmington), the Senate minority floor leader and a longtime champion of oil and natural gas production. His district covers a large portion of the San Juan Basin in northwest New Mexico. Among the perceived benefits, the legislators championed the natural gas pipeline as “a unique opportunity to uplift the Navajo Nation,” despite the fact that oil and gas have been produced for more than 100 years on the economically challenged reservation. The letter doesn’t note them talking with anyone from the Nation, either.

In an email, Dixon said, “Even as [Sharer] and I disagree on some principles, we agree on the important role of carbon storage.”

Dixon didn’t say how she heard about the GreenView pipeline change, apparently before many on the Navajo Nation did. But she did offer reasons for supporting it: the argument of natural gas as a so-called “bridge fuel” (which is often–debunked); national and international security risks in light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (which are debatable); and the real lack of other readily available power sources for energy-intensive manufacturing processes and transport.

Groups ranging from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to the Rocky Mountain Institute support using hydrogen in energy-intensive industrial processes and heavy transport — but not elsewhere. That’s because for the past few years, grid-scale solar and wind energy have been cheaper to install than any fossil fuel. In fact, solar projects are growing across the Navajo Nation as part of a federal program to electrify Native lands. And the Environment America Research & Policy Center ranked New Mexico fourth in its top 10 list of states for renewable energy.

“My letter is intended to highlight potential opportunities created by this project,” Dixon said. “I fully expect Tallgrass to engage with all affected tribal and non-tribal communities.”

Three more letters that share similar structure and language and came from businesses on or near the Mexican border may be the work of LS2group, which calls itself “a bipartisan public relations, government affairs, public affairs, and marketing firm.”

Josh Rubin, the vice president of a cross-border manufacturing facilitator in Nogales, Arizona, 300 miles from the pipeline, told Capital & Main that a friend at LS2group asked him to send the letter, though he wasn’t overly familiar with the project.

A second letter, signed by a Holly Jensen claiming to own a Groovy Hues painting franchise in Tucson, couldn’t be verified. Neither name is affiliated with a registered business in Tucson, though there is a Groovy Hues 113 miles away in Phoenix, registered to a different person. And a call center operator for Groovy Hues said the company doesn’t do business in Tucson.

A third letter writer, Michael Sene, who runs a truck repair shop on the border, didn’t respond to a call and message from Capital & Main.

LS2group also did not return calls from Capital & Main.

Jessica Keetso (Diné) is deeply familiar with the GreenView project. For three years as an outreach coordinator for the Native group Tó Nizhóní Ání, or Sacred Water Speaks, she led an educational campaign opposing the hydrogen pipeline. (She recently left the group to attend law school.)

Even so, she first heard about the change from hydrogen to natural gas from Capital & Main, though she suspected something was in the works. “We knew something was happening because of how little presence Tallgrass had in the community” in recent months, she said.

“I think the Nation was always uncertain about the market for hydrogen,” she added. As for the pipeline change, “I think it’s really going to push the Navajo Nation for more benefits.”

Keetso said tribal agencies had already devoted a lot of time and energy working on the initial GreenView proposal, and changing the fuel could restart the whole process. She said that when she asked regulatory agencies on the Navajo Nation what would be required for changing the long-debated hydrogen pipeline to natural gas, they hadn’t heard of it.

The water crashes into six turbines, each weighing about 500 tonnes, which generate high-volume blasts of renewable power on demand.
But after 140 years generating electricity it is hydropower’s potential as an energy storage technology that is key to its future.
A House of Lords report published late last year warned that a large-scale rollout of long-duration energy storage technologies was “not being treated with sufficient urgency”.
Paolucci said: “Flexible storage is essential for net zero carbon operation of Britain’s electricity system.","Seconds after a catastrophic series of power outages struck across the UK in the summer of 2019, a phone rang in the control room of the Dinorwig hydropower plant in north Wales. It was Britain’s energy system operator requesting an immediate deluge of electricity to help prevent a wide-scale blackout crippling Britain’s power grids.

The response was swift, and in the end just under one million people were left without power for less than 45 minutes. While trains were stuck on lines for hours and hospitals had to revert to backup generators, that phone call prevented Britain’s worst blackout in a decade from being far more severe.

Almost six years later, the owners of Dinorwig, and its sister plant at Ffestiniog on the boundary of Eryri national park, formerly Snowdonia, are preparing to pump up to £1bn into a 10-year refurbishment of the hydropower plants that have quietly helped to keep the lights on for decades.

Ffestiniog was one of the first pumped hydroelectric systems in the UK when it opened in 1963, while nearby Dinorwig – the largest and fastest-acting pumped storage station in Europe – followed in 1984. The refurbishment could mean the plants continue to provide reliable clean energy on demand for decades to come – and serve as giant grid batteries to store Britain’s renewable electricity for when it is needed most.

Miya Paolucci, the UK boss of the French energy company Engie, one of Dinorwig’s owners, said refurbishing the plant will cost a third of the investment needed to build a new hydropower plant on a similar scale, making the overhaul an “intuitive” decision to secure another 25 years of life from the “much-loved” power station.

Britain has used gravity and the flow of water to generate electricity since 1878, when a hydroelectric generator first powered an arc lamp at the Cragside manor house in Northumberland. The project involved dropping water 100 metres vertically to turn a Siemens generator that would go on to power a series of newly invented incandescent lightbulbs in the country house.

Dinorwig and Ffestiniog use the same principles as the Cragside manor house to generate enough electricity to power the equivalent of almost 2 million UK households in a matter of seconds. When power is plentiful, the plants use electricity to pump water from a lower reservoir up to an elevated dam. Later, when power supplies are tight, the water is released to drive the turbines, generating power.

Dinorwig or Mynydd Gwefru, as it is known locally, can be called upon to generate electricity within 75 seconds by releasing 86,000 gallons of water a second down a cavernous 500-metre vertical tunnel. The water crashes into six turbines, each weighing about 500 tonnes, which generate high-volume blasts of renewable power on demand.

Overall, hydropower makes up only 2% of the UK’s total electricity – but often at times when its electrons are at their most vital to keeping the lights on. It provides many of the key benefits of large fossil fuel power plants – but without the carbon emissions.

Unlike wind and solar farms, hydropower projects can be called upon by the system operator at specific times when the grid needs more generation to meet demand. The spinning mass of its generators can also help to stabilise the frequency of the power grid at about 50Hz, the level required to avoid power outages. In the event of a blackout, hydropower can even help to restart the power system.

But after 140 years generating electricity it is hydropower’s potential as an energy storage technology that is key to its future. Pumped hydropower can effectively work as a long-duration battery by using renewable electricity when it is abundant to pump water up into a reservoir and release the water to generate electricity when renewable energy wanes.

Unlike grid batteries, which are often designed to charge during the day and discharge electricity at night, long-duration energy storage systems can store energy for hours, days or even weeks so it can be used when needed.

The government hopes to bring forward investment in 18GW of storage by 2035, of which 10GW should be long-duration storage such as hydropower. But pumped hydropower projects are struggling to find a place in Britain’s energy landscape

There are geographic hurdles: there are only so many vast mountains and brimming reservoirs, and the projects can also provoke concerns within the local community. But in locations where they are viable developers have been left to wait for government officials to confirm the details of its financial support framework.

One of the UK’s biggest renewable energy developers, SSE, hopes that its Coire Glas project in the Scottish Highlands could be the first major pumped storage hydro scheme built in the UK in more than 40 years.

The project could power 3 million homes for up to 24 hours, and would nearly double Great Britain’s total current electricity storage capacity, but it needs the final details of a government support scheme before SSE can fully commit to the project.

A House of Lords report published late last year warned that a large-scale rollout of long-duration energy storage technologies was “not being treated with sufficient urgency”.

The report found that a wide-scale rollout would allow more renewable power to be available, potentially lowering the overall cost of electricity for consumers.

Better energy storage could, the committee said, make the grid more flexible and avoid paying to switch off wind and solar farms when there is more clean power being generated than consumers can use.

Paolucci said: “Flexible storage is essential for net zero carbon operation of Britain’s electricity system. It helps balance the system by ensuring there’s always a large volume of ‘back-up’ power on standby, that can be delivered in very fast timescales if required. We’re very proud to contribute to the electricity security of supply and green energy ambition of the UK with these extraordinary assets.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36d01b654e6f8d58369675fb3019bb326c795079/854_0_7200_5760/master/7200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=057853b4eeefd7387ccdfef618f125ca,N,,2025-05-24 20:05:12.897529

BYD Is #1 In Europe

Please note BYD overtakes Tesla in Europe

BYD sold more battery electric vehicles (BEVs) than market leader Tesla in Europe for the first time last month, as the Chinese carmaker continued to make inroads despite hefty tariffs on cars imported from the mainland.

Shenzhen-based BYD, which also makes plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), sold 7,231 BEVs in April, a year-on-year increase of 169 per cent, according to data compiled by market research firm Jato Dynamics from 28 countries in Europe. Tesla’s sales fell 49 per cent to 7,165 units in the same period.

“Although the difference between the two brands’ monthly sales totals may be small, the implications are enormous,” said Felipe Munoz, a global analyst at Jato Dynamics, on Thursday. “This is a watershed moment for Europe’s car market, particularly when you consider that Tesla has led the European BEV market for years, while BYD only officially began operations beyond Norway and the Netherlands in late 2022.”

Despite huge tariffs imposed by the European Union (EU), Chinese firms’ BEV sales jumped 59 per cent year on year in April to nearly 15,300 units, while carmakers from Europe, Japan, South Korea and the US posted a 26 per cent increase in sales, it added.

In the PHEV segment, Chinese carmakers’ sales surged 546 per cent year on year to 9,649 units, accounting for nearly 10 per cent of PHEVs registered in the bloc.

In response to disruptions from US tariffs, the EU and China are negotiating the European levies and exploring the possibility of setting a price floor for Chinese EVs.

Chinese EV makers are also speeding up the construction of factories on the continent to counter the tariffs. BYD’s first European car factory in Hungary is expected to start production in the second half of this year.

BYD also planned to establish its European headquarters and a new research and development centre in Hungary, CEO and president Wang Chuanfu said this week.

BYDs would sell in the US too were it not for 100 percent tariffs.

Would You Pay $15,000 for this Nice-Looking EV Toyota?

On May 4, 2025, I asked Would You Pay $15,000 for this Nice-Looking EV Toyota? Zoomers?

I am sure many would say yes, but there’s a catch.

But the Toyota bZ3X is real, and it is actually on sale starting at that price. There is a catch: To buy one, you have to be in China.

Tesla has two models widely available—Model 3 and Model Y—and both have been on the market for years. China’s BYD has about 25 models, according to the market-analysis firm Inovev, and is constantly introducing more.

Pay More – Get Less

That is Trump’s unofficial motto as well as the UAW and Teamsters.

The BZ3X would be a hot seller in the US at $15,000 or even $20,000.

But Trump wants you to to pay more. His 145 percent tariff that would price the car at $37,000 or so.

Trump finds it easy to get the economically clueless on his side with chants of “They are stealing out jobs; they are ripping us off; and it’s unfair trade”.

Trump never asks, would you like a $15,000 EV Toyota

However, the president has cast nuclear energy as a complement, rather than a replacement, for fossil fuels.
Developers have said the change would create a significant barrier to building nuclear plants.
That would allow nuclear energy to power and operate critical defense facilities and AI data centers, a senior White House official said.
Like wind and solar plants, nuclear generates electricity without producing the greenhouse gas emissions that drive global warming.","President Donald Trump on Friday signed orders meant to accelerate the construction of nuclear power plants, including small, untested designs that offer the promise of rapid deployment but haven’t yet been built in the US.

The effort is a bid to meet a coming surge in electricity demand and help the US reclaim its edge in nuclear energy. While the country was once the leader in deploying and producing nuclear power, it’s finished building only two new reactors in the last 30 years and shuttered existing plants, even as China and Russia race to deploy them.

Trump’s initiative to unleash nuclear energy could give a boost to an emission-free source of power that’s championed as a climate-friendly alternative to electricity generated by burning coal and natural gas. However, the president has cast nuclear energy as a complement, rather than a replacement, for fossil fuels.

“We’re signing tremendous executive orders today that really will make us the real power in this industry,” Trump said as he issued the directives in the Oval Office, adding that nuclear technology “has come a long way, both in safety and costs.”

Trump was joined by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and energy industry executives including Constellation Energy Corp. CEO Joseph Dominguez and Jake DeWitte of Oklo Inc.

The initiative represents the latest bid by an American president to jump start the domestic nuclear industry, which has languished in recent decades. Former President Joe Biden last year laid out a plan to triple US nuclear capacity by 2050, and Trump’s new plan aims to quadruple it. It also comes as technology companies are clamoring for power to supply energy-hungry data centers.

The effort is likely to give a boost to companies developing small reactors, including Last Energy Inc., Oklo, TerraPower LLC and NuScale Power Corp.

One of the orders also aims to get 10 large, conventional reactors under construction by 2030, potentially benefiting Westinghouse Electric Co., whose gigawatt-scale AP1000 design was the last commercial nuclear unit built in the US and has been embraced worldwide.

Trump’s nuclear initiative also would encourage the use of government financing to support the restart of shuttered nuclear plants, target 5 gigawatts worth of upgrades at existing sites and help spur the completion of others — potentially aiding South Carolina utility Santee Cooper’s bid to resume building two reactors at its V.C. Summer plant, where soaring costs prompted the company to halt construction in 2017.

However, Trump’s nuclear push comes as lawmakers move to phase out a government subsidy that’s seen as critical to helping propel construction of new reactors and support existing plants. Developers have said the change would create a significant barrier to building nuclear plants.

Under a bill that passed the House early Thursday, new and expanded advanced nuclear projects would be eligible to receive clean energy tax credits only as long as they begin construction by the end of 2028, while tax credits for existing nuclear power plants would expire at the end of 2031.

Trump’s initiative aims to spur construction of at least one reactor at US military installations. That would allow nuclear energy to power and operate critical defense facilities and AI data centers, a senior White House official said. And, because that approach doesn’t involve commercial plants, it lets developers bypass the customary approval process through the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

In the meantime, the NRC would also get an overhaul. Trump is ordering a reorganization of the agency and a culling of its workforce in consultation with the president’s Department of Government Efficiency cost-cutting program, along with fixed timelines for license approvals and “a wholesale revision” of its regulations.

While some developers have decried the lengthy and expensive process to secure NRC approval for proposed designs and renew licenses for existing facilities, some nuclear power advocates worry the effort may backfire by sparking regulatory upheaval and uncertainty. If new reactor designs can’t be fully vetted within the president’s proposed 18-month deadline, they warn, the models could even be rejected altogether, an outcome that would likely undermine Trump’s deployment goals.

Trump is also ordering the NRC reconsider radiation limits, saying its reliance on safety models assuming there is no safe exposure threshold has led to “a myopic policy of minimizing even trivial risks.”

Some energy experts have expressed alarm about the president’s plan to strengthen the domestic supply chain for nuclear fuel, potentially creating a market for reprocessed radioactive material and surplus plutonium stockpiles. Former US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz this week warned that the proposal may lead “to the creation of additional stocks of weapons-usable materials.”

The president is also embracing the Energy Department’s Loan Programs Office as a potential source of financing for nuclear projects. Under Trump’s orders, the office would be directed to prioritize activities and resources for restarting shuttered plants, increasing output at existing sites, completing construction of unfinished reactors and building new advanced-nuclear units.

Constellation’s Dominguez said current permitting processes waste time, especially as data center operators and hyperscalers seek out 24/7 power supply. “We need to do this for America,” he said alongside Trump.

Reactors currently supply almost a tenth of the world’s power, including about 100 gigawatts of capacity in the US. Advocates say the industry needs to grow threefold by 2050 to help avoid the most catastrophic consequences of climate change. Like wind and solar plants, nuclear generates electricity without producing the greenhouse gas emissions that drive global warming. But reactors also have the advantage of running around the clock, delivering the non-stop power that’s in-demand from artificial intelligence companies and data center operators.

The US was at the vanguard of installing nuclear power plants for decades, but China is now the world’s top builder, with roughly 30 reactors under construction. Russia, meanwhile, has spent years honing its own technology and has exported reactors to buyers in India, Iran and elsewhere.

The initiative, focused on solar, wind, and hybrid projects, aims to deliver affordable energy at ₹2.54 per unit. Rural areas will benefit from stable solar access, boosting agriculture and secondary income. This move positions Maharashtra as a green energy leader.

In Detail : Mumbai – Maharashtra is spearheading India’s clean energy revolution under Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis’ leadership with an ambitious plan to add 38 GW of renewable capacity by 2030.

The Chief Minister’s office in a post on X on Monday said, “Backed by Rs 3.3 lakh crore in investments and 7 lakh new jobs, the state is blending affordability with sustainability. This is more than a transition, it’s a blueprint for inclusive, green growth!”

The CMO quoted the article written by the Energy Department’s Additional Chief Secretary Abha Shukla.

“India’s electricity demand is rising rapidly. By 2030, driven by economic growth, industrialisation, and population pressure, the country’s power consumption is expected to touch unprecedented levels. In this context, Maharashtra’s approach stands out as a powerful example of how forward-thinking policy and long-term vision can turn a challenge into an opportunity,” read the article.

It added that as India’s largest industrial and power-consuming state, Maharashtra is expected to witness a 6.5 per cent annual increase in power demand. That translates to a requirement of more than 280 billion units of electricity by 2030, with peak demand jumping from the current 29 GW to 45 GW — a scale comparable to that of major European nations.

To meet this challenge, Maharashtra has formulated a practical, future-ready energy transition plan. Its goal is clear: affordable electricity, clean energy, and sustainable growth.

At the heart of this transition is a strong push for 38 GW of renewable energy (16 GW distributed RE for agriculture) with storage (pump storage and distributed battery storage ), solar and wind hybrid energy, with tariff commitments as low as Rs 2.54 per unit for solar energy. This is not just a clean energy initiative — it is also a cost-saving move.

Lower production costs mean cheaper power for industries, which in turn enhances their global competitiveness. It is a smart economic strategy cloaked in environmental foresight.

The broader transition plan is expected to attract investments worth Rs 3.3 lakh crore by 2030. Significantly, 75 per cent of this investment will be within Maharashtra and will be largely driven by the private sector. This scale of capital infusion promises to reshape the energy ecosystem and, in turn, the economy, it said.

For India to remain competitive in the global energy and manufacturing markets, it must deliver power that is not just clean but also affordable and reliable.

Maharashtra recognises this. By focusing on lower input costs through clean energy, the state is creating an environment where both MSMEs and large industries can thrive.

In addition, the state’s investments in transmission networks and energy storage infrastructure are aimed at reducing wastage and ensuring that every unit of generated renewable power is efficiently utilised. These steps are critical to making the grid stable, attracting private participation, and preventing the kind of power curtailment issues seen in some developed markets like Germany, it said.",https://www.eqmagpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Green-Hydrogen_RE_Renewal-Energy_Solar_Wind.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 20:04:53.133895

Renewed attention is being given to the integration of consumer energy resources, such as rooftop solar systems and home batteries, as well as community-scale batteries and utilisation of spare government land and commercial roof space. This will minimise the impact on surrounding communities and the environment by repurposing existing infrastructure as much as possible.

The Illawarra region contains unique features that make it an ideal location for a REZ. The region already hosts major energy, port and transport infrastructure, has a skilled workforce and has strong demand for future renewable energy projects. The Illawarra REZ will help strengthen the region’s economy and support jobs for decades.

EnergyCo will engage closely with community, industry, local government and other stakeholders as the design and delivery of the REZ progresses.

Minister Penny Sharpe said the Illawarra has the potential to be NSW’s first urban renewable energy zone.

“This is a chance to leverage the community’s enthusiasm for solar, batteries and EVs to benefit the entire region, as well as pursue longer-term opportunities to support green manufacturing,” Minister Sharpe said.

“The Roundtable is an opportunity for community, industry and energy leaders to map out the next steps for unlocking clean, reliable and affordable energy for the Illawarra Renewable Energy Zone.”

NSW Minister for Planning and Public Spaces and Wollongong MP Paul Scully said the Illawarra is uniquely positioned to show how renewable energy production and consumption can fit into an urban area.

“This Roundtable brings together industry pace setters and innovators in a crucial step towards delivering clean green energy that can meet the needs of both residents and local local industry,” he said.

Minister for the Illawarra and the South Coast, and Keira MP Ryan Park said the Illawarra already hosts major energy, port and transport infrastructure, has skilled workers required and strong demand for projects which capitalise on the region’s ability to innovate.

What is a Renewable Energy Zone?

REZs will group new wind and solar power generation into locations where it can be efficiently stored and transmitted across NSW. Five zones have been identified and will keep electricity reliable as coal-fired power stations retire, by delivering large amounts of energy.

REZs will help deliver lower wholesale electricity costs and place downward pressure on customer bills through increased competition.

What is EnergyCo?

EnergyCo is the NSW Government authority responsible for leading the delivery of REZs, as part of the Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap. The Roadmap is the state’s 20-year plan to transform our electricity system and unlock more affordable and reliable energy.

EnergyCo leads strategic planning and consultation processes, to make sure the new transmission infrastructure needed is built in the right place at the right time, with benefits for host communities.

The biggest rival isn’t another electric vehicle manufacturer.
Environmental groups have expressed frustration with these deadline extensions, viewing them as barriers to electric vehicle market penetration.
The current administration has also signaled intentions to eliminate tax credits that make electric vehicles more affordable for average buyers.
The path forward remains unclear What’s becoming clear is that electric vehicle adoption faces more complex challenges than initially anticipated.","The electric vehicle revolution faces an unexpected enemy. It’s not the charging infrastructure gaps or battery technology limitations that most people assume. According to industry insiders from leading Chinese manufacturers, the real obstacle blocking widespread EV adoption isn’t even competitor brands—it’s something much more familiar sitting in driveways across America.

The real competition isn’t what you think

When we talk about the EV market, Tesla usually gets mentioned as the benchmark everyone’s chasing. But here’s where things get interesting. Senior executives from major Chinese automakers have been quite vocal about what they see as their primary competition, and it might surprise you.

The biggest rival isn’t another electric vehicle manufacturer. It’s internal combustion engine vehicles that continue to dominate consumer preferences. This perspective comes from someone who’s spent nearly three decades in the automotive industry, watching market dynamics shift and evolve.

Think about it from a consumer standpoint. You’re looking for a new car, and you’ve got two basic paths: stick with what you know (gasoline) or jump into something relatively new (electric). The familiar option usually wins, especially when policy makers keep moving the goalposts.

Policy mixed signals hurt EV momentum

The regulatory landscape has become a maze of contradictory signals. Take what’s happening globally with emission standards and combustion engine phase-out dates. Government policies announce ambitious targets for ending gas car production, then quietly extend deadlines when traditional manufacturers push back.

The latest example involves emission compliance standards getting pushed back by two years beyond original projections. This kind of policy flip-flopping creates uncertainty for both manufacturers and consumers. Why rush to buy electric when regulators keep giving gas cars more time?

Environmental groups have expressed frustration with these deadline extensions, viewing them as barriers to electric vehicle market penetration. Meanwhile, traditional automakers celebrate the breathing room to continue their current production strategies.

American market faces unique headwinds

The situation in the United States adds another layer of complexity. Recent policy shifts have removed federal incentives for EV charging infrastructure development. The current administration has also signaled intentions to eliminate tax credits that make electric vehicles more affordable for average buyers.

This policy reversal comes at a time when some energy experts warn that domestic oil reserves may be showing early signs of depletion. Yet the political momentum seems to be moving away from alternative energy solutions rather than toward them.

Chinese manufacturers face additional hurdles through import tariffs that make their vehicles less competitive on price—one of their key advantages in other markets.

European expansion plans continue despite obstacles

Despite these challenges, some Chinese automakers remain committed to establishing themselves as “European brands” through local manufacturing. This strategy aims to sidestep trade barriers while building consumer trust through domestic production.

The numbers tell an interesting story. Vehicle sales in Europe jumped 41% year-over-year in 2024, reaching approximately 4.27 million units from Chinese manufacturers. That’s significant growth, but it still represents a small fraction of the total European market.

The question becomes whether this momentum can sustain itself when combustion engine vehicles continue receiving regulatory extensions and policy support.

Traditional automakers share similar concerns

Interestingly, major European automotive groups have voiced similar frustrations about policy inconsistency. Leadership from both Stellantis and Renault have publicly stated that European automotive markets have been declining for five consecutive years, with conditions potentially worsening.

These executives argue that the industry faces a split between two competing interests: supporting existing traditional manufacturing versus promoting new Asian market entrants. They advocate for policies that would help both segments grow rather than forcing a zero-sum competition.

Their proposal includes differentiated regulations for compact vehicles, recognizing that smaller cars face unique challenges in the transition to electric powertrains (mainly due to cost constraints and battery packaging limitations).

Market reality vs. political rhetoric

The disconnect between political promises and market realities creates an unstable environment for long-term planning. Consumers hesitate to make major purchases when they’re unsure about future fuel costs, charging availability, or resale values.

This uncertainty benefits the status quo—gasoline-powered vehicles—by default. When people are confused or concerned about change, they typically stick with familiar options.

The automotive industry requires massive capital investments with payback periods measured in decades. Policy instability makes these investment decisions much harder to justify, whether you’re building EV factories or gas engine plants.

The path forward remains unclear

What’s becoming clear is that electric vehicle adoption faces more complex challenges than initially anticipated. Technology improvements and manufacturing scale-up have progressed faster than expected, but consumer behavior and political support have proven more resistant to change.

The irony is that while EV manufacturers compete intensely against each other for market share, they’re all fighting the same larger battle against consumer inertia and policy uncertainty. Until that dynamic changes, internal combustion engines will likely maintain their position as the real competition.

The next few years will determine whether electric vehicles can overcome these systemic barriers or whether they’ll remain a niche market despite their technological advantages.",https://www.actumoteur.fr/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/stella-li-vicepresidenta-byd-4304639.webp,N,,2025-05-24 19:07:53.192383

The “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” passed the House by one vote, with votes predominantly falling along party lines . Two House Republicans, Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio, joined the entire House Democratic Caucus in voting against the bill.

Included in the package were provisions pushing Trump and Republicans’ policy around increasing domestic energy, timber and mineral production, and restoring the federal multiple-use mandate on public land. These were passed earlier this month through the House Natural Resources Committee , where Republicans claimed that the new oil and gas leases, energy development, and rollbacks of environmental protections in the bill could generate around $15 billion in savings.

In a recent interview with The Aspen Times, Republican U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd, who represents much of western Colorado and who voted to approve the final House bill, said it is “about finding balance” and approaching public lands “pragmatically.”

Hurd added that he believes the bill does a good job advancing the agenda he and other Republicans campaigned on. This includes his campaign promise that decisions around federal public lands should be made with the input and buy-in of those who would be affected as well as “making sure we unleash the energy agenda.”

“In areas, especially in Western and Southern Colorado, energy production isn’t just an issue — it’s a livelihood,” he said. “I think, when it comes to this reconciliation legislation, that we’re reflecting that mentality.”

U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Republican who represents the 4th Congressional District in eastern Colorado, issued a press release applauding the bill’s passage as “a​​ major step towards implementing the America First mandate voters delivered to us last November.”

“This critical legislation makes the Trump tax cuts permanent, unleashes American energy producers, invests billions in support of our farmers and ranchers by responsibly reforming SNAP benefits, strengthens Medicaid to focus on American citizens who truly need help, and delivers a final net deficit reduction of $1.5 trillion,” she stated.

House Democrats in the committee, who have criticized Trump’s reconciliation package as a way to fund tax cuts for billionaires, referred to the legislation as one of the most destructive and extreme anti-environment bills in the country’s history.

Some of the natural resource committee’s most controversial proposals — including a last-minute amendment that proposed the sale of over 500,000 acres of public land in Nevada and Utah — were stripped from the final version in a manager’s amendment.

Also removed from the bill was a section that would have repealed five resource management plans approved under former President Joe Biden, including two plans in Colorado for the Bureau of Land Management’s Colorado River Valley and Grand Junction field offices.

Colorado Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse fought against the plans’ removal from the package through a failed amendment at the committee hearing and after the hearing in a submission to the Rules Committee, according to an aide from his office. In a statement, Neguse said he was “proud that we were successful in our pursuit of removing the provision from the bill.”

“Republicans’ effort to overturn Resource Management Plans for two Bureau of Land Management field offices in Colorado was an attempt to roll back years-long community efforts, backed by public input and on-the-ground expertise,” he stated.

The two Colorado plans were finalized last fall , and according to the bureau, made around 85% of lands that have “high potential” open to future oil and gas leases, while closing “low and medium potential” areas to leases. The plans also extended wilderness protections and conservation areas.

Even with these changes, Democrats and environmental advocates are concerned about what remains in the package.

“I continue to be deeply concerned for the sweeping threats this bill still poses to critical conservation and public oversight programs,” Neguse stated.

Still included are proposed changes to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), including changes that would allow private entities to pay a fee and bypass public review; funding cuts to the National Park Service; mandating quarterly lease sales for oil and gas on federal land (including in Colorado); requiring offshore and Arctic drilling and more.

In a statement, Tracy Stone-Manning, president of The Wilderness Society, referred to what remains as “one big giveaway.”

“By opening hundreds of millions of acres to drilling, mining, and logging to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, this bill harms the tens of millions of people who like to hike, recreate, or find solace in the outdoors,” Stone-Manning stated.

Now, the big bill is heading to the Senate, where advocates are hopeful changes will continue to be made. Louis Geltman, the vice president of policy and government relations for the recreation member group Outdoor Alliance, said in a statement that the act is still “very bad for public lands and waters.”

“But at the same time, it’s really encouraging that a growing group of lawmakers are standing up for public lands, and that doesn’t happen without our community showing up,” Geltman stated. “We can continue to make a difference as this conversation shifts to the Senate.”

King Crab Mode: Turning Tough Trails Into Playgrounds

The biggest headline for the 2026 model is undoubtedly King Crab mode, an advanced rear-wheel steering system that elevates Hummer EV’s legendary maneuverability to a new level. Unlike traditional four-wheel steering, where rear wheels mimic the front at a similar rate, King Crab allows the rear wheels to turn significantly faster. This results in unprecedented agility when negotiating tight, technical off-road terrain, whether that’s threading through boulders or tight rock crawling.

King Crab is standard on the 2X and 3X Pickup and SUV trims and will also be rolled out as a complimentary over-the-air update to all 2022 through 2025 Hummer EV owners, fulfilling a promise made at the vehicle’s original launch. This fusion of hardware and software showcases the benefits of electric platforms that can evolve post-purchase, delivering new capabilities based on owner feedback and technological advances.

Carbon Fiber Edition: The Quickest Hummer EV Yet

The 2026 lineup introduces the limited-edition Carbon Fiber Edition, available for both the Pickup and SUV. This version not only looks distinct with its matte Magnus Gray exterior and Velocity Ember interior theme but also takes performance to the next level. Powered by a 24-module battery pack optimized through software and hardware calibrations, it rockets from 0 to 60 mph in an estimated 2.8 seconds, making it the fastest Hummer EV to date.

Design cues extend beyond performance, with exclusive 22-inch carbon fiber black wheels, all-terrain tires, and carbon fiber accents on mirror caps and skid plates. Black approach shields and black badging underscore its rugged yet refined character, while the SUV model includes a matching carbon fiber spare wheel. The higher-contrast, brighter palette reinforces its presence on and off the road.

Bidirectional Charging Expands Utility

Building on practical innovation, the 2026 Hummer EV introduces bidirectional charging capabilities. This allows the truck to transfer power to another compatible EV (vehicle-to-vehicle) or to supply electricity to a home during blackouts (vehicle-to-home), provided it’s equipped with the necessary hardware and the home grid supports it. This capability extends the truck’s role from transportation to a mobile power source, a feature increasingly valuable as electric vehicles become integrated into broader energy ecosystems.

Enhanced Driver Assistance and Infotainment Tech

Super Cruise, GMC’s semi-autonomous driving system, now integrates Google Maps for enhanced lane guidance on supported roads. The system will automatically activate hands-free driving when entering Super Cruise-enabled highways, with the steering wheel’s light bar turning green to confirm activation. Newly added hands-on functionality keeps drivers centered in their lanes and adjusts speed relative to the vehicle ahead, while adaptive cruise control can now automatically comply with posted speed limits.

Inside, the 13.4-inch diagonal premium infotainment display offers a customizable split-view screen, keeping vital information at drivers’ fingertips. Google Built-In enriches the in-car experience with apps like Chrome, GameSnacks, and Prime Video, entertainment options accessible even while charging. OnStar connectivity supports intelligent EV routing, voice commands, and seamless access to various apps.

Power and Ride Quality: Leading the Class

At the heart of the lineup is the 24-module Hummer EV 3X Pickup, delivering an estimated 1,160 horsepower and 13,000 lb-ft of torque, making it the most powerful truck in its class. For 2026, GMC has further refined damper tuning to improve overall ride quality, striking a balance between the ruggedness demanded off-road and the comfort expected on daily drives.

Fresh Exterior and Interior Styling Options

The Hummer EV continues to embody GMC’s premium off-road lifestyle with bold, practical styling. New exterior paint options include Coastal Dune and Auburn Matte, while interior themes Granite Drift and Stealth Eclipse provide fresh looks and enhanced personalization.

Production and Availability

Production of the 2026 GMC Hummer EV will commence later this year at GM’s Factory ZERO Assembly Center in Detroit and Hamtramck, Michigan, the hub for GMC’s all-electric trucks, including the Hummer EV Pickup, SUV, and Sierra EV. The updated models are expected to reach GMC EV dealerships later this year. Official pricing and GM-estimated driving range figures will be announced closer to launch.

Advanced, Fast, and Ready, But Range Remains a Mystery

The 2026 GMC Hummer EV builds on its trailblazing roots with new off-road tech, improved acceleration, and expanded energy management features that underline its status as a technologically advanced supertruck. While the addition of King Crab mode and the limited Carbon Fiber Edition push capability and performance forward, the absence of published range figures leaves a key factor yet to be disclosed. This pending detail will likely play a significant role for prospective buyers weighing power against daily usability in the growing electric truck market.",https://www.idrivesocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2026-HUMMER-EV-pic-Carbon-Fiber-Edition-Pickup.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 17:07:47.966547

Nuclear energy stocks soared after President Donald Trump signed a set of executive orders on Friday meant to accelerate the development of nuclear power reactors in the U.S. and revamp the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

Share prices of nuclear power companies including Oklo (OKLO) (OKLO), Nuscale (SMR) (SMR), and Constellation Energy (CEG) (CEG) rose sharply on Friday. For Oklo, shares increased nearly 30% to $51 earlier in the day. Nuscale, meanwhile, rose nearly 23% to $31.05 per share.

The four executive orders are expected to pave the way for the Department of Energy to install nuclear reactors on federal land, along with expanding uranium mining and enrichment in the U.S. The Trump administration also aims make it easier to build and operate nuclear reactors, with the NRC also tasked with reviewing nuclear reactor licenses in the next year and a half.

“The first tranche of [executive orders] relates to nuclear energy where President Trump is taking truly historic action to usher in the American nuclear renaissance,” Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, told reporters in a call as reported by CBS News.

At the White House during the signing, Trump was flanked by the chief executives of nuclear energy companies including Joseph Dominguez of Constellation Energy and Scott Nolan of General Matter, NBC News reported.

Trump called nuclear energy “safe and clean,” adding, “It’s time for nuclear and we’re gonna do it very big.”

In a bid to retain the staggering $40 billion required to close its electricity access gap in the country, Nigeria is doubling down on local manufacturing of solar technologies, positioning itself as Africa’s renewable energy hub while unlocking new job opportunities and attracting investment.

Speaking at the launch of the Next Generation RESCO programme in Abuja, the Managing Director of the Rural Electrification Agency (REA), Abba Aliyu, said the Federal Government has resolved to transform its energy deficit into an economic opportunity.

Aliyu stressed that the $410 billion required for Nigeria’s energy transition plan and the $40 billion required to bridge access cannot end up in the pockets of foreigners and importers.

He noted that Nigeria, despite having the highest number of people without access to electricity on the continent, remains critically under-represented in the global renewable energy job market.

“It is no longer enough to talk about energy poverty. We must act by localising solutions through finance, infrastructure, talent, and manufacturing. The access gap is not just a burden; it is our opportunity to lead Africa’s energy future,” Aliyu said.

Under President Bola Tinubu’s administration, Nigeria has secured a landmark $750 million in public-sector renewable energy funding — one of the largest globally. This, according to the REA boss, marks a turning point in efforts to build infrastructure and deepen the domestic renewable energy value chain.

Aliyu revealed ongoing negotiations for an additional $200 million in co-financing and a prospective $700 million under separate arrangements, bringing potential funding to well over $1 billion to push renewable. But he stressed that financing alone is insufficient without an enabling ecosystem.

At the heart of this ecosystem is the Renewable Energy Service Company (RESCO) framework, a public-private model aimed at fast-tracking deployment through private sector-led innovation.

He disclosed that more than 50 RESCOs are currently active across Nigeria; up from just 10 a few years ago, deploying off-grid and decentralised energy systems in underserved communities.

Aliyu said Nigeria’s focus on import substitution is already bearing fruit, with the country’s local solar panel manufacturing capacity rising from 100MW to over 600MW since President Tinubu took over office.

He disclosed that operational plants now exist in Lagos, Abuja and other parts of the country, with more expected in the near term.

He added that localisation is not limited to panels alone. “We are ensuring that components currently imported will soon be produced here in Nigeria, not only for domestic use but for export across Africa,” he said.

Aliyu said human capital remains a challenge for the sector, stating that “to convert financing and policy into sustainable energy access, we need a skilled workforce.”

The Next Generation RESCO programme, developed in partnership with Prado Energy, National Power Training Institute of Nigeria (NAPTIN) and other stakeholders, is Nigeria’s first public-private talent pipeline for the renewable energy sector.

Aliyu noted that the programme blends classroom learning with nine months of paid internship placements at leading RESCOs, with automatic job offers for top-performing trainees.

The initiative, designed with gender parity and regional inclusion in mind, will kick off with 120 participants and grow over time.

The National Power Training Institute of Nigeria (NAPTIN) said the initiative was designed to build a skilled workforce for the country’s rapidly evolving renewable energy sector.

NAPTIN’s Director General, Ahmed Nagode, emphasised the urgent need for practical skills over traditional academic qualifications.

“White-collar jobs alone are no longer sufficient. This programme is about creating a vibrant, efficient and effective workforce to drive Nigeria’s energy transition,” he said.

Nagode stressed the underutilised potential of the energy sector and the disconnect between academia and industry, which has contributed to high unemployment.

The initiative, he said, aims to build capacity and align training with industry demands.

Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, at the event, lauded the programme as “a bold and efficient initiative”, adding that it aligns with the government’s broader reforms in the power sector.

Adelabu, who was represented by the Director of the Rural Power Services Department at the Power ministry, Owolabi Sunday, said: “This is not just about training, it is about transformation. We must invest in leadership and local solutions to ensure a sustainable, climate-resilient energy future for Nigeria.”

The programme, coordinated by Dr Alex Tamunomiegbam of Prado Power, will target all six geopolitical zones of Nigeria.

Story summary

U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright issued an emergency order on Friday, May 23 — just eight days before the J.H. Campbell plant in Port Sheldon Township was scheduled to shut down, a plan that has been in place since 2021.

The Ottawa County Board of Commissioners approved a resolution on in February urging Consumers Energy to delay the closure of the J.H. Campbell plant, however, it stopped short of filing a lawsuit in April.

Consumers Energy previously said the plan for closure was vetted and approved from multiple stakeholders and regulatory agencies; it is unknown how much coal remains at the site to continue operations.

PORT SHELDON TWP. — The long-planned closing of the coal-fired J.H. Campbell plant in Port Sheldon Township will be delayed at least 90 days after Trump Administration officials issued an emergency order directing Consumers Energy to remain “available for operation” going into peak summer demand.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued the emergency order on Friday, May 23 — just eight days before the plant was scheduled to shut down, a plan that has been in place since 2021.

The U.S. Department of Energy said the move is intended “to minimize the risk of blackouts and address critical grid security issues in the Midwestern region of the United States ahead of the high electricity demand expected this summer.”

Wright directed the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, in coordination with Consumers Energy to ensure that the 1,560 megawatt plant to “[remain] available for operation, minimizing any potential capacity shortfall that could lead to unnecessary power outages.”

“Today’s emergency order ensures that Michiganders and the greater Midwest region do not lose critical power generation capability as summer begins and electricity demand regularly reach high levels,” Wright said in a prepared news release.

The Energy Department said the emergency order, which is issued by the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, is authorized by Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act and is in accordance with President Trump’s Executive Order: Declaring a National Energy Emergency to ensure that power generation availability in the region does not “dip below 2024 capacity levels.”

“This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families. With President Trump’s leadership, the Energy Department is hard at work securing the American people access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy that powers their lives regardless of whether the wind is blowing, or the sun is shining.”

On May 14, Consumers officials said the planned May 31 closure of the Campbell plant remained on track. After Wright issued the emergency order on Friday, however, the company said it would comply.

“Consumers Energy plans to comply with the 90-day pause from the Department of Energy. We are reviewing the executive action and the overall impact on our company,” Katie Carey, director of media relations for Consumers, said in a Friday statement to ONN.

A long-debated topic

The emergency order came after a yearlong effort from a local grassroots organization petitioned Ottawa County officials to intervene in some way to prevent the closure of the Campbell plant.

Organizers of the “Save the Campbell” effort coalesced at the beginning of 2024 — mainly members of far-right fundamentalist groups such as Ottawa Impact, The Gideon 300 and the Ottawa County GOP — said a government-owned electric co-op was possible if voters approved a “home rule charter” at the ballot box.

The issue was never put up for a vote, so a change in government structure is not forthcoming; however, local officials asked Consumers for reassurance earlier this year that local energy supplies will be uninterrupted as the Campbell plant headed for closure at the end of May.

In February, the Ottawa County Board of Commissioners approved a resolution urging delay in the plant’s closure, however, officials stopped short April 22 of opting to bring litigation to prevent the closure altogether.

Commissioners pointed to two separate reports — from MISO as well as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC — that gave them concerns over the energy grid’s reliability once the Campbell is taken offline.

MISO published the results of its annual survey in June 2024, which indicated at the time that there was “a growing capacity deficit beginning in the 2025-26 planning year.”

“Next summer, MISO could see resource sufficiency ranging from a 2.7 GW capacity shortfall to a 1.1 GW surplus, underscoring the need to accelerate resource additions, monitor large load additions, and delay resource retirements to reliably manage the anticipated growth in electricity demand,” according to the survey.

NERC is a nonprofit international regulatory authority that more broadly looks at reliability standards as well as seasonal and long‐term outlooks for the entire U.S. grid. The group published a long-term reliability assessment in December 2024 that labeled MISO’s section of the grid as “high risk,” meaning the grid subsection that includes the state of Michigan “falls below established resource adequacy criteria in the next five years.”

“High-risk areas are likely to experience a shortfall in electricity supplies at the peak of an average summer or winter season. Extreme weather, producing wide-area heat waves or deep-freeze events, poses an even greater threat to reliability,” the report said.

Commissioner Jacob Bonnema questioned why Consumers opted to sunset the plant five years ahead than previously planned.

Dena Isabell, stakeholder engagement manager at Consumers, told commissioners in February that Consumers adopted in 2021 that helped the company identify about $600 million in savings for its customers over 20 years with the retirement of the plant.

“That includes renewables that get brought onto the grid, which are cheaper than what we have,” she said, “so that is a savings to our customers, which is part of the clean and affordable and reliable energy — so it’s an economic decision.”

One component of the cost savings was coal.

Rich Houtteman, community affairs manager for Consumers, explained to commissioners in February that the cost of shipping coal is a huge financial consideration for the energy company.

“It’s about $50 a ton to ship excess coal off-site,” he said. “We had 30,000 tons. That’s a lot for our customers. So we’re trying to burn up all the coal as we kind of bring in 130 train car loads a day.”

Consumers did not respond to an inquiry Friday evening on how much coal remained on the site.

A political talking point

OI Commissioner Allison Miedema — who strongly backed the county suing Consumers to prevent the Campbell closure — asked the utility company’s officials in February what new assets were being brought onto the grid.

Isabell pointed to renewables as well as natural gas assets.

“We do have a lot of renewables that are coming online, so that is very important to us,” she said. “We do have natural gas. We like natural gas. It is part of our future that we have — it is agile, it’s able to come online quickly, we can dispatch that in a matter of hours, versus a matter of days in the cold — so we see natural gas as part of our future.”

Isabell also noted wind and solar and battery storage, “which is going to be a major, major component and required by law, so we are going to be adding a ton of battery storage as well.”

After Isabell noted that the state’s new clean energy laws required energy companies to have clean and sustainable energy sources by 2040, OI Commissioner Sylvia Rhodea asked if the new Trump Administration’s policies could lead to a relaxation in Consumers’ plans.

“Is it possible we might see a change in that legislation that would lift those requirements? I’m just wondering if it could be slowed down if we’re not looking at deadlines until 2040,” Rhodea said.

Isabell said Consumers was committed to its clean energy plan in 2021 — before the legislation in Michigan was approved in 2023 — and that bringing massive assets like the Campbell on and off the grid is no simple or quick task.

“We do our best to try to be as agile as possible, but assets like this aren’t something that you can just bring on and take off very quickly,” she said. “So we do our best in these integrated resources plans to try to plan for what we think could be possible in the future. But we can’t plan for everything that could happen with any type of policy. So our plan to retire (Campbell) was on the last integrated resource plan, which does actually meet the new state policy, which works for us going forward.

“But large assets like that aren’t something that you can just quickly change with new policies in two years.”

The integrated resource plans are required by the Michigan Public Service Commission, a regulatory agency that oversees public utilities in Michigan.

“The Michigan Public Service Commission requires us to create a 20-year plan that says, ‘How are you going to serve your customer, clean, reliable and affordable energy for the next 20 years?’ And this requires us to come up with scenarios,” Isabell said.

Those scenarios are then presented to stakeholders in a series of workshops over two years with community stakeholders who then provide feedback to help.

“We’re retooling, and we’re getting ready to do our next integrated resource plan, new technologies, new laws, new things like that require us to be agile. We constantly need to update those plans and make sure that we’re giving our customers the best technology and the best cost we possibly can,” Isabell said.

How we got here

The Campbell Plant is Consumers’ last — and largest — coal-fired plant in the state.

The plant, operating since 1962, was originally scheduled to close partially in 2030 and wholly in 2040. But the utility announced in 2021 it was moving the plan up by 15 years for an operations end date of May 31, 2025.

The utility was seeking to end coal use altogether by 2025 as part of its goal to achieve carbon neutrality.

Since the announcement, Consumers has been actively preparing the plant for “full retirement,” a spokesperson said last year.

“The complex will officially go into retirement with an aim to go cold and dark after 2025,” said former Consumers spokesperson Kristen Van Kley. “In 2026 and on, the complex will be demolished with a plan to restore the site over time.”

The plant, when operating at full capacity, can generate 1,450 megawatts of electricity. Michigan consumed about 113,740 gigawatt hours of electricity in 2019, according to a 2020 report from the U.S. Department of Energy.

At the time, Van Kley said new technologies would ensure Consumers would be able to continue supporting the statewide grid.

“Energy efficiency, demand response and emerging technologies such as grid modernization and battery storage will help us lower peak customer demand for electricity and deliver exactly what Michigan needs,” she said. “Our plan is designed to respond to emerging needs, adapt to changing conditions and embrace emerging innovative technologies as we work to achieve net zero carbon emissions.”

Key to that strategy are natural gas-fired plants in Consumers’ portfolio, Van Kley said, which include locations in Zeeland, Jackson and a 1,200-megawatt facility that began operating in Van Buren County’s Covert Township in June 2023.

Those operations “will supply reliable, on-demand electricity to meet Michigan’s energy needs when renewables and other sources are not available,” Van Kley said.

Meanwhile, efforts continue to restart operations at Palisades Nuclear Power Plant in Covert Township. The facility, owned by New Jersey-based Holtec International, went offline for decommissioning in May 2022.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-86/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/screenshot-2025-05-24-0652591748084302.png?h=e9fb820e&itok=hbXDWXMO,N,,2025-05-25 03:02:27.601852

After months of stating the intention to remove clean-vehicle tax credits, Republican House members have passed a version of President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" that could potentially decimate electric vehicle sales in America. If passed into law, the bill would cut subsidies for battery manufacturing and remove incentives for purchasing electrified vehicles.

Specifically, the bill would phase out the Clean Vehicle Credit, first put in place under President Barack Obama and expanded in the Biden administration through the Inflation Reduction Act. Currently, buyers of hybrid and electric cars can get $7500 off qualified new vehicles with restrictions based on vehicle price and household income.

After They're Gone

In addition to removing the clean-vehicle credits, the bill would add new registration fees for hybrid and electric vehicles as a stand-in for fuel taxes. Hybrid vehicles would become subject to a new $100 registration fee, while electric vehicles would add a $250 annual fee. Combined with the removal of clean-vehicle credits, the new registration fees would help to significantly raise the cost of electric vehicle ownership.

A Princeton University study cited by the New York Times alleges that, should Republicans succeed in repealing the incentives, electric vehicle sales will make up just 24 percent of new car sales in 2030 in the U.S. If incentives remain in place, EV's are projected to make up 40 percent of new car sales by the same year.",https://images.platforum.cloud/logos/prologuedrivers_com_profile.png,N,,2025-05-24 17:07:09.143246

The world is drowning in plastic, but companies like PepsiCo and Coca-Cola are focused on one thing only — profits.","As You Sow is a non-profit organization whose role is to “harness shareholder power to create lasting change and align investments with values. Our mission is to promote environmental and social corporate responsibility through shareholder advocacy, coalition building, and innovative legal strategies. Our vision is a safe, just, and sustainable world in which protecting the environment and human rights is central to corporate decision making.” One of its core initiatives is reducing plastic waste from companies like PepsiCo and Coca-Cola.

Sounds simple enough. What it really comes down to is encouraging shareholders to steer the corporations they invest in toward sustainable business practices that support a circular economy. As my colleague Carolyn Fortuna has written, As You Sow uses “shareholder resolutions and dialogue to alter a company’s practices and behavior. This tactic is known in the investment industry as ‘engagement’ to prod companies into increasing environmental responsibility.”

In December 2022, As You Sow successfully concluded an agreement with PepsiCo to double the amount of zero waste packaging it uses. In a press release, As You Sow announced the company would boost its reusable delivery systems by expanding its SodaStream business in homes and workplaces and by increasing its use of refillable plastic and glass bottles in selected markets. In addition, it would find new ways to ensure more fountain drinks are served in reusable cups, and offer more of its products such as Gatorade as powders and concentrates.

“The pledge was made in response to a shareholder proposal filed by As You Sow, asking the company to report on actions it could take to rapidly reduce dependence on single-use plastic packaging, with a suggested focus on setting stronger refillables goals. In March, the company agreed to set a goal by the end of 2022 for a percentage of beverages to be delivered via strategies that avoid or minimize single-use packaging,” As You Sow proclaimed.

PepsiCo Reneges

In a press release on May 22, 2025, PepsiCo announced it was “updating its packaging goals to focus on key markets where it believes its efforts can make the most positive impact and to better account for external factors outside of the company’s control. By prioritizing efforts in key packaging markets, continuing work to reduce its use of virgin plastic and improve the design of its packaging, PepsiCo plans to focus on investments that aim to improve the packaging lifecycle.”

Here’s the kicker. “The company is also sunsetting its reuse target, while continuing various efforts on reuse as part of its goal around designing packaging to be reusable, recyclable or compostable.” Sunsetting is corporate speak for abandoning. In other words, that agreement with As You Sow is no longer operative. Why? The company’s own words tell the tale.

“The revised goals on climate, packaging, agriculture and water also reflect PepsiCo’s understanding of where it can accelerate impact — striving for greater return on its investments — and where progress will take more time, based on the realities of key global enablers such as recycling and reuse infrastructure, electric grid modernization, electric vehicle charging infrastructure and cost-competitive vehicle availability, and varying and changing government approaches. (Emphasis added.) These refined goals reflect transparency about challenges, while reinforcing a commitment to rigorous progress tracking to pursue the company’s long-term sustainability vision.”

CleanTechnica readers will immediately decode the message contained in this statement. The current administration is taking a sledgehammer to the tax credits contained in the Inflation Reduction Act that would promote the use of electric vehicles in the company”s distribution network and the charging infrastructure needed to support them. “Varying and changing government approaches” really gives the game away.

Elections have consequences. The current administration has sent a strong signal to the business community that all the “woke” nonsense about sustainability that has been part of the conversation since the Paris Climate Accords of 2015 can now be safely ignored. But it’s more than that. It has been made abundantly clear that corporations that persist in promoting such goals will be punished.

As You Sow Speaks Out

We got an email this week from Ryon Harms at As You Sow concerning PepsiCo’s about face on reducing its pledge to use more reusable and refillable packaging and more recycled materials. Those two commitments were made by the company following the filing and subsequent withdrawal of shareholder proposals by As You Sow in 2021 and 2022. The email said the company had abandoned the reuse goal altogether and weakened the virgin plastics reduction goal without specifically stating why, citing vague “external factors” and “systemic barriers.”

“In the absence of a credible explanation, this appears to be an opportunistic move, in a deregulating political environment, to abandon the hard work necessary to seriously tackle growing plastic pollution through reusables,” said Conrad MacKerron, senior vice president of As You Sow. “Shareholders expect companies to keep their commitments regardless of which way the political winds are blowing. Politics eventually change direction and companies that abandon their goals can easily fall behind on crucial commitments aimed at stemming plastic pollution.”

“As You Sow is deeply disappointed in this unexpected action by PepsiCo,” added Kelly McBee, circular economy manager at As You Sow. “The move appears counterintuitive to the company’s previous leadership in tackling plastic pollution and its PEP+ program to operate within planetary boundaries.”

The groundbreaking study in 2020 entitled Breaking the Plastic Wave concluded that recycling alone is insufficient to address plastic pollution. Instead, it must be coupled with reductions in use, materials redesign, and substitution through reusables. “PepsiCo’s decision to abandon reuse targets and scale back plastic reduction efforts calls into question whether the company is heeding the call to invest in a future of circular packaging — which conserves resources and reduces waste — or if it is instead embracing the wasteful status quo of take-make-waste,” the email said.

“Global governments are rapidly adopting policies holding corporations like PepsiCo financially accountable for packaging at its end-of-life, a policy known as extended producer responsibility (EPR.) In the U.S., seven producer responsibility laws for packaging have been enacted since 2021. These policies are designed to financially incentivize reusable and refillable packaging — making PepsiCo’s de-prioritization of these packaging formats increasingly out of step with evolving regulatory and market expectations. Furthermore, the forthcoming international adoption of a Global Plastics Treaty is expected to similarly emphasize plastic reduction and reusable alternatives, making it imperative that PepsiCo follow through on its goals,” the message from As You Sow explained.

As You Sow’s message pointed out the course change by PepsiCo followed a similar move by Coca-Cola six months ago. As a result, no portfolio-wide reuse goal is currently in effect among any of the 225 largest consumer-facing corporations with business operations in North America, according to As You Sow’s research report Plastic Promises Scorecard. The absence of reuse goals among leading corporations signals a dangerous retreat from circular economy principles and threatens to derail corporate progress on plastic pollution just as momentum is building.

A Call To Action

“We call on PepsiCo and its peer companies to uphold their responsibility to significantly reduce plastic pollution and contribute to the development of a circular economy for packaging–not only when it’s politically convenient, but especially when leadership is needed. Transformative change demands vision and resilience — not only when it’s politically convenient, but especially when leadership is needed. Transformative change demands vision and resilience,” Conrad MacKerron said.

The world is drowning in plastic, but companies like PepsiCo and Coca-Cola are focused on one thing only — profits. The US administration has absolved the corporate world of any requirement to be good corporate citizens. If you are a private citizen and dump used motor oil in the woods, you face legal consequences. But if you are a large multi-national corporation, you are excused from all responsibility for the harm your business does to the environment. The message is clear: If your activities will harm the Earth, first make sure you are incorporated. Then you will be free to proceed with impunity.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Microplastic.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 16:05:06.664172

Water utilities were instructed to use a “hazard index” to monitor a sixth chemical, called PFBS, as well as mixtures of the chemicals.
The Trump EPA said it would keep the PFOA and PFOS drinking water limits but give utilities until 2031 to comply with them, instead of 2029.
Putting these filtration systems into place will thankfully sweep up more PFAS than just PFOA and PFOS, Jones said.
The release contains no further information about what this would entail, but Jones worries it could allow water utilities to circumvent the federal government’s water quality requirements altogether.","Last week, environmental groups decried plans from the Environmental Protection Agency to rescind and “reconsider” drinking water limits for four per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, compounds linked to cancer and damage to the immune and endocrine systems, among other health effects.

The limits had been finalized by Joe Biden’s administration last April as part of an effort to limit people’s exposure to hazardous “forever chemicals.” Out of a total of more than 10,000 known PFAS, they targeted just six of the most concerning ones. The Trump administration’s EPA said it would retain the limits for two of the PFAS but give utilities more time to comply with them and scrap the others. One advocate called the EPA’s move a loss for public health and a “victory for chemical companies.”

But how protective were the Biden regulations to begin with? And how much of a difference will it make to pare them back?

On the one hand, experts agree that backtracking is not in the public’s interest. Virtually everyone has PFAS coursing through their veins, and specific kinds like PFOS and PFOA are known or likely to contribute to kidney and testicular cancers. The other compounds originally regulated by the Biden administration have been linked to elevated cholesterol, heart disease, and an increased risk of diabetes.

The chemicals have become so ubiquitous in people and the environment because of their use in everything from outdoor clothing to cooking utensils and food packaging. Runoff from firefighting foam, infused with the chemicals, has contributed to widespread drinking water contamination, along with manufacturers’ deliberate dumping of the chemicals into rivers — despite knowing about their health risks.

Once they’re created, PFAS don’t break down naturally; hence the moniker “forever chemicals.” Regulating them is an “important win,” experts have said, one that “allows the country to begin cleaning up the mess in its water.”

But the fight over drinking water limits for individual PFAS distracts from the larger context that there are thousands of types, and scientists suspect they all have similar health effects. Even last year, when the Biden administration first announced its national drinking water standards, scientists criticized it for addressing PFAS on a chemical-by-chemical basis. “The EPA is trying to regulate six forever chemicals. Just 10,000 to go,” as the title of an op-ed by one Harvard researcher put it.

Erik Olson, a senior strategist for the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the U.S. is “stuck in a Whac-a-Mole game” with PFAS, in which only the best researched compounds are regulated. Lesser-known compounds may be just as toxic — thanks to their similar chemical structures — but escape regulations just because they haven’t been studied, he added. “What we need to do is control PFAS as a class.”

Of the six forever chemicals targeted by the Biden administration’s original policy, PFOA and PFOS are the most prevalent and, consequently, they’ve been researched the most extensively. Those compounds got the strictest drinking water limits of 4 parts per trillion, the lowest level at which they can be detected, reflecting scientists’ understanding that there is no safe exposure level for them. Three additional compounds — PFNA, PFHxS, and GenX — were given a contamination limit of 10 parts per trillion. Water utilities were instructed to use a “hazard index” to monitor a sixth chemical, called PFBS, as well as mixtures of the chemicals.

The Trump EPA said it would keep the PFOA and PFOS drinking water limits but give utilities until 2031 to comply with them, instead of 2029. The rules for the other four compounds will be scrapped and reevaluated. The EPA said it intends to finalize its replacement regulations by next spring.

A statement from EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the extended timeline for PFOA and PFOS would provide “common-sense flexibility” to utilities, some of which sued the EPA over its regulations last year. The utilities said the EPA’s new rule was too strict and would cause unreasonable compliance costs.

A spokesperson for the EPA told Grist that the process by which the agency had “promulgated the preliminary regulatory determinations simultaneously with the proposed regulation” for PFNA, PFHxS, GenX, and PFBS under the Biden administration “was inappropriate and may not comply with the statutory requirements of [the] Safe Drinking Water Act.” With regard to the rescissions, they said that “while EPA cannot predetermine the outcome, it is possible” that the agency will issue more stringent requirements this spring.

Daniel Jones, an emeritus professor of molecular biology at Michigan State University, said the impacts of the Trump administration’s reversal will depend on geography. Communities primarily affected by PFOS and PFOA may not be greatly affected, since the standards for those chemicals remain in place — albeit with an extended timeline for compliance. To meet the standards, water utilities will likely have to install something like an activated carbon filtration system, he said, which is effective at removing “long-chain” PFAS like PFOA and PFOS, which have a larger chemical structure than compounds like GenX.

Putting these filtration systems into place will thankfully sweep up more PFAS than just PFOA and PFOS, Jones said.

States like North Carolina, Ohio, and West Virginia, however, face disproportionate contamination from GenX due to production facilities concentrated there. This contamination could continue unabated if the standard for the compound is eliminated. According to Olson, some of the technologies that remove PFOS and PFOA are not as effective at attracting GenX. “To really control the full suite of PFAS, we need to go to more advanced technologies like tight membranes, like reverse osmosis,” he said.

Some water utilities may opt for these more advanced — and expensive — technologies if they believe that they will eventually be required to test for and limit a much larger number of PFAS, Olson added.

Although Jones is disappointed that the EPA intends to drop regulations for the four PFAS, he said he is more concerned about a single clause in the EPA’s press release, about the EPA’s intent to establish a “federal exemption framework” for the PFOS and PFOA limits. The release contains no further information about what this would entail, but Jones worries it could allow water utilities to circumvent the federal government’s water quality requirements altogether. “It seems that an exemption framework is likely to open the door to say, ‘This is going to cost too much, you don’t have to do it,’” he said.

The EPA spokesperson said exemptions would not allow utilities to violate regulations: “Rather, they allow additional time to find a compliance solution.”

Jones also raised concerns about funding for further PFAS research, including investigations on how exposure to mixtures of the chemicals may impact human health. One of his federal grants for PFAS research was recently cut by the Trump administration, he said, and a colleague at Michigan State University studying PFAS on farms has also had his funding rescinded.

In addition to regulating PFAS by groups or as a class, Jones said the EPA should set pollution standards using what’s known as the “precautionary principle,” which doesn’t require definitive evidence about a chemical’s harms before it can be regulated. “In some countries, if you want to release a chemical into the environment you have to show it’s safe,” he said. “The U.S. usually takes the opposite approach and says, ‘You can use these chemicals … and if we find that there’s a problem, then we’ll come up and regulate [them].’”

Olson believes the EPA’s alterations to the PFAS rules are in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act’s “anti-backsliding provision,” which says any revision the EPA proposes to a drinking water standard must be at least as protective of public health as the previous one. The law also caps compliance timelines at five years, whereas postponing the PFOS and PFOA compliance deadline to 2031 would give water utilities seven years.

“Ultimately, we need to be phasing these chemicals out,” Olson added. “We have to turn off the spigot and stop using these things so that five generations from now, our great-great-great grandchildren won’t be dealing with them.”

“For the White House to be saying, ‘Oh, climate change is not real.","From our collaborating partner Living on Earth, public radio’s environmental news magazine, an interview by Jenni Doering with David Cash, the former England Administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

A new White House memo instructs federal agencies to disregard the economic impacts of climate change in their regulations and permitting decisions, unless explicitly required by law.

This metric is known as the “social cost of carbon,” and it has been used for decades as a way to guide policy so that it takes into account the economic realities of our changing climate.

Even in the first Trump administration, the White House used the metric, though they put it only around $5 a ton at the time, far lower than the Obama Administration estimate of $42 a ton. In the Biden White House, a recalculation factored in inflation and the worsening toll of climate change, bumping up the cost to nearly $200 per ton.

David Cash served under President Biden as the New England Administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

JENNI DOERING: Let’s start by breaking down what this phrase means, the “social cost of carbon.” What is this all about?

DAVID CASH: This is a little bit on the wonky side of things, but really, really important and very different than a lot of the other things that we’ve seen this administration doing in turning back the climate clock in terms of freezing federal funding and changing regulations.

Social cost of carbon means, basically, if we don’t stop climate change, what are the costs that we all feel because of climate change? In other words, what are the costs because of the increased chance of wildfires or coastal flooding or drought? When the government regulates industry polluters for doing things, it has to justify taking actions, and that justification is based on what happens if industry is not regulated. Government doesn’t want to regulate industry just because it’s fun to regulate industry. We regulate industry to protect people, because industry will sometimes take actions that don’t take into account the cost of doing business, and what that cost has on people.

DOERING: Just ignoring what’s happening doesn’t make the problem go away.

CASH: Not at all. I have a quick little metaphor that maybe can help people understand.

In the 1960s and ‘70s, it became more and more obvious that if you drove a car without seatbelts and you got into an accident, you were much more likely to get hurt, to have injuries, to have deaths, and there was a large cost to a car company not putting in seat belts. Of course, there was a cost to the company to add the seat belts. It cost money. It would cost the consumer money.

But the government did the analysis, and it showed that actually it was incredibly cheap to put in these seat belts. The benefits were huge, the reduction of injuries and costs, and even to local municipalities, for their police departments, fire departments and emergency responders—all of those costs would go down.

That’s exactly what the role of regulation should be: to protect the public from actions that industry takes that they don’t put in their bottom line. Regulations force them to put it in their bottom line, and that’s exactly what we’re trying to do with climate change.

DOERING: Let’s talk about the numbers. The Trump administration is looking to bring this cost to zero. What do our best estimates say that the cost actually is in comparison?

CASH: In the Biden administration, it was up to $190 per ton. So what that means is that, on average, if a ton of carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere through cars or through a power plant, it would cost about $190 in terms of damage.

You could see how that $190 [per ton] could add up pretty quickly. Analysis from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration last year showed impacts of at least $180 billion [in the U.S.], and that’s taking into account the impacts of floods and drought and wildfires and things like that. That’s what the cost of carbon is supposed to capture.

By the way, industries all over the country are taking this into account. You might have read in the news about how insurance is much, much harder to get now in California and Florida and other places that are hit by climate change really hard, and that’s because the insurance companies have to take into account those costs. They’re real. For the White House to be saying, ‘Oh, climate change is not real. It doesn’t cost anything,’ is outrageous.

DOERING: The Trump administration has said there’s just so much uncertainty in how much carbon dioxide costs society that it’s not even worth counting. What’s your response?

CASH: Of course there’s uncertainty. This is a dynamic, changing landscape, and our understanding changes. But if government never made decisions because there was uncertainty, government would never make decisions because there’s always uncertainty.

The key in wise governance is how you take into account those uncertainties. When you make your decisions, you acknowledge them, and then you invest in science to reduce those uncertainties. But guess what the White House is also doing: It’s reducing its investment in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s science. It’s getting rid of EPA science efforts to study climate change. So uncertainties will not be diminished; in fact, they’re even reducing things like hurricane forecasting. States and municipalities all over this country use those forecasts to prepare for the next big hit. The Trump administration is taking away that information as well.

“For the White House to be saying, ‘Oh, climate change is not real. It doesn’t cost anything,’ is outrageous.”

DOERING: What might a social cost of carbon of “zero” mean in the real world when it comes to projects that the federal government is considering?

CASH: It would allow the EPA, for example, to diminish the effectiveness of regulations so that cars could pollute more, factories could pollute more. Gas plants and coal plants could produce more. All of which would increase the chance of greater storms, greater flooding, greater wildfires, greater drought, greater incidence of incredibly hot days in the summer where people will get more cases of asthma, more respiratory disease—all of those kinds of things. It will have a real world impact.

A year from now, you could go into hospitals and see an uptick in asthma in emergency room visits. I live in New England, and about a year or so ago we had the wildfires that were sending smoke from Canada to the Boston area. In all of New England, we saw an uptick of emergency room asthma cases, kids coming in because of that. We’ll see more of that.

DOERING: Deadly particulate matter kills something like 300,000 people in the U.S. alone every year. According to the World Health Organization, it’s coming from wildfires. It’s coming from smokestacks, tailpipes. To what extent does the social cost of carbon or another metric capture that societal toll?

CASH: When EPA regulates, it takes into account all of the different pollutants. Particulates are one of the most important because they have such an on-the-ground impact on people’s ability to breathe, so regulations do capture that.

The memo from the White House that said it was going to count the social cost of carbon as zero does not at this point impact particulates, but we know that that’s coming. We know there’s going to be relaxing of the standards that protect people’s health and protect the ecosystems upon which we all depend.

DOERING: What do you think people need to keep in mind when they hear a story like this coming out of the current federal government?

CASH: I think they have to figure out how to speak out when they hear news like this, and understand that what this administration is doing is making their environment not as safe for them, and that will have an impact on their family, that will have an impact on their community, that will have an impact on their farms.

A kind of interesting sidebar is that when the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that they were going to cut their climate forecasting, farming associations got very concerned and complained a lot, so they reinstated them.

So we all have to be vigilant to protect the science and the wonky regulatory things like the social cost of carbon. We have to protect those so that our families are protected.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2150753989-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 15:06:23.500874

According to reporting by The New York Times, a copy of the draft proposal was sent to the White House on May 2 and may be released for public comment in June.

The document marks a reversal in regulatory approach from prior Biden-era EPA actions, including a 2024 rule that imposed new emissions restrictions on coal-fired plants.

The draft reportedly says carbon dioxide emissions from US power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution or climate change, citing the declining share of global emissions represented by the US power sector. Eliminating these emissions would not produce a measurable improvement in public health or welfare.

Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy has been developing a regulatory framework for carbon management, focusing on carbon capture, utilization, and storage and carbon offset projects.

In 2023, Gov. Mike Dunleavy proposed carbon management and monetization legislation to enable the Department of Natural Resources to regulate carbon offset and sequestration projects on state lands. These legislation allows private companies to lease state lands for carbon offsets (keeping lands undeveloped) or store CO2 underground for permanent sequestration or enhanced oil recovery, particularly in the Cook Inlet basin, estimated to have a 50-gigaton CO2 storage capacity. The target for this monetization is Asia, with countries like Japan looking to buy carbon storage to meet international climate goals set by globalists.

Alaska also submitted a climate action plan (renamed Sustainable Energy Action Plan) to the EPA in 2024 under the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program, focusing on renewable energy expansion and energy efficiency (e.g., heat pumps, home weatherization, and hydroelectric projects like Bradley Lake). The plan avoids direct regulation of oil and gas emissions but emphasizes reducing emissions from energy use.

The Trump Administration policy shift, if enacted, could have far-reaching consequences for the burgeoning carbon credit market, which relies heavily on emissions limits to drive demand for offsets. Such credits are typically purchased by companies seeking to comply with emissions regulations or to voluntarily meet environmental, social, and governance (ESG) targets.

By removing the regulatory cap on emissions from major polluters, the EPA could reduce the pressure on utilities and industrial firms to purchase offsets, dampening demand in both compliance and voluntary markets.

The move may also shift the center of gravity for carbon market activity from the federal level to states like California and Washington, which maintain their own cap-and-trade systems. These programs could gain new prominence as firms seek alternative venues for regulatory certainty and emissions accountability.

The new EPA direction is almost certain to bring lawsuits and fierce opposition from environmental groups and Democrat lawmakers, many of whom championed the 2024 EPA rules.

At that time, the EPA projected that its regulations would prevent up to 1,200 premature deaths annually and reduce thousands of cases of asthma and hospitalizations related to air pollution. Now, the EPA says there is no data to support that claim.

Power plant operators, many of which have already made major investments in emissions reductions and carbon trading strategies, may find themselves caught between diverging state and federal priorities.

Alaska’s carbon sequestration framework relies on market-driven demand for carbon storage. A federal rollback of emissions limits could weaken demand for carbon storage services, as power plants (especially coal- and gas-fired) would face no federal mandate to reduce CO2 emissions.

This could reduce revenue potential for Alaska’s carbon storage projects, undermining the economic viability of the DNR’s leasing program.

Before the new EPA rule can take place, it must go through public comment period and could be revised. The topic is sure to come up during Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s Sustainable Energy Conference in Anchorage in June, when the head of the EPA Lee Zeldin, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum are scheduled to attend.",https://mustreadalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-20-at-9.51.07-AM.png,N,,2025-05-24 19:08:59.422025

While growth of the U.S. EV market stumbled in 2024 with only 7% growth from 2023, another side of the clean energy sector – Solar and Energy Storage – have shown another record year and promise even more for the rest of the decade despite. In 2024, residential and commercial-scale Solar were the largest contributor to new grid capacity with 50GW installed – a 21% increase from 2023; U.S. utility-scale battery capacity grew by 66% in 2024, reaching 26GW, with expected two-digit percent CAGR in the coming years. According to EIA, solar and energy storage will lead to new US utility-scale generating capacity going online in 2025 (Figure 1).

The rapid growth of solar and energy storage has been boosted in recent years by significant cost reductions, technological improvements, expanding demand for cheap electricity from manufacturing facilities and datacenters, and a vast flow of private investments driven by tax equity funding structures complemented with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) transferable tax credits, established in 2022.

The median cost of installed solar PV system in the US has dropped by 3-4 times (Figure 2). Together with advanced capacity factors, the average LCOE (levelized cost of energy) has dropped by 85% since 2010, now being cheaper than energy from any traditional fuel sources (Figure 3). Similarly, according to Bloomberg NEF, battery energy storage turnkey prices in China have dropped by 43% in 2024, pushing the global market down.

Total business and consumer investment in renewables and cleantech manufacturing already reached $493B according to Deloitte, largely instigated by Federal IRA policies with total claimed tax credits expected to reach $800B-$1.2T in 2022-2032.

The funding vehicle energizing this recent surge of investments lays in the intersection of a traditional tax equity project financing and recently established transferability of the key IRA tax credits – §45 Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit (PTC) and §48E Clean Energy Investment Tax Credits (ITC).

Tax Equity Financing originated in the United States decades ago and, over time, became a successful model for project financing of renewable energy projects. Through this financing model, investors who have high tax liabilities can put their money into otherwise too long-term or low return projects (such as renewable energy) in return for tax benefits that are channeled to them from a project entity (normally a pass-through LLC – Figure 3). Typical tax equity investors include large financial institutions, insurance companies, and corporations who are looking to use their tax liabilities to fund sustainable projects.

Figure 1. U.S. planned utility-scale generating additions (2025)

Figure 2. Median Installed PV System Price in the U.S.($/W)

Figure 3. Average Unsubsidized LCOE in the U.S. ($/MWh)

PTCs and ITCs are also not a new phenomenon and first originated in Energy Policy Acts of 1992 and 2005 respectively. The 2022 IRA not only expanded the eligibility of projects but also added a key feature – transferability of tax credits – a way to monetize tax credits even when the project company does not have any tax liabilities to offset. Transferability allows taxpayers to sell all, or a portion, of tax credits to another completely unrelated eligible taxpayer. The cash proceeds for the seller as well as savings from purchased tax credits for the buyer are not considered gross income and, as such, not subject to federal taxes.

Since 2022, when IRA was passed, the market for IRA tax credits has evolved. The buyers are both for-profit companies that want to offset their tax liability and banks for which purchasing clean energy tax credits is a way to both minimize own taxes but also a vehicle to finance renewable energy projects that otherwise would not meet their investment and credit risk-profile. The biggest incentive for the buyers to enter the market is immediate savings from purchasing transferable tax credits at a discount to the nominal value. For example, a bank can buy $500M worth of tax credits for $475M, at 5% discount, saving $25M which are also not subject to taxes. Depending on the risk profile of the project, as well as balance of supply and demand, credits can be traded at $0.93-$0.95 range for lower risk profile, while more complex deals may require higher discounts. All else equal, PTCs are generally more secure since they do not pose a recapture risk compared to ITCs.

Figure 3. Example of a project with tax equity investor

Despite some of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) credits being at risk of cancellation (such as consumer 30D credit), transferable §45 PTC and §48 PTC are likely to stay and continue driving investments in a mix of renewable projects. Since 2022, these credits have driven employment, more resilient local electric grids, and cheaper energy sources. Currently, there are 41 states with solar or battery manufacturing facilities − which ensures bipartisan support at a local and state level.

Financing renewable energy projects presents several challenges: substantial upfront investments, long payback periods and low returns (which cut off a bult of traditional financiers), regulatory and policy risks, and finally technological and operational risks. Tax equity financing structures are designed to maximize benefits of IRA tax credits, as well as leverage bonus depreciation and accelerated depreciation schedules (MACRS), and to allocate roles and risks among the stakeholders – Developers, Sponsors, Project Beneficiaries, Tax Equity Investors, and Lenders. Risk-reward allocation is key to expand investor pull and make such long-term investments attractive.

Common legal structures in tax equity financing include:

Partnership Flips: Initially, tax equity investors receive most tax benefits (e.g. 95-99%) and cash flows until a target return is achieved, after which the ownership structure “flips,” granting the sponsor a larger share.

Sale-Leasebacks: The developer sells the project to a tax equity investor and leases it back, allowing the developer to operate the project while the investor utilizes the tax benefits.

Inverted Leases: The tax equity investor leases the project from the developer, enabling the investor to claim tax benefits while the developer retains ownership.

The final typical returns on investment for tax equity investors consists of several items:

ITC tax credits

Depreciation deductions reducing tax liability

Cash payments as fixed interest return

Cash buyout at exit (typically 5 years after the investment which allows to capture the fully vested ITC)

While most projects are not public, several notable renewable energy projects have utilized tax equity financing:

VF Corporation’s Solar Investment: In July 2022, VF Corporation initiated the largest renewable energy tax equity investment, funding the development of four utility-scale solar projects in South Carolina, anticipated to generate 47GWh of renewable energy per year.

Cimarron Bend Wind Farm: This 599 MW wind farm in Kansas was financed through tax equity agreements with U.S. financial institutions, including Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan Chase, and MetLife.

BrightNight and Cordelio Power Solar: 300MW solar project in Arizona with $260M tax-equity financing provided by J.P Morgan affiliate and Capital One, announced in 2024.

Tax equity and transferrable tax credits proved resilient and efficient way of driving investments in capital intensive industries and, hopefully, will stay a unique feature of the U.S. investment landscape as it drives funds into small and large projects across the country.

US President Donald Trump has embraced geothermal energy under the protective mantle of his “American Energy Dominance” plan, perhaps assuming that the nation’s renewable geothermal resources are somewhat limited in scope, posing little or no threat to his pals in the fossil energy industry. Guess again…

Enhanced Geothermal Energy Systems Are Coming For Your Fossil Fuels

To be fair, it is easy to underestimate the future role of geothermal energy in the US. Only a handful of geothermal power plants are in operation today, all located west of the Rocky Mountains in spots where the ideal combination of heat, rock, and water exists by circumstance of Mother Nature.

The great moment of derp has arrived, however. The US Department of Energy has been supporting innovators working on enhanced geothermal systems that are more flexible as to location. The general idea is to create human-made geothermal reservoirs within rock formations, deploying technology borrowed from the oil and gas industry (see more enhanced geothermal background here).

Don’t get too excited just yet. The enhanced geothermal field is just beginning to shift gears from the R&D phase into marketable power generation systems. Still, they are getting closer. The all-important drilling time factor has been compressed to cut costs, and the US Air Force is among those investing in demonstration projects to kick the activity up a notch.

The Nevada Geothermal Bonanza

That brings us to the news about Nevada. The US Geological Survey, which never makes headlines, grabbed some media attention last week when it posted a provisional assessment of geothermal energy potential in the Great Basin region, which covers most of Nevada. According to USGS, the upper six kilometers (about 3. 7 miles) of the Earth’s crust within the Great Basin could yield 135 gigawatts of geothermal-sourced electricity, equivalent to about 10% of the nation’s current generating capacity.

That’s quite a turnaround from the current status of geothermal energy, which currently accounts for less than 1% of the nation’s generating capacity. “This estimate is a potential substantial increase of the installed geothermal electricity-generating capacity from <1 to 10 percent of current total U.S. power production capacity,” USGS emphasizes.

Before you get too excited — again — the key words are “estimate” and “provisional.” USGS also advises that the survey zeroed in on high temperature, low-permeability rock formations. Reading between the lines, those are not ideal conditions for conventional geothermal power plants.

“If sufficient technological advances to commercialize enhanced geothermal systems occur, then a current best provisional estimate for electric-power generation capacity of 135 gigawatts electric are available from the upper 6 kilometers of the Earth’s crust,” USGS affirmed, reminding everyone that the enhanced geothermal field still has some R&D work to do.

Science Strikes Again

If you’re wondering why nobody ever knew about this before, that’s a good question. USGS targeted the Great Basin for analysis because they already knew that some promising geothermal resources were down there, somewhere. They just didn’t know how much. For the new analysis, they leveraged new underground mapping technology along with AI and machine learning, which did not exist back in the 1870s when USGS was formed with the task of spotting energy and energy-related resources, including critical minerals as well as geothermal energy resources and groundwater.

In a press release explaining the report, USGS appeared optimistic about the prospects for commercial-level enhanced geothermal systems to emerge, but they re-emphasized that the technology is not ready for prime time yet, at least not on a mass adoption scale.

“The new assessment … depends on widespread commercial-scale development and continued successful application of evolving and emerging technologies, many of which have been developed over the past several decades in the geothermal and oil and gas industries,” USGS explained.

Geothermal Energy To Hydropower: Hold My Beer

Geothermal energy is not the only renewable resource that made its way into the “American Energy Dominance” plan. Biomass and hydropower are also included. Sure enough, the Trump administration eventually greenlit an Energy Department loan guarantee for a new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) operation in Montana that had been issued during former President Biden’s final weeks in office.

Opportunities to expand hydropower are limited by the number of suitable waterways in the US. Though, pumped storage projects and upgrades to existing dams are two possibilities. As for brand new hydropower dams, industry stakeholders will have to balance the cost and timeline of major new water infrastructure projects against the risk of drought and other uncertainties in the age of climate change.

Geothermal energy is both insulated from climate risks and amenable to a wider range of locations, and the USGS has just barely begun to explore the possibilities. The Great Basin analysis is just the first among a whole series of assessments planned by USGS deploying the latest mapping technology.

“The Energy Act of 2020 directed the USGS to assess the entire nation’s potential for geothermal energy. To conduct the assessment the USGS and partners created new heat flow maps, new underground temperature maps, and new methods to estimate energy extraction efficiency and conversion of heat to electricity,” USGS explains.

The Geothermal Energy Boom Is All Trump’s Fault

Speaking of irony, the Energy Act of 2020 was signed into law by President Trump himself. “Congress passed the Energy Act of 2020 as part of the fiscal year 2021 omnibus appropriations bill which President Trump signed into law on Dec. 27,” notes a handy explainer from the National Conference of State Legislatures.

“Overall, the bill prioritizes research, development, and demonstration across a broad spectrum of energy technologies within the Department of Energy (DOE),” NCSL recapped, adding that “the Department of Interior is directed to procure at least 25 gigawatts of solar, wind, and geothermal production on public lands by 2025.”

In an interesting turn of events, for his second term in office, Trump chose Chris Wright, the CEO of the leading oilfield services firm Liberty Energy, to helm the Energy Department. Liberty was scouting new opportunities to apply its drilling know-how to the enhanced geothermal energy field during Wright’s tenure there.

Back in 2022, Liberty invested $10 million in the enhanced geothermal energy startup Fervo Energy, which went on to nail down an additional stake of $224 million earlier this year from other investors, including another leading oilfield firm, Devon Energy.

Whatever happened to the Energy Policy Act of 2020? Isn’t it still there? If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread. Better yet, find your representatives in Congress and let them know what you think.

Meanwhile, USGS is soldiering on. Now that they have finished the preliminary work on the Great Basin, they are heading off to North Dakota to see what the Williston Basin has to offer.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nevada-geothermal-energy-usgs.png,N,,2025-05-24 13:08:40.778134

By MATTHEW DALY – Associated Press

WASHINGTON (AP) — The head of the Environmental Protection Agency clashed with Democratic senators Wednesday, accusing one of being an “aspiring fiction writer” and saying another does not “care about wasting money.” Democrats countered that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s tenure will likely mean more Americans contracting lung cancer and other illnesses.

The heated exchanges, at a Senate hearing to discuss President Donald Trump’s proposal to slash the agency’s budget in half, showed the sharp partisan differences over Zeldin’s deregulatory approach. Zeldin, a former Republican congressman, has said his tenure will turbocharge the American economy while ensuring clean air and water. Democrats say he is endangering the lives of millions of Americans and abandoning the agency’s dual mission to protect the environment and human health.

Zeldin, who took office in January, has proposed a flood of changes that would sharply reduce the agency’s workforce, terminate billions of dollars in grants approved by the Biden administration and roll back dozens of environmental rules including landmark regulations on climate change and pollution from coal-fired power plants.Sharp words, back and forth

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told Zeldin that a plan to cut EPA spending by 55% means that, to Zeldin and Trump, “more than half of the environmental efforts of the EPA … to make sure Americans have clean air and clean water are just a waste.” If approved by Congress, the budget cuts “will mean there’s more diesel and more other particulate matter in the air” and that “water that Americans drink is going to have more chemicals,” Schiff said.

“Your legacy will be more lung cancer,” he told Zeldin. “It’ll be more bladder cancer. It’ll be more leukemia and pancreatic cancer … more rare cancers of innumerable varieties.”

Replied Zeldin: “I understand that you are an aspiring fiction writer. I see why.”

Schiff said the real fiction was Zeldin’s apparent belief that he can cut the EPA’s budget in half “and it won’t affect people’s health, or their water or their air.” Schiff said the Republican administrator was “totally beholden to the oil industry,” adding: “You could give a rat’s ass about how much cancer your agency causes.”

Zeldin engaged in a similar rhetorical match with Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

Whitehouse said Zeldin and others at EPA have made “baseless accusations of fraud” about grants awarded under Democratic President Joe Biden, removed “career officials who stood up for the rule of law” and deployed FBI agents “to harass career civil servants.”Questions over whether Zeldin reviewed canceled grants

Whitehouse also challenged Zeldin’s contention that he had personally reviewed 781 Biden-era grants totaling nearly $2 billion that the Trump administration later canceled. The grants were intended to address chronic pollution in minority communities and jump-start clean energy programs across the country, but Zeldin said they were plagued by conflicts of interest and unqualified recipients.

“You don’t care about wasting money, but the Trump administration does, Senator,” Zeldin said.

When Whitehouse pressed to see Zeldin’s schedule to prove he personally reviewed the grants before canceling them, Zeldin said he’s worked on the issue “almost every single day” since taking office.

“We are cracking down on every waste, every aspect of abuse,” Zeldin said, adding that Whitehouse seemed unable to grasp that more than one person could review EPA’s grant program.

“I am insisting on the facts,” Whitehouse said.

American taxpayers “put President Trump in office because of people like you,” Zeldin replied. “They have Republicans in charge of the House and Senate because of people like you. You don’t want me to go through the list of all the evidence of waste and abuse.”

Whitehouse replied that Zeldin should explain why Justice Department lawyers, speaking under oath on behalf of the agency, have “said that everything you just said is not true. That’s what I want.”",https://i0.wp.com/vernonreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/lee-zeldin-.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-24 14:07:04.975207

One executive order also focuses on reorganizing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, an independent agency that serves as a watchdog for public health and safety involving nuclear energy.
Nuclear energy made up about 19 percent of U.S. utility-scale energy generation as of 2023, according to the Energy Information Administration.
“Are we doing something about the regulatory in here?” Trump asked Dominguez of the executive orders he was about to sign.
The Navajo Nation in particular has experienced decades of environmental destruction, death and disease linked to uranium mining for nuclear weapons and then nuclear power.","President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders Friday focused on speeding up nuclear energy development by reducing regulations that officials said have “choked” the industry for decades.

Many nuclear rules stem from reforms to protect the public after a partial meltdown at the Three Mile Island power plant in Pennsylvania in 1979.

Friday’s orders include directives to clear the regulatory path for the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense to build nuclear reactors on public lands to power defense facilities and artificial intelligence data centers, speed up the review process and encourage mining for the uranium the industry needs.

One executive order also focuses on reorganizing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, an independent agency that serves as a watchdog for public health and safety involving nuclear energy. It directs the agency to prepare for layoffs.

“Mark this day on your calendar: This is going to turn the clock back on over 50 years of over-regulation on industry,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said at the signing.

Nuclear energy made up about 19 percent of U.S. utility-scale energy generation as of 2023, according to the Energy Information Administration. Nuclear power reactors don’t spew greenhouse gases or other air pollutants, but they are expensive and time-consuming to build and involve processes, like waste storage and uranium mining, that have a history of environmental and health harms.

Some experts responding to the executive orders said that deregulation and weakening the NRC could do more harm than good, hindering safety and eroding public trust in nuclear projects.

Potential changes to the NRC are particularly concerning, said John Burrows, energy and climate policy director of the Wyoming Outdoor Council, a group focused on public lands and environmental protection.

“The NRC is really respected as an independent agency free of industry and political influence, and to the extent that these executive orders undermine that, I think it poses [a] significant challenge for public buy-in for a lot of these projects,” Burrows said.

The executive order mandating “reform” to the agency questions the NRC’s safety models and warnings about radiation risks, and criticizes what it calls a “myopic policy of minimizing even trivial risks.” The directive also says that the temporary Department of Government Efficiency, a key part of Trump’s efforts to dismantle agencies, will consult on staffing changes.

A senior White House official said that “total reduction in staff is undetermined at this point,” but noted that the orders “call for a substantial reorganization” of the agency. The NRC order left open the possibility of increasing staff in some areas, such as nuclear reactor licensing, even as others are cut.

“The NRC is assessing the executive orders and will comply with WH directives,” NRC public affairs officer Scott Burnell wrote in an emailed statement. “We look forward to continuing to work with the Administration, DOE and DOD on future nuclear programs.”

Joseph Romm, a senior research fellow at the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Science, Sustainability and the Media, said that any reduction in capacity at the NRC would be ill-timed with the administration’s proposed ramp-up of nuclear projects.

“This is not the time to be weakening oversight,” said Romm, who was a senior official at the Department of Energy in the 1990s. “It’s very dangerous to be weakening and undermining and politicizing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s oversight at a time when it’s not going to be having to do less work.”

Speeding up the permitting process while accepting proposals for new reactor designs would be “ridiculous and very dangerous,” he added.

The executive orders are part of the administration’s stated push toward “American energy dominance,” and officials said they hope to quadruple the country’s nuclear power production in the next 25 years.

“It’s a hot industry, it’s a brilliant industry, you have to do it right and it’s become very safe and environmental, yes, 100 percent,” Trump said at Friday’s signing.

Members of the Trump administration praised the executive orders at the event, and were joined by several nuclear energy company CEOs, including Joseph Dominguez of Constellation Energy, who said that delays in regulations and permitting can “absolutely kill” companies.

“We’re wasting too much time on permitting and we’re answering silly questions, not the important ones,” Dominguez said.

“Are we doing something about the regulatory in here?” Trump asked Dominguez of the executive orders he was about to sign.

“Oh, yes, sir,” Dominguez responded.

Nuclear energy requires large quantities of uranium, a naturally occurring radioactive element found in soil, rock and water. Mining and processing uranium produces toxic waste and has contaminated water. The Navajo Nation in particular has experienced decades of environmental destruction, death and disease linked to uranium mining for nuclear weapons and then nuclear power.

After years of decreased demand, uranium mining is cropping up again in the Southwest. Amber Reimondo, energy director at Grand Canyon Trust, said Friday’s executive orders could signal a return to the injurious practices that put many communities in harm’s way.

“All these years, the mining industry and the federal government have tried to reassure these communities that they have nothing to fear from future development, and the fact that they’re basically looking to repeat history is really astounding to me,” Reimondo said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2216721732-1024x688.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 19:09:15.856065

Reuters reports that JFE Steel, the country's second-largest steel producer, says it will invest $2.26 billion (329.4 billion yen) to build a state-of-the-art electric arc furnace at a plant in western Japan. The project, backed by up to $710 million in Japanese government grants, is expected to launch in 2028 with the capacity to produce around 2 million tons of steel annually — but with a lot less pollution.

The steel industry is a major contributor to planet-warming pollution because of the coal-fired blast furnaces traditionally used to smelt iron. But EAFs work differently. Instead of coal, they rely on electricity to melt scrap steel, dramatically cutting the amount of polluting gases released in the process. This switch could have ripple effects across supply chains, from construction to cars to clean energy projects including wind turbines.

It's all part of a broader goal to transition toward low-carbon and hydrogen-based steelmaking. That's good news not just for the environment but also for communities breathing in the pollution generated by these industries. Less air pollution means lower risks of asthma, cardiovascular issues, and other illnesses linked to pollution.

Plus, with major companies scaling eco-friendly initiatives with the help of government grants, it could drive down long-term costs. As clean steel becomes the norm, consumers are likely to see comparable prices (or even savings) for more sustainable goods.

The project is an example of how governments and industries can work together to hit climate targets. Companies around the world are testing low-carbon steel made with hydrogen, and major automakers such as Volvo and Mercedes-Benz are signing deals to use cleaner steel in future vehicles.

""JFE Steel aims to become the world's first mass supplier of high-quality, high-function steel materials, such as electromagnetic steel sheets and high-tensile steel sheets, which cannot be produced with existing large-scale electric arc furnaces,"" the company said in a statement.

All three measures were approved by the Senate on Thursday and by the House earlier this month.
“This is not about electric vehicles,” Newsom said at a news conference while the Senate was still voting on the measures.

The measure overturning the rule now goes to the White House, where Trump is expected to sign it, along with two other resolutions that would block California rules curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks. All three measures were approved by the Senate on Thursday and by the House earlier this month.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, and state air regulators say that what Congress is doing is illegal and they will sue to keep the rules in place.

“This is not about electric vehicles,” Newsom said at a news conference while the Senate was still voting on the measures. “This is about polluters being able to pollute more.”

California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state plans to sue over the way that Republicans passed the measures blocking the emissions rules. Senate Republicans established a narrow exception to the filibuster Wednesday to clear the way for the votes.

The GOP effort could have a profound impact on California’s longtime efforts to curb air pollution. California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends — especially because about a dozen states have already followed California’s lead. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.

Senate Democrats charged that Republicans are acting at the behest of the oil and gas industry and they say California should be able to set its own standards after obtaining waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency.

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the votes should “send a chill down the spine of legislators in every state.”

“What we have at stake is a state’s ability, it’s right to make its own laws and to protect its own citizens, without having this body overturn that right,” Schiff said.

Republicans say the phaseout of gas-powered cars, along with other waivers that California has obtained from the EPA, is costly for consumers and manufacturers, puts pressure on the nation’s energy grid and has become a de facto nationwide electric vehicle mandate.

“America cannot meet these impossible standards –- not next year, and not in 10 years,” said Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the second-ranking Republican.

Newsom announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles within 15 years as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.

The Biden administration approved the state’s waiver to implement the standards in December, a month before Trump returned to office. The California rules are stricter than a Biden-era rule that tightens emissions standards but does not require sales of electric vehicles.

Biden’s EPA said in announcing the decision that opponents of the California waivers did not meet their legal burden to show how either the EV rule or a separate measure on heavy-duty vehicles was inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.

Republicans have long criticized California’s waivers and have worked to find a way to overturn them. The Government Accountability Office said earlier this year that California’s policies are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows Congress to reject federal regulations under certain circumstances with a simple majority vote not subject to the filibuster. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that ruling, but Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., cleared the way for the votes anyway with a workaround that established a new Senate precedent.

Democrats fought those changes, which were the latest attempt to chip away at the Senate filibuster after both parties have used their majorities in the past two decades to lower the threshold for nominations. Democrats tried in 2022 to roll back the filibuster for legislation, as well, but were thwarted by members of their own caucus who disagreed with the effort.

Republicans have insisted that they would not try a similar move after regaining the majority this year. But Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the move to block California’s laws were a “point of no return” and called the Republicans “fair weather institutionalists.”

Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan was the only Democrat to support the measure to block the phaseout of gas-powered vehicles. She said in a statement after the vote that she has a “special responsibility to stand up for the more than one million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry.”

John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an auto industry association and lobby group, said there is a gap between the vehicles that car buyers are purchasing and the rules that would force a transition to electric vehicles.

“The fact is these EV sales mandates were never achievable,” Bozzella said.

Statement from the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project on yesterday’s congressional attack on clean transportation

Yesterday, the U.S. Senate voted to block leading states Colorado and New Mexico from enforcing a suite of clean transportation policies designed to reduce pollution and accelerate adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). The Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions passed today strike down waivers previously granted by the Environmental Protection Agency, which allowed states to implement the Advanced Clean Cars, Advanced Clean Trucks, and Heavy Duty Omnibus regulations.

These rules require automakers to build vehicles that emit fewer health-harming and climate-changing pollutants, while advancing zero-emission technologies like plug-in electric and hydrogen vehicles. The U.S. House passed similar resolutions earlier in May.

Travis Madsen, Transportation Program Director for the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project (SWEEP), issued the following statement:

“Today’s vote makes it clear that Congress wants Americans to waste more money on gasoline.

“Electric vehicles are far more fuel efficient than gasoline or diesel ones. Our research shows that drivers in the Southwest can save about $10,000 over 200,000 miles with an electric sedan, and more than $30,000 with a battery-electric pickup — roughly a 25% discount on the total cost of ownership.

“But those savings depend on having vehicles available to buy. These clean vehicle programs have made that possible by driving innovation, helping Tesla get off the ground, and motivating traditional automakers to invest in better, more cost-effective technology.

“These policies are projected to deliver up to $4 trillion in national benefits by mid-century — including consumer savings and avoided health and environmental costs. That’s more than $1,000 per household, every year.

“By overturning these waivers, Congress is letting manufacturers off the hook, hanging consumers out to dry, and giving up on climate action. Combined with the repeal of EV incentives in the recent House budget bill, Congress is ceding leadership in clean vehicle technology to China.

“I expect states and cities to pursue progress through other channels — courts, legislatures, and administrative action — and SWEEP stands ready to help.”

SWEEP thanks Senators Hickenlooper and Bennet (CO), Heinrich and Luján (NM), Kelly and Gallego (AZ), and Rosen and Cortez-Masto (NV) for voting against these harmful resolutions.

Additional Background

Under the Clean Air Act, California is allowed to set its own vehicle pollution standards, and other states may adopt them if they face significant air quality challenges. Colorado and New Mexico adopted California’s Advanced Clean Cars 2 and Advanced Clean Trucks rules in 2023, while Nevada adopted Clean Cars 1 in 2021, but has not updated its regulations to their current form. Arizona briefly participated in a prior clean car program in the 2010s.

Although Colorado and New Mexico implemented their rules only through 2032 — after which they would revert to federal standards — the CRA vote threatens to block all state enforcement of these programs, regardless of their planned duration.

Legal challenges are expected. Both the Senate Parliamentarian and the Government Accountability Office previously ruled that these waivers are not subject to CRA oversight. The issue is now likely headed to federal court.

“Corban Commons has never been just about housing; it’s about dignity, a place to live” Boyce said. “It’s about ensuring that our seniors have access to safe, stable homes, where they’re seen, valued and supported, most importantly — and now, the integration of solar power.”

Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther, who also spoke at the press conference, said the Columbus Region Green Fund was launched in 2023 out of a desire to promote clean energy and affordable housing, with a specific focus on the communities most affected by climate change.

“Today, less than two years later, we’re standing in front of proof that this organization is working as intended,” Ginther said. “This solar panel installation is more than just panels on a roof and on the ground. It represents action, partnership and follow-through.”

According to the release, the Columbus Region Green Fund exists through multimillion-dollar investments from the city, Franklin County and the Columbus Partnership — a nonprofit organization of CEOs from the city’s top businesses.

Ginther said projects like these go hand in hand with the Columbus Climate Action Plan, which was announced by the mayor in 2020 as a goal for the city to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030 and be carbon neutral by 2050.

“The Green Fund is a critical piece of the puzzle, and we’re already seeing returns,” Ginther said. “More than 10 nonprofits and affordable housing developments are in the process of being built in 2025 alone. In short, we’re no longer just talking about goals; we’re delivering on them.”

If President Donald Trump’s signature budget and tax legislation makes it through the Senate as written, things will get very ugly for the country’s electric vehicle sector—including its flourishing battery industry.

Coupled with the Trump administration's cuts to other climate policies, the bill's destruction of pro-EV tax credits will ""reduce annual sales of electric vehicles by roughly 40% in 2030 and end America's battery manufacturing boom,"" according to an analysis out Thursday from Princeton University's climate-focused REPEAT Project.

The bill pays for tax cuts and extra spending on defense and immigration enforcement by eviscerating the Inflation Reduction Act, the landmark climate law that had been funding an American manufacturing renaissance since 2022.

It would swiftly eliminate rebates for people who buy new North American-made EVs and place new restrictions on tax credits that subsidize domestic production of battery packs and cells. All of that, plus a $250 annual registration tax for EVs also included in the bill, will make plug-in cars costlier to buy and make.

Meanwhile, Trump’s agencies plan to roll back Biden-era tailpipe emission and fuel economy rules that would have forced automakers to rapidly clean up their fleets. And the Senate just moved to revoke California’s influential zero-emission vehicle mandate.

In other words, the nationwide carrots and sticks—incentives and penalties—that were pushing America full-steam ahead toward an EV future are dead or dying. And experts say the battery industry will get slammed on multiple fronts.

Importantly, any policy changes that dent EV sales will also diminish demand for batteries among car manufacturers. A slower-growing EV market simply won’t need nearly as many battery cells each year as a thriving one. As the EV sector grew, it was expected to drive up domestic battery production while bringing battery costs down. Currently, battery supply chains are overwhelmingly controlled by China.

Some at-risk policies support battery makers more directly. The 45X tax credit created by the IRA covers some of the cost of battery cells, modules and critical minerals produced in the U.S. New language in the bill would bar projects with even remote ties to China from receiving credits. One analysis called these rules ""extremely complex"" and ""in many ways unworkable.""

The tax credit for EV buyers, 30D, includes provisions that push manufacturers to onshore and friendshore battery production. The House voted to terminate the credit at the end of 2026, six years early.

According to the REPEAT Project, if the House bill becomes law and EV demand slows down, all planned U.S. battery capacity that is not up and running by the end of 2025 may not be necessary in 2030. In other words, even without any of the battery plants slated to open up from 2026 onward, the U.S. would likely have plenty of battery capacity to supply all domestically made EVs through the end of the decade.

Moreover, some battery factories that are currently operating or about to come online could be at risk of shutting down due to depressed EV demand, the researchers said.

Hyundai's Georgia Metaplant, where it makes Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 EVs, includes a $4.3 billion joint-venture battery factory with supplier LG Energy Solution.

And there are more than a few battery projects that are still in their early stages right now. Post-IRA, companies have announced 128 U.S. facilities for battery manufacturing, materials processing and the like, according to Wellesley College’s Big Green Machine database. Of those, 77 have not started construction or production.

Deep cuts to battery production would result in far fewer American manufacturing jobs over time. According to a recent report from the International Council on Clean Transportation, repealing the EV provisions in the IRA could slash U.S. battery production by roughly 75% in 2030, from the 1,050 gigawatt-hours currently planned to 250 GWh. The organization concluded that getting rid of the law would vaporize 130,000 potential jobs in the EV space by 2030, including 85,000 jobs in battery manufacturing alone.

Projected job gains or losses in the U.S. EV industry with and without the IRA, according to the ICCT.

The impact would be almost immediate. Thousands of battery industry jobs that exist today would disappear starting in 2026, the ICCT says, and employment in the sector would only climb back to 2024 levels in 2030.

If the House bill were to become law, the outcome would look a lot like the ICCT's no-IRA scenario, said Peter Slowik, the organization's U.S. passenger vehicles lead.

Some of the biggest losers will be red and purple states like Michigan, Texas, Tennessee, Nevada, Kentucky and Georgia, according to the ICCT. For that exact reason, many who watch this industry closely had believed that a motivated contingent of Republicans would fight to save some core parts of the IRA. That’s not what happened.

States projected to lose the most job under an IRA repeal, according to the ICCT.

Just two Republicans joined all Democrats in voting against the bill, and that was because they didn’t think the cuts went deep enough. Georgia Rep. Buddy Carter, whose district is home to Hyundai’s enormous new EV, hybrid and battery plant, supported the bill and called it “fantastic.”

Nevada’s vast lithium deposits have made it a magnet for the battery industry. Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) previously told The Nevada Independent that he’d like to preserve the 45X and 30D tax credits. He voted to gut them instead.

The bill’s cuts go far beyond EVs and batteries. None of the 21 Republican House representatives who previously defended the IRA’s tax credits for clean energy voted against the bill either.

Now the big, destructive bill heads to the Senate, where lawmakers have set a July 4 deadline to send it to the president’s desk. The next few weeks and months of deliberations will determine whether the battery boom charges ahead—or grinds to a halt.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/ojG9ky/s1/congress-threatens-america-s-battery-boom-2.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 12:16:24.050788

The annual national registration fee would begin at $250 for electric vehicles and $150 for hybrid vehicles.
The Highway Trust Fund is severely underfunded, partly (though not primarily) due to EVs not paying the gas tax,"" Muresianu said.
These electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles either use a little bit of gas, or the electric vehicles use no gas at all so they're not paying into the Highway Trust Fund at all,"" Moore said on the Just the News Not Noise TV program.","There's a first-of-its-kind national vehicle registration tax tucked inside the final version of President Trump and the GOP's ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act."" The legislation has created a new federal vehicle tax for energy-efficient vehicles that rises each year based on inflation.

The annual national registration fee would begin at $250 for electric vehicles and $150 for hybrid vehicles. An earlier version of the bill included a $20 fee for all other vehicles, but it was dropped from the final version that passed the House on Thursday. The only Republicans to vote against the bill were Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio. All House Democrats voted against it.

The Senate is now considering the legislation.

Under the House-passed bill, the administrator of the Federal Highway Administration would impose the fees each year.

According to the text of the bill, a state motor vehicle department must ""incorporate the collection of the fees"" into the vehicle registration and renewal processes administered by each department ""so long as such fees are imposed for each year in which the fees are required.""

States get a cut of the action

A state DMV must also ""obtain approval from the Administrator to establish an alternate means of compliance for the collection of such fees that is acceptable to the Administrator.""

The bill allows states to retain 1% of the total fees collected. The amount of the fees will rise each year in accordance with inflation.

""The amounts specified in subsection (a) shall be increased on an annual basis to account for the rate of inflation each fiscal year in accordance with the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers of the Bureau of Labor Statistics,"" the bill states.

Alex Muresianu, a tax policy expert from the Tax Foundation, told Just the News that fees would help the Highway Trust Fund (HTF), which could become insolvent as early as 2028. The Peterson Foundation explains the Highway Trust fund was ""established in 1956 to provide a more dependable source of funding from the federal government for the construction of the interstate highway system.""

""They do target real problems. The Highway Trust Fund is severely underfunded, partly (though not primarily) due to EVs not paying the gas tax,"" Muresianu said. ""The fees would raise revenue and improve HTF's fiscal position, although not nearly enough to fix the HTF's structural deficits.""

Muresianu said the fees in the bill are ""poorly targeted"" because they are flat fees and they ""do not adjust for the number of miles"" a vehicle owner drives each year.

""That means effectively overcharging EV/hybrid owners that don't drive very much. Additionally, EVs are not the only vehicles that are undertaxed under current law,"" he said. ""Conventional passenger cars and (particularly) heavy commercial traffic are also not covering the maintenance costs they impose. Leaning on EVs alone to fix the problem is not a sound approach.""

EV owners will be asked to pay their fair share

In addition to imposing new registration fees, the GOP eliminated the $7,500 tax credit on the purchase of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids made in the U.S. that meet certain requirements for ""critical minerals and battery components.""

Rep. Riley Moore, R-W.V., said the new fees are a ""fair way"" to get green vehicles to pay into the Highway Trust Fund. At present, EV owners -- who pay little or no gas tax -- avoid paying into the pool that builds public highways and transportation programs.

""Well, it's certainly not meant to create a backlash. What it's supposed to do is treat everybody fairly. These electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles either use a little bit of gas, or the electric vehicles use no gas at all so they're not paying into the Highway Trust Fund at all,"" Moore said on the Just the News Not Noise TV program. ""And these vehicles, particularly electric vehicles, tend to be much heavier than your standard vehicle, which they put more wear and tear on the highway itself. So there has to be some way for them to pay in, as we all do that drive gas-powered vehicles.""

Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-R.I., said he understands the reason for the new fees, but the GOP should have left the $7,500 tax credit for clean vehicles in the bill.

""I understand conceptually that if we're going to be moving toward more EVs on the road it's not sustainable to just have the gas tax pay for keeping our infrastructure up to date so that part doesn't necessarily concern me,"" Magaziner said during a press gaggle on Capitol Hill.

""What concerns me more is the elimination of the tax credits to make it easier for people to buy EVs if they choose to do so. It should be a choice, but if we don't continue to invest in having a strong EV industry in the United States, China and other countries are going to eat our lunch,"" he added.",https://justthenews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_share/public/2025-05/GettyImages-2216074866.jpg?h=9fe24eb1&itok=4csyCW0G,N,,2025-05-24 13:09:11.578304

""They're improving the air quality for our kids across the state, so, where these buses are in service, we're seeing a lot of positive reviews,"" Ruder said.

The Newfield Central School District is one of those places, reporting near-perfect performance from its three electric buses that have been in use throughout this school year. Voters there just approved the purchase of a fourth for next year, but not everyone shares that enthusiasm. Newfield was the sole Central New York district where voters approved buying an electric bus this budget season; Cortland and Mexico rejected electric buses while dozens of other districts didn't bother to give voters the option, with some districts like Fayetteville-Manlius citing .

Ruder said that NYSERDA is working with more than 350 districts - about half of the state - to create electrification plans that would address those kinds of worries. He said that at present, NYSERDA-backed studies have found that electric school buses would be capable of completing about 70 percent of the bus routes that exist across the state. He said that anticipated technological changes would account for other routes that, at the moment, are too long for those buses.

""We're confident that the technology is going to continue improving and that electric school buses are a real solution that are going to work in schools across the state,"" Ruder said.

When it comes to money, Ruder pointed to federal grants from the Environmental Protection Agency and available state aid; Newfield has made use of both. Ruder said that about 75 districts have applied for funding with the state making $500 million available towards this effort; but some estimates, including one from the conservative think tank Empire Center for Public Policy, put the cost of fully electrifying all school buses in every district at around $9 billion.

Ruder said that the cost involved will change along with the technology, expecting battery prices and other parts of electric school buses to become cheaper. He explained that districts should expect to save money over time, given NYSERDA's data showing electric buses cost less to 'fuel' and maintain compared to their diesel counterparts.

State lawmakers have begun to acknowledge that districts are having difficulty convincing voters that electric buses are the right move. Districts can now apply for two waivers that would each grant two year extensions; some Central New York representatives have entertained the idea of tweaking the specifics of the mandate as more information on practicality becomes available.",https://cnycentral.com/resources/media2/16x9/650/986/5x0/90/f2c1d8bd-64d6-4d90-b8cf-43b4b27f1691-AdieselbussitsattheFayettevilleManliusgarage.PNG,N,,2025-05-24 13:08:51.109746

The EPA on May 24 said a new rule on emissions would be published after interagency review.

A spokesperson for the EPA told Reuters news service: “Many have voiced concerns that the last administration’s replacement for that rule is similarly overreaching and an attempt to shut down affordable and reliable electricity generation in the United States, raising prices for American families, and increasing the country’s reliance on foreign forms of energy. As part of this reconsideration, EPA is developing a proposed rule.”

The New York Times first reported on the draft plan, with the newspaper saying it had reviewed internal agency documents. The EPA in the proposed regulation said carbon dioxide and other GHG from U.S. power plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or to climate change, with the agency saying emissions from U.S. power generation are a small share of global GHG emissions. The EPA said eliminating those emissions would not have a meaningful effect on public health.

Lee Zeldin, who heads the EPA, in a statement said, “We are seeking to ensure that the agency follows the rule of law while providing all Americans with access to reliable and affordable energy.”

Draft Rule Under Review

The Times on Saturday reported that the EPA sent the draft rule to the White House for review on May 2. The paper noted the proposal could be changed before being made available publicly, which it said could occur in June.

The EPA in its draft of the plan wrote that the U.S. share of emissions is just 3% of global pollution from the power generation sector. The agency also noted the U.S. has reduced its share of global emissions in the past 20 years, writing that the U.S. was responsible for 5.5% of global emissions in 2005. The U.S., though, is responsible for the second-most emissions from power generation worldwide, behind only China.

Saturday’s news comes one day after President Trump signed four executive orders supporting a faster buildout of nuclear power plants in the U.S. Those orders including a directive for the departments of Energy and Defense to look at putting reactors at military bases. The orders also noted deployment on federal lands, and also siting them near data centers. The directives also looked at ways reactors could be deployed without approval of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

The administration also set a goal of increasing U.S. nuclear power generation capacity to 400 GW by 2050, a fourfold jump from the current capacity of about 100 GW that comes from just more than 90 operating reactors.

Trump’s Support for Fossil Fuels

The proposed emissions rule aligns with the Trump administration’s efforts to prop up the use of fossil fuels for power generation in the U.S. The president on Jan. 20, the first day of his second term, declared an “energy emergency”, writing “The energy and critical minerals [“energy”] identification, leasing, development, production, transportation, refining, and generation capacity of the United States are all far too inadequate to meet our Nation’s needs. We need a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our Nation’s manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness.”

The Trump administration has issued several orders related to ending federal spending related to programs that would combat climate change. The administration also has repeatedly said it would remove rules, such as emissions limits, that would hinder thermal power generation, oil and gas exploration, and mining operations.

Republicans in the U.S. House on Thursday in a party-line vote advanced Trump’s tax and spending bill that calls for ending subsidies and tax credits for renewable energy. The bill aims to eliminate funding including tax credits and grants, from the Inflation Reduction Act that support solar, wind, and other renewable energy, along with programs designed to reduce GHG from the power generation and transportation sectors.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/screenshot-2024-10-16-at-51331pm.png,N,,2025-05-24 12:17:28.783441

OEMs, vendors and transportation leaders are highlighting the continued challenges but also the benefits of electric school buses while also promoting collaboration as the industry enters uncharted territory. But continued funding is necessary.

Brad Beauchamp, EV product segment leader for Blue Bird, moderated a related session, “School Bus Sector: Rolling out the New Generation of School Buses,” on April 30 at the Advanced Clean Transportation (ACT) Expo that provided the perspectives of two student transporters, a leader of electrification at the nation’s largest school bus contractor, a mechanical engineer, and a smart charging technology provider.

Mike Bullman, director of transportation for the South Carolina Department of Education. described the uniqueness of The Palmetto State, as the DOE owns and maintains all 5,600-plus school buses. Bullman noted the fleet fuel makeup is currently 88 percent diesel, 10 percent propane, and three-and-a-half percent electric. He noted that his operation has taken a multi-pronged approach to alternative fuels with a focus on advancing technology.

He added that the South Carolina state specifications committee will be convening in the this summer, and gasoline will be on the agenda as well. “We feel that fleet diversity is very important as we certainly move into the future,” he said.

The South Carolina fleet travels 78 million miles a year and supports 77 public school districts. Those 78 million miles serve 365,000 students a day using about nine or 10 million gallons of diesel fuel annually and 1.2 million gallons of propane. There are 42 statewide school bus maintenance facilities and a staff of about 375 employees, with an annual budget of $170 million.

“It’s quite a large endeavor,” Bullman shared.

In addition to fuels, Bullman is focused on technology adoption. “We take a safety-first approach, but we want to make sure that technology is in there,” he said, adding that buses have tire pressure monitoring systems, stability control, camera systems, stop arm cameras, student management, GPS tracking. “All of that is part of this comprehensive multi-prong approach,” he added.

He noted that preventative and predictive maintenance are also important. Bullman and his team in South Carolina lead the inspection program offered at STN EXPO conferences.

Bullman’s department also has a statewide routing program and a comprehensive driver training program. “Additional investments in charging and fueling infrastructure is on our list and important to us, long cycle cost analysis for vehicle procurement, and staff training,” he said.

He added that South Carolina will continue to seek additional funding sources, noting that was the main driver for purchasing electric vehicles. In 2021, the state received $1.3 million in grant money to purchase four electric school busses and in 2022 received $6.6 million to purchase 16 EVs and then in 2024 they got another $6.9 million to purchase another 20.

He added that with the EVs, they are seeing cost savings with maintenance and operating costs, it’s the initial cost gap that needs to be bridged. “I personally and professionally believe that the school bus space is an ideal space for an electric vehicle,” he said. “It just fits. You’ve got long dwell times. You’ve got repeatable routes. Certainly, 80 to 90 percent of the routes in South Carolina can be covered quite comfortably with an EV bus.”

Bullman cited the current challenge is uncertainty surrounding federal funding for ESBs — which many in the industry would agree with. He noted that without grants, South Carolina would not have been able to purchase electric, citing the cost gap with diesel. He noted that data collecting will be key and help to convince naysayers that this is the right technology moving forward.

Sam Hill-Cristol, director of strategy and business development for The Mobility House, noted that V2G technology is a way to offset some of those costs. “We’re optimistic about the contributions that V2G revenues can make in the total cost of ownership calculation,” he said.

He noted that while there are ongoing V2G projects across the U.S., it is currently not scalable. He expects V2G to gain more popularity in the years to come.

Meanwhile, Lauren Lynch, senior mechanical engineer with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), noted that the agency focuses on energy systems research and development with an eye on data collection. She said NREL provides data to fleets of school buses to enable fleet managers who are adopting the technologies to better understand their use and performance.

She said the fully funded program is a free service to fleets right now. Going forward, she explained that NREL will provide buses with a data logger that works in conjunction with telematics systems, so it won’t interfere with other data logging taking place on the bus. The data is transferred to NREL, who stores the data and conducts an analysis. Currently, they are working with seven different fleets and aim to collect data for at least 30 days. NREL is also hoping to capture a year after year performance and is coming up on year two working with Beaverton School District near Portland, Oregon.

“It’s been exciting, and we’re expanding our analysis to include a maintenance and cost study,” she shared. “We want to ensure that we provide a value back to the fleets. So, as part of our overall objective, we not only want to provide this analysis to the fleets, where we highlight key insights or maybe identify some areas of opportunity, but we also hope to utilize the data as an aggregated study for the vocation, utilize the data and other tools and models to inform driver developments or address any barriers within the industry.”

She explained that the data shows electric buses are more efficient than other powertrains. They do, she confirmed, have higher capital costs but have resulted in an overall lower dollar-per-mile cost when operating the same routes.

“We’re looking at all powertrains within the fleet to understand the performance of each and identifying areas of opportunity and what’s going well,” she explained, adding that the end-goal is to make the electric school bus data publicly available via the online tool FleetREDI. Currently, the website has data on heavy- and medium-duty findings.

San Marcos Unified School District in California also received about $30 million in grant funds for infrastructure and school buses. “It was very overwhelming,” Executive Director of Transportation Mike Sawyer said.

He noted that the district had 84 old diesel buses, so he started applying for grants — one of them being the Carl Moyer Memorial Air Quality Standards Attainment Program grant in California and the Zero Emission School Bus and Infrastructure Program — and the money kept flowing.

To help him navigate all the funding, he said he reached out to partners, including Engie, which helped San Marcos find inefficiencies in charging infrastructure. Engie helped San Marcos create “one of the biggest” charging infrastructure bus yards. Phase one was completed with 40 EV chargers, six of which are 120 kW, the remainder being 30 kW chargers. Phase two, which is about to break ground, will bring the district to a total of 75 chargers.

The location holds about one megawatt of solar and 1.5 megawatts of battery storage, and it includes a 60kW diesel generator to serve as backup if the power goes out. Sawyer noted SMUSD currently has 33 electric buses on the road.

Providing a Service

Meanwhile, First Student operates over 45,000 school buses across 43 states and eight Canadian provinces. Of those, 450 are electric vehicles.

“EVs, they are providing not only cleaner and quieter rides to school, but these kids are arriving to school calmer,” said Jennifer Harp, the contractor’s vice president of the electric vehicles program, discussing a recent project in rural Westville, Illinois that electrified its entire fleet of 17 school buses with help from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Clean School Bus Program, IRA tax credits, and the Illinois Volkswagen Environmental Mitigation Trust program.

“They had some limited resources,” she said, adding that they were on a lease property and needed an infrastructure solution that would avoid high costs.

She added the company integrated its First Charge, a trenchless, flexible and quick-to-deploy. purpose-built charging hub with that removes the barrier of having to trench locations.

Harp also noted First Student currently deploys 14 First Charge units. It took about nine months to deploy the one operating in Westville.

“If we want to follow Westville’s playbook for electrification success, we really need to remember that continued success in this space requires continued funding incentives from all of our government sectors,” she said. “It also requires that we minimize costly infrastructure as much as possible. Requires partnerships and a willingness to share those learnings. …With the right strategy and infrastructure, school bus electrification is not only possible, it is absolutely practical.”

She noted the conversations on battery-electric adoption at ACT Expo have evolved from the initial belief that it could be a plug-and-play option. “If you’ve been here long enough, you know that it’s not that simple,” she shared. “Fleet electrification takes partnerships, very strong partnerships, high increased project coordination, industry standardization, and, above all else, patience.”

Meanwhile, The Mobility House provides smart charging to fleets to over 2,500 sites globally, 100 of which are location in North America. Hill-Cristol shared that the grand vision is to achieve “zero emission transportation at zero cost,” he said. “We think we can get there in some cases, through the technology that we provide.”

He explained that vehicle grid integration is an umbrella term The Mobility House uses to talk about a suite of use cases that are becoming more common with the next-generation electric school bus projects.

“The days of going to the utility, getting a totally new service, 100 percent paid for, putting in enough capacity for every charger to be on at once, and then just turning it on and not worrying, I think those days are pretty much behind us,” he said, adding that now customers are looking for ways to solve challenges, like vehicle-to-grid, charging off peak and backup power integration.

Hill-Cristol also mentioned off-grid supplemental solutions, which consists of using solar storage or a backup generator to help with capacity challenges and the delay in receiving chargers. All of this is also provided by The Mobility House.

He elaborated that the off-grid solutions can be either a long-term or temporary solution. For instance, some districts are using it as a bridge as they wait for their infrastructure, whereas some districts can solely use it as a charge management system. Other use cases include a micro-gird if districts need additional power on site.

“Depending on where you fall on that spectrum, and the investment that you’re making, I think that would lead you to the conclusion of whether this is a two-to-five-year solution or whether this is going to be something that sticks around,” he said. “Because with the right combination of technologies, you’re also going to get operational cost saving.”",https://i0.wp.com/stnonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250430_26379-1-3-copy.jpg?fit=1920%2C1280&quality=100&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-24 12:16:31.338884

Apex Power's first foray into American soil promises an initial workforce of 300. That number, they say, could more than double by the end of the decade.

Snagged by Mesa, the burgeoning 206,000-square-foot facility represents over a $60 million investment and is set to blow up the local economy by manufacturing cutting-edge multi-megawatt power conversion systems, as stated in MesaNow. The assembly lines are scheduled to fire up by early 2026. Jacob Marshall, President & Co-Founder of Apex Power Conversion, called it ""a humbling honor"" to kickstart operations in Mesa, pointing to a lofty mission to integrate renewables and energy storage onto the grid.

In recent years, climate scientists have reported higher levels of anxiety, distress and hopelessness as they analyze the ways global warming is altering life on Earth.
As a way to cope, some researchers have formed climate science support groups, while others have turned to comedy.","On Tuesday, a small crowd gathered outside Tom’s Restaurant in New York City. The cozy, neon-lit diner appeared regularly on the sitcom “Seinfeld,” but this group wasn’t there for a photo op or to recreate one of George and Jerry’s many arguments over a cup of coffee.

They were saying goodbye to the building above it.

Since 1966, this Upper West Side location has been the home of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, a laboratory dedicated to unraveling the complex dynamics of natural and man-made changes on our planet and beyond. The Columbia University-owned building, known as Armstrong Hall, has hosted scientists who have made a number of groundbreaking discoveries. Among them: Jim Hansen, who was one of the first to warn the public about the climate risks of greenhouse gas emissions.

However, on April 24, NASA informed scientists working at the institute that the agency’s tenure at the location was about to end.

The move came shortly after President Donald Trump signed an executive order calling for agencies to re-evaluate their leased office space. Federal climate and Earth scientists are facing widespread budget and staffing cuts in the Trump administration’s push to dismantle vast swaths of the government.

Experts say this downsizing will come at the expense of science that is crucial to American lives and livelihoods.

Even beyond job and funding rollbacks, it’s a tough time to be a climate scientist. A growing number of researchers are speaking out about the mental toll of studying and witnessing increasingly devastating impacts of global warming firsthand. Many are calling for better support, while others are leaving the country—or the field altogether.

An Unwanted Farewell: From the outside, the unassuming brick building at Broadway and West 112th Street looks like any other office space or apartment complex on the block. But within, the six floors that make up Goddard Institute for Space Studies offered a proving ground for scientific discovery over the past six decades.

Federal researchers have worked alongside Columbia scientists and other groups on a variety of cross-disciplinary projects, from better understanding how the ocean and atmosphere exchange carbon dioxide to running simulations on the potential for humans to survive on Mars. In the 1970s, Hansen developed a climate model on an IBM computer that took up the entire second floor to shed light on human-driven global warming, the findings of which he eventually brought before Congress to testify on the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

“We were put here for the purpose of having a free exchange of information and ideas between the academic community at Columbia and federal research scientists at NASA,” a NASA scientist told me under the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. “When you are face-to-face with people, sometimes this collective mind is able to make leaps that are … difficult to make in isolation.”

But the clock is ticking on this space. Despite still having the lease until 2031, as The New York Times reports, NASA informed staff working at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies that they would temporarily work remotely as the agency ends its operations in the building. Many employees have not yet been told where they will work, leaving the future of their research and jobs uncertain.

“You’re taking the pace of science from being very dynamic and quick and cutting edge and intentionally disrupting it,” the same NASA scientist told me.

At Tuesday’s outreach event, scientists from the agency and Columbia University lined the street outside Tom’s with posters of their work and passed out free stickers and books on climate science to passersby. They were enthusiastic about their research, but there was an undeniable sense of somber nostalgia as people reminisced about caffeine runs to fuel brainstorms or popping by a colleague’s desk to work out a problem.

Though NASA has other centers operating around the country, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies has the only large facility in NYC. The Trump administration recently proposed a budget that seeks to cut 24 percent of the agency’s funding, putting a range of locations and the programs within at risk, experts say.

Many Goddard Institute for Space Studies employees are operating in a holding pattern as they work remotely and wait for instructions from higher ups.

NASA told me the agency is canceling the lease, effective May 31, as part of “the administration’s government-wide review of leases to increase efficiency.”

“Over the next several months, employees will be placed on temporary remote work agreements while NASA seeks and evaluates options for a new space for the GISS team,” NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens said in a statement to Inside Climate News. “Additionally, this decision is specific to the lease; the GISS mission continues. NASA’s GISS has a significant place in the history of space science and its work is critical for the Earth Science Division, particularly as the division looks to the future of its modeling work and capabilities.”

NASA did not answer my questions about whether the federal government will have to continue paying the lease despite the cancellation, and where they will host employees after the period of remote work is over.

An Emotional Toll: Budget and staffing cuts have disrupted science for researchers across nearly all agencies, adding a layer of stress to those working in the field within the U.S.

More broadly, working in climate science comes with its own set of mental burdens, research shows. In recent years, climate scientists have reported higher levels of anxiety, distress and hopelessness as they analyze the ways global warming is altering life on Earth. But some are hesitant to share their experience for fear that they may seem biased or unprofessional, according to a 2024 commentary in the journal Nature Climate Change, authored by a group of researchers.

“Many scientists are understandably hesitant to express what they really feel, at the risk of being accused of either being alarmist or simply being too unscientific—in other words, emotional,” the commentary’s authors wrote. “In reality, however, individual scientists—including the authors here—often cycle through feelings of both despair and hope, and/or work to actively cultivate optimism (despite despair) to ensure contributions to addressing the problem.”

In a recent response to that piece, researchers based in Germany zeroed in on the emotional impact of climate fieldwork specifically. The authors pointed out the “deeply embodied experience” of fieldwork, which requires people to immerse themselves in places being impacted by climate change—from smelling the acrid smoke of wildfires to hearing “the silence in a once-vibrant ecosystem.”

I asked lead author Anna Lena Bercht to tell me about a particular climate impact that stuck with her during field work. She primarily studies small-scale coastal fisheries in the Arctic, where Northeast Arctic cod fish stocks are shifting migration patterns as water temperatures warm and unpredictable weather hinders traditional fish-preparation practices.

“I saw the eggs that flies had laid in the fish hanging outside on wooden racks to dry. When the weather gets too warm, the flies come,” she said over email. “A stockfish producer showed me the fish. He could no longer sell it—or others like it—because of the loss in quality. I could see the worry and despair in his eyes. His fear for his livelihood, culture and identity.”

Bercht believes emotions like compassion and curiosity, as well as anxiety and concern, can strengthen science and build trust with communities. But she emphasized the importance of institutional support to help researchers manage the emotional challenges of fieldwork.

Scientists studying climate change from a lab or those who use models to understand warming’s impact on Earth systems have also reported feelings of anxiety, which has influenced their personal life decisions such as whether to have children, The Guardian reports.

As a way to cope, some researchers have formed climate science support groups, while others have turned to comedy. Amid ongoing assaults on climate science in the U.S., many researchers have organized protests to defend scientific integrity and fight to retain funding, as my colleagues reported in March.

“I’m here basically to support the idea that science is really important, and it’s important for everybody,” physicist Rob Semper, chief science officer at the Exploratorium, the storied San Francisco science museum, told my colleagues. “It’s not just doing the research, it’s the results of the research, and it’s also thinking about how to help the world with new knowledge, new information.”

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says the upcoming Atlantic hurricane season is forecast to be “above normal,” with 13 to 19 possible named storms this year between June 1 to Nov. 30. Of those, six to 10 are forecast to become hurricanes with winds of 74 miles per hour or higher, with the possibility of three to five major hurricanes with winds of 111 mph or higher. (My colleague Amy Green reports on that as well as the major cuts that could impact the federal government’s ability to help respond.)

“As we witnessed last year with significant inland flooding from hurricanes Helene and Debby, the impacts of hurricanes can reach far beyond coastal communities,” acting NOAA Administrator Laura Grimm said in a statement. “NOAA is critical for the delivery of early and accurate forecasts and warnings, and provides the scientific expertise needed to save lives and property.”

Memorial Day weekend is typically one of the busiest holidays for national parks across the country, and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum recently issued an order to ensure that parks stay open despite staffing constraints.

But as Jonathan Jarvis, the past head of the Park Service under former President Barack Obama, recently told me, pulling staff from other parts of park operations to fill in gaps that support visitor experience “means that the stuff the visitor doesn’t see, the natural resources, the cultural work, the archeology, the historic preservation, anything that isn’t front and center of the visitor, is going to be set aside.”

My colleague Wyatt Myskow reached out to the nonprofit Trust for Public Land to ask about park readiness ahead of the weekend.

“More Americans than ever are heading outside—and just as demand is surging, key federal agencies like the National Park Service face staffing reductions and hiring freezes,” Trust for Public Land CEO Carrie Besnette Hauser said over email. “These reductions threaten the ability to care for the very places we love.”

New research suggests that humpback whales struggle to see one of the biggest threats to their lives: fishing nets. Despite having grapefruit-sized eyeballs, humpback whales have shockingly low-resolution vision, Elizabeth Anne Brown reports for The New York Times. The scientists say this is due to the anatomy of their eyes, a large part of which is sclera—the tissue that isn’t involved in vision—and have a low density of cells that help capture images and convert them into signals that the brain can understand.

This means it is difficult for the whales to see distant and thin items such as fishing nets or even boats before it is too late. These threats are also driving North Atlantic right whales toward extinction, as I’ve reported in the past.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/giss-armstrong-hall-may-2013.webp,N,,2025-05-24 14:06:53.031549

Campbell Power Plant in Ottawa County, the U.S. Department of Energy has issued an emergency order requiring Consumers Energy to keep the plant ""available for operation.""
“It's voluntary for the Campbell Plant to be closing (this) early,” Ottawa County Commissioner Allison Miedema said in February.
The Campbell Plant began operations in 1962, generating nearly 1,500 megawatts of electricity on a 2,000-acre property.","The U.S. Department of Energy issued an emergency order to delay the closure of the J.H. Campbell Power Plant in Ottawa County, Michigan.

Consumers Energy, the plant's operator, will comply with the pause while assessing the order's impact.

The plant's planned closure was part of Consumers Energy's clean energy transition, but the order cites concerns about grid reliability.

PORT SHELDON TWP. — With single digits left before the scheduled closure of the J.H. Campbell Power Plant in Ottawa County, the U.S. Department of Energy has issued an emergency order requiring Consumers Energy to keep the plant ""available for operation.""

In a brief statement to the media, Consumers Director of Media Relations Katie Carey described the order as a 90-day pause, and said the utility intends to comply.

""We are reviewing the executive action and the overall impact on our company,"" she added.

The order, issued Friday, May 23, cited a need to ""minimize the risk of blackouts and address critical grid security issues"" in the Midwest ahead of ""the high electricity demand expected this summer."" The order was directed to the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, the grid on which the plant operates.

The Campbell Plant was scheduled to close May 31.

An effort to ""Save the Campbell"" in Ottawa County has been underway since Consumers announced the facility in Port Sheldon Township was slated for an early 2025 retirement in 2021. Initially, at least one portion of the plant was meant to stay online until 2040.

“It's voluntary for the Campbell Plant to be closing (this) early,” Ottawa County Commissioner Allison Miedema said in February. “That was a voluntary decision. This wasn’t a mandate that was put on them.”

The decision was spurred by Consumers’ Clean Energy Plan, which calls for eliminating coal as an energy source in 2025. The plan was released in the wake of state law requiring Michigan to produce all of its energy from clean sources by 2040.

The Campbell Plant began operations in 1962, generating nearly 1,500 megawatts of electricity on a 2,000-acre property. The plant's closure would've marked the end of Consumers' electricity generation from coal.

Retirement and restoration of the property was expected to begin later this year and last until 2030. Work includes the removal of coal residuals, backfilling the cold pile with clean fill, ash remediation with Ashcor, removal of a warm water discharge pipe and relocation of multiple bird boxes. It wasn't immediately clear how that timeline will be affected by the order, or what pre-shutdown activities may already have taken place.

MISO is responsible for power across 15 states and one Canadian Province. In 2024, 26% of the authority's energy came from coal.

According to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, MISO is listed as ""high risk,"" meaning shortfalls to the energy supply can occur at normal peak conditions. That's the worst ranking on NERC’s Risk Area Summary for 2025-2029 — and MISO is the only grid that's earned it.

“The only way the lights can come on is if there’s enough power into the grid serving our area collectively,” said Ottawa County Commissioner Josh Brugger. “... I don’t like coal. I think there ... are other options, green energy, natural gas — but at the same time, we’ve got business, we’ve got industry, we’ve got residents all throughout the grid that need that power.”

Commissioners passed a resolution Feb. 25, making a “formal appeal” to the MPSC to reconsider shutdown plans for the Campbell Plant; but officials said the decision was already made. The board voted against taking legal action at Miedema's insistence in April, and noted the previous resolution had been shared with the federal government, which some officials hoped would spur action.

""Today's emergency order ensures that Michiganders and the greater Midwest region do not lose critical power generation capability as summer begins and electricity demand regularly (reaches) high levels,"" wrote Energy Secretary Chris Wright in a statement announcing the order.

""This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families.""

The order, issued by the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, was delivered in accordance with President Donald Trump's Executive Order: Declaring a National Energy Emergency. It will ensure power generation availability in the region doesn't dip below 2024 capacity levels, according to the government's statement.

Consumers Energy was set to close the 1,560 megawatt J.H. Campbell plant at the end of the month. On Friday, the Department of Energy issued a 90-day emergency order to keep the lights on.

Secretary of Energy Chris Wright says keeping this open is important for grid security.

The DOE explains that the Campbell plant needs to remain available for operation, minimizing any potential generation shortfall that could lead to unnecessary power outages.

“Today’s emergency order ensures that Michiganders and the greater midwest region do not lose critical power generation capability as summer begins and electricity demand regularly reach high levels,"" Wright said. ""This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families. With President Trump’s leadership, the Energy Department is hard at work securing the American people access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy that powers their lives regardless of whether the wind is blowing, or the sun is shining.”

This is also a hot topic for Ottawa County commissioners who were looking to keep this open for the past several months.

Commissioner Allison Miedema wrote, ""this is great news as we will preserve access to baseload power for Michigan.""

Commissioner Jacob Bonnema added, ""Grid stability is a major priority for our county. Numerous business owners are concerned about this issue.""

In 2021, Consumers Energy filed a proposal with the Michigan Public Service Commission, laying out its plan to close the plant in 2025.

It had previously planned on closing a portion of the coal-fired facility in 2031 and completing its decommissioning in 2040.

The new timeline fell in line with the utility company's clean energy goal of eliminating coal use by 2025.

Consumers did send us a statement. They say they'll comply with the 90-day pause from the Department of Energy. The company is also reviewing the executive action and the overall impact on the company.

For me, this came to mind last week, when the Trump administration announced that it was rolling back guidelines meant to prevent the spread of “forever chemicals,” which have been linked to cancer and heart disease.

This week, Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency chief, Lee Zeldin, launched what I’d describe as a vocal defense of some forever chemicals, claiming that research is inconclusive and framing the Biden administration’s regulations as too onerous for corporations.

In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin said entities that provide water to the masses deserve “more flexibility to be able to come into compliance,” which sounds like bureaucratic jargon that effectively means companies should have more leeway and not be forced to meet strict standards.

As the saying goes, “the devil doesn’t need an advocate.”

And I don’t think cancer-causing chemicals do either. And keep in mind: This move is coming from the same administration whose health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has spread conspiracy theories about fluoridated water.

In addition, House Republicans approved a measure early Thursday that would roll back the Biden administration’s guidelines meant to prevent air pollution. The GOP-led Senate approved a similar measure last month, and the House version is headed to Trump’s desk to be signed into law.

As The Hill reported:

The House early Thursday morning voted to eliminate a Biden-era rule that sought to crack down on toxic air pollution, sending the resolution to President Trump’s desk. The vote was 216-212, and Trump is expected to sign the measure. The vote took place overnight as the House debated the GOP’s megabill of Trump’s priorities. The Biden-era policy required polluters that had once been considered “major” emitters of seven types of pollution to continue to follow strict pollution control and reporting requirements.

Senate Republicans also bypassed the filibuster this week in order to kill California’s air pollution standards that regulate vehicles’ emissions. California Gov. Gavin Newsom hit the nail on the head while vowing to fight the move, saying the GOP’s legislation stands to “make America smoggy again.”

The past week has highlighted the ruse undergirding the GOP’s Make America Healthy Again rhetoric. As Trump, Kennedy and others in the MAGA movement portray themselves as faithful stewards of Americans’ health, this administration and its allies in Congress appear to be doing everything in their power to make it easier for dangerous toxins to reach the masses.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250522-trump-ch-1631-0eeaac.jpg",N,,2025-05-24 12:17:54.282669

As lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries increase in performance and drop in price, large-scale energy storage projects are taking off en masse.
In fact, the growth of the energy storage sector now outpaces the growth rate of electric vehicle sales.
But demand for storage batteries surged 51%, according to Rho Motion, and is on track to expand by 40% this year,” reports Reuters.
As our grids become increasingly dependent on variable energies like wind and solar, energy storage becomes more essential.","The energy storage sector is booming. As lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries increase in performance and drop in price, large-scale energy storage projects are taking off en masse. In fact, the growth of the energy storage sector now outpaces the growth rate of electric vehicle sales. For now, electric vehicles still dominate overall battery demand, but energy storage is growing so rapidly that the sector is expected to make up about a fifth of the market in the next five years, according to a forecast by Rho Motion, an energy transition consultancy.

“Global EV sales still grew 23% last year. But demand for storage batteries surged 51%, according to Rho Motion, and is on track to expand by 40% this year,” reports Reuters.

One of the major benefits of LFP batteries is that, unlike traditional lithium-ion batteries, this format does not include cobalt or nickel, which have historically been the costliest part of battery manufacturing. In fact, Tesla announced an ambitious plan to phase out lithium-ion batteries back in 2020. At the time, scientists thought this goal to be so lofty as to be nearly impossible, as cobalt is extremely energy dense and allows vehicles to travel for longer distances without a charge. Today, there are some electric vehicle models that are using cobalt-free lithium-iron batteries, but these are largely models from Chinese automakers, including BYD, which overtook Tesla to become the world's biggest electric vehicle seller in 2024.

These developments have thrown global markets for nickel and cobalt into disarray. “Anticipating a demand surge, production ramped up - particularly in top nickel miner Indonesia and leading cobalt exporter Democratic Republic of Congo,” Reuters reported earlier this month. “But a lack of affordable EV models and the slow roll-out of charging infrastructure have slowed EV uptake among consumers outside China, leading some carmakers to scale back their electrification plans.” This has caused the price of cobalt and nickel to plummet.

But the prices of LFP batteries have also been falling. In the last year and a half, lithium-iron batteries has been cut in half. The increased uptake of these batteries will likely also batter the cobalt and nickel markets, while providing a boost to lithium demand and potential lithium prices as well. But in the immediate term, it’s fantastic news for the energy storage industry, which can now scale up their projects without breaking the bank.

While these technological and economic developments have been major catalysts for the recent proliferation of large-scale energy-storage projects, the energy storage sector has been poised for stratospheric growth for some time now. Last year, The Economist reported that the energy storage sector was gearing up to be “clean energy’s next trillion-dollar business.” In the near term, Allied Market Research estimates that the sector will reach $329.1 billion by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate of 5.2% from 2023 to 2032. And UBS bank calculates that global storage capacity will have to expand by a factor of eight to keep up with the expansion of renewable energy.

As our grids become increasingly dependent on variable energies like wind and solar, energy storage becomes more essential. These batteries are used to capture excess energy supply when the sun is shining on solar panels and the wind is blowing through turbines, to then feed energy back into the grid when energy demand outstrips supply. This is paramount for energy security, as evidenced by the crippling blackouts in Spain and Portugal earlier this month.

The drivers of growth for energy storage are significant enough to keep projections steady even in the face of geopolitical turmoil. “Growth in the U.S. - the world's second-biggest energy storage market, still dependent upon Chinese imports - will face headwinds in the next few years due to tariff uncertainty, analysts say,” reports Reuters. “But long-term growth is intact.”

Campbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Michigan, online through August.
The plant had been slated for permanent shutdown on May 31 as part of Consumers Energy’s transition away from coal.
“Consumers Energy plans to comply with the 90-day pause from the Department of Energy.
“Donald Trump invoking the Federal Power Act is an illegal abuse of his presidential authority,” Greg Wannier, senior attorney for the Sierra Club, said in a statement.","The Trump administration has ordered a West Michigan coal plant to remain operational through the summer, invoking emergency federal powers in a move that has prompted criticism from environmental advocates, legal analysts, and clean energy proponents.

On Friday, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued an emergency order directing the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), in coordination with Consumers Energy, to keep the 1,560-megawatt J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Michigan, online through August. The plant had been slated for permanent shutdown on May 31 as part of Consumers Energy’s transition away from coal.

The order was issued under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act and aligns with President Donald Trump’s April 8 executive order declaring a national “energy emergency.” The Department of Energy said the action is necessary “to minimize the risk of blackouts and address critical grid security issues in the Midwestern region of the United States ahead of the high electricity demand expected this summer.”

“Today’s emergency order ensures that Michiganders and the greater Midwest region do not lose critical power generation capability as summer begins and electricity demand regularly reach high levels,” Wright said in a statement. “This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families.”

Consumers Energy confirmed it will comply.

“Consumers Energy plans to comply with the 90-day pause from the Department of Energy. We are reviewing the executive action and the overall impact on our company,” said Katie Carey, Director of Media Relations.

However, environmental and public health groups strongly condemned the move. The Sierra Club called the emergency declaration a “sham” and criticized the administration for overriding a previously approved retirement plan supported by state regulators and energy experts.

“Donald Trump invoking the Federal Power Act is an illegal abuse of his presidential authority,” Greg Wannier, senior attorney for the Sierra Club, said in a statement. “Coal is expensive, outdated, and deadly, and all of the relevant parties, including MISO… concluded years ago that J.H. Campbell could retire without causing any grid reliability problems.”

The Clean Air Task Force estimates the Campbell plant is responsible for 44 premature deaths and 455 asthma attacks annually. Sierra Club Michigan organizer Bryan Smigielski said, “This blatant act of federal overreach… is being imposed against the wishes of Michigan consumers, businesses, regulators, and elected leaders.”

Critics also questioned the reliability justification.

“The Department of Energy muscling in on reliability in ways that can be abused,” said Tyson Slocum of Public Citizen in a statement, while Ari Peskoe of Harvard Law School wrote on Bluesky that the April 8 order “imagines that a 90-year old law about power sector ‘emergencies’ empowers the Dept of Energy to subsidize any power plant in the country.

House Republicans were jubilant after muscling through President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and immigration package by a single vote. But across the Capitol, senators were more cautious.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune can afford to lose three Republican senators and still pass the bill, and there are more than that, right now, who have problems with it. Like the House, he will have to balance the concerns from moderate and conservative members of his conference.

Republicans’ aspirational deadline is July 4, ahead of a potential debt default. Thune said groups of senators had already been meeting to discuss the legislation and that they would want to take some time to review it. “And then we’ll put our stamp on it,” he said.

“We’ll see how it goes,” Thune said. “What does it take to get to 51?”

A look at a few of the potential sticking points in the Senate:

Spending

Several Republican senators have said the House’s multi-trillion-dollar tax package doesn't have enough savings. Thune said many in his GOP conference favor the tax breaks in the bill but “when it comes to the spending side of the equation, this is a unique moment in time, in history, where we have the House and the Senate and the White House, and an opportunity to do something meaningful about how to control government spending.”

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., a sharp critic of the House bill, wants the United States to go back to pre-pandemic spending levels. He has indicated he would be a no on the bill as it stands now, and he says he has at least three other senators aligned with him.

Medicaid and food stamp cuts

Senate Republicans are generally on board with stricter work requirements for older Medicaid recipients that make up much of the bill’s $700 billion savings from the program. But Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Susan Collins of Maine, among others, have voiced concerns about other changes in the bill that could potentially cut funding to rural hospitals or increase copays and other health care costs for recipients.

The senators could have a powerful ally in Trump, who has frequently said he doesn’t want cuts to Medicaid, even as he’s endorsed the House bill. Hawley said he talked to Trump this week on the phone and “his exact words were, ‘Don’t touch it, Josh.’”

Others have been wary of the House bill’s effort to shift some costs of the food stamp program to states, potentially a major issue for some red states that have high numbers of food aid recipients. The House bill saves $290 billion from the food aid, and Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman said the Senate savings will be “probably be a little bit lower.”

Permanent tax cuts

Thune said this week that “one of the principal differences” between the House and Senate is that Republican senators want to make many of the tax cuts permanent while the House bill has shorter time frames for many of its cuts — including no taxes on tips, overtime pay, car-loan interest and others.

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo said Thursday that trying to make some of the cuts permanent is “an objective right now.""

How to pay for it all

One of the biggest questions for the Senate: whether the tax breaks really need to be offset by cuts elsewhere.

To offset the costs of lost tax revenue, House Republicans have proposed more than $1 trillion in spending reductions across Medicaid, food stamps and green energy program rollbacks. However, Republicans in the Senate do not believe there is a cost associated with permanently extending the existing taxes, setting up a political and procedural showdown ahead.

Debt limit

The House bill includes a $4 trillion increase in the debt limit. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that the United States is on track to run out of money to pay its bills as early as August without congressional action.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he won’t support the bill if the debt ceiling increase is included. He said he’s willing to consider it if it’s taken out.

But most Republican senators want it to avoid a separate fight that would require 60 votes in the Senate. Texas Sen. John Cornyn said that if they deal with the debt ceiling outside of the legislation then they would have to “pay a king’s ransom” to Democrats to get enough votes.

Energy tax credits

Several Republican senators have said they are concerned about House provisions that repeal or phase out clean energy tax credits passed in 2022 that have spurred investment in many states.

Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Curtis of Utah and Moran wrote Thune a letter last month arguing that removing the credits could ""create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning, and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy.”

Artificial intelligence

The House bill would ban states and localities from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade, giving the federal government more control over the policy. It’s an approach that has been favored by the AI industry but has drawn concern from members on both sides of the aisle.

And even if it has enough support, the provision may not pass muster from the Senate parliamentarian because it’s unlikely to have impact on the federal budget.

Other issues

With a narrow margin for victory and only 53 Republicans in the Senate, every senator’s top priority takes on outsize importance. South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds said he supports the House bill but that the way that it deals with spectrum auctions — selling off telecommunications signal rights — is a “dealbreaker” for him. He said he’s in talks with other senators on the issue.

Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., said one of his main goals is that they include money for certain farm safety net programs and set up passage for a broader farm bill later this year.

“In the end, we have to have 50 plus one supporting it,” Hoeven said. “So we’ve got some work to do.""",https://www.westkentuckystar.com/getattachment/70369761-ae89-498e-8be0-255687446a4e/Pix-US-Capitol-Building.JPG?lang=en-US&width=600&height=453&ext=.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 17:07:53.072699

And, after an all-night session, the measure, entitled the ""one big, beautiful bill,"" squeaked through by a single vote.

It'll now go to the Senate, which will leave its own mark on the bill. But here's what's in the legislation that was passed by the House Thursday.

Tax cuts and extensions

At the center of the legislation — and accounting for its biggest expense — are the provisions extending Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. With the cuts slated to sunset at year's end, the extension and new tax cuts have been a key priority for congressional Republicans and the White House.

Beyond the 2017 tax cuts, the legislation includes a number of tax cuts that the president touted on the campaign trail. It includes no taxes on tips for workers in the service industry, like those who work at restaurants and bars, as well as people who work in the beauty industry. But it's a temporary exemption that expires at the end of 2028. The package also includes no taxes on overtime through 2028. And the new legislation would allow tax deductions on up to $10,000 in interest on auto loans for cars assembled in the U.S. This provision would be in place until 2029.

The bill would also eliminate a longstanding $200 tax on gun silencers, which has been on the books since Congress passed the National Firearms Act in 1934.

And among the bill's provisions is a temporary $500 increase in the child tax credit, bringing it to $2,500 through 2028.

The package also includes a tax on remittances, imposing a tax on cash payments sent by non-U.S. citizens to family members in their home countries. Though the bill initially would have subjected individuals to a 5% excise tax, the managers amendment, which contained the updates to the bill, lowered the tax to 3.5%.

Medicaid restrictions

The legislation includes changes to Medicaid, a popular entitlement program that provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans — imposing work requirements for able-bodied adults without children, more frequent eligibility checks, cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants and banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services for children and adults.

The amendment speeds up the implementation of the work requirements from Jan. 1, 2029, to no later than Dec. 31, 2026, a change sought by hardliners. The work requirements would apply to Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 18 and 65, and those who do not have a child under the age of 7.

Increasing the State and Local Tax Deduction, or SALT

Also included in the package is an increase to the cap on the State and Local Tax Deduction, which was imposed by the 2017 Trump tax law and currently stands at $10,000.

Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.

The package initially included a $30,000 cap, but blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support, and they ultimately reached an agreement with leadership to increase the deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000.

Border security funding

Though the bulk of the funding allocated in the legislation goes toward tax cuts, it also includes resources for border security and defense. Among the bill's provisions is $46.5 billion for the border wall, $4.1 billion to hire Border Patrol agents and other personnel and more than $2 billion for signing and retention bonuses for Border Patrol agents. It also includes an additional $1,000 fee for people who are filing for asylum in the U.S.

The amendment to the legislation added an additional $12 billion for expenses related to border security.

$1,000 ""Trump accounts"" for child savings

The legislation also creates $1,000 savings accounts for children, which were originally titled ""MAGA accounts"" — Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement. The name has been updated to ""Trump accounts."" Under the plan, the federal government will contribute $1,000 to the accounts of children born between 2024 and 2028. Parents can contribute up to $5,000 a year. The funds, which can begin to be distributed once the child turns 18, can be used for higher education, job training and the purchase of their first home.

While income on the accounts can grow on a tax-deferred basis, distributions for qualified expenses, like those mentioned above, would be taxed at a long-term capital gains rate. Another type of education savings vehicle, 529 accounts, enables parents to save and grow the accounts on a tax-deferred basis, too, but the money can be withdrawn for specific education-related expenses tax-free.

Restrictions on food stamps

The package also raises the upper age requirement for able-bodied adults without children to qualify for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, or food stamps. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18-54 must meet work requirements. The House bill would update the age requirement to 18-64 and would also shift more of the costs to states.

Rolling back clean energy programs

The bill would also roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, like an earlier phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles. A late addition to the bill would move up the timeline to end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants as well, requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028. The measure makes an exception for nuclear plants, which must be under construction by the end of 2028.

The legislation also adds annual federal registration fees for EV and hybrid car owners: $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids.

Addressing the debt limit

With a major deadline to address the debt limit on the horizon, the legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/05/22/2e1c73d8-e064-41ae-ae08-12e0e44beda9/thumbnail/1200x630/120e7070576fe031508b47984ab08c44/gettyimages-2215736910.jpg?v=48f078ae8a74a1412614b0db6f935e48,N,,2025-05-24 11:06:38.183382

(Reporting by Rishabh Jaiswal in Bengaluru and Lucia Mutikani in Washington; Editing by Sharon Singleton and Diane Craft)","WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) confirmed on Saturday that it was drafting a plan to eliminate all limits on greenhouse gases from coal and gas-fired power plants in the United States and would be published after interagency review.

""Many have voiced concerns that the last administration's replacement for that rule is similarly overreaching and an attempt to shut down affordable and reliable electricity generation in the United States, raising prices for American families, and increasing the country's reliance on foreign forms of energy,"" a spokesperson for the agency said. ""As part of this reconsideration, EPA is developing a proposed rule.""

The draft plan was first reported by the New York Times, which said the EPA argued in its proposed regulation that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from power plants that burn fossil fuels ""do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution"" or to climate change because they are a small and declining share of global emissions.

The EPA also said that eliminating those emissions would have no meaningful effect on public health and welfare, the report added.

According to the United Nations, fossil fuels are by far the largest contributors to global warming, accounting for more than 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90% of carbon dioxide emissions.

The U.S. government under President Donald Trump has moved quickly to remove all federal spending related to efforts to combat climate change and to eliminate any regulation aimed at addressing greenhouse gas emissions as part of its effort to bolster oil, gas and mining operations.

On Thursday, the U.S. House of Representatives advanced Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill, which may end numerous green-energy subsidies that have supported the renewable energy sector.

Trump's budget package - which he calls ""one big beautiful bill"" - would eliminate funding established under former U.S. President Joe Biden's administration through the Inflation Reduction Act and repeal grants intended to reduce air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions or purchase electric heavy-duty vehicles.

Trump in his first term promised to repeal regulations focused on reducing carbon pollution from power plants.

""We continue to build on that progress now,"" said EPA administrator Lee Zeldin.

GDP rises slightly, as labor supply and savings respond to a reduced social safety net, but the dynamic score is larger ($3.2 trillion) than the conventional.

Key Points

Tax provisions approved by the House Ways and Means Committee would extend and expand major components of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which we estimate will increase primary deficits by $4,348 billion ($4.3 trillion) over 10 years. Three other Committees increase primary deficits by another $230 billion. These changes would be partly offset by spending cuts of $1,791 billion, for a total conventional cost of $2,787 billion.

Despite increasing debt by 7.2 percent in 10 years and 12.8 percent in 30 years, the bill would increase GDP by 0.4 percent in 10 years and 0.7 percent in 30 years. The average wage falls slightly in 10 years but increases by 0.3 percent in 30 years. Primary deficits increase by more (to $3,198 billion) in the budget window when accounting for these positive economic dynamics, due to microeconomic responses and compositional effects described in the brief.

The positive economic gains are driven by increases in savings and labor supply, as households face a weaker social safety net associated with reductions in spending. On a conventional basis, households in the first income quintile lose about $820 in 2026, reflecting net reductions in taxes and transfers, including cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. The top 10% of the income distribution receives about 70 percent of the total value of the legislation. (Under current law, the top 10 percent of the income distribution pays about 70 percent of all federal taxes). On a dynamic lifetime basis, lower-income households and some in the middle class are worse off, despite positive economic effects.

House Reconciliation Bill: Budget, Economic, and Distributional Effects (May 22, 2025)

Introduction

Yesterday morning, the House of Representatives approved legislation bringing together proposals from its various committees under the Fiscal Year 2025 Concurrent Budget Resolution’s reconciliation instructions. Together, these proposals make up the House reconciliation bill.

This analysis scores the legislative text as currently written against current law. Future analysis will consider the effects of making various temporary tax provisions permanent.

House Committee Proposals

Table 1 summarizes the deficit effects of the legislation passed by the House of Representatives on May 22. PWBM estimates that, as written, the bill would increase primary deficits by $2,787 billion from 2025 to 2034, just under the target maximum in the reconciliation instructions. Under the Budget Resolution, Congress may increase primary deficits over the 10-year budget window by up to $2.8 trillion only.

PWBM estimates that the House Ways and Means Committee’s tax proposals would reduce revenues by $4.3 trillion over the budget Increases in spending under the Armed Services, Judiciary, and Homeland Security Committees’ jurisdictions would add another $230 billion to primary deficits. While all other committees have proposed net spending cuts or revenue increases, these savings amount to only $1.8 trillion in total, offsetting less than 40 percent of the $4.6 trillion increase in deficits from tax cuts and spending increases.

House Ways and Means Committee Tax Proposals

Table 2 reports the revenue effects of the reconciliation legislation approved by the House Ways and Means Committee, which would extend and expand major components of the TCJA, create several new tax benefits for specific forms of income, and eliminate or substantially limit a wide range of energy-related tax credits.

Below, we summarize the major provisions and new tax proposals from the Ways and Means Committee. For an overview of the proposal, see the Bipartisan Policy Center. For detailed explanations of its provisions, see the Joint Committee on Taxation. Appendix Table 1 (at the end of this report) presents detailed revenue estimates for these proposals.

Extend TCJA individual and estate tax provisions: Extending the TCJA would retain the current individual income tax rates, tax brackets, standard deduction, limits on itemized deductions, tax credits, estate tax exemption, and other tax parameters in place since TCJA went into effect. See our previous analysis of the House reconciliation proposals and TCJA extension for additional details. For provisions of the TCJA that are expanded or altered under the Ways and Means proposal (such as the section 199A deduction for pass-through businesses and the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions), we consider those expansions separately and estimate their effects relative to extension of the original version in the TCJA.

Restore TCJA business and international tax provisions: The bill would temporarily restore the cost recovery rules initially in place under the TCJA through 2029, including the special bonus depreciation deduction for qualified investment, the immediate deductibility of research and experimentation costs, and the more relaxed net interest limitation based on income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. It would also permanently maintain the section 250 deduction and effective statutory tax rates on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) and foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) close to their current levels (they are set to rise in 2026 under current law) and maintain a lower rate in the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT).

Expand TCJA individual and estate tax provisions:

Provide an additional year of inflation adjustment for some ordinary tax bracket thresholds: For all but the top two ordinary rate bracket thresholds (i.e. the 35 percent and 37 percent bracket), the bill provides an additional year of inflation adjustment, setting the base year for calculating the adjusted value to 2016, rather than 2017. This produces bracket thresholds that are higher than they otherwise would be, relative to a simple extension of the TCJA.

Enhanced standard deduction: The bill provides an additional year of inflation adjustment for the standard deduction, beginning in calendar year 2026. This produces a standard deduction that is higher than it would be otherwise, relative to a simple extension of the TCJA. In addition, the bill provides for a temporary enhancement to the standard deduction, institutes a bonus amount to the standard deduction of $2000 for joint returns, $1500 for head of household returns, and $1000 for all others. This bonus amount begins in tax year 2025, is not indexed for inflation, and expires after 2028.

Enhanced child tax credit: The bill temporarily increases the value of the child tax credit from a nominal $2000 to a nominal $2500 per child. This increase begins in tax year 2025 and expires after 2028. After 2028, the child tax credit reverts to the TCJA value of $2000 per child. In 2029 and thereafter, the value of the credit is adjusted for inflation, using 2024 as a base year.

Enhanced deduction for qualified business income: The bill provides for a permanent enhancement to the section 199A deduction for qualified business income beginning in tax year 2026, increasing the deduction rate from 20 percent to 23 percent of qualified business income (relative to a simple TCJA extension). It also modifies the rules dictating the limitation of qualified business income based on income and business type/characteristics, relative to a simple TCJA extension.

Enhanced estate tax exemption: The bill permanently increases the estate tax exemption to $15 million (up from $10 million in 2017 dollars under a simple TCJA extension), beginning in tax year 2026. This amount is indexed for inflation thereafter.

Expand TCJA business and international tax provisions: The bill would increase the limits on immediate expensing of investment under section 179 and temporarily expand the special bonus depreciation deduction to structures used in production activities through 2028. It also extends and expands Opportunity Zones, relaxes size thresholds for certain requirements on small manufacturers, and excludes services income from the U.S. Virgin Islands from the GILTI regime.

New individual tax provisions:

Limit itemized deductions: The bill institutes a new limit on itemized deductions beginning in tax year 2026. This limitation applies to filers with taxable income that exceeds the 37 percent ordinary rate threshold for their filing status and reduces the allowable non-SALT itemized deductions by 2/37 of the amount by which taxable income exceeds this threshold (or the total amount of itemized deductions, whichever is smaller). A similar limit, with a larger reduction, is applied to SALT deductions (described below).

No tax on tips: The bill provides a temporary deduction for qualified tip income, available to all filers regardless of itemizing status, beginning in tax year 2025. The bill sets general guidelines for forthcoming regulations governing what constitutes qualified tip income. These guidelines are intended to limit the occupations for which tipped income will qualify for the deduction. The deduction is limited to non “highly compensated employees,” generally individuals making less than $160,000 per year in 2025 dollars. This deduction ends after 2028.

No tax on overtime: The bill provides a temporary deduction for the bonus amount of eligible overtime pay, available to all filers regardless of itemizing status, beginning in tax year 2025. The deduction only applies to overtime covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act, and is limited to non “highly compensated employees,” like the tip income deduction. This deduction ends after 2028.

Additional deduction for seniors: The bill provides a new temporary bonus deduction for all individuals who have attained the age of 65. This deduction is $4,000 per individual and phases out at a rate of 4 percent of AGI over $150,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly, or $75,000 for all other filers. This deduction is available to all qualifying taxpayers regardless of filing status beginning in tax year 2025, and it expires after 2028.

No tax on auto loan interest: The bill provides a temporary deduction for qualified passenger vehicle loan interest beginning in 2025. The bill outlines several restrictions on what constitutes qualified auto loan interest. It also limits the total deductible amount to $10,000 per year, or 20 percent of the taxpayer’s AGI more than $100,000 ($200,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly), whichever is lower. This deduction expires after 2028.

Charitable deduction for non-itemizers: The bill provides a temporary deduction for charitable contributions, available to non-itemizers. This deduction is limited to $300 for married taxpayers filing jointly, and $150 for all other filers. It is available beginning in tax year 2025 and expires after 2028.

Permanently increase the SALT deduction cap to $40,000: In the 2017 TCJA, the previously unlimited individual state and local tax (SALT) deduction was capped at $10,000, meaning itemizers could only claim a maximum of $10,000 of their state and local tax liability as a This bill provides a permanent new SALT deduction cap of $40,000, beginning in This cap phases out at a rate of 30 percent of adjusted gross income over $500,000, to a minimum cap of Starting in 2026, the applicable cap and phase out thresholds grow by 1 percent each year through 2033, and persist at the 2033 nominal value thereafter. The allowable deduction after the cap is further reduced using a formula similar to the new itemized deduction limit described above, but at a higher rate of 5/37 of each dollar over the 37 percent bracket.

Alternative Minimum Tax Inflation Adjustment: The 2017 TCJA set higher exemptions and exemption phase out thresholds for the Alternative Minium Tax It indexed these thresholds for inflation, with a base year of 2017. This bill, along with extending the TCJA AMT parameters, resets their nominal value in 2026, effectively “resetting” the inflation adjustments that occurred since the TCJA passed, and inflation adjusts them using a 2025 base year thereafter. This lowers the exemption and phase out thresholds, and therefore subjects more income to the AMT, relative to a simple TCJA extension.

Repeal or modify energy and clean vehicle tax credits: The bill eliminates or substantially limits several tax credits designed to encourage investment and production of clean energy, alternative fuels, and electric vehicles. A number of these credits created or expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2021. They include credits for individuals (such as clean vehicle and residential efficiency credits) and businesses (such as energy production and manufacturing credits).

Major Spending Cuts

Table 1 also shows the deficit reduction achieved by committees instructed to reduce spending or increase non-tax revenues. Below, we summarize the major spending reductions proposed by various committees.

Changes to Medicaid and Health Insurance Marketplaces: The Energy and Commerce Committee’s proposal includes changes to major federal health programs. It would cut Medicaid spending by imposing work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents, increasing eligibility checks to twice a year, reducing the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for states covering undocumented immigrants, introducing cost-sharing for Medicaid expansion enrollees, banning new or increased provider taxes used to draw federal funds, and capping provider payments at Medicare rates. It would also codify proposed changes to the federally subsidized Health Insurance Marketplaces that would reduce participation in the Marketplaces. These proposals would reduce the deficit by more than $900 billion over the budget window.

Changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP): The Agriculture Committee’s proposal would reduce spending on SNAP by more than $290 billion over ten years. The bill would shift a significant portion of SNAP benefit costs to states with a new cost-sharing formula linked to payment error rates. It would also create additional work documentation requirements, limit the growth of the Thrifty Food Plan, shift administrative costs to states, and make other changes to reduce federal SNAP costs.

Changes to student loans: The Education and Workforce Committee’s proposal would eliminate subsidized and income-driven loan repayment plans, impose new overall limitations on student borrowing, and tighten Pell Grant eligibility. Altogether, the Education and Workforce Committee’s proposal would reduce spending by $350 billion over the budget window. Under federal budget accounting rules, the lifetime subsidy costs of student loans are measured on an accrual basis and recorded up front. As a result, almost $200 billion of the Committee’s total savings are recorded in the budget immediately in Fiscal Year 2025.

Deficit Effects: Conventional and Dynamic

Table 3 reports the total conventional-basis cost of legislation of $2,787 billion over 10 years. Including dynamic effects does not reduce the legislative costs despite small, positive increases in GDP over the first decade, reported in Table 4 and discussed below. The actual savings from economic growth do not appear until 2033 and 2034 and are not enough to overcome higher costs in earlier years in the 10-year budget window. After 2033, the dynamic costs fall relative to conventional, a difference which persists until 2054.

Before 2033, two primary factors increase the dynamic costs relative to conventional:

First, some households that would otherwise have lost Medicaid without dynamics re-acquire access with dynamics by reducing their hours worked.

Second, despite increasing the number of hours worked in response to the legislation (Table 4), firm-level total wage bills are often flat or negative due to compositional effects. Specifically, lower-wage workers increase their hours worked, especially due to a reduction in the social safety net spending programs. However, higher-income households reduce their hours worked, as income effects slightly dominate substitution effects after reductions in marginal tax rates. While total productivity-weighted hours increase, lower-income households pay taxes at a lower marginal tax rate than higher-income households.

PWBM’s dynamic model --- an overlapping-generations (OLG) lifecycle model with uninsurable idiosyncratic risks --- allows us to capture these two effects in detail. Without this framework, the positive response to labor and savings from an increase in uninsurable risk could not be properly incorporated against the negative effects of more government debt. Moreover, the OLG model captures the microeconomic effects associated with Medicaid enrollment and the tax compositional effects noted above, which are important for explaining why 10-year costs with positive dynamics need not be smaller than conventional costs.

Economic Effects

Table 4 reports the economic effects of the legislation over the next 30 years. By 2034, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is projected to be 0.4 percent higher than under current law, while the capital stock will be 0.4 percent higher, and federal debt will increase by 7.2 percent. Work hours are expected to rise by 0.9 percent, even as wages fall by 0.2 percent. Despite higher debt, the simultaneous increase in labor supply and capital accumulation reflects that households are less protected from health and income shocks due to cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. As a result, they work longer hours and increase precautionary savings.

Over the next 30 years, the House reconciliation bill increases GDP growth slightly, and GDP would be 0.7 percent higher in 2054 than under current law. That growth is driven by a 1.5 percent larger capital stock and a 0.6 percent increase in hours worked. At the same time, the House reconciliation bill increases debt by 12.8 percent over the next 30 years.

Distributional Effects: Conventional

Table 5 reports conventional-basis distributional effects by income quintile as the percentage change in income after changes in taxes and government spending. The average household in the lowest quintile – with a household income between $0 and $16,999 – would lose about $820 under the House reconciliation bill. That figure represents a 14.6 percent loss in average income for that group and a 5.7 percent reduction in the median income for that group. Households with incomes between $17,000 and $50,999 would lose $430 on average. Lower income households tend to fare worse as spending cuts deepen over time.

Most of the gains for the top 0.1% derive from a boost to corporate profits from restoring the TCJA’s original cost recovery regime and maintaining lower tax rates on multinationals. In the near-term, the temporary restoration and expansion of bonus depreciation and other cost recovery provisions produce large gains in after-tax profits. When they expire after 2029, those gains are partially and temporarily reversed, due in part to firms moving investment to earlier years before expiration and thus reducing investment in 2030. By 2033, the international tax provisions become the dominant factor. The net effect is a partial u-shape in gains over time for this group.

Distributional Effects: Dynamic Estimates

Dynamic distributional analysis considers how a policy affects households across the income and age distribution, including the unborn (represented by a negative age index at the time of the reform). It asks how much, on average, households in each (income, age) bucket value the proposed policy change over their entire lifetime, represented as a one-time transfer at the time of the policy change. Dynamic distributional analysis is the standard in academic research, where conventional analysis is rarely used due to several key limitations that dynamic analysis addresses. It is also the natural welfare metric of the OLG lifecycle model with uninsurable risk, which is the paradigm model in economics for modeling the bidirectional equilibrium relationship between microeconomic and macroeconomic responses to a policy change.

Table 6 reports policy “equivalent variations” for the same cases and versions reported in Table 4. A positive equivalent variation means that the person would be better off under the policy reform; a negative equivalent variation means that the person would be worse off under the policy reform. For example, as shown in Table 6, a household aged 30 in the 20th to 40th percentile of the income distribution loses about $11,300 of value from this policy bundle, as shown by the negative value. Put differently, this household is indifferent between adopting this policy bundle and losing a one-time payment of $11,300 without this policy change. However, a household aged 30 in the top 20th percentile of income gains an equivalent of $27,400. This household would be indifferent between this policy bundle and a one-time payment of $27,400 to avoid adopting this bundle.

Table 6 shows that households most affected by the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP—those in the bottom income quintile—experience the largest losses under this bill, averaging almost $30,000 in lifetime value for the working-age population. In contrast, working-age households in the top income quintile generally benefit from lower taxes, gaining an average of almost $45,000. Working-age households in the middle of the income distribution also lose, with an average lifetime reduction of $1,300, as they face a chance of needing spending programs that have been reduced. All future low- to middle-income generations are projected to experience lifetime losses under the bill, ranging from $600 for middle-income households to $8,500 for low-income households. In contrast, higher-income earners are projected to see lifetime gains between $7,400 to almost $19,000. These losses for lower-income groups are primarily driven by a reduced social safety net and rising federal debt, while generous tax cuts account for the gains among higher-income households.

Brownfields are abandoned or underused properties, often industrial or commercial, where redevelopment is complicated because of hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants in the soil. There are dozens of these sites scattered across the state, according to officials.

The grants will help fund assessments of brownfields, a revolving loan fund and cleanup grants. The funds come from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Brownfields Program. The program began in 1995 and has provided nearly $2.9 billion in brownfields grants to assess and clean up contaminated properties and return blighted properties to productive reuse.

As part of the overall $7 million, approximately $3.2 million are assessment grants, which will provide funding for brownfield inventories, planning, environmental assessments and community outreach. The other $3.75 million is part of revolving loan fund grants to help continue the work to carry out cleanup and redevelopment projects on contaminated brownfields sites. Supplemental funding for revolving loan fund grants is available to recipients that have depleted their funds and have viable cleanup projects ready for work, according to officials.

“Today’s brownfields announcement reflects EPA’s commitment to clean air, land, and water for every American,” said EPA regional administrator Mark Sanborn. “From rural towns to urban centers, we are helping communities across New England clean up contaminated sites and unlock new opportunities for economic growth and revitalization. Through partnerships with states, local governments, and the private sector, we’re returning blighted properties to productive use — and showing that a clean environment and economic development can go hand in hand.”

On Friday, the Connecitcut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection announced the applicants who are being awarded funding.

The Capitol Region Council of Governments has been selected to receive $750,000; DEEP has been selected to receive $2 million for a brownfields community-wide assessment grant for states and tribes; Connecticut Metropolitan Council of Governments has been selected to receive $1 million in supplemental funding for its revolving loan fund program; Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments has been selected to receive $2 million in supplemental funding for its Brownfields Revolving Loan Fund program; and Southeastern Connecticut Council of Governments has been selected to receive $1.2 million to lead a Brownfields Assessment Coalition Grant.

Among the sites that will benefit from the funding are the Collinsville Axe Factory in Canton, the Excelsior Plant and the Torrington and E. Farrel Corporation property in Ansonia, and the Connecticut Sports Group and Davidson Block properties in Bridgeport, officials said.

“DEEP congratulates the Capitol Region, Metropolitan, Naugatuck Valley, and Southeastern Councils of Governments on earning EPA brownfield grants. We are also proud to receive a $2 million Community-Wide Assessment Grant for Connecticut,” said DEEP commissioner Katie Dykes. “This funding will promote the cleanup of contaminated sites, turning long-abandoned properties into community assets that support public health, environmental safety and economic development. It’s a win for cleaner neighborhoods, stronger local economies and a more affordable, vibrant future.”

GAC’s move comes at a time of growing competition in the world’s sixth-largest automotive market, where sales of electric vehicles have been speeding up and other Chinese companies – such as BYD, Chery and GWM – have also made inroads in recent years.

The company, which last year had already announced plans to invest six billion reais (S$1.4 billion) in Brazil over five years, will launch in the country on Saturday selling four imported electric cars and a hybrid model.

It expects sales to reach 100,000 units in the next five years, according to GAC International president Wei Haigang.

“Brazil is a huge country and very important to us,” he said in an interview in Chinese through a Portuguese interpreter, adding that the automaker had a “long-term” strategy for the South American country.

Electrified vehicles represent the fastest-growing segment in the Brazilian market, with sales having jumped 37.4 per cent year on year in the first four months of 2025 to 70,450 units, whereas sales of light vehicles, in general, rose 3.4 per cent to 714,800 units, according to local group Fenabrave.

“We are aware that Brazil is an increasingly competitive market,” Wei said.

He noted that “external influences” such as the trade war between China and the United States triggered by US President Donald Trump’s trade policies and sweeping tariffs did not weigh on GAC’s plans in Brazil.

“We developed our strategy with the bilateral relationship between Brazil and China in mind.”

The effort is a bid to meet a coming surge in electricity demand and help the US reclaim its edge in nuclear energy. While the country was once the leader in deploying and producing nuclear power, it’s finished building only two new reactors in the last 30 years and shuttered existing plants, even as China and Russia race to deploy them.

Trump’s initiative to unleash nuclear energy could give a boost to an emission-free source of power that’s championed as a climate-friendly alternative to electricity generated by burning coal and natural gas. However, the president has cast nuclear energy as a complement, rather than a replacement, for fossil fuels.

“We are signing tremendous executive orders today that really will make us the real power in this industry,” Trump said as he issued the directives in the Oval Office, adding that nuclear technology “has come a long way, both in safety and costs”.

Trump was joined by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and energy industry executives including Constellation Energy CEO Joseph Dominguez and Jake DeWitte of Oklo.

The initiative represents the latest bid by an American president to jump-start the domestic nuclear industry, which has languished in recent decades. Former president Joe Biden last year laid out a plan to triple US nuclear capacity by 2050, and Trump’s new plan aims to quadruple it. It also comes as technology companies are clamouring for power to supply energy-hungry data centres.

The effort is likely to give a boost to companies developing small reactors, including Last Energy, Oklo, TerraPower and NuScale Power.

One of the orders also aims to get 10 large, conventional reactors under construction by 2030, potentially benefiting Westinghouse Electric, whose gigawatt-scale AP1000 design was the last commercial nuclear unit built in the US and has been embraced worldwide.

Trump’s nuclear initiative also would encourage the use of government financing to support the restart of shuttered nuclear plants, target five gigawatts worth of upgrades at existing sites and help spur the completion of others – potentially aiding South Carolina utility Santee Cooper’s bid to resume building two reactors at its VC Summer plant, where soaring costs prompted the company to halt construction in 2017.

However, Trump’s nuclear push comes as lawmakers move to phase out a government subsidy that’s seen as critical to helping propel construction of new reactors and support existing plants. Developers have said the change would create a significant barrier to building nuclear plants.

Under a bill that passed the House early Thursday, new and expanded advanced nuclear projects would be eligible to receive clean energy tax credits only as long as they begin construction by the end of 2028, while tax credits for existing nuclear power plants would expire at the end of 2031.

Trump’s initiative aims to spur construction of at least one reactor at US military installations. That would allow nuclear energy to power and operate critical defence facilities and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres, a senior White House official said. And, because that approach does not involve commercial plants, it lets developers bypass the customary approval process through the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

In the meantime, the NRC would also get an overhaul. Trump is ordering a reorganisation of the agency and a culling of its workforce in consultation with the president’s Department of Government Efficiency cost-cutting programme, along with fixed timelines for license approvals and “a wholesale revision” of its regulations.

While some developers have decried the lengthy and expensive process to secure NRC approval for proposed designs and renew licenses for existing facilities, some nuclear power advocates worry the effort may backfire by sparking regulatory upheaval and uncertainty.

If new reactor designs cannot be fully vetted within the president’s proposed 18-month deadline, they warn, the models could even be rejected altogether, an outcome that would likely undermine Trump’s deployment goals.

Trump is also ordering the NRC to reconsider radiation limits, saying its reliance on safety models assuming there is no safe exposure threshold has led to “a myopic policy of minimising even trivial risks”.

Some energy experts have expressed alarm about the president’s plan to strengthen the domestic supply chain for nuclear fuel, potentially creating a market for reprocessed radioactive material and surplus plutonium stockpiles. Former US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz this week warned that the proposal may lead “to the creation of additional stocks of weapons-usable materials”.

The president is also embracing the Energy Department’s Loan Programs Office as a potential source of financing for nuclear projects. Under Trump’s orders, the office would be directed to prioritise activities and resources for restarting shuttered plants, increasing output at existing sites, completing construction of unfinished reactors and building new advanced nuclear units.

Constellation’s Dominguez said current permitting processes waste time, especially as data centre operators and hyperscalers seek out 24/7 power supply. “We need to do this for America,” he said alongside Trump.

Reactors currently supply almost a tenth of the world’s power, including about 100 gigawatts of capacity in the US. Advocates say the industry needs to grow three-fold by 2050 to help avoid the most catastrophic consequences of climate change.

Like wind and solar plants, nuclear generates electricity without producing the greenhouse gas emissions that drive global warming. But reactors also have the advantage of running around the clock, delivering the non-stop power that’s in demand from AI companies and data centre operators.

The US was at the vanguard of installing nuclear power plants for decades, but China is now the world’s top builder, with roughly 30 reactors under construction. Russia, meanwhile, has spent years honing its own technology and has exported reactors to buyers in India, Iran and elsewhere.

Tori Shivanandan, chief operating officer of Radiant Nuclear, a California-based startup, said the executive orders mark a “watershed moment” for nuclear power in the U.S., adding that Trump’s support for the advanced nuclear industry will help ensure its success.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump signed executive orders Friday intended to quadruple domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, a goal experts say the United States is highly unlikely to reach.

To speed up the development of nuclear power, the orders grant the U.S. energy secretary authority to approve some advanced reactor designs and projects, taking authority away from the independent safety agency that has regulated the U.S. nuclear industry for five decades.

The order comes as demand for electricity surges amid a boom in energy-hungry data centers and artificial intelligence. Tech companies, venture capitalists, states and others are competing for electricity and straining the nation’s electric grid.

“We’ve got enough electricity to win the AI arms race with China,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said. “What we do in the next five years related to electricity is going to determine the next 50″ years in the industry.

Still, it’s unlikely the U.S. could quadruple its nuclear production in the time frame the White House specified. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two reactors, at a nuclear plant in Georgia, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.

The nation’s 94 nuclear reactors supply about 19% of U.S. electricity, compared to about 60% for fossil fuels and 21% for renewables, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Trump is enthusiastic

At the Oval Office signing, Trump, surrounded by industry executives, called nuclear a “hot industry,” adding, “It’s time for nuclear, and we’re going to do it very big.”

Burgum and other speakers said the industry has stagnated and has been choked by overregulation.

“Mark this day on your calendar. This is going to turn the clock back on over 50 years of overregulation of an industry,” said Burgum, who chairs Trump’s newly formed Energy Dominance Council.

The orders would reorganize the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission to ensure quicker reviews of nuclear projects, including an 18-month deadline for the NRC to act on industry applications. The measures also create a pilot program intended to place three new experimental reactors online by July 4, 2026 — 13 months from now — and invoke the Defense Production Act to allow emergency measures to ensure the U.S. has enough uranium and other reactor fuel for a modernized nuclear energy sector.

The orders also call for the Energy and Defense departments to assess the feasibility of restarting closed nuclear power plants and explore siting reactors on federal lands and military bases.

The NRC is assessing the executive orders and will comply with White House directives, spokesperson Scott Burnell said Friday.

Jacob DeWitte, chief executive officer of the nuclear energy company Oklo, brought a golf ball to the Oval Office. He told Trump that’s the amount of uranium that can power someone’s needs for their entire life.

“It doesn’t get any better than that,” he said, holding up the ball.

“Very exciting indeed,” Trump said.

Trump has signed a spate of executive orders promoting oil, gas and coal that warm the planet when burned to produce electricity. Nuclear reactors generate electricity without emitting greenhouse gases. Trump said reactors are safe and clean, but did not mention climate benefits. Safety advocates warn that nuclear technology still comes with significant risks that other low-carbon energy sources don’t, including the danger of accidents or targeted attacks, and the unresolved question of how to store tens of thousands of tons of hazardous nuclear waste.

The order to reorganize the NRC will include significant staff reductions but is not intended to fire NRC commissioners who lead the agency. David Wright, a former South Carolina elected official and utility commissioner, chairs the five-member panel. His term ends June 30, and it is unclear if he will be reappointed.

Critics have trepidations

Critics say the White House moves could compromise safety and violate legal frameworks such as the Atomic Energy Act. Compromising the independence of the NRC or encouraging it to be circumvented could weaken the agency and make regulation less effective, said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“Simply put, the U.S. nuclear industry will fail if safety is not made a priority,” he said.

Gregory Jaczko, who led the NRC under President Barack Obama, said Trump’s executive orders look like someone asked an AI chatbot, “How do we make the nuclear industry worse in this country?”

He called the orders a “guillotine to the nation’s nuclear safety system” that will make the country less safe, the industry less reliable and the climate crisis more severe.

A number of countries are speeding up efforts to license and build a new generation of smaller nuclear reactors to meet a surging demand for electricity and supply it carbon-free. Last year, Congress passed legislation that President Joe Biden signed to modernize the licensing of new reactor technologies so they can be built faster.

This month, the power company in Ontario, Canada, began building the first of four small nuclear reactors.

Valar Atomics is a nuclear reactor developer in California. Founder and CEO Isaiah Taylor said nuclear development and innovation in the United States has been slowed by too much red tape, while Russia and China are speeding ahead. He said he’s most excited about the mandate for the Energy Department to speed up the pace of innovation.

The NRC is currently reviewing applications from companies and a utility that want to build small nuclear reactors to begin providing power in the early 2030s. Currently, the NRC expects its reviews to take three years or less.

Tori Shivanandan, chief operating officer of Radiant Nuclear, a California-based startup, said the executive orders mark a “watershed moment” for nuclear power in the U.S., adding that Trump’s support for the advanced nuclear industry will help ensure its success.

“The score on whether the California clean air rule is treated by EPA as a waiver or a rule?
Ten million Californians live in areas that are under distinct, elevated threats from air pollution, said Adam Schiff, California’s junior senator.
Republicans argued that California’s rules amount to de facto national standards, given the state’s size and the fact that other states have signed on.
Other states, including Rhode Island, follow California’s emissions standards because it’s good for public health to have clean air, Whitehouse said.","In a move Democrats warned would have disastrous consequences for the economy, the environment, and public health, the Republican-led Senate Thursday voted to block California’s electric-vehicle mandates, revoking the state’s right to implement the nation’s toughest emissions standards.

Republicans used the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, to overturn California’s long-standing authority under the Clean Air Act to request waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency to pass emissions standards stricter than federal rules and protect residents from dangerous air pollution. The move affects 17 other states and Washington, D.C., which have voluntarily adopted one or more of California’s stricter standards.

The CRA allows Congress to quickly rescind a rule within a limited time after it’s issued by a federal agency, allowing a simple majority vote rather than the 60 votes needed to advance legislation under the filibuster rule.

But both the Senate parliamentarian, the chamber’s official nonpartisan adviser, and the Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan congressional referee, said the waivers are not rules and so are not subject to the Congressional Review Act.

“Today, the Senate has done something unprecedented,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island late Wednesday night, after he and his Democratic colleagues spent the past several days urging Republicans to respect not just California’s authority under the law, but also Senate rules.

“Our actions and the ones that will follow from the procedural steps taken here today, over the next day or so will change the Clean Air Act, will change the Congressional Review Act, will change the rules of the Senate, and will do so by overruling the parliamentarian and breaking the filibuster—in effect, going nuclear,” Whitehouse said, referring to attempts to subvert the filibuster.

“This isn’t just about California’s climate policies, and this isn’t just about the scope of the Congressional Review Act, and this isn’t just about eliminating the legislative filibuster,” said California Sen. Alex Padilla on the Senate floor Tuesday. The Trump administration’s EPA submitted California’s waivers for review by Congress “with full knowledge that they are not actually rules” subject to the CRA, Padilla said, opening the door for any agency to ask Congress to revoke regulations a new administration doesn’t like.

By mid-afternoon Thursday, Republicans moved to overturn California’s waivers through a procedural maneuver—giving the Senate the authority to determine what constitutes a rule for fast-track voting. They overturned waivers behind California’s rules to reduce tailpipe emissions from passenger vehicles and trucks, those regulating medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and the rule for heavy-duty smog-producing diesel and gas trucks.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) mocked Democrats’ objections to using the CRA, saying they were “throwing a tantrum over a supposed procedural problem.”

Thune insisted that having a waiver submitted to Congress “is all that Congress has ever needed to decide to consider something under the Congressional Review Act.”

He called the GAO’s ruling that the waiver is not a rule “an extraordinary deviation from precedent,” saying it was the first time the office “has decided to insert itself into the process and affirmatively declare that an agency rule submitted to Congress as a rule is not a rule.”

Despite Thune’s claim, since the CRA was passed in 1996 the GAO has offered 26 legal opinions about whether an agency action was a rule in response to inquiries from members of Congress.

And EPA never submitted California Clean Air Act waivers to Congress before the Trump administration, Padilla and his Democratic colleagues say. They contend that Republicans chose this route because they don’t have the votes to withdraw the waivers through legislation.

“The CRA has never been used to go after emission waivers like the ones in question today,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said on the floor Tuesday. “The waiver is so important to the health of our country, and particularly to our children; to go nuclear on something as significant as this and to do the bidding of the fossil fuel industry is outrageous.”

The first waiver was granted to California on July 11, 1968, Whitehouse told his colleagues in a last-ditch effort to change their minds late Wednesday night. Waivers have either been granted or amended or modified repeatedly since then, he said. “The score on whether the California clean air rule is treated by EPA as a waiver or a rule? It’s 131 to zero.”

The use of the Congressional Review Act resolution is inconsistent with past precedent and violates the plain language of the act itself, said John Swanton, a spokesperson for California’s Air Resources Board, which regulates emissions.

“The vote does not change CARB’s authority,” Swanton said, adding that the agency will continue its mission to protect the public health of Californians impacted by harmful air pollution.

Ten million Californians live in areas that are under distinct, elevated threats from air pollution, said Adam Schiff, California’s junior senator. That has led to higher rates of respiratory issues like asthma and chronic lung disease, and increased the risk of heart disease, cancer, chronic headaches, and immune system issues, he said.

“And that is multiplied by us living now on the front lines of the climate crisis. We have devastating and year-round fire dangers that put millions of other pollutants into our air,” Schiff said. “We need, deserve, and reserve the right as Californians to do something about our air.”

Yet earlier this month, House Republicans, joined by 35 Democrats, including two from California, voted to rescind the waivers, sending the issue to the Senate.

A “Compelling and Extraordinary” Need

California’s legal authority to implement stricter air quality standards than federal rules comes from having already implemented its own tailpipe-emission regulations before Congress passed national standards in 1967. California officials developed the regulations to deal with the “compelling and extraordinary” air-pollution problems caused by the Golden State’s unique geography, climate, and abundance of people and vehicles.

Recognizing these unique conditions, Congress gave California the authority to ask the Environmental Protection Agency for a waiver from rules barring states from passing air and climate pollution rules that are more protective than federal rules.

Only one waiver was denied, an action that was quickly reversed, according to CARB. And though the Trump administration in 2019 withdrew a waiver, a move legal scholars say has no basis in the law, the Biden administration restored the state’s authority to set its own vehicle-emission standards within a few years.

Republicans argued that California’s rules amount to de facto national standards, given the state’s size and the fact that other states have signed on.

But California can’t force its emission standards on other states, Padilla said. “Yes, over a dozen other states have voluntarily followed in California’s footsteps, not because they were forced to, but because they chose to, in order to protect their constituents, their residents, and protect our planet.”

California’s standards also represent ambitious but achievable steps to cut carbon emissions and fight the climate crisis, Padilla said. “Transportation is the single largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and California has been proud to set the example for other states who may choose to follow suit.”

Padilla, who grew up in California’s chronically polluted San Fernando Valley, recalled being sent home from grade school “on a pretty regular basis” when throat-burning smog settled over the valley.

“It appears that Republicans want to overturn half a century of precedent in order to undermine California’s ability to protect the health of our residents,” Padilla said. “Republicans seem to be putting the wealth of the big oil industry over the health of our constituents.”

“For Their Fossil Fuel Donors”

Rhode Island’s Whitehouse, who has long schooled his colleagues on the perils of carbon pollution, took to the floor Tuesday to school them on the Congressional Review Act.

Under the American legal system, administrative agencies can make rules through “a very robust process” that follows the Administrative Procedure Act, Whitehouse said. A rule could be contested in court, but years ago Congress decided there also could be a period of review when congressional members could reject the rule.

And for all the decades since the CRA was passed, he said, it’s been used to address rules under the APA within the specified 60 days.

Other states, including Rhode Island, follow California’s emissions standards because it’s good for public health to have clean air, Whitehouse said. “Efficient cars may mean lower cost for consumers, but those lower costs for consumers are lower sales for the fossil fuel industry.”

Whitehouse told his colleagues they had legitimate pathways to change laws they didn’t like. They could pass a joint resolution or a simple Senate resolution. But those approaches would require 60 votes to end debate.

“They don’t want to do that,” he said. “They want to ram this thing through for their fossil fuel donors.”

Republicans, by contrast, argued they had the authority to protect consumers from what they call California’s “electric vehicle mandate,” which they say would endanger consumers, the economy, and the nation’s energy supply.

“And our already shaky electric grid would quickly face huge new burdens from the surge in new electric vehicles,” argued Thune.

Congress had approved $5 billion to build electric vehicle charging infrastructure across the country, but the Trump administration withheld that funding, triggering a lawsuit from a coalition of attorneys to reverse what they said was a clearly illegal action.

Republicans’ attacks on electric vehicles could disrupt a burgeoning industry built around the transition to renewable energy.

“The repeal of these waivers will dramatically destabilize the regulatory landscape at a time when industry needs certainty to invest in the future and compete on a global scale,” said Jamie Hall, policy director for EV Realty, which develops EV-charging hubs.

Thune also argued that California’s waiver rules are an improper expansion of a limited Clean Air Act authority, echoing an argument in Project 2025, a policy blueprint for the second Trump administration produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation, which has long battled efforts to combat climate change.

In a chapter on transportation asserts, Project 2025 claims that California has no valid basis under the Clean Air Act to claim an extraordinary or unique air quality impact from carbon dioxide emissions. Its recommendation? “Revoke the special waiver granted to California by the Biden administration.”

On Wednesday, a clearly frustrated Whitehouse argued that Republicans were helping the fossil fuel industry create a shortcut for itself so it can sell more gasoline and ignore all the states that joined California to demand cleaner air for their constituents. “The fossil fuel industry essentially runs the Republican Party right now,” he said.

Last year, the oil and gas industry spent more than $153 million on lobbying, led by the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, which spent $27.6 million to influence Congress on bills including those designed to repeal vehicle-emission standards. The trade group also donated $178,750 to congressional candidates, 96% of which went to Republicans.

The American Petroleum Institute, the largest U.S. oil and gas industry trade association, spent $6.25 million on lobbying last year to influence some of the same bills. Of nearly $400,000 donated to congressional candidates last year, 78% went to Republicans.

Ninety-five percent of the $21,000 the Heritage Foundation donated to congressional candidates last year went to Republicans.

“We Believe That You Can Do It”

The week before Donald Trump returned to office, the American Petroleum Institute held its biggest annual meeting in Washington, D.C. API promoted the event as an opportunity to urge the incoming Trump administration and Congress to “seize the American energy opportunity” by advancing commonsense energy policies.

Thune joined API Chief Executive Mike Sommers onstage, where they reminisced about starting their careers in adjacent offices in the same congressional office building 30 years ago.

“It is a huge opportunity, having an administration that actually is pro-energy development working with the Congress,” Thune told his old friend. “We want to be supportive in any way that we can in ensuring that the president and his team have success in making America energy dominant.”

Sommers suggested that one of the “big, powerful tools” Congress can use when one party controls both chambers is the Congressional Review Act, which he said offers fast-track authority to reverse “midnight regulations” passed by the Biden administration.

Thune said he wouldn’t be able to use the CRA for one of California’s tailpipe emissions standards because it doesn’t fit within the required time window. But he was arguing with the parliamentarian and others, he said, “about the whole California waiver issue and how to reverse that because that was such a radical regulatory overreach.”

Both California’s Clean Cars and Clean Trucks rules require an increasing percentage of vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emissions by 2035, with the cars rule, the so-called “EV mandate,” requiring that 100% of passenger cars and trucks be zero emissions by that date.

“What California did was completely radical,” Sommers said at the meeting. “The fact that 17 other states who’ve waived into this are going to be subject to it could completely change the vehicle market.”

“So we would highly encourage you to look at that as an option for the CRA,” Sommers told Thune. “And we believe that you can do it.”

Thune assured Sommers that his committee chairs and team were looking at ways to fit repeal of California’s waivers “within the parameters of a CRA action” to fix what they saw as a shared problem.

The oil and gas industry appreciated the efforts of Thune; John Barrasso of Wyoming, the Senate Majority Whip; and West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, who pledged to overturn California’s clean cars rule and introduced the measure to do so last month.

“Today, the United States Senate delivered a victory for American consumers, manufacturers, and U.S. energy security by voting to overturn the prior administration’s EPA rule authorizing California’s gas car ban and preventing its spread across our country,” said the American Petroleum Institute and the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers in a joint statement. “We cannot thank Senators John Barrasso, Shelley Moore Capito, and Leader John Thune enough for their leadership on this important issue.”

Back on the Senate floor, Democrats warned their Republican colleagues that they may live to regret their decision to override the parliamentarian and flout legislative rules.

“It won’t be long before Democrats are once again in the driver’s seat here, in the majority once again,” Padilla said. When that happens, he warned, every agency action that Democrats don’t like, whether it’s a rule or not, and no matter how much time has passed, would be fair game with this new precedent.

“I suggest that we all think long and hard and be very careful about this,” he implored, in vain. “I would urge my colleagues, all my colleagues, to join me, not just in defending California’s rights to protect the health of our residents, not just in combating the existential threat of climate change, but in maintaining order in this chamber.”

The dynamic appears particularly acute for green energy manufacturers, as well as for multinational manufacturers with facilities both in the US and elsewhere.

Both are set to eat some proverbial spinach alongside the range of goodies clearly on offer in the 1,000-plus-page package.

Overall though, the focus from many is on tax provisions in the bill that could boost company bottom lines, like an increase in the pass-through deduction as well as tax credits for things like depreciation, interest payments, and factories.

""In short, this is a manufacturers' bill,"" said Jay Timmons, the National Association of Manufacturers president, touting the tax credits in particular that will be implemented if they are eventually signed into law by the president.

Yet some were quick to point out that other subsectors will face challenges. None more so than green energy, with the bill set to include a rollback of clean energy credits implemented during the Biden administration for things like the making of solar panels and electric vehicles.

""These are just massive headwinds for US manufacturing clean energy, which was already facing a tough global environment,"" said Alex Jacquez, a former special assistant to Biden for economic development and industrial strategy, in an interview.

Passage of the bill as it is could lead to ""much lower levels of ongoing investment,"" he added, as well as outright project cancellations ""for sure.""

And markets may agree, to an extent. Clean energy stocks were down this past week, with solar stocks especially hard hit after the bill advanced.

A focus on 100% expensing deduction for new factories

Overall, the bill has a range of provisions for factory owners, most notably a new plan for 100% expensing for structures that could be felt quickly.

This would allow companies to immediately deduct the costs of building new factories and updating existing ones, with the credit currently set to be in force from 2025 through 2028.

This provision is set to join other parts of the bill that would reinstitute previous business-world deductions around things like depreciation of property, interest expenses, and research and development costs.

The bill also makes permanent the 199A deduction at a new rate of 23%. That deduction — also known as the pass-through deduction — is focused on often smaller businesses organized as S corporations or partnerships.

The National Association of Manufacturers says 96% of manufacturers are organized as pass-throughs.

Overall, it's a suite of tax credits that has also led to highly ambitious estimates from some of what the legislation will mean for economic growth.

The White House, for instance, has projected that the bill — fueled by these provisions in particular — could lead to GDP growth around 4%-5% annually in the coming years. Most outside analysts suggest much more modest growth will be in the offing.

Less popular provisions

Part of these estimates for slower growth are the result of a bill that is primarily focused on extending existing tax cuts for both individuals and businesses — as well as new cuts in the offing.

In addition to the green energy cuts, another change in the bill is around section 899 of the IRS code to tighten restrictions on what Republicans call “discriminatory foreign countries” with new taxes to combat some of their practices.

This could directly impact companies that operate or are based in these nations.

A release from a group called the Global Business Alliance reacted to those provisions, saying changes to this section will threaten US manufacturing and reporting that impacted international companies support 2.9 million manufacturing jobs — or 22% of US manufacturing employment.

""The impact of this punitive and discriminatory provision will be felt by workers in communities like Paris, Kentucky, and London, Ohio, not Paris, France, or London, England,"" Jonathan Samford, the group's president and CEO, said in a statement.

And that's in addition to an energy rollback in the bill that includes last-minute changes put into place just before the final vote that could make the credits expire more quickly.

One last-minute change would require projects to break ground within 60 days of the bill’s signing to qualify for some credits. Jacquez calls the passed bill ""as close to full repeal as they can get"" of that piece of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Groups have estimated wide-reaching effects could follow.

Advanced Energy United says that the provisions could undermine $3 trillion in economic benefits currently being felt in the green and ""advanced"" energy sector. They also say it could jeopardize the 13.7 million American jobs that these credits had been projected to generate in the coming decade.

""We call on the Senate and allies across Capitol Hill to ensure that the final reconciliation package preserves key tax policies,"" said the group's CEO, Heather O'Neill.

And advocates like O'Neill could find an audience when the bill reaches the Senate in the weeks ahead.

A range of red-state Republicans already highlighted the positive effects these green energy credits are having in their states as they've suggested changes need to be in the offing.

Jacquez added ""the pro-IRA caucus in the House just was not willing to go to the mat in the way, say, the SALT caucus was,"" in reference to last-minute changes that blue-state Republicans were able to secure over state and local tax deductions.

""I think in the Senate, the negotiations will be much different,"" he added.

Other changes in the Senate potentially in the offing could make the bill into a further win for manufacturers, with some senators already suggesting that some of the business-world provisions currently written with an expiration date — like for factories — be made permanent.

In his statement following the bill's advancement, NAM's Timmons pledged to keep working with lawmakers to make sure the final bill is ""maximally effective.""

WASHINGTON — A Senate vote on Thursday means that both houses of Congress have now passed a resolution that would deny California a federal waiver to set stricter environmental standards for cars, a move that could upend the U.S. auto industry.

The levels of pollutants that cars may legally emit into the atmosphere are set by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air Act, which overrides any state laws on the subject. The EPA may grant waivers to individual states that set stricter standards.

California, a politically progressive state long run by the Democratic Party, has for many years received such waivers to set stricter emissions standards for cars.

Due to its status as the most populous state with the largest vehicle market in the nation, California’s standards have often dictated how automakers develop cars and have been adopted by other states, effectively making California the country’s benchmark for automobile emissions.

Republicans have long criticized these standards, which they claim are too burdensome on automakers and costly to consumers. As a result, Republicans in Congress introduced a resolution to repeal the Biden administration’s last grant of a waiver to California. The resolution passed the Senate on Thursday and will be presented to President Donald Trump for enactment.

“I have led this fight to protect consumer freedom and save the American auto industry from dangerous environmental regulations,” wrote Rep. John Joyce, R-Pa., the resolution’s sponsor, in a statement on his website.

The resolution was passed by the Senate on a roll call vote of 51 yeas to 44 nays. Such resolutions that repeal federal regulations, under the Congressional Review Act, may be passed by a simple majority and do not require the support of 60 senators to overcome a “filibuster” as is the case with most legislation. Previously, the House passed the measure in a bipartisan vote of 246 yeas to 164 nays.

The resolution’s passage was controversial. Unlike other previous CRA measures, this resolution pertained not to the issuance of a new regulation, but a waiver from an existing regulation. The Government Accountability Office had previously opined that such a waiver was not a “rule” subject to CRA disapproval, meaning that the only way to legislatively repeal a waiver would be a fresh Act of Congress subject to a Senate filibuster.

Democrats cited the GAO report during debates on the resolution to claim that Republicans were usurping powers that the CRA did not grant.

“The Senate Parliamentarian has advised both sides, Democrats and Republicans [that] legislation to overturn these waivers does not qualify for expedited consideration under the Congressional Review Act,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said during a floor debate on the measure.

“To use the CRA in the way that Republicans propose is going nuclear … they will not like it the next time they are in the minority, that’s for sure.”

Gov. Gavin Newsom said the vote was illegal and said the state would sue if the repeal was enforced.

“Republicans went around their own parliamentarian to defy decades of precedent,” Newsom said. “We won’t stand by as Trump Republicans make America smoggy again.”

Trump is likely to sign the resolution, according to an April 28 statement from the Office of Management and Budget.",https://signalscv.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/23120522/052325_CALICARS_EV_Charger-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 12:17:46.611863

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that the department's highway safety agency, the NHTSA, recently submitted a new rule, titled ""Resetting the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Program,"" to the White House for review. He claimed the previous rules used fuel economy standards as a way to force more EVs into the market, which made cars more expensive.

If EVs are no longer counted in these rules, the average fuel economy targets for cars could be lowered.

In June, the NHTSA announced plans to increase the average fuel economy for cars to approximately 50.4 miles per gallon by 2031, up from the current 39.1 mpg. However, last year, 120 Republican lawmakers claimed that the NHTSA had gone too far by setting rules that favored electric vehicles and made it harder for gasoline-powered cars to remain competitive. They said the agency used EVs in its baseline calculations, which led to stricter standards for regular cars.

Recently, House Republicans proposed ending tax credits for EVs and canceling fuel economy rules that aim to encourage automakers to build more zero-emission vehicles.

Federal law requires NHTSA to set fuel standards at the highest level that is practical.

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has begun reviewing the reversal of Biden-era vehicle emissions rules, which also promoted the adoption of more EVs. However, the EPA has not moved to cancel California's right to ban gas-powered cars by 2035.

The EPA is also reviewing whether to continue awarding fuel economy credit for ""start-stop"" systems, which are found in many new cars.

NHTSA had said last year that its rule would save 64 billion gallons of gas and reduce emissions by 659 million metric tons.

The legislation would terminate key tax credits that have supported the industry's growth, triggering a broad sell-off of solar stocks on Thursday. The bill does still have to pass the Senate, where Jefferies expects the ""unworkable"" provisions to be undone.

But in its current form, the tax bill effectively takes a ""sledgehammer"" to President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, the Jefferies analysts said. The legislation would ""upend an economic boom in this country that has delivered an historic American manufacturing renaissance,"" said Abigail Ross Hopper, CEO of the lobby group Solar Energy Industries Association.

Hopper excoriated the tax bill as ""willfully ignorant"" of the role that solar power and battery storage is playing in meeting electricity demand from U.S. consumers and businesses.

""If this bill becomes law, America will effectively surrender the AI race to China and communities nationwide will face blackouts,"" she warned.

Sunrun CEO Mary Powell told CNBC in an interview Thursday that the legislation could result in the loss of 250,000 jobs and would increase the cost of electricity for consumers. The rooftop solar installer had its worst performance ever Thursday, with shares dropping 37%.

Trump, for his part, called on the Senate to pass what he calls the ""one, big, beautiful bill"" as soon as possible. ""There is no time to waste,"" the president said on his social media platform Truth Social Thursday.

Clean energy boom could bust

Companies have invested more than $161 billion in large solar and battery storage projects since the IRA passed in 2022, according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Rhodium Group.

Solar and battery storage is the fastest growing energy source in the U.S., making up 81% of expected power additions to the grid in 2025, according to the Energy Information Administration.

But the tax bill would basically kill the two tax credits that have done the most to enable the surge of solar power. It terminates the investment and electricity production credits for clean energy facilities that begin construction 60 days after the legislation is enacted or enter service after 2028. This also applies to wind power, which is growing at slower place in the U.S.

""That'll put a massive slowdown on the amount of clean energy that gets added to the grid,"" said Ben Smith, associate director of Rhodium Group's energy and climate practice. The deployment of clean energy to the grid could decline by 57% to 72% over the next decade, according to Rhodium.

Clean energy projects also cannot claim the tax credits as early as next year if they receive ""material assistance"" from prohibited foreign entities. This mostly targets projects that source basic materials from China, such as glass for solar panels or cobalt and lithium for batteries, King said.

""It really does serve in our estimation as a de facto repeal of the credit as early as next year,"" he said. The manufacturing tax credit that has supported companies such as First Solar remains in place until 2031, though its also subject to the foreign entity restrictions.

The tax bill is ""disastrous"" for the rooftop solar industry, Guggenheim analyst Joseph Osha told clients. It terminates tax credits for companies like Sunrun that lease solar equipment to customers. About 70% of the residential solar industry is using lease arrangements, Osha said.

GOP senators could tweak bill

But some Republican senators have pushed back on the legislation, raising at least some hope for the industry that the bill's harshest provisions will be softened. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.V., told Politico that the tax bill acts like a blanket repeal of the tax credits.

""I would expect that to change,"" Capito told Politico on May 13. ""There has been job creation around these tax credits.""

Indeed, GOP congressional districts would get hit the hardest if the credits are terminated. Some 81% of IRA investment has gone to Republican districts, according to data from advocacy group E2.

A slowdown in solar deployment would come at the same time that electricity demand is increasing due to the construction of artificial intelligence data centers, reindustrialization and the broader electrification of the economy.

Renewables can be deployed the most quickly to meet demand right now because solar, battery storage and wind represent 92% of the power projects waiting for connection to the grid, according to Interconnection.fyi, an organization that tracks connection requests.

Natural gas demand is also soaring in the U.S., but the wait time for new turbines is five to six years if an order is put in now, said Reid Ramdathsingh, an analyst at consulting firm Rystad Energy. While growth may slow, solar and batteries will continue to be deployed because there really isn't an alternative, Ramdathsingh said.

""The demand is there for energy,"" he said. ""Gas is not able to meet this demand in the short term. The biggest alternative to that gas generation that we would need in the next couple of years is renewables.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108107402-1740524097942-gettyimages-2201978086-_97a2001_lprtgtdj.jpeg?v=1740524140&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-05-24 10:04:51.883798

The Problem: Rising EV Adoption Presents New Battery Lifecycle Challenges

In 2024, global EV sales reached approximately 17.1 million units, representing a 25% increase from 2023¹. With cumulative global EV sales from 2015 to 2023 totaling an estimated over 40 million units², a significant share of the global EV fleet is expected to exit warranty coverage over the coming years.

By 2031, nearly 40 million electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid vehicles worldwide are anticipated to fall outside of their original warranty coverage3,4. This projection is based on current EV adoption figures and standard industry warranty terms, and underscores a growing risk for EV owners facing battery degradation, reduced capacity, and costly replacement requirements5. As the global EV fleet continues to expand, the demand for technologies that extend battery life, reduce long-term ownership costs, and support a sustainable transition to electric mobility is increasing.

The Solution: Pioneering Next-Generation Technologies to Support Lithium-Ion Battery Longevity

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary software and hardware technology aims to address this challenge by extending the lifespan of EV batteries. This innovation is being developed with the aim to enhance the sustainability of electric transportation and the goal to provide EV owners with a more cost-effective, environmentally friendly ownership experience by reducing the need for costly battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), focuses on battery cell rebalancing. The NRC validation demonstrated the technology's ability to effectively correct cell imbalances in lithium-ion battery packs, recovering nearly all lost capacity due to cell imbalance. The validation was conducted on battery modules composed of fifteen 72Ah LiFePO₄ cells connected in series. The cells were initially balanced to a uniform state of charge (SOC), with a measured discharge capacity of 71.10Ah. In the validation test, three of the fifteen cells were then artificially imbalanced-one cell was charged to a 20% higher SOC, and two cells were discharged to a 20% lower SOC-resulting in a reduced discharge capacity of 46.24Ah, following rebalancing using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology.

These advancements establish Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a participant in lithium-ion and EV battery solutions, aiming to tackle the critical challenges of capacity degradation of battery packs and expensive replacements. By extending the lifecycle of battery materials within the supply chain, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies aims to support the energy transition and promote a more sustainable future.

Significance of the Nissan Leaf in the Out-of-Warranty Electric Vehicle Market

The Nissan Leaf holds a significant position in the global electric vehicle market. Since its launch in December 2010, the Leaf has sold more than 650,000 units worldwide6, making it one of the most widely adopted electric vehicles to date. In the United States, the Nissan Leaf was the #2 best-selling plug-in EV between 2010 and 2017, with 114,808 units sold during that period7.

Given that the standard EV battery warranty in the U.S. covers at least 8 years or 100,000 miles8, Nissan Leafs sold during that 2010-2017 window will be out of the standard warranty as of 2025. This represents a substantial and growing segment of aging EVs in need of affordable and effective battery rebalancing solutions.

Looking ahead, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies plans to expand its battery rebalancing solutions to address both current and future high-volume electric vehicle models in the out-of-warranty market. The Company aims to support models that are already beyond their original warranty coverage, as well as those approaching the warranty threshold in the coming years. This strategic expansion is intended to position Battery X Rebalancing Technologies to serve a broader base of electric vehicle owners and service providers, supporting battery lifespan extension, improved affordability, and circular economy objectives.

What it means for Iowa,Not Available,,,,,https://insurancenewsnet.com/oarticle/u-s-house-approves-trumps-tax-and-spending-bill-what-it-means-for-iowa-2,"House Republicans on Thursday, following a marathon all-night debate, narrowly passed a massive tax and spending bill as part of President Donald Trump's budget priorities.
""This bill protects Iowa families, seniors, and small businesses while strengthening Medicaid for the vulnerable — not for those who can work and choose not to.""
By making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, she said the bill prevents a tax hike for 106,800 Iowa families and small businesses.
According to KFF, two-thirds of adults on Iowa Medicaid are already working.
More Iowa families will experience food insecurity and turn to food pantries already stretched thin and asked to do more with less.","Doctors, nurses, food bank directors and other social safety net providers across Iowa warn major cuts to public health insurance and food assistance programs could lead to crowded emergency rooms, more rural hospital closures, drained family budgets, overworked providers and reduce care for veterans, seniors and children.

House Republicans on Thursday, following a marathon all-night debate, narrowly passed a massive tax and spending bill as part of President Donald Trump's budget priorities.

All of Iowa's U.S. House members, including 4th District Rep. Randy Feenstra, voted to pass President Donald Trump's ""one big, beautiful"" sweeping reconciliation bill.

The bill includes roughly $4.5 trillion in tax breaks passed during Trump's first term in 2017 that are set to expire this year, while temporarily adding new ones he campaigned on during his 2024 campaign, including no taxes on tips, overtime pay, car loan interest and others.

To make up for some of the lost tax revenue, the bill would cut an estimated $625 billion to Medicaid — the joint federal and state program that helps cover medical costs for low-income individuals, including the elderly and those with disabilities — and $300 billion to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps, over the next 10 years.

The cuts would largely be done by imposing work requirements on many of those receiving benefits. Able-bodied adults age 19-64 without dependents would need to work, volunteer or go to school for 80 hours a month in order to maintain them.

""They're going to keep scrutinizing and rescrutinizing who qualifies,"" said Patrick Kearns, of Iowa City, who has two adult children with disabilities who depend on Medicaid assistance to live independently. ""People are going to get excluded.""

The bill also would roll back green energy tax breaks from the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act and add $350 billion in new spending on border security, mass deportations and defense.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates 8.6 million fewer Americans would receive health care coverage and 3 million fewer people a month would receive food assistance under the proposed changes.

The CBO said the tax provisions would increase federal deficits by $3.8 trillion over the next decade, while the changes to Medicaid, food stamps and other services would lead to $1 trillion in reduced spending. The lowest income households in the U.S. would see their resources drop, while the highest ones would see a boost, it said.

A study done by Penn Wharton Budget Model found that people earning between $17,000 and $51,000 would see on average a $700 reduction in their income after taxes. People reporting less than $17,000 in income would see a reduction closer to $1,000 on average. People earning more, however, would see gains.

The predicted losses are primarily due to the cuts being made across federal agencies, and the benefits many lower-income Americans will see disappear because of them. Penn Wharton's analysis found increased cost of medical bills and food by losing access to programs will be far higher than the amount of money they'll receive through tax cuts.

By contrast, the top 0.1 percent of income earners, including those with incomes over $4.3 million, would gain on average more than $389,000 in after-tax income in 2026, mostly from a boost to corporate profits from extending the 2017 tax cuts, which may improve the value of their investments.

The bill now heads to the U.S. Senate, which is expected to make changes.

Miller-Meeks, Hinson praise bill's passage

Iowa U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a Republican from Ottumwa and Davenport, voted for the cuts and sits on the Energy and Commerce committee, which played a crucial role in advancing the sweeping legislation to identify hundreds of billion in cuts over the next decade to programs it oversees, including Medicaid.

In a statement and social media post Thursday, Miller-Meeks praised the legislation as ""delivering tax relief for Iowa families and small businesses, preserving Medicaid for those for whom it was meant for, and real action to secure the border.""

She said it's now time ""for the Senate to step up and get this done!""

""As a former small business owner and Army veteran, I know what's at stake,"" Miller-Meeks said in a statement. ""This bill protects Iowa families, seniors, and small businesses while strengthening Medicaid for the vulnerable — not for those who can work and choose not to.""

By making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, she said the bill prevents a tax hike for 106,800 Iowa families and small businesses.

Kearns, the Iowa City parent, said Miller-Meeks' office had repeatedly reassured him and his family that there would be no cuts to Medicaid.

""She had a chance to stop it,"" Kearns said. ""She's voting against families like mine and a lot of other families in her district.""

He fears his 35-year-old daughter, who has autism but lives independently in an apartment, might be forced to return to Kearns' house, and that his 21-year-old son, who suffered a severe brain injury, might not be able to move into his own apartment as planned.

Kearns also is a 30-year nurse for the Iowa City VA Medical Center, which has suffered staffing cuts since Trump took office. The proposed Medicaid reductions would further affect veterans that require long-term care, he said, and might imperil struggling rural hospitals.

The bill also includes $46.5 billion to revive construction of Trump's wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and more money to expand detention capacity, hire more immigration enforcement agents and speed up deportations.

Also included are provisions pushed by Miller-Meeks she argues cracks down on ""waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid,"" and ""recommits"" those dollars to children, pregnant women, seniors, veterans and people with disabilities.

""Today's vote is a win for Iowa and for every American who believes in work, responsibility and a government that serves its people, not the other way around,"" Miller-Meeks said.

U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, a Republican from Marion, wrote in a post on X that the bill ""will fast-track our country back to prosperity and will be a huge part of President Trump's legacy.""

""Iowans overwhelmingly voted for President Trump's America First agenda — ending illegal immigration and preventing dangerous criminals and drugs from entering our communities, cutting wasteful spending and unleashing American energy,"" Hinson wrote. ""Throughout this process, I was proud to champion provisions to help working families keep more of their hard-earned dollars, including expanding the child tax credit, making small business tax cuts permanent, and eliminating taxes on tips.""

Democrats contend the legislation will drive up grocery and health care prices for regular Iowans to fund tax breaks for the well-off and well-connected.

Health care workers: Cuts may mean longer wait times, drives for care

Iowa health care officials warn the Medicaid cuts could lead to longer wait times in emergency rooms, longer drives to see health care providers and fewer options for mental health care and OBGYN services in rural areas that are already lacking.

Abby Butler, is a registered nurse at UnityPoint Health — Finley Hospital in Dubuque, and was on Capitol Hill last week to oppose cuts to Medicaid.

Butler, speaking to reporters Wednesday, said the proposed changes to Medicaid could lead to rural hospitals eliminating services or even closing completely.

""Many rural hospitals in Iowa are already currently functioning in a deficit and receive anywhere from 8 to 25 percent of their revenue from Medicaid,"" she said. ""With a decrease in this Medicaid funding, these hospitals may have to cut certain specialty services, such as (obstetrics) services, to be able to operate, which would have serious impacts on pregnant women in rural Iowa.""

Proposed cuts to Medicaid also could severely impact Iowa nursing homes, especially those relying on Medicaid reimbursement for a significant portion of their funding, opponents said.

Cuts also could affect seniors with Medicare who rely on Medicaid for long-term care. Medicare generally only covers a limited period of skilled nursing facility care, while Medicaid is a primary payer for ongoing long-term care services, including nursing home stays.

Medicaid covers nearly 40 percent of all births in Iowa, and 50 percent of people who live in nursing homes are enrolled in Medicaid. Iowa also has the highest percentage of nonelderly recipients who need Medicaid to pay for mental health care.

""This could affect people from receiving proper care even with private insurance,"" Butler said. ""We need to remember that patients on Medicaid are not just numbers on the paper. They are people who deserve the right access to health coverage. These cuts will affect everyone in the community, no matter your political stance, income or background. We will all feel, see and hear the effects of these cuts.""

States take on more costs for SNAP, Medicaid under federal bill

The proposed changes to SNAP and Medicaid will shift much of the costs to states that will grapple with the additional financial burden of administering the safety net programs, said Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, former administrator of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) under Democratic former President Joe Biden.

According to the nonprofit health care advocacy and reporting organization KFF, Iowa would lose $518 million in federal Medicaid funding, representing a 25 percent cut to state spending per resident.

That will force states to make tough choices: maintain current spending on Medicaid by raising taxes or reducing spending on other programs; or cut Medicaid spending by covering fewer people, offering fewer benefits or paying providers less, Brooks-LaSure said.

KFF estimates between 64,000 and 107,000 Iowans would lose Medicaid coverage.

Anne Discher, executive director of Common Good Iowa, notes state lawmakers this moth approved a budget that calls for using the state's various surpluses and reserve funds to cover an estimated $917 million budget shortfall. The governor's office anticipates needing to tap surpluses to balance the budget in the foreseeable future due to declining revenues from state income tax cuts, ""and that is without taking into account any big Medicaid changes.""

Brooks-LaSure, speaking to reporters Thursday, also warned the legislation will destabilize the health insurance marketplace created under the Affordable Care Act and lead to significant increases in premiums and out-of-pocket costs for millions of Americans.

""Both Medicaid and marketplaces are fundamental and foundational in helping millions of Americans live a healthy life, and they are also vital to our economy by keeping our hospitals — especially rural ones — open, and bolstering our health care workforce,"" she said.

Additionally, requiring states to implement work requirements for low-income adults under Iowa's Medicaid expansion group, will increase barriers to enrolling in and renewing Medicaid coverage, leading to higher rates of Iowans without health insurance coverage, Brooks-LaSure said.

Another KFF analysis estimated around 56,000 people in Iowa would become uninsured under the House bill. The higher uninsured rates among Iowa patients will place increased strain on community health centers and rural health care systems, which are already caring for a higher percentage of uninsured or underinsured patients, Brooks-LaSure said.

She and Butler said past evidence in Georgia and Arkansas shows work requirements are ineffective, costly and disproportionately harm vulnerable populations. They contend the requirements ignore real-world barriers to employment, and ultimately lead to coverage loss for eligible individuals through increased red tape and paperwork required for Medicaid enrollment.

According to KFF, two-thirds of adults on Iowa Medicaid are already working. Among those not working are caregivers, full-time students and Iowans with a chronic health condition or disability that prevents them from working but who do not meet the strict requirements for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits.

About 8 percent of Medicaid adults reported that they are retired, unable to find work, or were not working for another reason.

Additionally, the proposed changes would shift a chunk of SNAP funding from the federal government to states, starting in 2028. The bill also would expand the program's preexisting work requirements to include parents of school-age children and some older adults.

Each state's share of the cost would be calculated according to how often it overpays or underpays program participants. All states would have to shoulder at least 5 percent of the cost, while the most error-prone states would pay 25 percent. The proposal also cuts federal funding states receive to administer the program.

An estimate from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that Iowa would be responsible for at least $26 million of program costs by fiscal year 2028 under changes made in the bill. At the highest share, Iowa would pay an additional $131 million, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Such changes would significantly impact Iowa's budget, and likely lead to dramatic cuts in assistance at a time when food insecurity across the state is on the rise and food banks are seeing record demand, said Luke Elzinga, board chair of the Iowa Hunger Coalition and policy and advocacy manager at the DMARC Food Pantry Network.

The federally funded program provides money to more than 40 million people in eligible low-income households — mostly older adults, people with disabilities and families with children — to help buy groceries. About one in 12, or more than 259,000, Iowans were enrolled in SNAP at the end of last year. Of those, 64 percent of SNAP participants are families with children, 35 percent are families with members who are older adults or are disabled, and 50 percent are in working families.

""This will only make food insecurity in the state of Iowa worse,"" Elzinga said. ""There is incredible strain already on food banks and food pantries across the state, and resilience is wearing thin. More Iowa families will experience food insecurity and turn to food pantries already stretched thin and asked to do more with less.

""… This bill is essentially taking from the poor to give to the rich.""",https://insurancenewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/inn-social-default.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 11:07:03.458859

The administration must look not only to support the nuclear technologies but also provide an environment that enables the efficient deployment of nuclear energy.","WASHINGTON, DC, May 23 – Earlier today, President Trump signed four executive orders that pave the way for the United States’ nuclear industry to move forward. The executive orders (EOs) push for more efficient licensing at the NRC, building a resilient domestic supply chain, and advancing the deployment of nuclear energy in the US. Many of these directives align with the bipartisan policies set forth in the ADVANCE Act of 2024, and are already in process at the NRC. Not all of the provisions are feasible, and some are contradictory, but the orders represent a real commitment to support a large scale-up of nuclear energy.

The Breakthrough Institute (BTI) appreciates the White House’s attention and commitment to advancing the deployment of nuclear energy. These EOs show the determination of the current administration to ensure American energy abundance and national security. Nuclear power is an indispensable part of that.

In many cases, the executive orders say the quiet part out loud. Nuclear power is the largest source of firm, clean energy in the United States, and further growth of the industry will reduce overall electricity system costs. Regulation should not be one-sided and must be considered in balance with the risks of other energy sources. Nuclear energy helps to avoid thousands of excess pollution deaths a year in the United States, and millions more worldwide.

Executive Order Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base will build a great American nuclear ecosystem by enabling a domestic fuel supply chain, expanding workforce, prioritizing funding for nuclear plants uprates, restarts, and more.

The support of increased nuclear deployment through the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense is promising. However, it is unclear that licensing under DOE would be any easier than licensing under the NRC. Similarly, the Department of Defense has no recent experience in the deployment of nuclear reactors and technology. Additionally, the EOs’ call to restart shuttered reactors is an encouraging opportunity, but the DOE’s Loan Programs Office must be properly staffed and empowered to realize the smooth restart of reactors.

Executive Orders Ordering the reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Directs Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission directly call out to reform NRC’s overly risk-averse culture, structure, and regulations, setting an 18-month and 12-month deadline on licensing the new and existing reactors, respectively.

Those EOs will push the NRC to become more efficient in its licensing, but they also threaten to reduce the NRC’s workforce, independence, and resources. To enable high-volume licensing to meet the administration’s goal of 400 GW of new nuclear plants by 2050, the NRC will need at least 350 staff members whose full-time focus will be on licensing, even if licensing becomes twice as efficient as of now. The order correctly identifies that increases in staffing in certain areas, particularly licensing, may be necessary.

It also asks the NRC to reconsider, not outright eliminate, the linear-no-threshold radiation exposure model and As-Low-As-Reasonably-Achievable (ALARA) regulation. This is consistent with Congressional expectations in the ADVANCE Act, to not unnecessarily limit benefits to society, while ensuring safety. However, it is a big missed opportunity to finally align the NRC with a modern, risk-informed approach that directly reflects Congress’s 1990 Clean Air Act amendments emphasizing an “ample margin of safety”, as a numerical threshold that is consistent for radiological health risk and other regulated hazards. Reconsideration of safety and risk thresholds must consider what is in statute.

Executive Order Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy advocates for speeding up the development of advanced nuclear through pilot programs and streamlining environmental reviews.

The goal of 400 GW of nuclear capacity by 2050 is laudable and supports national security, but achieving that goal will require comprehensive and complementary strategies and ample resources. A series of executive orders is just a start. The administration must look not only to support the nuclear technologies but also provide an environment that enables the efficient deployment of nuclear energy.

In response to the EOs, Dr. Adam Stein, Director of Nuclear Energy Innovation at Breakthrough, noted, “These executive orders take bold steps to accelerate the deployment of nuclear energy in the United States, including supporting innovative technology, strengthening the fuel supply chain, and streamlining the licensing process. It also re-emphasizes the need to implement many of the requirements of the bipartisan ADVANCE Act to accomplish the modernization of the NRC, and directs reevaluation of regulations for alignment with the agency’s mission. However, a comprehensive strategy is still needed to bring the parts together. The clear negative health and environmental effects and risks of alternative energy sources should no longer be ignored when considering innovation, licensing, and deployment of nuclear energy.”

When the United States led the world in deploying nuclear energy, in 1954 Congress declared in the Atomic Energy Act that “the development, use, and control of atomic energy shall be directed so as to make the maximum contribution to the general welfare.” The nation needs a nuclear regulator that can license new nuclear reactors, and a federal government capable of enabling the industry to grow and maximize benefits to society—a position Congress reaffirmed in the ADVANCE Act last year. These executive orders are a positive sign that the Trump administration understands both the value of nuclear power and the important role that the federal government must play in its resurgence.

One energy analyst said the bill could tie up clean energy projects with rules like the one imposing a 60-day deadline to start work and a 2028 completion date.

Arizona's House members faced criticism for their support of the bill, particularly Rep. Schweikert for not voting and Rep. Ciscomani for his deciding vote.

House Republicans passed their ""One, Big, Beautiful Bill"" through the reconciliation process on May 22, sending it to the U.S. Senate and one step closer to being signed into law by President Donald Trump.

Ways and Means Chairman Rep. Jason Smith, R-Missouri, issued a statement claiming the bill ""locks in the successful 2017 Trump tax cuts"" and, if passed, would result in ""made-in-America incentives"" and secure more than 7 million jobs over the next four years, with wage increases of more than $11,000.

“This bill represents an historic opportunity to deliver economic freedom for working families, farmers and small businesses,"" Smith said.

But a long list of analysts and advocates are adamant that it would have devastating consequences for clean energy progress, related manufacturing projects and jobs, air quality and electricity prices in Arizona — all while adding between $3.3 trillion and $5.2 trillion to the federal debt, which Trump promised and has so far failed to lower.

A fierce and fast flurry of opposition

The House passed the reconciliation package at 3:54 a.m. MST on May 22 with a margin of just one vote — 215 Republicans were in favor and 214 opposing votes came from two other Republicans and all 212 Democrats present.

Within the hour, national and local organizations began issuing statements vehemently opposing the bill's continued progress through the Senate on the grounds that it would reverse gains in air quality and wildlife protections, for domestic clean energy and electric vehicle industries and in ensuring affordable and equitable access to electricity for all Americans. Many had been watching the bill's progress through the House closely in recent weeks.

“This bill is an ugly mess for companies and workers, families and communities,” said Joanna Slaney, vice president for political and government affairs at Environmental Defense Fund, in a statement issued at 4:33 a.m. on May 22. “Its nearly full repeal of the tax credits that help the U.S. produce some of the world’s cleanest energy would raise household electricity prices, create uncertainty for businesses, send jobs to other countries and threaten people’s health with more pollution.""

Environmental Defense Fund shared statistics from an Energy Innovation analysis that a repeal of Biden-era clean energy tax incentives would raise household energy costs by $32 billion over the next decade and cut about 700,000 American jobs, while emitting unnecessary climate pollution equal to an additional 116 million cars.

In Arizona specifically, which has benefited more than most states from clean energy investments related to then-President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act since 2022, the cuts would jeopardize more than 25,000 solar and EV manufacturing and construction jobs and add nearly $160 to average annual household energy costs by 2035, according to the nonpartisan energy and climate policy think tank's report.

The budget reconciliation package would also ""mark a harmful reversal of efforts to address crises facing wildlife and people,"" according to the National Wildlife Federation in a statement sent at 6:23 a.m. The National Wildlife Federation flagged the bill's removal of protections for clean air and water and efforts to ""short-circuit proper environmental review for government-approved projects.""

“At a time when wildlife and people need Congress to meet the moment and address the immense and interconnected challenges they face, this legislation callously struts in the opposite direction,” said Abby Tinsley, National Wildlife Federation's vice president for conservation policy, in the statement. “The Senate should reject this bill and go back to the drawing board.”

Defenders of Wildlife also opposed how the reconciliation bill ""authorizes the destruction and degradation of large swaths of public lands and waters currently home to hundreds of imperiled species,"" in a statement sent at 8:19 a.m. The organization's vice president of government relations, Robert Dewey, warned of ""unchecked logging and energy extraction designed to increase corporate profit at the expense of our public health and natural habitat.""

In one exception to the overall tone from environmental groups, the Center for Western Priorities celebrated the last-minute removal from the bill of provisions to sell or swap hundreds of thousands of acres of public land in Utah and Nevada, a momentary win for wildlife, recreation enthusiasts and nature lovers, as well as for the effective management of clean air and water across the region.

“Clearly, selling off public lands is still a third rail for members of Congress on both sides of the aisle,” said the Center for Western Priorities' Deputy Director Aaron Weiss in a statement issued just before 7 a.m.

Other organizations highlighted injustices still likely to result from the proposal's remaining language, or language added just before the vote.

""This anti-environmental billionaire tax scam would limit our ability to build new power generation fast enough to meet rising electricity demands,"" said Vianey Olivarría, state executive director for Chispa Arizona, in a statement released at 11:28 p.m. ""And in the case of low income and communities of color who have borne the brunt of air pollution for generations, it will reverse decades of progress in protecting our air.""

And the Guttmacher Institute objected to provisions added at the last minute that it said in a 9:30 a.m. statement would ""have major implications for people's access to reproductive health care nationwide,"" which has been linked to climate concerns among young people reconsidering parenthood in an environmentally destabilized world.

In a release sent at 3:15 p.m. from local organizations including Poder Latinx, the Grand Canyon Chapter of the Sierra Club, the Arizona branch of Mom's Clean Air Force, Arizona Alliance for Retired Americans and the Arizona coalition of Mountain Mamas, the groups joined together to condemn the bill's ""harmful impact on Arizona families and businesses"" while saying Congress ""should be doubling down on innovation and energy independence.""

That innovation and independence won't come from the business-as-usual policies benefiting the oil and gas industry, according to cleaner electrification advocates.

“This policy about-face couldn’t come at a worse time: energy prices have surged 30 percent since 2020,"" noted Rewiring America's CEO Ari Matusiak in a statement about the bill sent at 10:51 a.m. ""Maintaining these tax credits gives American households an opportunity to offset these price hikes, potentially saving up to $990 a year with efficiency upgrades, $2,240 a year with rooftop solar and 60% on fuel costs with an EV.""

Arizona reps 'stepping out' on local constituents and industries

On top of more than a dozen statements issued from groups active in Arizona opposing the reconciliation bill on the same day it passed in the U.S. House, members of the organization Climate Power, in a briefing that morning, called out specific Arizona representatives for supporting the bill — or helping to write it and then ""stepping out"" from the session just moments before the vote.

That accusation was lobbed at Rep. David Schweikert, the Arizona Republican who is on the Ways and Means Committee that authored the bill but was the only representative from Arizona to not vote on it. All five other House Republicans from the state voted with their party, as did the two Arizona Democrats.

Schweikert did not immediately respond to The Arizona Republic's request for comment on his missed vote.

Rep. Juan Ciscomani, R-Tucson, also received a critical spotlight from the Grand Canyon Chapter of the Sierra Club in its 3:10 p.m. statement for his ""deciding vote to advance Donald Trump’s massive budget reconciliation package that would endanger clean air and water, repeal investments in clean energy, and raise costs on Arizona families — all to give more tax cuts and handouts to billionaires and corporate polluters.""

With 19 of the 22 Arizona projects that have received clean energy tax credits located in Republican districts, according to Climate Power, the organization views these acts by GOP representatives as a striking failure to support the clear benefits to their constituents from the state's momentum in the global economic movement toward energy generation from renewable sources.

""This (bill) is going to be a massive challenge for almost all projects that have already been announced,"" said Jesse Lee, a senior adviser for clean energy economy with Climate Power and a former senior communications adviser to the National Economic Council. ""These (provisions) are all unique ways to tie up clean energy projects that don't apply to anything else.""

Lee referenced a requirement in the reconciliation bill that projects awarded federal funding must break ground within 60 days of receiving clean energy tax credits and be in service by 2028. This would make it nearly impossible for large, complex clean energy projects to succeed and could cause others to lose financing options for reasons that are totally outside of their control, the Climate Power team said.

They added that recent polling shows 70% of Americans do not want these clean energy tax credits to be repealed.

""This is the opposite of a careful process,"" Lee said. ""If you require everything to be built right away, then you can't build anything here, and that's kind of the point. This bill forfeits manufacturing to China and other countries.""

Lee predicted that, if this bill were to pass, Arizona industries engaged in solar panel installation, electric vehicle battery manufacturing and other efforts to clean up air pollution caused by the transportation and electricity generation sectors would be ""revising their projections downward, I'm sure.""

A Long-Term Play With a Short Fuse

Charles Harris, portfolio manager at O’Neil Global Advisors, remains invested in Tesla but is candid about the stock’s punishing swings and how they’ve forced a rethink of strategy.

“I still have a large position in Tesla – particularly in my non-margin accounts – which I’m just holding,” Harris said on the Investor’s Business Daily podcast “Investing with IBD.”

“I really got killed holding Tesla,” he added, describing the fallout of holding an oversized margin position during Tesla’s steep 2022 downturn.

After reaching an all-time high of $488.54 in December 2024, Tesla shares tumbled nearly 47% within just four months. The plunge was fueled by a combination of factors: CEO Elon Musk’s close political alignment with President Trump, which sparked protests and investor anxiety; a broader market selloff in February; and fears about weakening global EV demand as tariffs loomed.

Harris, like many investors burned during the slide, now focuses on managing risk and position size—especially avoiding margin when holding high-volatility names like Tesla.

“When you enter a bear market, regardless of the conviction you have in a stock or how well you’ve done, if you’re going to hold through a base or hold a long-term stock, you can’t do it on margin,” Harris warned.

Trump’s Tax Bill Pushes Tesla Into a Tougher Spot

The situation for Tesla worsened this week with the House’s passage of President Trump’s new tax bill, a sweeping reform that dismantles several clean energy incentives aimed at boosting electric vehicle adoption.

While the bill preserves IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) tax credits through 2026, it limits eligibility to automakers that haven’t sold 200,000 EV units by the end of 2025. That automatically disqualifies Tesla, along with General Motors and Ford, which have already passed the threshold.

This leaves Tesla at a competitive disadvantage compared to smaller, newer EV players like Lucid (LCID) and Rivian (RIVN), who now gain a runway to capture more price-sensitive buyers. Analysts say this change could reshape the EV market, effectively stalling growth for established brands that once benefited heavily from federal support.

The market reacted swiftly with shares of GM, Ford, Rivian, and Lucid all declining on Friday following the bill’s passage. Tesla, despite the broader concerns, managed to inch upward—rising 46% from its April lows to trade around $342 by midday Friday. Still, it remains 30% below its December peak.

Analysts Still See Long-Term Upside

Despite the regulatory shake-up and ongoing volatility, not all analysts are bearish on Tesla. Some believe the company’s next phase—centered around autonomous driving and AI—could usher in a powerful growth era.

“We believe the golden age of autonomous is now on the doorstep for Tesla with the Austin launch next month kicking off this key next chapter of growth for Musk & Co.,” said Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities.

“We are raising our price target to $500 reflecting this massive stage of valuation creation ahead.”

Ives and others remain bullish on Tesla’s potential to dominate the future of autonomous transport and robotaxi networks—markets that could dwarf today’s EV business in scope and profitability. Musk has teased a major rollout event for Tesla’s long-promised robotaxi initiative next month at its Austin, Texas facility, a move that could revive investor sentiment and expand the company’s appeal beyond just car manufacturing.

Margin, Myth, and the Apple Comparison

Harris cautions investors not to assume Tesla will follow the same trajectory as other tech giants like Apple. Although often compared in terms of innovation and brand loyalty, the two companies have charted vastly different paths.

“I was using Apple as a precedent for Tesla, but they’re not the same thing,” Harris said. “Apple never saw a three-year consolidation period.”

Tesla’s corrections have been far more severe and frequent, often triggered by Elon Musk’s unpredictability, shifting political alliances, or the company’s dependency on future technologies that remain unproven.

“You can’t have too much faith in a precedent,” he added. “Following risk management rules should supersede one’s conviction in a stock’s fundamental story.”

Tesla remains one of the most watched and debated stocks in the market—an icon of both innovation and controversy. For every analyst projecting $500 price targets based on robotaxis and AI, there’s another warning about political fallout, regulatory pressures, and uncertain demand.",https://tkcdn.tekedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/13121620/Trump-Tesla.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 12:16:52.491740

“Sustainable development must be a global effort in which nations unite and act together to overcome the challenges,” IRNA quoted

The official made the remarks while addressing the BRICS panel, ‘BRICS and sustainable development of environment’, which was conducted on May 22 on the sidelines of the 11th Nevsky International Ecological Congress held from May 22 to 23 in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

“Furthermore, if countries decide individually, without any coordination with other nations, not only will the impact of the efforts be lowered, but sustainable development itself risks being perceived as a false promise or a deceptive slogan,” Ansari highlighted.

The official also proposed joint development of a strategic and fundamental program to guide collective efforts.

She went on to say that the distinctive feature of sustainable development is its ability to change mindsets. It encourages long-term change, promoting individuals and communities to think about their actions and their impacts on the planet. This shift in perspective is much more powerful than temporary technical solutions or legal measures.

“Unlike technical or legal solutions, which often offer quick-fix remedies, sustainable development addresses the fundamental cause of environmental, economic, and social issues. However, to achieve sustainable development goals, infrastructure, education, and public awareness are crucial. Otherwise, we cannot expect citizens to accept concepts that they have never heard of or learned about,” she further noted.

The official also elaborated on the country’s activities to align with sustainable development. “Sustainable development model lays the basis for a future in harmony with nature and a guarantee of human health and wellbeing.”

Today, sustainable development is vital not only for protecting the environment but also for improving the quality of life and creating equal opportunities for people in different societies.

To do so, Iran has adopted various measures such as offering incentives to companies that submit Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), and adhere to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues. This initiative indicates Iran’s alignment with internationally recognized standards for sustainable development and that the country is striving to incorporate these principles into its economic and trade procedures, Ansari said.

These measures further boost environmental sustainability and guarantee that the private sector prioritizes sustainable economic growth and social well-being, she further noted.

Nevsky Intl. Ecological Congress

The 11th Nevsky International Ecological Congress was held from May 22 to 23 in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

Ministers of environment from more than 40 countries, including Iran, Azerbaijan, Algeria, Burkina Faso, Belarus, Serbia, Indonesia, Jordan, Cambodia, and Kenya, attended the Congress.

The main goal of the Nevsky International Ecological Congress is to create effective and sustainable development mechanisms to preserve the environment in a changing climate.

The Congress 2025 once again hosted interstate, intersectoral dialogue on important environmental issues, with representatives from international organizations, government authorities, and business, scientific, and expert communities from across the globe already having confirmed their intention to attend the event.

The 11th Nevsky International Ecological Congress kicked off on May 22 with a Youth Programme, which became an important part of the business agenda.

Participants were treated to open dialogues and thematic sessions on youth engagement in the resolution of climate issues, the promotion of environmental awareness, the development of a culture of environmental volunteering, the inclusion of children in the ‘green’ agenda, and the role of youth climate initiatives in a more sustainable future.

The roundtables and sessions on May 22 focused on food security and climate risks, sustainable ecotourism, how artificial intelligence and digital solutions can be applied to benefit the environment, international cooperation within BRICS, conditions in the Caspian region, the development of the circular economy, the role of women in promoting eco-initiatives, green investment, the management of mineral resources, and low-carbon technologies.

On May 23, regional heads, mayors, and experts discussed the modern sustainable development practices of megacities, the process of making transport more environmentally friendly, the preservation of green areas, and new approaches to health preservation.

The model leans heavily on local solar, community batteries, and existing infrastructure rather than large-scale projects.
Energy Minister Penny Sharpe said the plan marked a shift from traditional renewable energy zones (REZs) in places like the Orana and South West.
Professor Christopher said the local REZ would still require bigger solutions like offshore wind to power heavy industry like BlueScope.
""It reflects what groups like Electrify 2515 and Hi Neighbour have been working toward — small-scale, local energy projects that create jobs and cut bills.""","The NSW government has launched a new approach to renewable energy in the Illawarra, pitching the region as the state's first ""urban renewable energy zone"".

The model leans heavily on local solar, community batteries, and existing infrastructure rather than large-scale projects.

Energy Minister Penny Sharpe said the plan marked a shift from traditional renewable energy zones (REZs) in places like the Orana and South West.

""It's not about big generation and transmission,"" she said.

""It's about how we support the infrastructure that's already here, how we prepare for green manufacturing, and how we make the most of the solar and storage potential across homes, businesses and communities.""

The announcement in Port Kembla at the BlueScope steel terminal — where renewable energy research is underway — included a memorandum of understanding with Endeavour Energy.

It set the groundwork for trials of new grid technologies and incentives for solar uptake.

Endeavour's Colin Crisafulli said the goal was to make the most of the infrastructure already in place.

""We're looking at how we can store more energy, share it locally, and avoid rebuilding the grid where we don't need to,"" he said.

'Bigger mix' of renewables needed

At the University of Wollongong, energy researcher Ty Christopher said the consumer focus in the REZ could deliver 300 megawatts of local energy.

""An urban REZ could certainly get it into the hundreds of megawatts of capacity,"" he said.

""With more generation on homes and businesses, and in particular with the ability to store and time shift all of that clean energy so that it's available in the evening .""

He said leaning into the local support for renewables with an urban REZ would ""really play to the strengths of the region"".

Even with the local consumer energy contributions, the government is still a way off its commitment of 1 gigawatt of energy creation for the Illawarra zone.

Professor Christopher said the local REZ would still require bigger solutions like offshore wind to power heavy industry like BlueScope.

""You can't run a steelworks on rooftop solar,"" he said.

""This needs to be part of a bigger mix, but this is something we can start now.

""One of the big challenges from a political perspective with the Urban REZ concept is it's not going to create one big thing that you can string a ribbon in front of and just cut.

The announcement came just days after the federal government lifted a pause on consultation for offshore wind off the Illawarra coast.

The applicant, BlueFloat, told the ABC it was not discussing the Illawarra project but focused on its plans for the Gippsland offshore wind zone.

'Thrilled' with announcement

Hi Neighbour founder Yael Stone, who earlier this year criticised the lack of visible progress since the Illawarra REZ was first announced, welcomed the urban REZ approach as a smart and community-led next step.

""I'm thrilled at the announcement,"" she said.

""It reflects what groups like Electrify 2515 and Hi Neighbour have been working toward — small-scale, local energy projects that create jobs and cut bills.""

She said Illawarra residents were already tuned in to the benefits of household solar, batteries and smarter grid interaction.

Stone saw the urban REZ concept as a ""companion piece"" to the federal move to resume offshore wind planning and said her group had already helped install solar on local manufacturing rooftops, using the returns to fund training scholarships.

Jacob DeWitte, chief executive officer of the nuclear energy company Oklo, brought a golf ball to the Oval Office.
“Simply put, the U.S. nuclear industry will fail if safety is not made a priority,” he said.
This month, the power company in Ontario, Canada, began building the first of four small nuclear reactors.
Tori Shivanandan, chief operating officer of Radiant Nuclear, a California-based startup, said the executive orders mark a “watershed moment” for nuclear power in the U.S., adding that Trump’s support for the advanced nuclear industry will help ensure its success.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump signed executive orders Friday intended to quadruple domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, a goal experts say the United States is highly unlikely to reach.

To speed up the development of nuclear power, the orders grant the U.S. energy secretary authority to approve some advanced reactor designs and projects, taking authority away from the independent safety agency that has regulated the U.S. nuclear industry for five decades.

The order comes as demand for electricity surges amid a boom in energy-hungry data centers and artificial intelligence. Tech companies, venture capitalists, states and others are competing for electricity and straining the nation’s electric grid.

“We’ve got enough electricity to win the AI arms race with China,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said. “What we do in the next five years related to electricity is going to determine the next 50″ years in the industry.

Still, it’s unlikely the U.S. could quadruple its nuclear production in the time frame the White House specified. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two reactors, at a nuclear plant in Georgia, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.

The nation’s 94 nuclear reactors supply about 19% of U.S. electricity, compared to about 60% for fossil fuels and 21% for renewables, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Trump is enthusiastic

At the Oval Office signing, Trump, surrounded by industry executives, called nuclear a “hot industry,” adding, “It’s time for nuclear, and we’re going to do it very big.”

Burgum and other speakers said the industry has stagnated and has been choked by overregulation.

“Mark this day on your calendar. This is going to turn the clock back on over 50 years of overregulation of an industry,” said Burgum, who chairs Trump’s newly formed Energy Dominance Council.

The orders would reorganize the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission to ensure quicker reviews of nuclear projects, including an 18-month deadline for the NRC to act on industry applications. The measures also create a pilot program intended to place three new experimental reactors online by July 4, 2026 — 13 months from now — and invoke the Defense Production Act to allow emergency measures to ensure the U.S. has enough uranium and other reactor fuel for a modernized nuclear energy sector.

The orders also call for the Energy and Defense departments to assess the feasibility of restarting closed nuclear power plants and explore siting reactors on federal lands and military bases.

The NRC is assessing the executive orders and will comply with White House directives, spokesperson Scott Burnell said Friday.

Jacob DeWitte, chief executive officer of the nuclear energy company Oklo, brought a golf ball to the Oval Office. He told Trump that’s the amount of uranium that can power someone’s needs for their entire life.

“It doesn’t get any better than that,” he said, holding up the ball.

“Very exciting indeed,” Trump said.

Trump has signed a spate of executive orders promoting oil, gas and coal that warm the planet when burned to produce electricity. Nuclear reactors generate electricity without emitting greenhouse gases. Trump said reactors are safe and clean, but did not mention climate benefits. Safety advocates warn that nuclear technology still comes with significant risks that other low-carbon energy sources don’t, including the danger of accidents or targeted attacks, and the unresolved question of how to store tens of thousands of tons of hazardous nuclear waste.

The order to reorganize the NRC will include significant staff reductions but is not intended to fire NRC commissioners who lead the agency. David Wright, a former South Carolina elected official and utility commissioner, chairs the five-member panel. His term ends June 30, and it is unclear if he will be reappointed.

Critics have trepidations

Critics say the White House moves could compromise safety and violate legal frameworks such as the Atomic Energy Act. Compromising the independence of the NRC or encouraging it to be circumvented could weaken the agency and make regulation less effective, said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“Simply put, the U.S. nuclear industry will fail if safety is not made a priority,” he said.

Gregory Jaczko, who led the NRC under President Barack Obama, said Trump’s executive orders look like someone asked an AI chatbot, “How do we make the nuclear industry worse in this country?”

He called the orders a “guillotine to the nation’s nuclear safety system” that will make the country less safe, the industry less reliable and the climate crisis more severe.

A number of countries are speeding up efforts to license and build a new generation of smaller nuclear reactors to meet a surging demand for electricity and supply it carbon-free. Last year, Congress passed legislation that President Joe Biden signed to modernize the licensing of new reactor technologies so they can be built faster.

This month, the power company in Ontario, Canada, began building the first of four small nuclear reactors.

Valar Atomics is a nuclear reactor developer in California. Founder and CEO Isaiah Taylor said nuclear development and innovation in the United States has been slowed by too much red tape, while Russia and China are speeding ahead. He said he’s most excited about the mandate for the Energy Department to speed up the pace of innovation.

The NRC is currently reviewing applications from companies and a utility that want to build small nuclear reactors to begin providing power in the early 2030s. Currently, the NRC expects its reviews to take three years or less.

Tori Shivanandan, chief operating officer of Radiant Nuclear, a California-based startup, said the executive orders mark a “watershed moment” for nuclear power in the U.S., adding that Trump’s support for the advanced nuclear industry will help ensure its success.

On Thursday, the US House of Representatives advanced Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill, which may end numerous green-energy subsidies that have supported the renewable energy sector.

Trump's budget package - which he calls ""one big beautiful bill"" - would eliminate funding established under former US President Joe Biden's administration through the Inflation Reduction Act and repeal grants intended to reduce air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions or purchase electric heavy-duty vehicles.

The NYT report adds that the EPA sent the draft to the White House for review on May 2, which could undergo changes before it is formally released and the public is given the opportunity to offer comments, likely in June.","https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--7biGeYKN--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/one-cms/core/2025-05-24t092158z_1_lynxnpel4n02v_rtroptp_3_berkshire-coal-pollution.jpg?itok=6q9Zm6KS",N,,2025-05-24 09:01:10.183188

""Improving public health in America cannot happen without reigning in corporate control.
""Any administration serious about public health must strictly regulate the corporations putting our food and water supplies at risk.""","Hours after Republicans in the U.S. House passed a budget reconciliation package Thursday that would slash hundreds of billions of dollars in healthcare and federal food assistance programs for low-income Americans, the nation's top health agency released a highly anticipated report on chronic diseases in children—one that had nothing to say about the impacts those cuts will have on millions of children and instead offered a litany of complaints about families' lifestyles, vaccines, and ""overmedicalization,"" with few solutions.

Led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the so-called ""Make America Healthy Again"" Commission released The MAHA Report, urging the federal government to ""act decisively"" to reverse ""the childhood chronic disease crisis by confronting its root causes—not just its symptoms.""

But longtime campaigners in the food safety realm said that while the report's partial focus on the wide use of pesticides, herbicides, and other chemicals—many of which are banned in Europe—is a positive step, the document gave little indication that Kennedy and other Trump administration officials plan to listen to scientists who warn that these chemicals are linked to cancer, birth defects, and immune function.

As Civil Eatsreported in April, dozens of GOP lawmakers wrote to Kennedy and other commission members including Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, warning that a push to limit pesticides in food was being pushed by ""activist groups promoting misguided and sometimes malicious policies masquerading as health solutions.""

""Protecting children's health and building a healthy food system must trump pesticide corporations' profits,"" said George Kimbrell, legal director of Center for Food Safety, in a Thursday statement. ""Policy and governance must be based on sound science and reject fearmongering and lobbying influence alleging that these toxins are needed for a healthy food system or agricultural economy.""

The report also includes numerous mentions of health guidelines and standards in Europe, but Zeldin was clear in a call with reporters as the document was released that ensuring the health of American children ""cannot happen through a European mandate system that stifles growth.""

The commission suggested that U.S. farmers will continue to use 300 millions of pounds of glyphosate and 70 million pounds of atrazine per year—herbicides that, respectively, have been the subject of thousands of lawsuits filed by cancer patients and contaminate the drinking water of 40 million Americans.

While the World Health Organization has classified glyphosate as a probable carcinogen and numerous countries have banned the weed-killer, the MAHA Commission said ""human studies are limited"" regarding glyphosate and similar products. The report allowed that ""a selection of research studies... have noted a range of possible health effects.""

Even that language was enough to anger agricultural groups and the Republican politicians who are allied with them, with the American Soybean Association accusing the commission of ""glaring misinformation and anti-farmer findings"" on Friday.

Kimbrell said the report ""falls woefully short of providing any next steps in how the government is going to stop this health epidemic from continuing.""

""To be meaningful, the findings of the report must translate into concrete actions that truly advance a healthier, more sustainable food system for America's farmers and consumers,"" he said.

The report also makes no mention of factory farming and its link to antibiotic resistance via corporate farmers' widespread antibiotic use; the leading causes of death for children in the U.S., gun violence and car accidents; and dental cavities, which is one of the most common chronic health problems in children.

Kennedy has spearheaded an effort to remove fluoride from public drinking water, saying in the report that exposure to high levels of fluoride is linked to low IQ in children. Widespread community water fluoridation has been linked to a sharp decrease in tooth decay among children, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hailing the practice, now used in 60% of the country, as a major public health achievement.

Medical organizations have said concerns about fluoridation raised by Kennedy and others are unfounded.

During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy dismissed the idea that healthcare should be a human right—falsely claiming Americans prefer the for-profit health insurance industry to government-run systems that have been shown to be far less costly and have better outcomes. The report also makes no mention of the harms of tying healthcare to profit, even as it compared U.S. life expectancy and healthcare costs unfavorably to those in other wealthy nations.

In a video posted to social media, dietician Jessica Knurick emphasized that Kennedy is right to point out the nation's ""chronic disease problem.""

""But he gets the causes and the solutions completely wrong,"" she said. ""His causes are not evidence-based and they play into the idea of scientific and regulatory corruption to erode trust in science. And his solutions distract from evidence-based solutions that could actually help while actively undermining public health.""

With the MAHA Report focusing heavily on sedentary lifestyles and low-income people's reliance on ultraprocessed, inexpensive food, Food and Water Watch (FWW) senior policy analyst Rebecca Wolf said the document amounts to ""half-baked finger-pointing that blames the sick.""

""Improving public health in America cannot happen without reigning in corporate control. It is a grave mistake to exclude Big Ag from culpability,"" said Wolf. ""Any administration serious about public health must strictly regulate the corporations putting our food and water supplies at risk.""

Policy solutions that went ignored in the report, said Wolf, include:

Closing the ""Generally Recognized as Safe"" loophole that allows corporations to self-certify the safety of food additives without Food and Drug Administration approval;

Canceling plans to roll back existing regulations for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS;

Fully funding and staffing food safety agencies, which have been slashed by the Trump administration; and

Stopping state legislatures from passing laws called ""Cancer Gag Act legislation"" by opponents, which would limit pesticide manufacturer liability in health-related lawsuits.

""The report is right to highlight the health impacts of ultraprocessed foods, microplastics, PFAS, and pesticides,"" said FWW, ""but falls short of directing real policy recommendations capable of reigning in corporate polluters.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=60312217&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C577%2C0%2C577,N,,2025-05-24 13:08:59.388796

Story summary

U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright issued an emergency order on Friday, May 23 — just eight days before the J.H. Campbell plant in Port Sheldon Township was scheduled to shut down, a plan that has been in place since 2021.

The Ottawa County Board of Commissioners approved a resolution on in February urging Consumers Energy to delay the closure of the J.H. Campbell plant, however, it stopped short of filing a lawsuit in April.

Consumers Energy previously said the plan for closure was vetted and approved from multiple stakeholders and regulatory agencies; it is unknown how much coal remains at the site to continue operations.

PORT SHELDON TWP. — The long-planned closing of the coal-fired J.H. Campbell plant in Port Sheldon Township will be delayed at least 90 days after Trump Administration officials issued an emergency order directing Consumers Energy to remain “available for operation” going into peak summer demand.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued the emergency order on Friday, May 23 — just eight days before the plant was scheduled to shut down, a plan that has been in place since 2021.

The U.S. Department of Energy said the move is intended “to minimize the risk of blackouts and address critical grid security issues in the Midwestern region of the United States ahead of the high electricity demand expected this summer.”

Wright directed the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, in coordination with Consumers Energy to ensure that the 1,560 megawatt plant to “[remain] available for operation, minimizing any potential capacity shortfall that could lead to unnecessary power outages.”

“Today’s emergency order ensures that Michiganders and the greater Midwest region do not lose critical power generation capability as summer begins and electricity demand regularly reach high levels,” Wright said in a prepared news release.

The Energy Department said the emergency order, which is issued by the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, is authorized by Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act and is in accordance with President Trump’s Executive Order: Declaring a National Energy Emergency to ensure that power generation availability in the region does not “dip below 2024 capacity levels.”

“This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families. With President Trump’s leadership, the Energy Department is hard at work securing the American people access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy that powers their lives regardless of whether the wind is blowing, or the sun is shining.”

On May 14, Consumers officials said the planned May 31 closure of the Campbell plant remained on track. After Wright issued the emergency order on Friday, however, the company said it would comply.

“Consumers Energy plans to comply with the 90-day pause from the Department of Energy. We are reviewing the executive action and the overall impact on our company,” Katie Carey, director of media relations for Consumers, said in a Friday statement to ONN.

A long-debated topic

The emergency order came after a yearlong effort from a local grassroots organization petitioned Ottawa County officials to intervene in some way to prevent the closure of the Campbell plant.

Organizers of the “Save the Campbell” effort coalesced at the beginning of 2024 — mainly members of far-right fundamentalist groups such as Ottawa Impact, The Gideon 300 and the Ottawa County GOP — said a government-owned electric co-op was possible if voters approved a “home rule charter” at the ballot box.

The issue was never put up for a vote, so a change in government structure is not forthcoming; however, local officials asked Consumers for reassurance earlier this year that local energy supplies will be uninterrupted as the Campbell plant headed for closure at the end of May.

In February, the Ottawa County Board of Commissioners approved a resolution urging delay in the plant’s closure, however, officials stopped short April 22 of opting to bring litigation to prevent the closure altogether.

Commissioners pointed to two separate reports — from MISO as well as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC — that gave them concerns over the energy grid’s reliability once the Campbell is taken offline.

MISO published the results of its annual survey in June 2024, which indicated at the time that there was “a growing capacity deficit beginning in the 2025-26 planning year.”

“Next summer, MISO could see resource sufficiency ranging from a 2.7 GW capacity shortfall to a 1.1 GW surplus, underscoring the need to accelerate resource additions, monitor large load additions, and delay resource retirements to reliably manage the anticipated growth in electricity demand,” according to the survey.

NERC is a nonprofit international regulatory authority that more broadly looks at reliability standards as well as seasonal and long‐term outlooks for the entire U.S. grid. The group published a long-term reliability assessment in December 2024 that labeled MISO’s section of the grid as “high risk,” meaning the grid subsection that includes the state of Michigan “falls below established resource adequacy criteria in the next five years.”

“High-risk areas are likely to experience a shortfall in electricity supplies at the peak of an average summer or winter season. Extreme weather, producing wide-area heat waves or deep-freeze events, poses an even greater threat to reliability,” the report said.

Commissioner Jacob Bonnema questioned why Consumers opted to sunset the plant five years ahead than previously planned.

Dena Isabell, stakeholder engagement manager at Consumers, told commissioners in February that Consumers adopted in 2021 that helped the company identify about $600 million in savings for its customers over 20 years with the retirement of the plant.

“That includes renewables that get brought onto the grid, which are cheaper than what we have,” she said, “so that is a savings to our customers, which is part of the clean and affordable and reliable energy — so it’s an economic decision.”

One component of the cost savings was coal.

Rich Houtteman, community affairs manager for Consumers, explained to commissioners in February that the cost of shipping coal is a huge financial consideration for the energy company.

“It’s about $50 a ton to ship excess coal off-site,” he said. “We had 30,000 tons. That’s a lot for our customers. So we’re trying to burn up all the coal as we kind of bring in 130 train car loads a day.”

Consumers did not respond to an inquiry Friday evening on how much coal remained on the site.

A political talking point

OI Commissioner Allison Miedema — who strongly backed the county suing Consumers to prevent the Campbell closure — asked the utility company’s officials in February what new assets were being brought onto the grid.

Isabell pointed to renewables as well as natural gas assets.

“We do have a lot of renewables that are coming online, so that is very important to us,” she said. “We do have natural gas. We like natural gas. It is part of our future that we have — it is agile, it’s able to come online quickly, we can dispatch that in a matter of hours, versus a matter of days in the cold — so we see natural gas as part of our future.”

Isabell also noted wind and solar and battery storage, “which is going to be a major, major component and required by law, so we are going to be adding a ton of battery storage as well.”

After Isabell noted that the state’s new clean energy laws required energy companies to have clean and sustainable energy sources by 2040, OI Commissioner Sylvia Rhodea asked if the new Trump Administration’s policies could lead to a relaxation in Consumers’ plans.

“Is it possible we might see a change in that legislation that would lift those requirements? I’m just wondering if it could be slowed down if we’re not looking at deadlines until 2040,” Rhodea said.

Isabell said Consumers was committed to its clean energy plan in 2021 — before the legislation in Michigan was approved in 2023 — and that bringing massive assets like the Campbell on and off the grid is no simple or quick task.

“We do our best to try to be as agile as possible, but assets like this aren’t something that you can just bring on and take off very quickly,” she said. “So we do our best in these integrated resources plans to try to plan for what we think could be possible in the future. But we can’t plan for everything that could happen with any type of policy. So our plan to retire (Campbell) was on the last integrated resource plan, which does actually meet the new state policy, which works for us going forward.

“But large assets like that aren’t something that you can just quickly change with new policies in two years.”

The integrated resource plans are required by the Michigan Public Service Commission, a regulatory agency that oversees public utilities in Michigan.

“The Michigan Public Service Commission requires us to create a 20-year plan that says, ‘How are you going to serve your customer, clean, reliable and affordable energy for the next 20 years?’ And this requires us to come up with scenarios,” Isabell said.

Those scenarios are then presented to stakeholders in a series of workshops over two years with community stakeholders who then provide feedback to help.

“We’re retooling, and we’re getting ready to do our next integrated resource plan, new technologies, new laws, new things like that require us to be agile. We constantly need to update those plans and make sure that we’re giving our customers the best technology and the best cost we possibly can,” Isabell said.

How we got here

The Campbell Plant is Consumers’ last — and largest — coal-fired plant in the state.

The plant, operating since 1962, was originally scheduled to close partially in 2030 and wholly in 2040. But the utility announced in 2021 it was moving the plan up by 15 years for an operations end date of May 31, 2025.

The utility was seeking to end coal use altogether by 2025 as part of its goal to achieve carbon neutrality.

Since the announcement, Consumers has been actively preparing the plant for “full retirement,” a spokesperson said last year.

“The complex will officially go into retirement with an aim to go cold and dark after 2025,” said former Consumers spokesperson Kristen Van Kley. “In 2026 and on, the complex will be demolished with a plan to restore the site over time.”

The plant, when operating at full capacity, can generate 1,450 megawatts of electricity. Michigan consumed about 113,740 gigawatt hours of electricity in 2019, according to a 2020 report from the U.S. Department of Energy.

At the time, Van Kley said new technologies would ensure Consumers would be able to continue supporting the statewide grid.

“Energy efficiency, demand response and emerging technologies such as grid modernization and battery storage will help us lower peak customer demand for electricity and deliver exactly what Michigan needs,” she said. “Our plan is designed to respond to emerging needs, adapt to changing conditions and embrace emerging innovative technologies as we work to achieve net zero carbon emissions.”

Key to that strategy are natural gas-fired plants in Consumers’ portfolio, Van Kley said, which include locations in Zeeland, Jackson and a 1,200-megawatt facility that began operating in Van Buren County’s Covert Township in June 2023.

Those operations “will supply reliable, on-demand electricity to meet Michigan’s energy needs when renewables and other sources are not available,” Van Kley said.

Meanwhile, efforts continue to restart operations at Palisades Nuclear Power Plant in Covert Township. The facility, owned by New Jersey-based Holtec International, went offline for decommissioning in May 2022.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-24-065259.png,N,,2025-05-24 08:03:33.097586

Despite proposing over $400 million in cuts to the DOE’s Office of Nuclear Energy, the Trump administration insists these executive orders represent a major step toward restoring what it calls “gold-standard science” in US energy policy.","President Donald Trump signed four executive orders aimed at reviving and expanding the US nuclear energy sector, accelerating reactor development, reforming regulatory frameworks, and boosting domestic uranium production.

According to a senior White House official, the moves are designed to establish the United States as a global leader in nuclear power, Caliber.Az reports via American media.

“We’re signing tremendous executive orders today that really will make us the real power in this industry, which is a big industry,” Trump declared at the Oval Office signing ceremony, where he was joined by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and nuclear industry executives.

The first order expedites reactor testing at the Department of Energy (DOE) national labs by streamlining the application process and enabling a pilot reactor construction program over the next two years. The second directive allows the DOE and the Department of Defence to build nuclear reactors on federal land, intended to power critical defence infrastructure and AI data centres.

Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth emphasised the national security angle, saying, “By having small modular nuclear capabilities... we’re creating an environment where, if things happen elsewhere, the military can be reliable.”

The White House Office of Science and Technology added that the planned reactors would be “small and advanced.”

The third order requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to process nuclear reactor license applications within 18 months. A fourth executive order targets revitalising the US nuclear industrial base, enabling uranium mining, enrichment, and expanded conversion capacity.

Currently, the US lacks sufficient enrichment infrastructure. Until 2023, most enriched uranium came from Russia, but a bipartisan law passed after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine ended that dependency. The administration now aims to dramatically scale up domestic production.

In a written statement, Trump’s administration outlined plans to increase nuclear capacity from about 100 gigawatts to 400 gigawatts by 2050. It also pledged support for new technologies, including Generation III+ and IV reactors, modular reactors, and microreactors, by cutting regulatory and cost barriers.

Though the NRC will not see leadership changes for now, the executive orders mandate a major internal overhaul. According to the order text, the NRC’s current staffing and structure “are misaligned” with its legislative mandate, and the body is criticised for being overly risk-averse at significant economic and strategic cost.

The NRC is instructed to consult the Department of Government Efficiency to reorganise and expedite reactor licensing and adopt “science-based radiation limits.” The order also calls for workforce reductions, though some divisions, particularly those handling new licenses, may expand.

Interior Secretary Burgum denounced what he called “overregulation” and praised Trump’s commitment to “energy dominance,” adding that nuclear innovation is essential to America “winning the AI arms race with China.”

“What we do in the next five years related to electricity is going to determine the next 50,” Burgum said.

Despite proposing over $400 million in cuts to the DOE’s Office of Nuclear Energy, the Trump administration insists these executive orders represent a major step toward restoring what it calls “gold-standard science” in US energy policy.

Asked about the timeline, the White House said it aims to begin testing and deploying new reactors before the end of Trump’s current term.

The Problem: Rising EV Adoption Presents New Battery Lifecycle Challenges

In 2024, global EV sales reached approximately 17.1 million units, representing a 25% increase from 2023¹. With cumulative global EV sales from 2015 to 2023 totaling an estimated over 40 million units², a significant share of the global EV fleet is expected to exit warranty coverage over the coming years.

By 2031, nearly 40 million electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid vehicles worldwide are anticipated to fall outside of their original warranty coverage3,4. This projection is based on current EV adoption figures and standard industry warranty terms, and underscores a growing risk for EV owners facing battery degradation, reduced capacity, and costly replacement requirements5. As the global EV fleet continues to expand, the demand for technologies that extend battery life, reduce long-term ownership costs, and support a sustainable transition to electric mobility is increasing.

The Solution: Pioneering Next-Generation Technologies to Support Lithium-Ion Battery Longevity

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary software and hardware technology aims to address this challenge by extending the lifespan of EV batteries. This innovation is being developed with the aim to enhance the sustainability of electric transportation and the goal to provide EV owners with a more cost-effective, environmentally friendly ownership experience by reducing the need for costly battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), focuses on battery cell rebalancing. The NRC validation demonstrated the technology's ability to effectively correct cell imbalances in lithium-ion battery packs, recovering nearly all lost capacity due to cell imbalance. The validation was conducted on battery modules composed of fifteen 72Ah LiFePO₄ cells connected in series. The cells were initially balanced to a uniform state of charge (SOC), with a measured discharge capacity of 71.10Ah. In the validation test, three of the fifteen cells were then artificially imbalanced-one cell was charged to a 20% higher SOC, and two cells were discharged to a 20% lower SOC-resulting in a reduced discharge capacity of 46.24Ah, following rebalancing using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology.

These advancements establish Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a participant in lithium-ion and EV battery solutions, aiming to tackle the critical challenges of capacity degradation of battery packs and expensive replacements. By extending the lifecycle of battery materials within the supply chain, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies aims to support the energy transition and promote a more sustainable future.

Significance of the Nissan Leaf in the Out-of-Warranty Electric Vehicle Market

The Nissan Leaf holds a significant position in the global electric vehicle market. Since its launch in December 2010, the Leaf has sold more than 650,000 units worldwide6, making it one of the most widely adopted electric vehicles to date. In the United States, the Nissan Leaf was the #2 best-selling plug-in EV between 2010 and 2017, with 114,808 units sold during that period7.

Given that the standard EV battery warranty in the U.S. covers at least 8 years or 100,000 miles8, Nissan Leafs sold during that 2010-2017 window will be out of the standard warranty as of 2025. This represents a substantial and growing segment of aging EVs in need of affordable and effective battery rebalancing solutions.

Looking ahead, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies plans to expand its battery rebalancing solutions to address both current and future high-volume electric vehicle models in the out-of-warranty market. The Company aims to support models that are already beyond their original warranty coverage, as well as those approaching the warranty threshold in the coming years. This strategic expansion is intended to position Battery X Rebalancing Technologies to serve a broader base of electric vehicle owners and service providers, supporting battery lifespan extension, improved affordability, and circular economy objectives.

To speed up the development of nuclear power, the orders grant the U.S. energy secretary authority to approve advanced reactor designs and projects, taking authority away from the independent safety agency that has regulated the U.S. nuclear industry for five decades.

The order comes as demand for electricity surges amid a boom in energy-hungry data centers and artificial intelligence. Tech companies, venture capitalists, states and others are competing for electricity and straining the nation's electric grid.

“We’ve got enough electricity to win the AI arms race with China,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said. “What we do in the next five years related to electricity is going to determine the next 50"" years in the industry.

Still, it's unlikely the U.S. could quadruple its nuclear production in the time frame the White House specified. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two reactors, at a nuclear plant in Georgia, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.

Trump is enthusiastic

At the Oval Office signing, Trump, surrounded by industry executives, called nuclear a “hot industry,” adding, ""It’s time for nuclear, and we’re going to do it very big.”

Burgum and other speakers said the industry has stagnated and has been choked by overregulation.

“Mark this day on your calendar. This is going to turn the clock back on over 50 years of overregulation of an industry,'' said Burgum, who chairs Trump's newly formed Energy Dominance Council.

The orders would reorganize the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission to ensure quicker reviews of nuclear projects, including an 18-month deadline for the NRC to act on industry applications. The measures also create a pilot program intended to place three new experimental reactors online by July 4, 2026 — 13 months from now — and invoke the Defense Production Act to allow emergency measures to ensure the U.S. has the reactor fuel needed for a modernized nuclear energy sector.

The NRC is assessing the executive orders and will comply with White House directives, spokesperson Scott Burnell said Friday.

Jacob DeWitte, chief executive officer of the nuclear energy company Oklo, brought a golf ball to the Oval Office. He told Trump that's the amount of uranium that can power someone’s needs for their entire life.

“It doesn’t get any better than that,” he said, holding up the ball.

“Very exciting indeed,” Trump said.

Trump has signed a spate of executive orders promoting oil, gas and coal that warm the planet when burned to produce electricity. Nuclear reactors generate electricity without emitting greenhouse gases. Trump said reactors are safe and clean, but did not mention climate benefits. Safety advocates warn that nuclear technology still comes with significant risks that other low-carbon energy sources don’t, including the danger of accidents or targeted attacks, and the unresolved question of how to store tens of thousands of tons of hazardous nuclear waste.

The order to reorganize the NRC will include significant staff reductions but is not intended to fire NRC commissioners who lead the agency. David Wright, a former South Carolina elected official and utility commissioner, chairs the five-member panel. His term ends June 30, and it is unclear if he will be reappointed.

Critics have trepidations

Critics say the White House moves could compromise safety and violate legal frameworks such as the Atomic Energy Act. Compromising the independence of the NRC or encouraging it to be circumvented entirely could weaken the agency and make regulation less effective, said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

""Simply put, the U.S. nuclear industry will fail if safety is not made a priority,” he said.

Gregory Jaczko, who led the NRC under President Barack Obama, said Trump’s executive orders look like someone asked an AI chatbot, “How do we make the nuclear industry worse in this country?”

He called the orders a “guillotine to the nation’s nuclear safety system” that will make the country less safe, the industry less reliable and the climate crisis more severe.

A number of countries are speeding up efforts to license and build a new generation of smaller nuclear reactors to meet a surging demand for electricity and supply it carbon-free. Last year, Congress passed legislation that President Joe Biden signed to modernize the licensing of new reactor technologies so they can be built faster.

This month, the power company in Ontario, Canada, began building the first of four small nuclear reactors.

Valar Atomics is a nuclear reactor developer in California. Founder and CEO Isaiah Taylor said nuclear development and innovation in the United States has been slowed by too much red tape, while Russia and China are speeding ahead. He said he's most excited about the mandate for the Energy Department to speed up the pace of innovation.

The NRC is currently reviewing applications from companies and a utility that want to build small nuclear reactors to begin providing power in the early 2030s. Currently, the NRC expects its reviews to take three years or less.

Tori Shivanandan, chief operating officer of Radiant Nuclear, a California-based startup, said the executive orders mark a “watershed moment” for nuclear power in the U.S., adding that Trump's support for the advanced nuclear industry will help ensure its success.

Preserve Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy provisions

To: Sen. Scott, Sen. Moody

From: A verified voter in Gulfport , FL

May 24

The Republican budget bill presented by the House would have severe consequences for American economic growth and energy security. At its core, this bill aims to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which has been instrumental in promoting clean energy investments, creating good-paying jobs, and providing relief to households through lower energy costs. The IRA's provisions have been a boon for American businesses, fostering innovation and positioning the nation as a leader in the rapidly growing clean energy sector. Repealing these measures would not only jeopardize economic growth but also cost an estimated 240,000 jobs in industries ranging from solar and wind to manufacturing. Moreover, the IRA's consumer tax credits have enabled working families to unlock substantial savings on their energy bills, providing much-needed financial relief. Stripping away these incentives would inevitably lead to higher energy costs, disproportionately impacting those struggling financially. The IRA's provisions have proven beneficial across the political spectrum, fostering job creation, economic growth, and energy security – values that transcend party lines. I urge you to exercise your power during the budget reconciliation process and preserve the IRA's consumer tax credits and other clean energy provisions. By defending these measures, you can demonstrate your commitment to the long-term economic prosperity and energy independence of our nation.",https://resist.bot/api/og/letter/letter?title=The+Republican+budget+bill+presented+by+the+House+would+have+severe+consequences+for+American+economic+growth+and+energy+security.+At+its+core%2C+this+bill+aims.....&fullName=Sen.+Scott%2C+Sen.+Moody,N,,2025-05-24 07:02:53.647182

The process is being used to advance President Trump’s key policy priorities on tax, border security, defense and energy policy, as well as a debt limit increase, and the bill will now proceed to the U.S. Senate.

This client alert focuses on the major tax and health provisions of the House-passed bill, and what lies ahead.

Overview of the House Reconciliation Bill

The OBBBA is estimated by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to cost at least $2.5 trillion over 10 years. It includes extensions and modifications of expiring 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) provisions, new corporate and individual tax provisions, repeal and modification of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) energy tax provisions, $1.3 trillion in cuts from Medicaid and other federal health and nutrition programs—including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicare or Affordable Care Act (ACA) coverage—and modification of rules for health insurance sold in the commercial market.

Tax Provisions

The final tax portion of the House-passed reconciliation bill includes expected extensions of expiring TCJA business and individual provisions; new provisions providing individual tax breaks for seniors, overtime work, tipped income and loan interest on domestically assembled vehicles; rollbacks of IRA clean energy tax credits; and tax increases on certain tax-exempt organizations. Below are brief summaries of key provisions.

Extensions for Expired TCJA Business Provisions

Temporarily reinstate the IRC §168(k) 100-% bonus depreciation (for property acquired after January 19, 2025, and before January 1, 2030; scored at $37 billion), suspend the IRC §174 amortization requirement for domestic research or experimental expenditures (for 2025 through 2029; scored at $23 billion) and reinstate the IRC §163(j) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) interest expense limitation for tax years beginning after December 31, 2024, and before January 1, 2030 (scored at $40 billion).

Permanency of TCJA Provisions

Increase and make permanent the rates on Global Intangible Low Tax Income (GILTI) (from 10.5% to 10.668% instead of 13.125%) and Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII) (from 13.125% to 13.335% instead of 16.406%), which are otherwise scheduled to increase more significantly after December 31, 2025 (scored at $143 billion before the slight increases to the rates were made).

Increase and make permanent the rate on Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) payments (from 10% to 10.1% instead of 12.5%), which is otherwise scheduled to increase more significantly after December 31, 2025 (scored at $31 billion before the slight rate increase was made). Additionally, it would repeal scheduled changes to the BEAT calculation that would have reduced regular tax liability by all tax credits.

Increase to 23% and make permanent the deduction for qualified pass-through businesses under IRC §199A.

IRA Clean Energy Tax Credits

While the final House-passed bill retained most of the Ways and Means bill’s changes to the IRA’s clean energy credits, some significant adjustments were made that accelerate the elimination of the tech-neutral clean electricity production tax credit (PTC) and Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and extend more favorable treatment to the production of nuclear energy. (For a more in-depth analysis of energy tax provisions, please see Akin’s prior alert here).

With certain exceptions, the bill would generally accelerate the termination of the following clean energy credits, including:

In 2026, the Clean Hydrogen PTC (§45V), the credits related to clean vehicles (Clean Vehicle Credit (§30D), Previously-Owned Clean Vehicles Credit (§25E), Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit (§30C), Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit (§45W)), and the residential credits for energy efficiency and clean energy (Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (§25C), Residential Clean Energy Credit (§25D), New Energy Efficient Home Credit (§45L)) would no longer be available.

In 2028, the Advanced Manufacturing PTC (§45X) for wind components would no longer be available.

In 2029, the Clean Electricity PTC (§45Y) and the Clean Electricity ITC (§48E) would no longer be available (with an exception for certain nuclear facilities, which would remain eligible) — but the project must have a beginning of construction date that is before 60 days after the bill’s enactment.

In 2032, the Advanced Manufacturing PTC (§45X) for non-wind components and critical minerals and the Energy Property ITC (§48) for geothermal heat property would no longer be available (and the phase-out for both would start in 2030). The Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit (§45U) and Clean Fuel PTC (§45Z) would also go away in 3032 but neither would phase-out before that.

Transferability to be terminated for facilities with beginning-of-construction dates falling after the second anniversary of the enactment of the bill for the Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit (§45Q). Transferability would not be available for the Clean Fuel PTC (§45Z) or Advanced Manufacturing PTC (§ 45X) for credits generated after 2027.

Foreign entity of concern prohibitions to be expanded where the taxpayer is either deemed to be a type of foreign entity or has certain relationships with certain foreign entities, subject to important new definitions. New restrictions would apply to: Clean Electricity ITC (§48E), Clean Electricity PTC (45Y), Advanced Manufacturing PTC (§45X), Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit (§45Q), Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit (§45U), Clean Fuel PTC (§45Z), Energy Property ITC for Geothermal Heat Property (§48). For more details on these new Prohibited Foreign Entity (PFE) rules, see our alert here.

Extend the Clean Fuel PTC (§45Z) by an additional four years through 2031 (scored at $45 billion).

Tax-Exempt Sector

The House-passed bill includes a variety of tax increases on the tax-exempt sector: increase and expansion of the so-called endowment tax through a new tiered rate structure of up to 21% (scored at $7 billion), expansion of the excise tax on tax-exempt employee compensation (scored at $4 billion), a new tiered structure for the excise tax on net investment income of private foundations (scored at $16 billion), an increase in unrelated business income to include transportation fringe benefits (scored at $3 billion) and an increase in unrelated business income to include research if results are not freely available to the general public (negligible score).

New Tax Provisions

New special depreciation allowance for qualified production property would provide a 100% depreciation allowance, versus the current 39-year cost recovery period for nonresidential real property, where “qualified production property” is property used by a taxpayer as an integral part of certain production activities, generally manufacturing, production or refining of a qualified product (scored at $148 billion).

Retaliatory measures under new section 899 for “unfair foreign taxes” would impose increased tax rates on certain individuals and entities, including foreign corporations that are tax residents of a foreign country with an “unfair foreign tax” (excluding U.S.-owned foreign corporations). The bill defines the Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR), digital service tax (DST) and diverted profits tax, as de facto “unfair foreign taxes” subject to the retaliatory measures. It also provides discretion to the Treasury Secretary to designate others that may be subject to retaliation as discriminatory or extraterritorial.

Health Provisions

The House Energy and Commerc­­e Committee’s title makes a number of significant changes that alter and reduce federal spending for the Medicaid program over the next 10 years, including these major provisions:

Medicaid

Work and community engagement requirements for individuals (80 hours per month) linked to Medicaid eligibility, similar to requirements implemented in Georgia. The start date was accelerated to December 31, 2026, instead of January 1, 2029, in the final bill. This requirement is expected to save more than $300 billion over 10 years with the new start date.

Suspension of Biden-era rules that streamlined eligibility and facilitated enrollment under Medicaid (saves $163 billion).

Moratorium on new or additional provider taxes and limitations on state-directed payments. This freezes states’ provider taxes at current dollar amounts and bars states that expanded Medicaid from using payments to pay providers more than 100% of Medicare rates and states that did not expand Medicaid coverage from paying providers more than 110% of Medicare rates. Final score is being updated since the 110% Medicare allowance was included in the final bill (prior estimates saved $196 billion).

Increase in eligibility redeterminations by states that expanded Medicaid coverage (saves $53 billion).

Mandate for cost sharing for all Medicaid expansion adult enrollees with incomes above the federal poverty line ($15,560 for a single person) up to $35 per service. Primary care, mental health care and substance use disorder services would be exempt (saves $13 billion).

Reduced federal spending to states (Federal Medical Assistance Percentage or FMAP) that expanded Medicaid and use their own funds to provide Medicaid coverage to undocumented immigrants. The reduction also applies to people who are otherwise lawfully present per the final bill with a score in progress (prior estimate saved $11 billion).

Ban on use of Medicaid funds for gender affirming care for kids and adults under Medicaid, ACA and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Final score in progress as the ban for adults was included in the final bill (prior estimate saved $830 million and includes a ban on ACA and CHIP).

The House Ways and Means Committee’s title makes payment, eligibility and other reforms to Medicare and significant changes to commercial insurance and ACA coverage. Major provisions include:

Medicare: Increases Medicare payment to physicians in 2026 and future years by tying payment to medical inflation (costs $8 billion); reforms pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) practices under Medicare and Medicaid (saves $3.4 billion); ends Medicare eligibility for some lawfully present foreign nationals and retains eligibility for permanent residents who hold green cards or are from the Marshall Islands, Palau, Micronesia and Cuba (saves $132 million).

Commercial Health Insurance: Expands individual coverage reimbursement arrangements to allow individuals to purchase health coverage on ACA marketplaces, and includes several provisions that expand contributions that can be made to tax-preferred health savings accounts, and expands primary care, health and fitness services that can be covered under health savings accounts and by employers as medical costs (costs $32 billion).

ACA Marketplace Coverage: Imposes stricter eligibility and income verification for enrollees, shortens enrollment windows and allows health insurers to require premium payment before coverage begins (saves $101 billion); limits lawful immigrant access to ACA coverage (saves $63 billion); restores cost-sharing reduction payments that were repealed under the first Trump administration and blocks these funds for abortion care (saves $50 billion); requires individuals to make full repayment of excess premium tax credits paid to health insurers on their behalf (saves $2.3 billion).

Senate Action on Deck: What’s Next?

The Senate will now receive the House measure and work to develop its version of the bill that meets Senate reconciliation instructions in order to maintain the bill’s privileged status and proceed under expedited consideration with a simple majority threshold. The Senate is expected to make potentially substantial changes to the House-passed measure for policy reasons and if needed to make changes to adhere to the Byrd Rule as applicable in the Senate. While it’s still unclear what legislative text the Senate Republicans will utilize, one option the Senate may utilize includes assembling a substitute amendment to the House-passed version for formal floor consideration.

The Senate Finance Committee instruction under the Senate-passed Budget Resolution includes a net spending ceiling of $1.5 trillion for tax cuts and other spending outside the scope of extending the TCJA. The Finance Committee also benefits from a “current policy baseline” per the budget resolution that excludes the $3.8 trillion cost of making the 2017 tax cuts permanent. This exclusion and net ceiling amount are intended to allow the Finance Committee to spend up to $5.3 trillion on tax cuts or other spending priorities, creating flexibility for additional tax cuts and spending priorities of Republicans and President Trump. The use of the current policy baseline in adhering to the Byrd Rule is expected to be a point of discussion among Republicans, Democrats and the Senate Parliamentarian.

The Finance Committee is also instructed to propose changes that increase the statutory debt limit by not more than $5 trillion, a $1 trillion increase compared to the Ways and Means Committee’s instruction. This difference was likely intended to provide flexibility for bill writers and ensure that the federal debt limit does not have to be revisited prior to the 2026 mid-term election.

Next Steps, The Byrd Rule and the “X” Date

Senate consideration of its reconciliation bill will follow expedited procedures if the bill meets budget resolution instructions and reconciliation rules. A Senate reconciliation bill is filibuster-proof, debate time is limited to 20 hours and amendments must be germane—understanding that points of order that require 60-vote thresholds can be raised by any member against provisions in the budget reconciliation package for which the Parliamentarian has determined run afoul of the Byrd Rule.

Following 20 hours of debate, there will be a vote-a-rama. In a typical session, hundreds of amendments will be proposed, but only a dozen or more will be voted on and even less adopted. Often used as a political messaging tactic, this process allows the minority party and any member to force votes on amendments that ordinarily would not be considered on the Senate floor.

The Byrd Rule is a Senate feature of the budget reconciliation process that can lead to exclusion of non-budgetary provisions, or unrelated legislative items. The rule comprises a multi-pronged test applied to individual provisions and the reconciliation bill as a whole. The Senate Parliamentarian presides over the application of the Byrd Rule, but individual points of order need to be raised to potentially eliminate provisions in the Senate reconciliation bill, or Senators can offer an amendment to recommit the measure with instructions.

The main premise of the Byrd Rule is that to have the filibuster-proof privilege, the Senate reconciliation provisions and the bill as a whole must be primarily budgetary (i.e., produce increases or decreases in federal spending in ways that alter the federal deficit as a first order). Alterations can increase or decrease the deficit, but the budget impact must be substantially greater than the policy or non-budgetary impact. Scoring of reconciliation provisions and the package is conducted by the CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). A provision that does not meet the budgetary impact requirements of the Byrd Rule are deemed “extraneous” and still may be included in a reconciliation bill, but a point of order can be raised by any member to require a 60-vote threshold to remain in the bill. Not meeting certain Byrd Rule provisions can endanger a provision or the privilege of the entire bill. Note, Appendix A lists the criteria that constitutes an extraneous matter under the Byrd Rule.

Since all Senate Democrats opposed the budget resolution, the first step in the Budget Reconciliation process earlier this year, Democrats are expected to test all provisions in the OBBBA against the Byrd Rule and raise objections or points of order to ones they believe do not pass muster. Major changes to the Medicaid program could fall into this category, as well as other provisions that do not change revenue or outlays. An example of such a provision includes the House-passed bill’s 10-year moratorium on state regulation of artificial intelligence (AI). A provision not meeting the Byrd Rule and failing to secure 60 or more votes in the Senate would be removed from the bill—regardless of whether it was in the House-passed budget reconciliation measure or included as part of a potential Senate substitute.

As a last step, both the House and Senate must pass an identical version of the reconciliation bill that can be presented to the President. While the President can veto the bill at this stage, it would require the process to completely restart, beginning with the adoption of a fresh budget resolution.

That said, inaction on the budget reconciliation bill is not an option in terms of the personal tax rates that will otherwise increase at the end of 2025—per the TCJA from 2017. The most pressing deadline, however, to deliver a reconciliation bill that can be signed by President Trump is sometime in July or early August. On May 9, Treasury Secretary Bessent warned Congress that there is a reasonable probability the federal government’s cash and extraordinary measures will be exhausted in August, while Congress is slated to be in its annual month-long recess. To “protect the full faith and credit of the United States,” Secretary Bessent is urging Congress to increase or suspend the debt limit by mid-July. Therefore, the Senate has a clear deadline to not only pass the budget reconciliation package, but to ensure whatever is adopted can also be approved by the U.S. House and signed into law by the President over the coming weeks.

1. Tax bill passed by House Republicans would gut Biden-era clean energy tax credits –– AP News

House Republicans passed a more stringent budget bill targeting clean energy tax incentives. The bill imposes a 60-day window for project construction to begin post-passage and requires completion by the end of 2028. It eliminates rooftop solar credits, slashes EV manufacturing credits, and blocks credit transferability—except for nuclear. It also enforces strict foreign sourcing limits for all credits. SEIA warns this could cost over 300,000 jobs, endanger nearly 300 solar and storage factories, and result in the loss of 145,000 GWh of power by 2030—more than Pennsylvania’s annual consumption.

Synhelion, a Swiss clean-energy company, demonstrated its “solar diesel” by powering a 110-year-old steamboat on Lake Lucerne. The startup uses concentrated solar heat to convert CO₂ and methane from ag waste into hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which are synthesized into diesel usable in conventional engines. The fuel can reduce carbon pollution by up to 80% compared to fossil alternatives. Synhelion raised $107 million and operates a pilot plant in Germany, with expansion plans in Spain, Morocco, and Oman.

The Trump administration has reportedly ceased enforcement of several federal standards. Enforcement actions by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration plummeted 95% compared to Biden-era levels. Trump also ordered the Department of Energy to stop appliance efficiency standards enforcement and curtailed EPA pollution crackdowns. A new memo instructs agencies not to halt energy production unless there’s an immediate health emergency. Legal experts say this represents an unprecedented use of executive power to selectively ignore laws, potentially setting a dangerous precedent for future administrations.

Despite Texas leading the nation in wind and ranking second in solar, Republican lawmakers are proposing laws that would hamper renewable growth. Since 2022, companies have announced $64 billion in clean energy investments in Texas. The proposed measures would tighten permitting rules, force wind and solar to cover backup power costs, and grant the state veto power over new projects. Critics warn this would cripple the renewables sector, increase consumer electricity costs, and weaken grid reliability—especially under extreme weather stress.

While the United States led the development of civilian nuclear power through the Atomic Energy Commission, the National Reactor Testing Station (now Idaho National Laboratory), and other Federal entities, the commercial deployment of new nuclear technologies has all but stopped in recent decades.

Overregulation by the Federal government has stifled the domestic development and deployment of advanced reactors.

While the United States cultivated the effort to design and build the first Generation IV reactor for commercial use, we have since ceded the initiative to foreign nations in building these advanced reactors.

Advanced reactors have revolutionary potential, opening a range of new applications to support data centers, microchip manufacturing, petrochemical production, healthcare, desalination, hydrogen production, and other industries.

By maximizing DOE’s jurisdiction over next-generation nuclear technologies that are still in development, this Executive Order ensures that America’s innovators have clear pathways to create nuclear technologies that will propel economic prosperity and bolster national security.

UNLEASHING AMERICAN ENERGY: President Trump believes in all forms of reliable, dispatchable energy, harnessing nuclear, fossil fuels, and emerging technologies to secure American energy independence and fuel economic growth.

On Day One, President Trump declared a National Energy Emergency to eliminate bureaucratic barriers, unleash innovation, and restore America’s position as the world’s leading energy producer.

Unleashing American energy will create jobs and economic prosperity, improve the United States’ trade balance, help our country compete with hostile foreign powers, strengthen relations with allies and partners, and support international peace and security.",https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WH47-Social-Share-Card.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 09:01:45.573307

Senator Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen, Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, have sent a letter to the U.S. Comptroller General Gene Dodaro urging the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to continue to investigate the Administration’s withholding of Congressionally appropriated funds. The GAO has the authority to determine whether the Administration is violating the Impoundments Control Act by illegally withholding funds, and the Senators’ letter follows GAO’s recent finding that the Department of Transportation was in fact doing so. In their letter, the Senators press GAO to continue working on the 39 cases and counting of potentially illegal impoundments it has identified and stress that the GAO must move forward with or without the Administration’s cooperation.

“As members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, we have tracked with growing alarm the pauses and cancellation of federal funding across agencies since the start of the Trump Administration. We have noted at least $430 billion in funding has been blocked, an amount equivalent to nearly a third of the discretionary budget,” the Senators begin.

“Agencies were required to submit spend plans for fiscal year 2025 on April 29, but most did not supply plans or provided insufficient detail to allow the Committee to ensure they are allocating resources in accordance with the law. The Administration has also stopped publicly posting apportionment documents as required by the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act of 2023, weakening Congress’s ability to conduct effective oversight,” they continue.

“In a Committee hearing on April 29, you testified that the GAO has 39 ongoing investigations into potentially illegal impoundments. […] In your testimony on April 29, you indicated that in some cases you were waiting on information from agencies on their justifications for funding freezes. We appreciate that GAO works to ascertain intent as part of any investigation under the Impoundment Control Act (ICA), and that your good faith requests for information from the Administration allow you to obtain a fuller picture of the circumstances surrounding a withholding. […] However, GAO was similarly stonewalled by the prior Trump Administration, when the Office of Management and Budget and the State Department failed to provide necessary information about potential impoundments of Foreign Military Financing Funds. GAO noted then, and we agree, that the delay in response had “constitutional significance” as it obstructed an investigation that Congress delegated to GAO under the ICA,” they note.

The Senators go on to urge, “As Congress begins deliberations on the fiscal year 2026 appropriations bills, it is critical that we understand how the Administration is executing current law, and whether, through programmatic delay or illegal impoundment, funds are in danger of expiring without obligation. If the Administration is breaking the law without consequence, the fundamental separation of powers and Congressional power of the purse is under serious threat. We encourage you to continue to report to Congress as quickly as possible on any violations of the ICA. In the event of a violation, Congress has also invested GAO with the authority to file suit to ensure funds are spent in accordance with the law.”

Dear Comptroller Dodaro,

As members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, we have tracked with growing alarm the pauses and cancellation of federal funding across agencies since the start of the Trump Administration. We have noted at least $430 billion in funding has been blocked, an amount equivalent to nearly a third of the discretionary budget.

Agencies were required to submit spend plans for fiscal year 2025 on April 29, but most did not supply plans or provided insufficient detail to allow the Committee to ensure they are allocating resources in accordance with the law. The Administration has also stopped publicly posting apportionment documents as required by the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act of 2023, weakening Congress’s ability to conduct effective oversight.

As the President enters his fifth month in office, the argument that programs are simply paused for review becomes increasingly less credible. In addition, executive orders and public statements from the President, his cabinet, and the so-called Department of Government Efficiency indicate a clear intention to stop funding for certain agencies and programs entirely. Those statements have frequently aligned with the cancellation of grants and contracts, indicating that they are implementing cuts in fiscal year 2025 in violation of appropriations law, rather than proposing cuts for fiscal year 2026 for Congressional consideration.

As you know, Congress has authority under the Constitution to appropriate funds, and the Executive Branch must expend those funds as the law dictates. And as GAO has stated, “Faithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law.”

In a Committee hearing on April 29, you testified that the GAO has 39 ongoing investigations into potentially illegal impoundments. We appreciate GAO’s completion of its first legal opinion, that the Department of Transportation violated the recording statute and the Impoundment Control Act (ICA) by improperly recording program liabilities and illegally withholding mandatory funds for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program. The NEVI program was authorized by the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and, as you noted, “[t]he Constitution grants the President no unilateral authority to withhold funds from obligation.” We agree with your conclusion, and will expect the Department of Transportation to immediately make the withheld funds available to the states.

In your testimony on April 29, you indicated that in some cases you were waiting on information from agencies on their justifications for funding freezes. We appreciate that GAO works to ascertain intent as part of any investigation under the Impoundment Control Act (ICA), and that your good faith requests for information from the Administration allow you to obtain a fuller picture of the circumstances surrounding a withholding.

However, GAO was similarly stonewalled by the prior Trump Administration, when the Office of Management and Budget and the State Department failed to provide necessary information about potential impoundments of Foreign Military Financing Funds. GAO noted then, and we agree, that the delay in response had “constitutional significance” as it obstructed an investigation that Congress delegated to GAO under the ICA.

GAO also noted, in its investigation of the illegal impoundment by the Department of Defense that occurred at the same time, that while OMB provided an explanation for the withholding, its explanation did not adequately justify the action. GAO said that “the burden to justify a withholding of budget authority rests with the executive branch.” You reiterated that in your decision on the Department of Transportation’s illegal withholding of NEVI program funds. In the absence of fulsome responses from the Administration, we encourage GAO to carefully examine the public record, including court records in cases filed against agencies, to inform your investigation into whether agencies are demonstrating the intent to illegally impound funds.

As Congress begins deliberations on the fiscal year 2026 appropriations bills, it is critical that we understand how the Administration is executing current law, and whether, through programmatic delay or illegal impoundment, funds are in danger of expiring without obligation. If the Administration is breaking the law without consequence, the fundamental separation of powers and Congressional power of the purse is under serious threat.

We encourage you to continue to report to Congress as quickly as possible on any violations of the ICA. In the event of a violation, Congress has also invested GAO with the authority to file suit to ensure funds are spent in accordance with the law.

We appreciate the investigations GAO has already undertaken and your vital role in carrying out the ICA to ensure that the President faithfully executes the law as required by our Constitution. We look forward to your legal opinions and analysis of the Administration’s fiscal year 2025 implementation.

Sincerely,

“We’re ready for big, bold solutions,” said Jennifer Walling, executive director of the Illinois Environmental Council.

Gina Ramirez, senior advisor with the Southeast Environmental Task Force, rallied the crowed in support of the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, which Illinois lawmakers will decide on next week. The act would accelerate Illinois’ clean energy progress with a slew of progressive initiatives, including, but not limited to:

The creation of a Solar Bill of Rights, which aims to expand the state’s community solar through incentives to low-income groups and other changes that would make more residents eligible to join programs;

The creation of Illinois Storage for All, which requires the agency to direct up to 25% of the funds toward grants, rebates or incentives designed to encourage renewable energy storage paired with solar distributed renewable energy generation.

The launch of a procurement plan for larger-scale battery projects;

create a virtual power plant program;

Adoption of uniform standards to ensure that Illinoisians who invest in rooftop solar are given fair

credit; and

Directing utilities to propose rules for new large-scale data centers to protect other electric consumers and ensure

the facilities have plans to develop clean energy resources to reduce strain on the power grid.

With the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, Ramirez said, “Illinois can continue to lead the nation on our climate and equity goals by facing the new and emerging threats to our electric grid and putting the interests of people and our planet before the interests of dirty energy companies, big tech, and entrenched utilities.”

(Read: Legislators call for increased transparency with PJM)

Utility companies and the “dirty fuel industry” wrote Illinois’ energy legislation for years, Ramirez said.

Illinois flipped that legislative script in 2021 to give environmental justice advocates a seat at the table, Ramirez said, and made reference to the Clean and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA).

Throughout the rally, advocates showed a sense of pride in the CEJA, which expanded the Illinois Solar for All program from $30 million to $70 million per year, unlocking the benefits of affordable renewable energy for families across the state. CEJA also sets a target to get Illinois to 40% renewable energy by 2030 and 50% renewable energy by 2040.

(See also: Five years of Illinois Solar for All)

Currently 2.46% of Illinois electricity is from solar, though the state is ranked 10th for capacity and 11th for its solar generation per capita, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. For overall generation, Illinois is the nation’s sixth-largest energy-consuming and eleventh-largest energy-producing state, and generates more nuclear energy than any other state, according to Energy Information Administration. Illinois typically sends about one-fifth of the power it generates to other states over the regional grid.

Illinois’ power grid is struggling to keep pace with the surge in demand for energy largely caused by its power-hungry data centers, Ramirez said. Many of these facilities are being located in environmental justice communities, she noted, “and while they promise progress in economic advancements, they also pose risks to our electric grid and place a huge pollution burden on our neighborhoods that are already surrounded by toxic-industry data centers that consume huge amounts of electricity.”

This electricity, she said, “often comes from a source that contributes to pollution and climate.”

Recent analysis from Synapse Energy Economics projected that if the retirement of coal plants are delayed so that more data centers can be powered up, CO2 pollution in Northern Illinois will increase by at least 64%.

“It’s not right,” Ramirez said. “And it’s not just pollution that will increase if we don’t put safeguards in place, bills will go up,” she said. “We cannot allow these power-hungry facilities to drive up costs for consumers that are already struggling to pay their bills.”",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/6486283919_7ec57874f0_o-1200x988.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 12:17:13.612568

To speed up the development of nuclear power, the orders grant the U.S. energy secretary authority to approve some advanced reactor designs and projects, taking authority from the independent safety agency that has regulated the U.S. nuclear industry for five decades.

""We've got enough electricity to win the AI arms race with China,"" said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. ""What we do in the next five years related to electricity is going to determine the next 50"" years in the industry.

Still, it's unlikely the U.S. could quadruple its nuclear production in the time frame the White House specified, experts say. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two reactors, at a nuclear plant in Georgia, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.

At the Oval Office signing, Trump, surrounded by industry executives, called nuclear a ""hot industry,"" adding: ""It's time for nuclear, and we're going to do it very big.""

""Mark this day on your calendar. This is going to turn the clock back on over 50 years of overregulation of an industry,"" said Burgum, who chairs Trump's newly formed Energy Dominance Council.

The orders would reorganize the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission to ensure quicker reviews of nuclear projects, including an 18-month deadline for the NRC to act on industry applications. The measures also create a pilot program intended to place three new experimental reactors online by July 4, 2026 -- 13 months from now -- and invoke the Defense Production Act to allow emergency measures to ensure the U.S. has enough uranium and other reactor fuel for a modernized nuclear energy sector.

The orders also call for the Energy and Defense departments to assess the feasibility of restarting closed nuclear power plants and explore siting reactors on federal lands and military bases.

Trump has signed a spate of executive orders promoting oil, gas and coal that warm the planet when burned to produce electricity. Nuclear reactors generate electricity without emitting greenhouse gases. Trump said reactors are safe and clean, but did not mention climate benefits. Safety advocates warn nuclear technology still comes with significant risks that other low-carbon energy sources don't, including the danger of accidents or targeted attacks and the unresolved question of how to store tens of thousands of tons of hazardous nuclear waste.

The order to reorganize the NRC will include significant staff reductions but is not intended to fire NRC commissioners who lead the agency. David Wright, a former South Carolina elected official and utility commissioner, chairs the five-member panel. His term ends June 30, and it is unclear if he will be reappointed.

Critics say the White House moves could compromise safety and violate legal frameworks such as the Atomic Energy Act. Compromising the independence of the NRC or encouraging it to be circumvented could weaken the agency and make regulation less effective, said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Gregory Jaczko, who led the NRC under President Barack Obama, said Trump's executive orders look like someone asked an AI chatbot, ""How do we make the nuclear industry worse in this country?""

He called the executive orders a ""guillotine to the nation's nuclear safety system"" that will make the country less safe, the industry less reliable and the climate crisis more severe.

A number of countries are speeding up efforts to license and build a new generation of smaller nuclear reactors to meet a surging demand for electricity and supply it carbon-free. Last year, Congress passed legislation that former President Joe Biden signed to modernize the licensing of new reactor technologies so they can be built faster.

This month, the power company in Ontario, Canada, began building the first of four small nuclear reactors.

They also argue that such state-level initiatives conflict with federal energy policy and are preempted by existing federal statutes.

The controversial Vermont law, modeled after similar legislation in New York, seeks to hold a select group of coal, oil, and natural gas producers financially responsible for a share of global greenhouse gas emissions dating back to 1995. The fines could total billions of dollars, with no cap included in the statute.

“Alaska is home to the most abundant natural resources and some of the most stunning environmental treasures in the nation,” said Taylor. “Protecting those resources is important and done every day here through rigorous environmental standards. However, Vermont’s newest legal efforts expand their authority and agenda, push their state powers far beyond any reasonable interpretation of the Constitution, and improperly attempt to impose on Alaska’s and other states’ sovereign authority.”

The lawsuit argues that Vermont’s law imposes retroactive liability on companies that were operating in compliance with both state and federal regulations during the time period in question. It also warns that the financial burden of the law would force many traditional energy producers out of business, resulting in widespread job losses and increased dependence on foreign energy sources from nations with weaker environmental protections.

Critics of the law say it unfairly targets domestic producers while ignoring Vermont’s own historical reliance on fossil fuels to power its economy. They also argue that such state-level initiatives conflict with federal energy policy and are preempted by existing federal statutes.

Joining Alaska and West Virginia in the lawsuit are the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming.

Wants to Erase Greenhouse Gas Limits on Power Plants,"Lisa Friedman, www.nytimes.com, lisa-friedman",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/climate/epa-power-plant-rules.html,"And globally, power plants account for about 30 percent of the pollution that is driving climate change.
Scientists have overwhelmingly concluded that carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases from the burning of oil, gas and coal are dangerously heating the planet.
So, it argued, even if American power plants erased all their greenhouse gases from the power sector, the risk to public health would not be “meaningfully” improved.
But in the U.S., power plants were responsible for about 25 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in 2022.
“If they’re successful with regard to power plants, they’re pretty much going to be successful with everything else,” he said.","The Environmental Protection Agency has drafted a plan to eliminate all limits on greenhouse gases from coal and gas-fired power plants in the United States, according to internal agency documents reviewed by The New York Times.

In its proposed regulation, the agency argued that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from power plants that burn fossil fuels “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or to climate change because they are a small and declining share of global emissions. Eliminating those emissions would have no meaningful effect on public health and welfare, the agency said.

But in the United States, the power sector was the second biggest source of greenhouse gases, behind transportation, according to the most recent data available on the E.P.A. website. And globally, power plants account for about 30 percent of the pollution that is driving climate change.

The E.P.A. sent the draft to the White House for review on May 2. It could undergo changes before it is formally released and the public is given the opportunity to offer comments, likely in June.

The proposed regulation is part of a broader attack by the Trump administration on the established science that greenhouse gases threaten human health and the environment. Scientists have overwhelmingly concluded that carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases from the burning of oil, gas and coal are dangerously heating the planet.

“Fossil fuel power plants are the single largest industrial source of climate destabilizing carbon dioxide in the United States, and emit pollution levels that exceed the vast majority of countries in the world,” said Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, an environmental group.

She called the proposed regulation “an abuse of the E.P.A.’s responsibility under the law” and added, “It flies in the face of common sense and puts millions of people in harms way to say the single largest industrial source of carbon dioxide in the United States is not significant.”

“We are seeking to ensure that the agency follows the rule of law while providing all Americans with access to reliable and affordable energy,” Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, said in a statement.

Mr. Zeldin’s spokeswoman, Molly Vaseliou, declined to offer more information about the plan other than to say “the proposal will be published once it has completed interagency review and been signed by the administrator.”

The Trump administration is methodically uprooting policies aimed at curbing climate change, and the E.P.A. is at the epicenter of that effort. In recent weeks, Mr. Zeldin has shuttered offices responsible for regulating climate and air pollution, and has launched the repeal of more than two dozen regulations and policies.

The agency is feeling pressure from the White House to finalize its deregulations by December, according to two people briefed on internal discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to describe them. That would be an extraordinarily fast pace. Rewriting regulations can typically take more than a year.

Mr. Zeldin said deregulation would drive “a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion.”

In proposing to lift regulations on power plants, the E.P.A. points to the fact that the U.S. share of global power sector emissions represented about 3 percent of worldwide greenhouse gases in 2022, down from 5.5 percent in 2005. So, it argued, even if American power plants erased all their greenhouse gases from the power sector, the risk to public health would not be “meaningfully” improved.

But in the U.S., power plants were responsible for about 25 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in 2022. They emitted about 1.5 billion metric tons of emissions in 2023, which is more than the total greenhouse gas emissions produced by most countries.

Just a year ago, when the Biden administration announced tough new limits on pollution from existing coal-fired power plants as well as some new gas-burning plants, the E.P.A. said the restrictions would mean that by 2035 the nation would annually avoid up to 1,200 premature deaths, 870 hospital visits, 1,900 cases of asthma, 48,000 school absences and 57,000 lost work days.

Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University, noted that solving climate change means undertaking a large number of seemingly small measures, like curbing emissions from automobiles, oil and gas wells, air travel, landfills, buildings and more.

“Just because there are multiple contributors to a problem doesn’t mean we should excuse all but the top one,” Dr. Oppenheimer said. “Just because a polluter’s emissions are decreasing doesn’t mean that aren’t still far too high.”

Attorneys who represent utility companies said they agree that the sector is a small part of the global climate problem. “The argument is a solid argument,” said Jeffrey R. Holmstead, who served in the E.P.A. during both Bush administrations and now represents utility companies as a lawyer for the firm Bracewell.

But he wondered if it would hold up under a legal challenge. “I just don’t know if you’re contributing 3 percent of greenhouse gas emissions the court will say ‘that's not significant’ when there’s hardly anybody that contributes more than that.”

Only China releases more pollution from its power plants than the United States.

The E.P.A. plan is likely to face lawsuits once it is finalized. If it survives, it could block future administrations from regulating carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, eliminating a tool that Democratic administrations have relied on to tackle climate change. It also could make it easier to unravel other climate regulations, some experts said.

“If the administration is going to do this, it is the strategically smartest way,” said Jonathan Adler, a conservative law professor at Case Western University. “If they’re successful with regard to power plants, they’re pretty much going to be successful with everything else,” he said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/23/multimedia/23cli-epa-cgfh/23cli-epa-cgfh-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 06:03:08.025098

VESOVICH: To watch our legislatures actively dismiss a constitutional ruling is devastating.

JUHLIN: That's not how State Senator Wylie Galt sees it. He calls the decision...

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

WYLIE GALT: Gift-wrapped present to radical environment activists, an open door for endless lawsuits designed to shut down Montana's fossil fuel industry.

JUHLIN: The federal government estimates that Montana is home to about a third of America's recoverable coal reserves, but the court ordered the state to consider the climate impacts of developing fossil fuel projects and their greenhouse gas emissions.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

GALT: It had nothing to do with protecting the environment and everything to do with weaponizing the courts to strangle our economy.

JUHLIN: A new law Galt sponsored appears to thread the needle of the court's decision. Montana will now inventory greenhouse gas emissions, but it won't regulate them. Other new state laws go one step further, barring Montana from regulating planet-warming emissions at all unless the federal government does so first. That's unlikely under the Trump administration. Lawmakers could have tried to change Montana's constitution, eliminating its guarantee of environmental protection, but that's very difficult to do. University of Montana law professor Constance Van Kley says, short of that...

CONSTANCE VAN KLEY: There has been a response to the courts striking down the legislation on the part of the legislature, with the legislature kind of claiming that the Montana judiciary is out of control and super liberal.

JUHLIN: That's been a theme for several years - Montana's conservative lawmakers and governor challenging the authority of the judicial branch. Green groups say Montanans won't stand for the new laws passed in response to the state Supreme Court decision, which means, Van Kley says, more confrontation in and with state courts.

VAN KLEY: I think it's very likely to end up being litigated.

(SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CHIRPING)

JUHLIN: Back on the river trail, Olivia Vesovich says she and countless other young people will continue to feel the effects of human-caused climate change. She says she's disappointed by the Montana Legislature's priorities.

VESOVICH: They care more about protecting the fossil fuel industry than they care about protecting the lives of children.

JUHLIN: She says the longer the state delays on climate action, the worse things will be in the future, and she hopes her lawmakers keep that in mind.

The concept of the green economy brings together environmental, social, and economic ideas such as using natural resources efficiently, cutting carbon emissions, and making sure economic growth benefits everyone. This approach focuses on two key goals: promoting Sustainable Consumption and Production and achieving Resource Efficiency for Sustainable Development. The first goal focuses on improving production processes while the second refers to lowering the demand for natural resources and minimizing emissions throughout the economy.

Since the Paris Agreement in 2016, international efforts to combat climate change have accelerated. While East Asia is making considerable strides in this regard, Europe — known for its strong commitment to sustainability and emission reductions — stands out as a regional leader.

The European Green Deal: A Sustainable Step Toward 2050

In 2019, the European Union (EU) initiated the European Green Deal to transform the EU into a resource-efficient economy by ensuring zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050 and decoupling resource use. And guess what – it is working.

Pop Out Quote 1: “When local governments invest in renewable energy, everybody wins.” – Saharnaz Mirzazad, Executive Director of ICLEI USA.

According to Eurostat, the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU are manufacturing (21.6%), electricity and gas supply (16.3%), and transportation and storage (16.1%). From 2019 to 2023, greenhouse gas emissions fell from 3.4 billion tonnes to 2.9 billion tonnes, which is a staggering 14.71% decrease.

Among the countries helping to drive this huge shift, Denmark, Austria, and Sweden stand out for their contributions.

Denmark’s Climate Revolution: Cities, Buildings, and Tourism

Denmark ranked as the number one country in the Green Transition Index 2024, based on seven categories: the Overall Economy, Nature, Manufacturing, Utilities, Waste, Buildings, and Transport. Meanwhile, Copenhagen has developed the CPH Climate Plan that addresses four key areas: energy consumption, energy production, mobility, and city administration initiatives. The city has been practicing eco-friendly projects to foster new industries in its green economy market.

Danish companies are putting a strong emphasis on green technologies. VELUX, for example, is a leading company in energy-efficient building solutions. Its “Living Places” project emits just one-third of the Danish government’s 2023 building standard, which caps emissions at 12 kg of CO2 equivalent per square meter per year.

Another city-sized project is eco-tourism, “CopenPay”. This encourages tourists to think and act more sustainably when they travel to the city. The key is simplicity. This allows users easy participation. Tourists can show a train ticket, arrive on a bicycle, or present other simple proof of green actions to redeem their rewards.

In Denmark, about 23.6% of workers are employed in jobs with a significant relation to green tasks that contribute to environmental objects. Between 2011 and 2021, all regions in Denmark recorded an increase in the share of green-task jobs in their employed labor force.

Austria: Proving That Growth and Emission Cuts Can Coexist

Can we decouple emissions from growth? Austria shows that the answer is yes. In 2022, Austria’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions dropped by 6.4% while GDP growth reached 4.8%. Looking at the longer trend, from 2000 to 2022, real GDP grew by 42%, while emissions fell by 4%. Austria achieved these mostly from decarbonization in energy use while maintaining the intensity. Today, 85.3% of the electricity supply is from renewable sources and 76% is from hydropower.

Austria is targeting to meet 100% of its annual electricity demand by renewable generation by 2030. To achieve this, the country must generate an additional 27 terawatt hours (TWh) from renewables. Solar and wind power will take an extra 11 TWh and 10 TWh respectively, and another 5 TWh and 1 TWh will be from hydropower and biomass.

In terms of economy, there are more than 550 companies in greening industries, with the Austrian GreenTech sector alone generating over EUR 15 billion in sales and 50,000 in employment as of 2019.

Sweden’s Step to a Fossil-Free Future

Sweden has also demonstrated that economic growth and reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can go hand in hand. In 2022, Sweden’s real GDP grew by 2.9%, while fossil CO₂ emissions decreased by approximately 0.48%, totaling 37.85 million metric tons. This success in decoupling economic growth from emissions has been driven by a strong emphasis on renewable energy sources.

As of 2022, about 68% of Sweden’s electricity generation came from renewable sources, with hydropower contributing 40%, wind power 19%, solar 1%, and bioenergy 8%. The Swedish government has set a target to achieve 100% fossil-free electricity production by 2040.

The number of jobs in the green economy has risen quickly. Employment in Sweden’s energy-intensive sectors is stable overall, the green economy is further expanding and the number of green jobs is growing. Northern Sweden, in particular, is becoming a significant green tech cluster. Over the next few years, it is estimated that more than EUR 970,000 million will be invested in new green technology.

A Renewable Future Within Reach

One common focus connects these European pioneers: all three are actively working toward achieving fossil-free energy generation within the next 10 to 20 years. It is amazing to imagine we could soon witness countries running on 100% renewable energy.

The moves involve a substantial overhaul of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) that includes looking at staffing levels and directing the Energy and Defence departments to work together to build nuclear plants on federal lands.
Mr Joseph Dominguez, the chief executive of US nuclear power operator Constellation Energy, said Mr Trump’s actions would help normalise the regulatory process.
“A major event would, like those in the past, increase regulatory requirements and set back nuclear energy for a long time,” he said.
Republicans, who are less concerned about global warming, support it because they say nuclear power plants could strengthen US energy security.","– US President Donald Trump on May 23 ordered the nation’s independent nuclear regulatory commission to cut down on regulations and fast-track new licences for reactors and power plants, seeking to shrink a multi-year process down to 18 months.

The requirement was part of a batch of executive orders signed by Mr Trump on May 23 that aim to boost US nuclear energy production amid a boom in demand from data centres and artificial intelligence (AI).

Licensing for reactors in the US can take over a decade at times, a process designed to prioritise nuclear safety but one that has discouraged new projects.

“This is going to turn the clock back on over 50 years of over-regulation of an industry,” US Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who heads the White House Energy Dominance Council, said in the Oval Office.

The moves involve a substantial overhaul of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) that includes looking at staffing levels and directing the Energy and Defence departments to work together to build nuclear plants on federal lands.

The administration envisions the Department of Defence taking a prominent role in ordering reactors and installing them on military bases, a senior White House official said.

The orders also seek to reinvigorate uranium production and enrichment in the US.

Mr Joseph Dominguez, the chief executive of US nuclear power operator Constellation Energy, said Mr Trump’s actions would help normalise the regulatory process.

“We’re wasting too much time on permitting, and we’re answering silly questions, not the important ones,” he said during the signing event.

The US and other nations have ramped up nuclear power regulation in recent decades, partly in response to reactor incidents like the meltdown at the Chernobyl plant in the former Soviet Union in 1986 and the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island plant in the US in 1979.

Developers are also now looking to deploy advanced nuclear technology such as small modular reactors (SMRs) that could potentially be built quickly and at less cost than traditional plants, but which may pose new safety challenges.

“Reorganising and reducing the independence of the NRC could lead to the hasty deployment of advanced reactors with safety and security flaws,” said Mr Ernest Moniz, former US Energy secretary and a nuclear physicist supportive of the industry.

“A major event would, like those in the past, increase regulatory requirements and set back nuclear energy for a long time,” he said.

Mr Trump declared a national energy emergency in January as one of his first acts in office, saying the US had inadequate supplies of electricity to meet the country’s growing needs, particularly for data centres that run AI systems.

Most of Mr Trump’s actions have focused on boosting fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, but administration officials also support nuclear power, which in recent years has attracted growing bipartisan support.

Some Democrats endorse nuclear because the plants do not emit planet-warming greenhouse gases, even as environmentalists have raised concerns about radioactive waste and reactor safety.

Republicans, who are less concerned about global warming, support it because they say nuclear power plants could strengthen US energy security.

Cost and competition, however, has been a major impediment to new nuclear projects, and it is unclear whether Mr Trump’s orders will be enough to overcome them.

NuScale, the only US company with an SMR design approved by regulators, axed its project in 2023 on rising costs and competition from plants that burn plentiful natural gas.

Vogtle, the last US reactor to come online, meanwhile, was about US$16 billion (S$20.5 billion) over budget and delayed by years.

The Loan Programmes Office, which the administration wants to use to finance reactor projects that banks are not willing to support, has been hit hard by Mr Trump’s job layoffs.

The Problem: Rising EV Adoption Presents New Battery Lifecycle Challenges

In 2024, global EV sales reached approximately 17.1 million units, representing a 25% increase from 2023¹. With cumulative global EV sales from 2015 to 2023 totaling an estimated over 40 million units², a significant share of the global EV fleet is expected to exit warranty coverage over the coming years.

By 2031, nearly 40 million electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid vehicles worldwide are anticipated to fall outside of their original warranty coverage3,4. This projection is based on current EV adoption figures and standard industry warranty terms, and underscores a growing risk for EV owners facing battery degradation, reduced capacity, and costly replacement requirements5. As the global EV fleet continues to expand, the demand for technologies that extend battery life, reduce long-term ownership costs, and support a sustainable transition to electric mobility is increasing.

The Solution: Pioneering Next-Generation Technologies to Support Lithium-Ion Battery Longevity

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary software and hardware technology aims to address this challenge by extending the lifespan of EV batteries. This innovation is being developed with the aim to enhance the sustainability of electric transportation and the goal to provide EV owners with a more cost-effective, environmentally friendly ownership experience by reducing the need for costly battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), focuses on battery cell rebalancing. The NRC validation demonstrated the technology's ability to effectively correct cell imbalances in lithium-ion battery packs, recovering nearly all lost capacity due to cell imbalance. The validation was conducted on battery modules composed of fifteen 72Ah LiFePO₄ cells connected in series. The cells were initially balanced to a uniform state of charge (SOC), with a measured discharge capacity of 71.10Ah. In the validation test, three of the fifteen cells were then artificially imbalanced-one cell was charged to a 20% higher SOC, and two cells were discharged to a 20% lower SOC-resulting in a reduced discharge capacity of 46.24Ah, following rebalancing using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology.

These advancements establish Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a participant in lithium-ion and EV battery solutions, aiming to tackle the critical challenges of capacity degradation of battery packs and expensive replacements. By extending the lifecycle of battery materials within the supply chain, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies aims to support the energy transition and promote a more sustainable future.

Significance of the Nissan Leaf in the Out-of-Warranty Electric Vehicle Market

The Nissan Leaf holds a significant position in the global electric vehicle market. Since its launch in December 2010, the Leaf has sold more than 650,000 units worldwide6, making it one of the most widely adopted electric vehicles to date. In the United States, the Nissan Leaf was the #2 best-selling plug-in EV between 2010 and 2017, with 114,808 units sold during that period7.

Given that the standard EV battery warranty in the U.S. covers at least 8 years or 100,000 miles8, Nissan Leafs sold during that 2010-2017 window will be out of the standard warranty as of 2025. This represents a substantial and growing segment of aging EVs in need of affordable and effective battery rebalancing solutions.

Looking ahead, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies plans to expand its battery rebalancing solutions to address both current and future high-volume electric vehicle models in the out-of-warranty market. The Company aims to support models that are already beyond their original warranty coverage, as well as those approaching the warranty threshold in the coming years. This strategic expansion is intended to position Battery X Rebalancing Technologies to serve a broader base of electric vehicle owners and service providers, supporting battery lifespan extension, improved affordability, and circular economy objectives.

Overview

The House of Representatives approved the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” on May 22, 2025. The tax changes in Title XI, as revised by certain amendments (the House Tax Bill) would terminate or otherwise significantly affect renewable energy tax credits. We described other key provisions in the House Tax Bill in a client update that can be accessed here.

Repeal of Inflation Reduction Act clean electricity tax credits

Under current law, electricity produced by certain qualified facilities that do not emit greenhouse gases may qualify for a 10-year production tax credit (the Section 45Y PTC).

Alternatively, under current law, investments in certain qualified facilities that produce clean electricity, as well as energy storage technology, are eligible for an investment tax credit (the Section 48E ITC).

The House Tax Bill would eliminate both the Section 45Y PTC and Section 48E ITC for facilities (other than certain nuclear facilities, credits for which are repealed beginning in later years) and property (i) the construction of which begins more than 60 days after the date of enactment or (ii) that are placed in service after December 31, 2028.

The House Tax Bill would also eliminate the Section 45Y PTC and Section 48E ITC for property that is leased to a third party that would qualify for the residential clean energy credit, such as residential solar property, for taxable years beginning after the date of enactment.

In addition, the House Tax Bill would eliminate Section 45Y PTCs and Section 48E ITCs for any facilities the construction of which begins after December 31, 2025 if the construction includes “any material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity” (including entities with specified relationships with governments, citizens or residents of China, Russia, North Korea or Iran, discussed further below). “Material assistance” means, with respect to any property, that any component, subcomponent or applicable critical mineral included in the property is extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured or assembled by a prohibited foreign entity, or any design of the property is based on intellectual property provided by a prohibited foreign entity, with limited exceptions. As a practical matter, given the broad scope of this rule, facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2025 may fail to qualify for these credits even if they otherwise would satisfy the effective date rules (e.g., because the legislation is not enacted before early November). The House Tax Bill includes additional restrictions on prohibited foreign entities, discussed below.

Under current law, Section 45Y PTCs and Section 48E ITCs may be transferred for cash consideration to unrelated buyers. An earlier version of the bill would have repealed transferability of these credits, but those restrictions were deleted in the final House Tax Bill, so the House Tax Bill does not restrict transferability of Section 45Y PTCs or Section 48E ITCs.

Note that the changes in the House Tax Bill would not generally affect projects qualifying for the Section 45 PTC or Section 48 ITC (which may be available for projects that began construction before 2025). However, the House Tax Bill would phase out the Section 48 ITC for certain equipment that uses the ground or ground water as a thermal energy source, and it would eliminate transferability of such credits.

Phase-out and repeal of transferability for Section 45X advanced manufacturing production credits

Section 45X currently provides a PTC for certain eligible components (e.g., battery cells, solar modules, wind energy components) produced by the taxpayer and sold to unrelated parties through December 31, 2032.

The House Tax Bill would:

Accelerate the phase-out of the Section 45X credit to December 31, 2031 (the provision currently remains in effect until December 31, 2032)

Repeal transferability of Section 45X credits for components sold after December 31, 2027

Restrict taxpayers from claiming the Section 45X credit beginning 2 years after the date of enactment for components that include any “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity” (as described above) or are produced subject to a licensing agreement with a prohibited foreign entity (subject to a $1M value threshold)

Place restrictions on “specified foreign entities” and “foreign-influenced entities” from claiming the Section 45X credit (as discussed below).

Repeal of transferability of carbon capture and clean fuel production credits

Under current law, the performance-based tax credits under Section 45Q for carbon oxide sequestration (carbon capture) and Section 45Z PTCs for clean fuel production may be transferred for cash consideration to unrelated buyers.

The House Tax Bill would repeal transferability of Section 45Q carbon capture credits for equipment the construction of which begins after the date that is two years after the date of enactment, and it would repeal transferability of Section 45Z clean fuel production credits with respect to fuel produced after December 31, 2027.

Earlier begin-construction requirement for clean hydrogen credits

Under current law, tax credits under Section 45V for production of clean hydrogen are available for projects the construction of which begins before January 1, 2033.

The House Tax Bill would accelerate that date to January 1, 2026.

Restrictions on renewable energy tax credits for “prohibited foreign entities”

As discussed above, the House Tax Bill would place restrictions on claiming renewable energy tax credits if the taxpayer is or receives “material assistance” from a “prohibited foreign entity”—more specifically, a “specified foreign entity” or a “foreign-influenced entity.”

A “specified foreign entity” is a “foreign entity of concern,” a Chinese military company operating in the U.S., certain other entities, or a “foreign-controlled entity” (a foreign government, citizen or resident, or entity organized under or having a principal place of business in North Korea, China, Russia or Iran or an entity controlled by such entity or person).

“Foreign-influenced entities” are entities that either have specified relationships with specified foreign entities (e.g., an entity that has owners who are “specified foreign entities” and meet certain ownership thresholds) or that make payments of dividends, interest, compensation for services, rents or royalties, guarantees or certain other income above stated thresholds to specified foreign entities.

As discussed above, “material assistance” means, with respect to any property, that any component, subcomponent or applicable critical mineral included in the property is extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured or assembled by a prohibited foreign entity, or any design of the property is based on intellectual property provided by a prohibited foreign entity, with limited exceptions.

Income from hydrogen storage and carbon capture added to qualifying income of certain publicly traded partnerships

Under current law, publicly traded partnerships are taxable as corporations unless they earn certain specified categories of qualifying income.

The House Tax Bill would expand the categories of qualifying income to include (i) income from the transportation or storage of liquified hydrogen or compressed hydrogen, as well as certain clean fuels, and (ii) the generation or storage of electric power or capture of carbon at qualified carbon capture facilities.",https://www.davispolk.com/sites/default/files/2021-06/Website_Social-Share-Image_1200x627.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 09:01:01.049251

Those Biden-era tax incentives were aimed at building up US manufacturing and competition against foreign manufacturers.

“It will certainly raise a lot of revenue this is the biggest sort of tax increase category in the reconciliation package,” said Alex Muresianu, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation.

These hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy tax incentives were part of former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) agenda.

“In the overall economy: GDP, investment, consumer spending, that sort of big picture, I don't think the impact is going to be very big because these are sort of narrowly targeted at specific industries,” said Muresianu. “So, I think the broad impact won’t be that big, but the impact for specific industries will be significant. This changes the economics of a lot of clean energy projects.”

Maria Martinez with the Clean Economy Project said these tax credits helped boost US production of materials and energy technologies while giving the US a more competitive edge in the energy industry.

“They are really crucial to meeting the rising electricity demand,” said Martinez.

Martinez said since the credits were updated in the IRA a few years ago, companies have announced they intend to build more than 300 manufacturing facilities across the country, which could bring in millions of jobs and revenue to local communities. One example after the IRA was passed, Vitro Architectural Glass announced a 93-million dollar investment in Crawford County to help manufacture glass for solar panels. Martinez said there could be a devastating impact if these incentives are gutted. She shares the economic impact over the next ten years:

“Not building would translate to something in the order of a trillion dollars in lost economic output, about four million jobs, something like 130-billion in tax revenue,” said Martinez. “And that’s really important because tax revenue helps improve schools, transit and other local services. So, we’re not just losing the direct jobs, we would be losing a lot of spillover, positive economic benefits that would come to these communities locally.”",https://WICU.images.worldnow.com/images/26564132_G.jpeg?lastEditedDate=1748014908000,N,,2025-05-24 11:06:42.808160

Campbell coal plant in West Olive, between Grand Haven and Holland.
Consumers in 2021 first announced plans to close the Campbell plant in 2025.
“Consumers Energy plans to comply with the 90-day pause from the Department of Energy.
We are reviewing the executive action and the overall impact on our company,” Consumers spokesperson Katie Carey said in a statement.","The Trump administration has ordered the Midwest regional grid operator and Consumers Energy to keep operating a large coal plant in Ottawa County for three months, citing concerns about potential electricity supply shortfalls in the coming summer months.

The U.S. Department of Energy’s emergency order issued on Friday comes just eight days before Consumers’ scheduled retirement of the 1,560 megawatt J.H. Campbell coal plant in West Olive, between Grand Haven and Holland. Consumers in 2021 first announced plans to close the Campbell plant in 2025. One of the units at Campbell was designed to operate until 2040.

The emergency order expires on Aug. 21. It cites a recent North American Electric Reliability Corporation assessment that the regional grid operator, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), “faces potential tight reserve margins during the summer 2025 period, particularly during periods of high demand or low generation resource output.”

The Jackson-based investor-owned utility said it would comply with the DOE’s order.

“Consumers Energy plans to comply with the 90-day pause from the Department of Energy. We are reviewing the executive action and the overall impact on our company,” Consumers spokesperson Katie Carey said in a statement.

While Consumers Energy acquired a 1,200 MW natural gas plant in Southwest Michigan in 2023, and has coordinated with MISO to ensure grid reliability as its coal plants came offline, the Energy Department’s order still cited an elevated risk for electricity supply shortfalls in the summer.

“Today’s emergency order ensures that Michiganders and the greater Midwest region do not lose critical power generation capability as summer begins and electricity demand regularly reach (sic) high levels,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. “This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families.”

Consumers’ plan to eliminate coal from its portfolio is part of its broader long-term energy strategy that includes increasing natural gas capacity as well as adding thousands of megawatts of solar energy and battery storage.

The 2025 retirement date for Campbell was part of a negotiated settlement agreement with various groups in a case before the Michigan Public Service Commission. Multiple environmental and clean energy groups hailed the agreement when it was reached in 2022.

Sierra Club Senior Attorney Greg Wannier said the Trump administration’s move to invoke the Federal Power Act to keep Campbell online “is an illegal abuse of his presidential authority.”

“Coal is expensive, outdated, and deadly, and all of the relevant parties, including MISO, the grid operator ultimately responsible for keeping the lights on in Michigan, concluded years ago that J.H. Campbell could retire without causing any grid reliability problems,” Wannier said in a statement. “Consumers Energy is right to finally retire this hugely expensive plant that is costing Michiganders their lives.”

At least four Republican senators have urged continuation of energy tax credits, including support for traditional and renewable energy sources.
The massive tax bill has now been sent to the Senate, which is likely to significantly revise the bill over the next month.","The multitrillion-dollar GOP tax bill could have detrimental impacts on decarbonization efforts in the U.S., according to energy experts.

On Thursday, the House of Representatives passed a sweeping package of tax cuts, Medicaid reform and immigration spending that advances President Donald Trump’s campaign promises.

The tax cuts would also impact sustainability efforts and domestic climate goals, environmental policy experts told ABC News.

Some of the biggest environmental impacts will come in the form of cuts to clean energy credits, Alys Campaigne, a climate initiative leader for the Southern Environmental Law Center, told ABC News.

The bill would repeal or phase out some of the Biden-era clean energy tax credits sooner, Campaigne said.

“What Trump and the Republicans want most is to extend tax cuts that have nothing to do with energy,” Campaigne said. “They are really trying to find ways to pay for their broader tax cuts.”

New energy projects must break ground within 60 days or be “placed in service” by the end of 2028, the bill states.

The legislation also walks back the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, considered the largest clean energy investment by the federal government.

Credits for rooftop solar installments and electric vehicles would be stripped under the bill as well.

At least four Republican senators have urged continuation of energy tax credits, including support for traditional and renewable energy sources.

Full-scale repeal of current credits “could lead to significant disruptions” in those states, the senators — led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — said in a letter on April 9. Billions of dollars in clean energy manufacturing investments from the Biden-era subsidies have benefitted Republican-led states and Congressional districts, Campaigne said.

“It’s a messy political process because of this tension between the different invested interests at play within the Republican caucus,” Campaigne said.

Up to 330,000 jobs could be at risk, and electricity bills for families and businesses could increase by $51 billion, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

“This bill threatens the clean energy industry at a time when it’s proving to be not only economically beneficial—lowering costs, creating jobs, and fueling local economies—but also essential to America’s energy future,” Andrew Reagan, president of of Clean Energy for America, said in a statement.

Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power, a climate communications firm, told ABC News that House Republicans voted “to create an American energy crisis,” calling it a “reckless betrayal” of the House representatives’ constituents.

“Every single House member who voted to risk jobs in their districts, drive up costs and threaten made-in-America energy will have to answer for that vote back home,” Lodes said.

Republican-led states and Congressional districts have benefited from billions of dollars in clean energy manufacturing investments spurred by the Biden-era subsidies, Campaigne said.

Environmental policy experts are also concerned about provisions in the bill that would allow polluters to avoid oversight by paying a fee, Campaigne said.

The massive tax bill has now been sent to the Senate, which is likely to significantly revise the bill over the next month.

“This fight isn’t over,” Lodes said. “Senate Republicans have made it clear the House bill is unacceptable.”

In addition, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is continuing to review the legislation.

There is still time for many of these provisions to be changed or removed, such as the removal of sections that authorized the sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands in Nevada and Utah.

“Language is still changing,” Campaigne said, adding that much of it is written so broadly that it’s difficult to understand exactly what the impacts will be if the law goes into effect.

On Inauguration Day, Trump declared a “national energy emergency,” claiming that leasing, development, production, transportation, refining and generation capacity of energy in the U.S. is “far too inadequate.”

Since then, Trump has attempted to promote increased production of fossils fuels, including signing an executive order to expand the mining and use of coal. An offshore leasing plan on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf that would allow for increased drilling was also announced by the Department of the Interior in April.

An Environmental Protection Agency initiative dubbed “Powering the Great American Comeback” includes a pillar to “restore American energy dominance,” which claims will lower energy bills for Americans.

Experts say, however, the U.S. does not have an energy crisis. In 2023, the Biden administration produced 12.9 million barrels per day, breaking the record set in 2019 at 12.3 million barrels, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. For the last several years, the U.S. has been the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world.

Trump pushed for swift action on the bill, urging senators to act “as soon as possible” in a post on his social media page following the narrow victory in the House.

More: GM’s Urgent Warning, California’s EV Rules Could Harm You

When the news broke, California Governor Gavin Newsom didn’t wait long to respond. He immediately called the move illegal and said it was harmful to health and the environment. “The party of MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) is making our world smoggier,” he said. To revoke the waiver from California, the Senate did go against counsel from two nonpartisan government entities that both said it would be illegal to do so.

States’ Rights or Regulatory Overreach?

That said, the GOP felt that California had too much power and was leveraging that power to set rules on a pseudo-federal level. Several states had joined California in imposing the same rules, including one that banned new gas-car sales after 2035.

Based on data, those goals were far too lofty considering the current state of EV adoption in the U.S. The GOP decision takes the stress off of automakers, oil companies, and dealers who felt they were going to be stuck with products that wouldn’t sell well.

Health First, Says California

For many in California, the state’s regulations are prioritizing health and wellness above all else. “We have real-world evidence that these rules are improving public health,” said Dr. John Balmes, of UC Berkeley. A recent study from the University of Southern California showed a significant reduction in asthma-related emergency room visits for children and adults associated with the number of electric vehicles in a zip code.”

Others in the state see the revocation of the waiver as a positive move. “I think this was a good middle ground that we can still talk about EVs,” said John Pitre, CEO of Motor City Auto Club in Bakersfield, to BakersfieldNow. “We can still develop them. We can still have future opportunities to explore different types of EVs. But it’s not at the detriment of people having a selection of gas or diesel-powered vehicles that they may really want.”

Ultimately, only time will tell whether or not California’s lawsuit will claw back its freedom to set its own standards. This will be the 21st lawsuit filed by the state attorney general against the Trump administration. “The federal government’s overreach is illogical,” Bonta said in a press conference in Sacramento. “It’s politically motivated, and it comes at the expense of Californians’ lives and livelihoods.”

Bonus Depreciation Various iterations of the bonus depreciation provisions have been included in the Internal Revenue Code for over 20 years, often changed by the political winds of the time.
Under the TCJA, the bonus depreciation allowance is phased out, going down to 20% in 2026 and 0% in 2027.
Qualified Business Income Deduction The TCJA also added Section 199A to the tax code—the qualified business income deduction, or QBID.
Conclusion Manufacturing companies should keep a keen eye on the cuts Congress makes in the budget reconciliation that is ultimately passed.","On May 13, the House Ways and Means Committee voted to approve a $3.8 trillion tax bill that would make permanent much of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The bill then moved to the House Budget Committee, where it was merged with other House Committee budget reconciliation bills to become the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act. On May 18, the House Budget Committee voted to advance the bill.

As Congress begins debating the bill’s substance, manufacturing companies should be closely watching key industry items that are placed on the chopping block. Three areas that could be ripe for change are bonus depreciation, the qualified business income deduction and energy tax credits. Changes in each of these areas potentially have major implications for manufacturers nationwide.

Bonus Depreciation

Various iterations of the bonus depreciation provisions have been included in the Internal Revenue Code for over 20 years, often changed by the political winds of the time. This was the case in 2017, when the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed into law.

The TCJA reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Significantly, it also included changes to Internal Revenue Code Section 168(k), or bonus depreciation.

Under Section 168(a), the costs of certain business assets, such as equipment and buildings, are required to be depreciated over time based on the life of the asset. Taxpayers are required to expense that cost over a three- to 40-year recovery period. However, under Section 168(k), taxpayers are allowed to report a percentage of the cost of certain qualified property as an expense in the first year, instead of spreading it over a longer recovery period.

Prior to the TCJA, bonus depreciation was set to phase down annually over several years. The TCJA expanded bonus depreciation to initially provide a 100% allowance and made it applicable to the cost of certain qualified new and used property, meaning the deduction was available to more taxpayers and more property. Under the TCJA, the bonus depreciation allowance is phased out, going down to 20% in 2026 and 0% in 2027.

For purposes of bonus depreciation, “qualifying property” generally means property that has a recovery period of 20 years or less, such as furniture, office equipment, technology equipment, agricultural equipment, and manufacturing machinery and equipment, among other property.

Given this broad definition of qualifying property, any change to the TCJA’s phasedown will affect capital-intensive industries—like manufacturing—the most.

For example, if a manufacturing plant needs to replace $10 million of qualifying equipment each year, the company’s tax benefit from the acquisition of that equipment in 2027 could range from $10 million to $0, depending on whether Congress reinstitutes the TCJA’s 100% allowance or lets the bonus depreciation allowance expire altogether.

Because the bonus depreciation rules in Section 168(k) have a significant impact on a capital-intensive company’s purchasing and investment decisions, those companies should be watching Congress closely over the next couple of months, as any new tax legislation will affect their company’s financials going forward.

Specifically, given the makeup of both houses, it is very likely that Congress will reinstitute some version of the TCJA’s bonus depreciation rules, potentially making the 100% allowance permanent this time. Accordingly, capital-intensive companies should be armed with cash—or the financing necessary—to take advantage of such legislation this year.

Qualified Business Income Deduction

The TCJA also added Section 199A to the tax code—the qualified business income deduction, or QBID. The QBID allows certain partnerships, S corporations and sole proprietorships to deduct up to 20% of their qualified business income, or the net amount of income, gain, deductions and losses, from a qualified trade or business.

Under the TCJA, the QBID expires at the end of 2025. If it does, manufacturing companies taxed as partnerships, S corporations and sole proprietorships could face a higher tax burden, making C corporations look more attractive. This is especially true if the newly converted C corporation might also qualify for other tax benefits like the Section 1202 gain exclusion.

Under Section 1202, shareholders of qualified small business stock — when meeting certain requirements, including a five-year holding period—are allowed to exclude from their gain up to $10 million or 10 times their initial investment in the C corporation on the sale of the stock.

Given these trade-offs in tax benefits and the need to encourage more U.S. manufacturing — a stated goal of the current administration—it will be interesting to see how Congress reconciles its need to pay for new changes to the tax code. With that said, it’s possible that the current Congress is likely to extend—or potentially make permanent—the TCJA’s QBID. Anything else would be a tax increase on small business owners, the backbone of the U.S. economy.

Energy Tax Credits

Passed by Congress in 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act offered several tax credits designed to support U.S. manufacturing, particularly for companies involved in clean energy production, energy efficiency and reduction of carbon emissions.

A few of these credits include:

The advanced manufacturing production credit, providing a per-unit tax credit for manufacturers producing components for clean energy—such as solar panels, batteries and wind turbines—for each eligible product made in the U.S.;

The advanced energy project credit, providing a 30% tax credit on project costs for eligible manufacturers expanding or building facilities to produce solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, electric vehicles, carbon capture equipment and grid modernization components; and

The clean hydrogen production credit, providing a production or investment tax credit from $0.60 to $3 per kilogram of hydrogen, depending on the carbon intensity of production, for eligible manufacturers with facilities producing hydrogen with low or zero emissions.

While there are many supporters of these credits in Congress, the current administration has been critical of these incentives, as many see the Inflation Reduction Act as a major contributor to the recent inflation.

Time will tell, but it is likely that these energy tax credits will be substantially reduced or rescinded entirely, as Congress will need to generate revenue to offset its other changes to the tax code, and these energy tax credits are not high on the current administration’s priority list.

Conclusion

Manufacturing companies should keep a keen eye on the cuts Congress makes in the budget reconciliation that is ultimately passed. As Congress works to balance the satisfaction of its constituents, the current administration’s agenda and the economy, manufacturing companies should anticipate changes such as those outlined above that will have a significant impact on capital-intensive industries. And with Congress’ stated goal of passing a budget reconciliation bill by Memorial Day, these changes could be happening quite soon.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16362_5006.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 05:02:59.776962

But across the Capitol, senators were more cautious.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune can afford to lose three Republican senators and still pass the bill, and there are more than that, right now, who have problems with it. Like the House, he will have to balance the concerns from moderate and conservative members of his conference.

Republicans’ aspirational deadline is July 4, ahead of a potential debt default. Thune said groups of senators had already been meeting to discuss the legislation and that they would want to take some time to review it. “And then we’ll put our stamp on it,” he said.

“We’ll see how it goes,” Thune said. “What does it take to get to 51?”

A look at a few of the potential sticking points in the Senate:

Spending

Several Republican senators have said the House’s multi-trillion-dollar tax package doesn't have enough savings. Thune said many in his GOP conference favor the tax breaks in the bill but “when it comes to the spending side of the equation, this is a unique moment in time, in history, where we have the House and the Senate and the White House, and an opportunity to do something meaningful about how to control government spending.”

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., a sharp critic of the House bill, wants the United States to go back to pre-pandemic spending levels. He has indicated he would be a no on the bill as it stands now, and he says he has at least three other senators aligned with him.

Medicaid and food stamp cuts

Senate Republicans are generally on board with stricter work requirements for older Medicaid recipients that make up much of the bill’s $700 billion savings from the program. But Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Susan Collins of Maine, among others, have voiced concerns about other changes in the bill that could potentially cut funding to rural hospitals or increase copays and other health care costs for recipients.

The senators could have a powerful ally in Trump, who has frequently said he doesn’t want cuts to Medicaid, even as he’s endorsed the House bill. Hawley said he talked to Trump this week on the phone and “his exact words were, ‘Don’t touch it, Josh.’”

Others have been wary of the House bill’s effort to shift some costs of the food stamp program to states, potentially a major issue for some red states that have high numbers of food aid recipients. The House bill saves $290 billion from the food aid, and Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman said the Senate savings will be “probably be a little bit lower.”

Permanent tax cuts

Thune said this week that “one of the principal differences” between the House and Senate is that Republican senators want to make many of the tax cuts permanent while the House bill has shorter time frames for many of its cuts – including no taxes on tips, overtime pay, car-loan interest and others.

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo said Thursday that trying to make some of the cuts permanent is “an objective right now.""

How to pay for it all

One of the biggest questions for the Senate: whether the tax breaks really need to be offset by cuts elsewhere.

To offset the costs of lost tax revenue, House Republicans have proposed more than $1 trillion in spending reductions across Medicaid, food stamps and green energy program rollbacks. However, Republicans in the Senate do not believe there is a cost associated with permanently extending the existing taxes, setting up a political and procedural showdown ahead.

Debt limit

The House bill includes a $4 trillion increase in the debt limit. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that the United States is on track to run out of money to pay its bills as early as August without congressional action.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he won’t support the bill if the debt ceiling increase is included. He said he’s willing to consider it if it’s taken out.

But most Republican senators want it to avoid a separate fight that would require 60 votes in the Senate. Texas Sen. John Cornyn said that if they deal with the debt ceiling outside of the legislation then they would have to “pay a king’s ransom” to Democrats to get enough votes.

Energy tax credits

Several Republican senators have said they are concerned about House provisions that repeal or phase out clean energy tax credits passed in 2022 that have spurred investment in many states.

Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Curtis of Utah and Moran wrote Thune a letter last month arguing that removing the credits could ""create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning, and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy.”

Artificial intelligence

The House bill would ban states and localities from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade, giving the federal government more control over the policy. It’s an approach that has been favored by the AI industry but has drawn concern from members on both sides of the aisle.

And even if it has enough support, the provision may not pass muster from the Senate parliamentarian because it’s unlikely to have impact on the federal budget.

Other issues

With a narrow margin for victory and only 53 Republicans in the Senate, every senator’s top priority takes on outsize importance. South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds said he supports the House bill but that the way that it deals with spectrum auctions – selling off telecommunications signal rights – is a “dealbreaker” for him. He said he’s in talks with other senators on the issue.

Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., said one of his main goals is that they include money for certain farm safety net programs and set up passage for a broader farm bill later this year.

“In the end, we have to have 50 plus one supporting it,” Hoeven said. “So we’ve got some work to do.""

This legislation is designed to integrate “scattered” environmental regulations, incorporate emerging environmental issues (e.g., climate change and biodiversity), and strengthen enforcement of the legal framework. Once adopted, the Code will become China's second formal statutory code, after the Civil Code, adopted in 2020. The deadline for public comments is June 13, 2025.

Background

China initiated its environmental legislation in the early 1980s by issuing the Environmental Protection Law (Trial). Soon afterward, China established a relatively systematic environmental legal system by promulgating the Water Pollution Prevention and Control Law, the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law, and incorporating “environmental protection” into its Constitution Law. Over time, the Chinese environmental protection legal system has developed further. Today, over 30 environmental laws, more than 100 administrative environmental regulations, and 1,000 local laws and regulations have been issued, together with related judicial interpretations, rules and regulations, policies and measures, and vertical enforcement mechanisms.

Notwithstanding this extensive legal framework, the current environmental legal system has faced numerous challenges, such as overlapping and/or conflicting regulations and a lack of administrative supervision on emerging environmental issues. For this reason, China decided to compile an ecological and environmental code (Code) to fill legislative gaps and guide further development of the environmental legal system.

In 2021, the 13th Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress listed a compilation of the Code in its legislative Plan. The NPC Environmental and Resources Committee took the lead in establishing a team to start drafting the Code in 2023. The first draft was prepared internally, and the opinions of the State Council departments, local people's congresses, and experts were solicited in 2024. In April 2025, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress reviewed and released the Draft Code for public comment. As of today, over 1,300 comments have been submitted through the online submission system.

Once implemented, the Code will repeal and replace the existing 10 environmental laws that cover pollution prevention and control concerning air, water, solid waste, noise, soil, ocean, and radiation. It will also incorporate the key principles and provisions of the environmental laws related to river basins, regions, natural resources, biodiversity, ecosystems, circular economy, and energy conservation (those laws will remain effective). Finally, the Code will set out key principles and legal foundations with respect to emerging environmental issues, such as new pollutants, climate change, and low-carbon development.

Draft Code

The Draft Code comprises 1,188 articles in 59 sections, which are contained in five chapters, including general provisions, pollution prevention and control, ecological protection, green and low-carbon development, and legal liability and supplementary provisions. Below are the key takeaways that are likely to be of interest to companies doing business in China:

Chemical substances, electromagnetic radiation, and light pollution prevention and control

Chapter 2 (Pollution Prevention and Control) addresses not only traditional pollution control issues, such as air, water, soil, and solid waste, but also pollution prevention and control for chemical substances (Section 34), electromagnetic radiation (Section 35), and light (Section 36). More specifically:

Chemical Substances. Section 34 specifies four management systems to regulate pollution risks associated with the production, import, storage, transportation, sale, use, and disposal of chemical substances:

A chemical substance pollution information survey system that applies to manufacturers, importers, and processors of chemical substances. The Draft Code will require these parties to disclose information regarding physical and chemical properties, quantity, uses, hazardous characteristics, and emissions of chemical substances.

An environmental risk management and control system for new pollutants. Production or import of new pollutants subject to key risk management controls would be banned, restricted, or subject to other control measures.

An environmental management registration system for new chemical substances. Producers or importers will have to file a registration before manufacture or import.

An import licensing system for chemical substances listed in the highly restricted import inventory (e.g., Ozone Depleting Substances).

Electromagnetic Radiation. Section 35 would establish a management system for equipment emitting electromagnetic radiation. No production, import, or sale will be allowed for industrial equipment, radio transmission equipment, telecommunication equipment, motor vehicles, railway locomotives, urban rail transit vehicles, navigation equipment, motor vessels, meteorological equipment, electrical or electronic equipment, medical equipment, and other products that generate electromagnetic radiation unless they meet the electromagnetic radiation limits specified by national standards.

Light. Section 36 will establish limits on light intensity, brightness, upward luminous flux ratio, color temperature, and reflectance for lighting products, outdoor display products, traffic lights, and architectural glass and related materials.

Incorporation of emerging environmental issues

The Draft Code includes an entire chapter (Chapter 4) addressing emerging environmental issues such as the circular economy, green and low-carbon development, and climate change.

Circular Economy. The Draft Code calls for establishing of a circular economy standard, addressing green design, green manufacturing, comprehensive utilization of industrial waste, and recycling of domestic waste. It will also further implement clean production auditing and green packaging requirements, Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) systems for electrical and electronic products, as well as lead and other batteries. The Draft Code will also establish mandatory recycled material content requirements for key categories of products.

Climate Change. Three important systems are or will be developed to address climate change:

Product Carbon Footprint Management. The Draft Code will introduce product carbon footprint verification measures and standards, and establish product carbon footprint evaluation, certification, and information disclosure systems.

Carbon trading system. Key greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting entities covered under the carbon trading system will be required to take effective measures to control their emissions, formulate and strictly implement GHG emission data quality control plans in accordance with relevant national regulations and technical specifications, carry out GHG emission-related inspections and statistical accounting, prepare annual GHG emission reports, submit such reports for verification, and pay carbon emission fees.

National voluntary GHG emission reduction trading market. The Draft Code will establish a voluntary GHG emission reduction trading program for projects that either avoid or reduce GHG emissions, or remove such gases.

Mandated Decentralization of enforcement

The Draft Code will restructure the existing environmental management system to monitor, supervise, and enforce ecological and environmental laws. Under the current system, county-level ecological and environmental bureaus (EEBs) are branches of the municipal EEBs, rather than a formal part of the county-level government. As branches, under China’s Administrative law, county-level EEBs do not hold enforcement authority . However, the Environmental Protection Law clearly states that the environmental protection department of the local people's government at or above the county level (e.g., the county-level EEB) shall implement unified supervision and management of environmental protection work in its administrative area and implement relevant penalties. In this way, county-level EEBs are charged with responsibility for compliance and environmental protection within their jurisdiction but lack the authority to initiate enforcement actions or impose penalties. This lack of authority undermines the ability of the county-level EEBs to fulfill their oversight responsibilities (although we have noticed that some locales, through local legislation, have granted enforcement powers to the county-level EEBs).

The Draft Code addresses this dilemma by providing that “the dispatched agencies established by the ecological environment department of the municipal people's government can carry out on-site inspections, seizures, detentions, performance on behalf of others and administrative penalties in their own name."" (Article 50). This legislative change will give the county branches of the municipal ecological environment bureaus (i.e., the county-level EEBs) independent law enforcement qualifications, thereby resolving the enforcement conflict of ""having responsibilities but no power."" Such changes will likely improve the efficiency and effectiveness of enforcement.

What is Next?

The Draft Code would consolidate the legal framework for ecological and environmental protection, strengthen pollution prevention and control systems, establish a clear mechanism to govern emerging environmental issues, enhance environmental enforcement, and unify penalty mechanisms for environmental violations. In this regard, it is important for companies to review the Draft Code, evaluate the potential impacts on their businesses, and proactively engage in the rulemaking process through trade associations or on their own. Companies can submit comments directly through the National People's Congress website, the National Laws and Regulations Database, or by sending by mail to the Legislative Affairs Commission of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (No. 1, Qianmen West Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, Postal Code: 100805) with ""Draft Ecological Environment Code"" on the envelope.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15478_5804.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 13:08:47.890197

FEOC Restrictions: A ""prohibited foreign entity"" is either (i) a specified foreign entity or (ii) a foreign-influenced entity.
Observation: The imposition of FEOC rules to tax credit qualification would introduce an additional layer of complexity.","On May 22, 2025, the House of Representatives passed (by a vote of 215-214-1) its version of the budget reconciliation bill (H.R. 1, the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"") containing numerous tax reform provisions. Below are our summaries of the proposed amendments to certain tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (""IRA"") as well as our initial observations. The bill now advances to the Senate for consideration and markup, and we will continue to monitor any developments and updates.

Overview of Changes from the Ways and Means Committee Draft Bill:

The focus of the updates from the draft bill presented by the Ways and Means Committee are as follows:

Termination of Tech-Neutral Credits Without Phaseout: Tech-neutral PTCs and ITCs under sections 45Y and 48E would terminate for projects that (i) begin construction after 60 days from enactment or (ii) are placed in service after Dec. 31, 2028.

The prior draft bill included a modified phase out of the credit rates starting in 2029 and running through 2032, with credits being terminated after 2032, based on when a project is placed in service.

The bill does not alter the existing guidance on how to begin construction of a project for tax purposes, and the date of enactment would be the date the bill is signed by the President.

Advanced nuclear facilities and expansions of nuclear facilities seeking credits under sections 45Y or 48E would be required to begin construction before Jan. 1, 2029.

Material Assistance from a Prohibited Foreign Entity: This restriction would apply to projects seeking tax credits under sections 45Y or 48E that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2025.

The prior draft bill provided a 1-year grace period to begin construction before the material assistance rules applied.

Observation: If the bill is enacted into law before November 1, 2025, then this material assistance restriction would not affect projects seeking credits under sections 45Y or 48E, because such projects would have to begin construction within 60 days of enactment to be eligible for such credits.

Transferability: Tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E would remain transferable for the duration of the credit period for projects that meet the Dec. 31, 2028 deadline to be placed in service.

The prior draft bill preserved transferability for projects that began construction up to 2 years after enactment.

Observation: The preservation of transferability is undermined by the accelerated expiration of the credits themselves.

Special Rule for Residential Solar: No credit would be allowed under sections 45Y or 48E for residential solar water heating property, solar electric property, or small wind energy property if (i) the taxpayer/owner rents or leases such property to a third party and (ii) the third party would qualify for the 25D credit with respect to such property if the third party were the owner of such property.

Observation: This does not seem to include residential PPAs because in such cases the owner is not leasing the equipment to the consumer (but only for systems that begin construction within 60 days of enactment and are placed in service by Dec. 31, 2028). We see no logical basis for treating PPAs differently than leases, so this treatment may be aligned by the Senate, if this special rule for residential property is otherwise maintained.

Observation: This also does not seem to include residential battery storage technology for which a credit is allowable under section 25(d)(6).

Observation: After the bill's amendment, the Section 25D credit would not be allowed for property placed in service after December 31, 2025. Thus, the lessee technically would not qualify for Section 25D credits after the bill's amendment, which means condition (ii) could not be satisfied. This is probably not the intended consequence and either the Senate or the House may modify the bill to fix this glitch.

Residential projects that can demonstrate that they began construction in 2024 would qualify for the ITC under Section 48, as noted below.

Accelerated Termination of Section 45U PTC for Existing Nuclear Facilities: This credit would terminate for electricity produced and sold after Dec. 31, 2031, and such credits would remain transferable for the duration of the credit period.

The amendments to the bill did not affect the provisions in the draft bill presented by the Ways and Means Committee with respect to tax credits available under sections 45Q, 45V, 45X, 45Z, and 48, which are summarized below.

Projects seeking tax credits under sections 45 and 48 (which must have begun construction by Dec. 31, 2024) are unaffected by the bill. To be eligible for tax credits under sections 45 or 48, a project must have begun construction before Jan. 1, 2025, and generally be placed in service within 4 years (or 10 years in the case of offshore wind). The quantum of PTC or ITC available for a given project under sections 45 or 48, as applicable, is the same (for a project that qualifies thereunder) as it would be for the same project under sections 45Y or48E. Application of the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements to achieve a 5x credit rate, potential bonus credit amounts for energy community and domestic content, and eligibility for direct pay under Section 6417 would not be affected by the bill

Reference Guide for Amendments to IRA Tax Credits in the House Budget Bill:

Overall, the proposed amendments fall into 3 general categories:

Expiration of certain credits as early as December 31, 2025, while other credits would either expire in 2028 or follow a modified phaseout schedule starting in 2029.

Foreign entity of concern (“FEOC”) restrictions would apply to all IRA tax credits.

Repeal of transferability after 2 years from enactment for credits under 45Q, 45X, and 45Z.

Repealed after 2 years 45Q8 Begin construction before Jan. 1, 2033 (no change)

After enactment: taxpayer cannot be a specified foreign entity

2 years after enactment: taxpayer cannot be a foreign-influenced entity

Observation: Safe harboring of credit rate would be based on timing of placement in service, whereas safe harboring of transferability would be based on timing of beginning construction.

§45Y – Clean Electricity Production Credit & §48E – Clean Electricity Investment Credit

The credits would expire for projects that (i) begin construction after 60 days from enactment, or (ii) are placed in service after Dec. 31, 2028. However, for advanced nuclear facilities and expansions of nuclear facilities, the deadline to begin construction would be Dec. 31, 2028, with no placed in service deadline. In other words, to claim credits a project would need to (i) begin construction within 60 days of enactment and (ii) be placed in service by Dec. 31, 2028.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment;

Facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2025, that include ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity""; and

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" or make an ""applicable payment"" to a ""prohibited foreign entity"" in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment.

100% of ITCs claimed under Section 48E with respect to a property would be recaptured if a ""specified taxpayer"" (i.e., one who is allowed an ITC for any tax year beginning 2 years after enactment) makes an ""applicable payment"" within 10 years after the property is placed in service.

Transferability would continue for the duration of the credit period.

No credit would be allowed for residential solar water heating property, solar electric property, or small wind energy property if (i) the taxpayer/owner rents or leases such property to a third party and (ii) the third party would qualify for the 25D credit with respect to such property if the third party were the owner of such property.

Observation: The placed in service deadline represents a policy change from the general continuity safe harbor period of 4 years (10 years for offshore wind) provided under current IRS guidance on beginning construction.

§45Q – Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment; and

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment.

Transferability would be repealed for facilities that begin construction after 2 years from enactment.

§45U – Clean Electricity Production (For Existing Nuclear Facilities)

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment; and

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment.

Transferability would be continue for the duration of the credit period.

§45V – Clean Hydrogen Production Credit

This credit would be terminated for facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2025.

On or before December 31, 2029: 100%;

During 2030: 75%;

During 2031: 50%; and

After December 31, 2031: 0%;

Wind energy components sold after December 31, 2027, would not be credit eligible.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment;

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" or make an ""applicable payment"" to a ""prohibited foreign entity"" with respect to any eligible component category in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment; and

Eligible components produced in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment that (i) include any ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"" or (ii) are produced subject to a licensing agreements with prohibited foreign entity valued in excess of $1 million.

Transferability would be repealed for components sold after 2027.

§45Z – Clean Fuel Production Credit

The credit period would be extended until December 31, 2031 (based on when the fuel is sold).

Fuel sold after December 31, 2025, would be required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions would exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land use charge, and distinct emissions rates would be provided for transportation fuels derived from animal manure, including dairy, swine, and poultry.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment;

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment.

Transferability would be repealed for property that begins construction after 2 years from enactment.

Observation: Credit-eligible asset classes under Sections 48, 45Y, 48E, and 45Q, application of the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, potential bonus credit amounts for energy community and domestic content, and eligibility for direct pay under Section 6417 would be unchanged.

Observation: Additional FEOC requirements would apply to credits under Sections 45Y,48E, and 45X that would not apply to credits under Sections 45U, 45Q, 45Z, and 48.

entities included on the specially designated nationals and blocked persons list maintained by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control;

entities alleged by the Attorney General to have engaged in conduct for which a conviction was obtained under certain laws;

entities determined by the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence, to be engaged in unauthorized conduct that is detrimental to U.S national security or foreign policy;

An entity is ""foreign-influenced entity"" if:

(i) During the taxable year:

A specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint a board member, executive officer, or similar individual;

A single specified foreign entity owns at least 10% of the entity;

One or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate at least 25% of the entity; or

At least 25% of the entity's debt is held in the aggregate by one or more specified foreign entities; or

(ii) During the prior taxable year, the entity knowingly makes (or had reason to know) a payment of dividends, interest, compensation for services, rents or royalties, guarantees, or any other fixed, determinable, annual, or periodic payments to:

QUOTES OF THE WEEK:

“The United States Senate has a choice: cede American car-industry dominance to China and clog the lungs of our children, or follow decades of precedent and uphold the clean air policies that Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon fought so hard for.”

— California Governor Gavin Newsom ahead of Senate Republicans’ illegal Congressional Review Act vote that overturned California’s long-standing clean car and truck waivers.

— Representative Mike Levin (CA-49) on Republicans’ harmful reconciliation bill.

“This so-called budget is not just morally bankrupt—it’s downright cruel… I didn’t leave the Capitol—didn’t sleep—for two days straight to fight back because the American people deserve to know what’s in this bill. And I will keep calling out their lies every step of the way.”

–Representative Teresa Leger Fernández (NM-03) on nearly 30 hours of continuous debate and resistance.

TOP NEWS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE

STATE NEWS

WORK TO RESUME ON NEW YORK OFFSHORE WIND PROJECT: Over a month after construction was halted for no legitimate reason by the Trump administration, Empire Wind has received the green light to resume work. The reversal from the administration is a result of intensive lobbying by New York Governor Kathy Hochul and the company building Empire Wind, Norwegian energy giant Equinor. The project will create 1,500 direct construction jobs and provide clean energy to hundreds of thousands of homes once completed.

NYLCV TAKE: New York LCV President Julie Tighe said, “We thank Governor Hochul for leading the fight to lift the stop-work order on the Empire Wind project. This is a critical step forward for our clean energy future, keeps 1,500 good-paying union jobs on track, and builds the infrastructure to create a healthy, safe New York for future generations. Offshore wind is key to reducing pollution, strengthening our grid, and securing long-term energy independence.

“At a time when the federal government is baselessly attacking an entire industry, this is exactly the kind of leadership we need. Governor Hochul stood up for what’s right and got this vital project back on track.”

NEW JERSEY LCV VICTORY FUND INVESTS $175,000 IN GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY: New Jersey LCV Victory Fund has invested $175,000 to help elect endorsed gubernatorial candidate and climate champion Representative Mikie Sherrill in the state’s Democratic primary election.

NEW JERSEY LCV TAKE: New Jersey LCV Political Director Jesse Sutherland said, “New Jersey LCV Victory Fund is making this significant investment because the stakes couldn’t be higher. We’re committed to ensuring voters know where the candidates stand and to electing leaders like Mikie Sherrill who will put the health and safety of New Jersey communities first.

“Voting is one of the most powerful tools we can use to shape the future of our communities and protect the environment we all share. As New Jerseyans cast their ballots on, and before, June 10th, we encourage everyone to make their voices heard and support Mikie Sherrill, who will prioritize clean air, safe water, and a sustainable climate for future generations.”

PENNSYLVANIA INVESTS $22.5 MILLION IN SCHOOL SOLAR PROJECTS: Over 70 Pennsylvania K-12 schools will receive $500,000 each to install solar panels that will generate clean power to reduce emissions and save schools millions of dollars in utility costs over the lifespan of the panels.

CVPA TAKE: Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania Political and Legislative Director Katie Blume said, “This program lowers costs for taxpayers, creates jobs, and provides clean energy produced right here in Pennsylvania. It’s a win for everyone.”

STATES FIGHT BACK: In response to the Senate’s illegitimate use of the Congressional Review Act to block California’s waiver to set stronger clean air standards for cars and trucks (more on that below in the Federal section), the U.S. Climate Alliance today announced the launch of the Affordable Clean Cars Coalition by 11 of its member governors to sustain America’s transition to cleaner and more affordable cars, support U.S. automotive manufacturers and workers, and preserve states’ clean air authority. Governors Gavin Newsom (CA), Jared Polis (CO), Matt Meyer (DE), Wes Moore (MD), Maura Healey (MA), Phil Murphy (NJ), Michelle Lujan Grisham (NM), Kathy Hochul (NY), Tina Kotek (OR), Dan McKee (RI), and Bob Ferguson (WA) issued the following statement on the initiative’s launch:

“The federal government and Congress are putting polluters over people and creating needless chaos for consumers and the market, but our commitment to safeguarding Americans’ fundamental right to clean air is resolute. We will continue collaborating as states and leveraging our longstanding authority under the Clean Air Act, including through state programs that keep communities safe from pollution, create good-paying jobs, increase consumer choice, and help Americans access cleaner and more affordable cars. As we consider next steps for our clean vehicle programs, our states will engage stakeholders and industry to provide the regulatory certainty needed while redoubling our efforts to build a cleaner and healthier future.”

NATIONAL NEWS

GAO CONFIRMS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ILLEGALLY WITHHOLDING FUNDS FROM ELECTRIC VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE: The non-partisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) concluded its investigation into the administration’s withholding of funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program (NEVI), determining that the administration is at odds with the law that provides important infrastructure investments in every state across the country.

REP. DELAURO TAKE: Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee Rosa DeLauro (CT-03) said, “House Democrats enacted critical investments to lower the cost of living, secure good-paying jobs, and protect and renew critical infrastructure to support American families, but Elon Musk and President Trump have sought to chaotically tear it all down…This is the law of the land, and the executive branch is required to carry it out. It should be obvious that the American people did not elect President Trump to steal from them, but today the Comptroller General reminded him of exactly that.”

CLIMATE ATTACKS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS

HOUSE PASSES ANTI-ENVIRONMENTAL BILLIONAIRE TAX SCAM: On Wednesday, House Republicans pushed through the most anti-environmental reconciliation bill of all time. The bill will increase families’ energy costs, sell off our public lands, and threaten public health and our economy, all to benefit Republicans’ polluter and billionaire allies. Read LCV’s full memo for more details on what is included in this terrible bill.

OUR TAKE: LCV Vice President of Government Affairs Sara Chieffo said, “The reconciliation bill Speaker Johnson and House Republicans just jammed through is a sweeping measure that amounts to the most anti-environmental bill in our nation’s history. It will mean higher gas and electricity costs for struggling families and businesses, tanking the U.S. manufacturing resurgence, ceding leadership to China and increased exposure to pollution for our kids and our communities. We are deeply disappointed by the House Republicans who failed to fix these provisions despite stating their support for these popular clean energy investments. It is notable that the majority of clean energy investments in this country are in congressional districts represented by Republicans, including a number of extreme members representing those districts doing polluters’ bidding in advocating for full repeal. Voting to gut these investments means voting against your own constituents, threatening their jobs and leaving them with higher electricity prices. People are deeply worried about our economy and rising costs, and our country simply cannot afford to halt clean energy progress in its tracks. Let’s be clear why this is being done — to benefit their Big Oil backers and to pay for tax cuts for billionaires.”

Ahead of this terrible vote, LCV issued a memo detailing the extreme and reckless bill, sent a letter to members of the House informing them that we will score this vote in our 2025 National Environmental Scorecard (as we only do infrequently for the most critical votes), and showed up in person and in chalk to ensure our message was heard.

TAKE 2: LCV Vice President of Government Affairs Sara Chieffo said, “Speaker Johnson’s extreme and reckless Reconciliation bill would stop our nation’s clean energy progress in its tracks. The bill Speaker Johnson is attempting to jam through means higher gas and electricity costs for struggling families and businesses, tanking the U.S. manufacturing resurgence, and ceding leadership to China.

“Now is the time for members of Congress who have spoken out in favor of these popular tax credits or whose districts have the most to lose to decide once and for all where they stand. We urge them in the strongest possible terms to ensure that the clean energy credits are restored before the bill goes to the House floor, or vote no. Members of Congress who vote for this bill will have to explain to their constituents why they voted to cut good energy and manufacturing jobs and raise home energy costs in order to pay for tax cuts for billionaires.

“Words are not enough. Now we need action.”

TAKE 3: LCV President Pete Maysmith said, “This partisan reconciliation bill puts our health and safety at risk. It cuts funding for all manner of environmental protections. It eliminates the penalty for fossil fuel companies that fail to reduce their dangerous methane pollution while cutting funds to monitor, enforce, protect and improve air and water quality. It also directs hundreds of billions of dollars to turbocharge mass deportations, militarize the border, fund immigration raids in schools and other community spaces, and tear families apart.”

TAKING YOUR CALLS: LCV’s Vice President of Government Affairs Sara Chieffo joined C-SPAN’s Washington Journal this morning to answer calls from viewers and talk about the ways the House’s reconciliation bill will undermine clean energy and the benefits people all across the country are experiencing. Spoiler alert, this package means higher gas and electricity costs, more pollution and a loss of manufacturing jobs.

SENATE REPUBLICANS PASS ILLEGITIMATE CRA RESOLUTIONS TO END CALIFORNIA CLEAN VEHICLE WAIVERS: Republicans in the Senate broke the law, and their own rules, to pass a series of illegitimate Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions that seek to eliminate EPA’s state preemption waivers for California’s tailpipe pollution limits – the Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT), Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II), and Heavy-Duty Vehicle Omnibus (HDO) rules.

OUR TAKE: LCV Vice President of Federal Policy Matthew Davis said, “This attempt by Republicans to push through illegitimate power grabs will benefit Big Oil CEOs, while repealing state protections that make vehicles cheaper and cleaner. This should not be a political or partisan issue, it’s about states’ ability to set standards that deliver cleaner air for their citizens. For nearly 50 years, both Republican and Democratic administrations have followed the Clean Air Act to affirm California’s ability to do more to protect their residents from air pollution because of the state’s unique air quality problems.

“Cleaning up cars and trucks is essential to cleaning up our air and reducing associated health problems like asthma and mitigating climate change. These votes also risk billions of dollars of investments in hundreds of job-creating factories and will raise costs for consumers by eliminating these crucial clean car standards and raise prices at the pump. If the Senate wants to protect our air, our jobs, our health and our environment, they must oppose these illegitimate CRAs.”

CHISPA TAKE: Chipsa Senior Director Estefany Carrasco-González said, “Nothing is more fundamental to our health than clean air. Once again, polluters are getting their way in Washington, and our families will pay the price. Eliminating clean cars and truck waivers is undermining cleaner vehicle standards that are an option for states to reduce truck and bus pollution in their communities. Congressional Republicans want to undo decades of clean air progress just to help their Big Oil backers, while also removing crucial funding for programs that benefit all communities across the country, including the Clean School Bus program, Medicaid, and food assistance programs. Our Latine communities have a lot to lose. According to the American Lung Association’s recent “State of the Air” report, we are more likely to live in polluted areas. Some places with the most polluted air in the country are where Chispa has been organizing to protect our families: Phoenix, Reno, Denver, and Coastal Texas. Higher air pollution means more children suffering asthma attacks and missing school, parents missing work, more grandparents dying prematurely, and more death and destruction from extreme weather. We can’t keep paying more to breathe dirty air. Our health, environment, and livelihoods cannot afford it.”

LCV’s Matthew Davis also joined a press conference after the CRA votes with environmental champions Senator Ed Markey (MA), Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (NY), and Senator Ron Wyden (OR).

MATTHEW’S TAKE: “Congressional Republicans led a Big Oil-backed effort to circumvent their own rules in order to block California, and other states, from having stronger clean air standards for cars and trucks. This should not be a political or partisan issue, it’s about states’ ability to set standards – like the original tailpipe pollution limits set by Ronald Reagan – that deliver cleaner air for their citizens. At the same time, House Republicans have just passed their billionaire tax scam, the most anti-environmental bill in our nation’s history that will drive up families’ energy costs by hundreds of dollars per year. Right now, the Senate must stand up against the anti-environmental billionaire tax scam to protect our clean air and water, and cost-saving, jobs-creating clean energy.”

SEN. MARKEY TAKE: Senator Ed Markey said, “The Trump administration has made one thing painfully clear: They are putting Oil Above All—above the law, above the economy, and above the health and wallets of working families. The repeal of the Clean Air Act waivers is yet another historic example of the lawlessness of today’s Republican party; no rule, no norm, no standard is safe if it stands between them and what their Big Oil donors want. They’re breaking precedent, breaking Senate process, and breaking public trust. As a result, we will see more asthma. More heart disease. More early deaths. More cancer. That will be the Trump and Republican legacy.”

HOUSE REPUBLICANS PASS CRA TO WEAKEN CLEAN AIR ACT PROTECTIONS OVER BIPARTISAN OPPOSITION: On Thursday, the House narrowly passed a Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn the Environmental Protection Agency’s “Reclassification Rule”, effectively rolling back critical Clean Air Act protections.

OUR TAKE: LCV Healthy Communities Advocate Lizzy Duncan said, “The Clean Air Act is one of our nation’s most critical bedrock environmental laws. In the statute’s 50-year history, Congress has never rolled back Clean Air Act protections. This is yet another attack on our environment, and puts millions of people nationwide at risk of serious health harms, including cancer, from preventable toxic air pollution in favor of big polluters.”

SECRETARY BURGUM BEFORE HOUSE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE: Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum addressed the House Appropriations Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee and he laid out his dangerous plan to kneecap the Interior Department.

REP. PINGREE TAKE: During the hearing, Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chellie Pingree (ME-01) said, “So, Secretary Burgum, the document we are here to discuss today is more than just a budget. It’s a blueprint for dismantling the very mission of the Department of Interior—making it impossible to protect our natural resources and iconic national parks or uphold our commitments to Tribal communities now and for future generations.”

ICYMI: NATIONAL NEWS

REPRESENTATIVE GERRY CONNOLLY DIES AT 75: Ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Representative Gerry Connolly (VA-11) passed away on Wednesday at 75. Connolly was a longtime climate and democracy champion who railed against President Trump’s efforts to gut the federal workforce.

OUR TAKE: LCV President Pete Maysmith said, “We are deeply saddened to lose such a steadfast leader and champion for our environment. Representative Connolly fought tirelessly on behalf of Virginians and to combat the climate crisis. His leadership co-founding and co-chairing the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (SEEC) made a lasting difference in climate advocacy in the Capitol and helped us pass the biggest climate legislation in history, the Inflation Reduction Act. His committed public service will most certainly be missed.”

VALCV TAKE: Virginia LCV Executive Director Mike Town said, “Representative Connolly was a proud American and a stalwart champion for the voters of Northern Virginia. He was also consistently outspoken in support for protecting our environment and addressing our climate crisis. Virginians are saddened today by his passing, and his legacy of service will be felt by Virginians for decades to come.”

While California, through the California Air Resources Board (CARB), did not officially set federal emissions standards, California holds enough of the market to influence automakers and other states significantly. If CARB sets standards that are tougher than EPA standards, the dominoes fall in line behind CARB—not the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). California effectively sets national tailpipe emission policy.

The 2035 mandate had several steps. By 2026, 35 percent of new cars and trucks sold in California had to be zero-emission, plug-in hybrid, or hydrogen. By 2030, that climbed to 68 percent. And by 2035, 100 percent. The auto industry has lobbied against the 2035 mandate, even while Honda, Ford, and other automakers signed agreements recognizing California’s authority to set standards, because of its aggressive transition period.

California Governor Gavin Newsom maintains that the state will still meet its climate goals despite this, citing a ""legal responsibility under the federal Clean Air Act to protect our community and reduce criteria pollutants to the levels required by federal law."" California may even consider stricter emissions limits on factories and oil refineries to make up the difference, according to Mary Nichols, former chair of CARB. The state could also encourage mass transit or impose penalties for gasoline-powered cars.

Meanwhile, the aftermarket is celebrating the repeal of the mandate. Mike Spagnola, President and CEO of the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) said:

Silicon batteries today can charge in well under 10 minutes and that’s less than it takes to refuel gasoline-based vehicles.
Silicon batteries are changing the way we think about electrification, using EVs, charging EVs and enabling other technologies, whether it is electrification of aviation, silicon batteries are fundamentally going to change the way we think about transportation.","Q&A with Group 14’s CEO

Silicon-anode batteries, like those produced by Group 14, offer significantly higher energy density and extremely fast charging times compared to traditional graphite-based lithium-ion batteries, promising to fundamentally change EV technology.

Scaling silicon battery production is the main hurdle—although silicon is abundantly available, expanding the manufacturing infrastructure to meet global demand will take years or even decades.

Fast-charging capabilities (with charging speeds potentially under 10 minutes or even as quick as 90 seconds) could eliminate “charge anxiety,” transforming the EV market by enabling smaller, cheaper batteries and dramatically accelerating EV adoption.

Global EV adoption dynamics highlight China’s rapid advancement in EV technology and adoption, contrasting sharply with slower, politically complicated adoption processes in markets like the US and Europe.

As EV makers continue to grapple with the challenges of using traditional lithium-ion batteries, including alleviating concerns about range anxiety, safety and raw material sourcing, battery material manufacturers are exploring alternative chemistries.

There has been talk about using silicon anodes to replace graphite anodes in lithium-ion batteries for several years. But there has been a jump forward—Group 14, NanoGraf, NEO Battery Materials and Nexeon are all moving from the pilot production stage to large-scale commercial manufacturing of silicon anode batteries.

Group 14 is manufacturing silicon battery material that it says provides up to 50% higher energy density than lithium-ion batteries at scale. Its SCC55 technology is designed for a range of sectors from EV to consumer electronics, eVTOL aircraft, enterprise/data centers and more.

The company is delivering material to customers from its 10 GWh facility in South Korea, and its BAM-2 factory in Moses Lake, Washington, currently under construction, will house an initial annual capacity of 2,000 tons of SCC55 or 10 GWh of silicon battery material. Group 14 takes a modular approach to manufacturing, allowing it to quickly set up production facilities anywhere in the world and begin delivering SCC55 while building additional manufacturing modules. The company’s manufacturing process consists of two main steps: creating a carbon scaffold and exposing that scaffold to silane for silicon deposition. This, it says, makes it easier to scale up than more complex manufacturing methods.

Charged recently spoke with Group 14’s CEO, Rick Luebbe, about how silicon anode batteries will shape the future of EVs, improving range, charging speed and performance.

Charged: Why are silicon anode batteries going into commercial-scale production now?

Rick Luebbe: We think silicon battery technology is going to obsolesce, already has obsolesced, graphite-based batteries, and the only constraint is how fast companies can scale and get silicon anode materials out in the marketplace.

We are extremely excited about the silicon battery age, both for more energy density, but more importantly, for extremely fast charging, which we think is critical in the battery space.

It is all about the pace of scaling. We demonstrated the technology many years ago and got the performance necessary for commercialization. But scaling a large material technology takes a long time. Our first commercial factory is on the smaller side; that’s been in production for about three years now and that material is in a variety of cell phones in China.

The most known is Honor’s high-end cell phones, enabling the power requirements being driven by AI-enabled chips in those phones, because they really need a more energy-dense battery. That has caused a realization in consumer electronics that silicon is here, silicon is better and silicon is a requirement for advanced phones. These AI-enabled phones require a lot more power, but from a user experience perspective, nobody is willing to accept shorter battery life to get that extra functionality.

From an EV perspective, the industry is waiting for the first EV-scale material to be available, and I think we’ll see it adopted as quickly as those plants can come online.

As far as I know, we are the largest and the farthest along, and our BAM-2 factory in Washington should be in production later this year. EV technology adoption has a bit of a delay once the factory comes online, because of the qualification process and then program scheduling and a few other hoops to jump through. But we expect to be driving fast charging and extended vehicle range as early as the first part of next year, after the factory comes online in the second half of this year. Call it a six-to-eight-month qualification adoption cycle, scheduling into ramp and then off and running. As fast as we can scale, we think EVs will be transitioning to silicon-based systems.

Charged: Silicon metal pricing is relatively stable compared to some other raw materials. But is the supply of silicon available enough and stable enough to ramp up?

Rick Luebbe: Absolutely—our silicon comes in the form of silane gas, which is a gaseous form of silicon. Effectively, silane is made by gasifying metallurgical-grade silicon. Silicon is the number-one or number-two most ubiquitous element on earth. You can even make silane out of sand; it is not the most efficient process, but it is possible. There is not really a shortage of silicon. There is silicon everywhere, so it is pretty easy to access the raw materials. In that respect, it is a fantastic battery material, as there are not any real supply chain concerns.

Charged: What kind of timescale do you see, and how much of a market share do you expect for silicon-anode versus traditional graphite-anode lithium batteries?

Rick Luebbe: I think that silicon will completely replace graphite-based batteries as soon as there is enough capacity. Think about the evolution of rechargeable batteries. Nickel-cadmium batteries from 30 or 40 years ago got replaced by nickel-metal-hydride batteries. And fairly quickly, nickel-metal-hydride got replaced by traditional lithium-ion batteries. I do think that lithium-based systems are advantaged, because lithium is the smallest and lightest element that can move a single ion back and forth. But in terms of silicon replacing graphite and getting all those performance improvements we get with silicon batteries, it obsolesces traditional lithium-ion that uses a graphite anode, and so I don’t see a use case in the long term for graphite-based batteries. It is really a supply chain constraint. How quickly can the industry build and grow silicon production infrastructure?

Charged: How quickly do you think that is?

Rick Luebbe: Right now, we assess the market to be about five terawatts’ worth of batteries supplied annually on a global basis. Each one of our production modules can do 10 gigawatts, so the current market is equivalent to about 500 of these buildings. We can build maybe two, three or four per year at Group 14. If the market today is 500 and growing at 15% a year, that means the market is growing at 75 modules per year. The market is growing faster than the silicon anode industry is growing because we’re starting off so small. So, the good news is that the market opportunity is enormous for silicon battery companies, but the trick is securing enough capital to grow this manufacturing base fast enough to take sizeable market share. That is going to be a multi-decade process. We will see graphite batteries for 20 years, but by that point we will see graphite more or less replaceable.

Currently 80% of the graphite for batteries comes from China. And if that becomes problematic, then the rest of the world is going to work harder to replace that anode supply, and it makes more sense to build silicon infrastructure than to build something that is being obsolesced. So, politics may accelerate that, depending on what happens here in the next couple years.

Charged: What does the use of silicon battery technology mean for EV range and charging capability?

Rick Luebbe: The magic of silicon batteries is related to the volume of the cell taken up by graphite today. About 60% of the volume of the battery is taken up by the graphite anode, but the cathode brings the lithium. And the lithium determines the energy density. The industry said, if we can find a way to shrink that anode, we can put in more cathode and get an improvement in energy density. Silicon, by itself, has about 10 times the capacity by weight of graphite, about three times by volume, and so it is a more energy-dense material to use.

Now that we’ve solved the challenges with cycle life we can make silicon work. We can put in a silicon anode that’s a fraction of the size of a graphite anode, which means we are going to put in much more cathode material. What we are seeing in our customers is up to a 50% increase in energy density, or a 50% increase in range for the same size cell, same weight, which is amazing.

But there has been so much focus on range because people talk about range anxiety. I don’t think range anxiety is really the problem. I think the problem is charge anxiety.

If we can get batteries to the same convenience from a chargeability perspective as gasoline cars, we don’t need a 400- or 600-kilometer-range pack. We are okay with even a 200-kilometer-range pack because we are charging at home in a lot of cases anyway. That is the secret and if you think about the ripple effect of being able to do that extreme fast charging and making it really convenient, packs are smaller, which means they’re cheaper. Now EVs are going to be cheaper than internal combustion vehicles, and it becomes an accelerating effect as we resolve charge anxiety.

Silicon batteries today can charge in well under 10 minutes and that’s less than it takes to refuel gasoline-based vehicles. When that charging infrastructure comes online, combined with the fact that you can refuel your EV at home, which you cannot do with your gasoline-powered car, I think we’re going to see a dramatic acceleration in electrification, and we’ll see a wider range of vehicles and size capabilities, much more customized for individual use case. Tremendous opportunity is going to be unlocked by the promise of extreme fast charging.

Charged: As you say, it’s the charging, rather than the range, that’s the issue, especially in cities.

Rick Lubbe: There is some capability coming that is mind-boggling. One of our customers is building a cell that they can charge from zero to 100% in 90 seconds. And now you can think about flash charging, not fast charging. You pull up at a stop light and in 10 seconds, you’re getting 20% more range. We cannot even imagine where the technology might go and what capabilities it unlocks. But we may never even think about charging. It may just happen in parking lots with inductive charging, or at stop lights or as you’re driving through a rest area, your car gets topped off. There are so many possibilities that folks have not even thought about that could be enabled by these extreme fast charging technologies.

Charged: If you can charge that quickly, what effect does that have on infrastructure and urban planning?

Rick Luebbe: At the end of the day, you are delivering the same amount of power. Whatever the cars are using to drive around, that amount of power is fixed whether you charge those cars faster or slowly, so you still deliver the same number of kilowatts. But at least in the US, a Tesla supercharger station typically has up to 12 chargers, because each car might be sitting at that charger for 40-60 minutes. If you can turn those cars through in five minutes or seven minutes, now you do not need 12 chargers, you only need two or three, because there is not that backlog. You use the same amount of power, the grid infrastructure requirements do not change, but you reduce the amount of charging infrastructure you need, because drivers are not sitting on the chargers as long as they do today. So, it will enable faster charger capability deployment. Maybe fewer chargers, but you will be able to charge more EVs with this faster charging technology.

Silicon batteries are changing the way we think about electrification, using EVs, charging EVs and enabling other technologies, whether it is electrification of aviation, silicon batteries are fundamentally going to change the way we think about transportation. We are just beginning to see that momentum. And two or three years from now, we will be amazed at how much transformation we will see.

The iPhone came out less than 20 years ago, which is not a long time. So, 20 years from now, what is going to be radically different that we are not seeing today is the electrification of aviation. The concept makes great technical sense and convenient sense. Car traffic is two-dimensional and very hard to manage. Aviation is three-dimensional. Now you have got an exponentially larger number of options for moving things around, taking advantage of all that space. The technology is here. The adoption is happening. In 20 years, it is going be like the Jetsons. We might not be driving, we might be flying to the airport, or the movie theater. We are going to see ubiquitous electrified aviation coming sooner than most people expect.

Charged: Thinking about the global market, how can countries apply lessons from other markets to accelerate EV adoption?

Rick Luebbe: China is crushing the world because it is not afraid to push EV adoption fast. It has embraced the benefits, both from a government perspective and from a consumer perspective, and they’re adopting EVs so fast it is blowing everybody’s mind. The EVs they are making are extremely high-quality, very low-cost, and really putting a lot of pressure on non-Chinese automakers.

Frankly, the rest of the world is asleep at the switch, missing the rate of what China is doing from a technology advancement perspective, while the rest of the world debates hybrid versus EV versus internal combustion, climate rules, all these other complexities we’ve layered on to EVs. For example, in the United States somehow EVs have become a political conversation. Phones are not political, why are EVs political? But other markets have just layered so much unnecessary complexity on the question of EV versus internal combustion, that it is inhibiting a natural process. The world is going to electrify. EVs are fundamentally technologically advanced over internal combustion. They are better vehicles. They are lower-maintenance, they are lower-cost in many respects, depending on what features you want and so forth. But there is this resistance to change that in some markets seems to not be consumer-driven, and almost seems to be politically driven, which is bizarre.

But the lesson for the rest of the world is, watch China, because China is moving at a pace of technological advancement that we have never seen before. Western nations are used to leading technological change, and so there is a bit of arrogance about it. “We’re Europe, we’re America, we have been everything,” it is not happening anymore, because we are not paying attention to what the rest of the world is doing. There is going to be a lot of catching up to do over the next 10 years.

India is an awesome potential market, not just for selling vehicles but producing vehicles. India has a lot of the advantages that China had a couple decades ago, without a lot of the political concerns that currently are challenging China to be a global player. India has its own challenges from an infrastructure perspective that it needs to overcome. But if it can make progress on being a manufacturing country, then it has a tremendous opportunity to develop its economy, become a world leader in manufacturing and then through that same process, becoming a large world market. The potential is there, but there is a lot of work to do.",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GROUP14_FALLBACK-1-2048x1408-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 10:04:44.707871

In this case, it’s to “spur a closer collaboration with private industry to ensure that we have the fuel supplies we need for a modernized nuclear energy sector,” Scharf said.

U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said the orders marked “a huge day for the nuclear industry,” enabling America to pursue nuclear innovation in ways it hasn’t done for decades.

“Mark this day on your calendar. This is going to turn the clock back on over 50 years of overregulation of the industry,” Burgum said.

Each of the executive orders addresses issues that have stifled the industry’s growth in the U.S. and in doing so, promote energy independence, Burgum said. A key priority of the Trump administration has been making America less dependent on foreign countries economically and in terms of energy production, as the administration sees American dependence on other countries as a national security vulnerability.

Assistant to the President and White House Staff Secretary Will Scharf explained each of the orders at the president’s signing session. Several focus mostly on peeling back regulations, while others activate new permissions or programs to spur industry growth.

One order centers on changes to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

“Before 1978, there were 133 reactors built in the United States. Since 1978, only two new commercial reactors have come online. That’s because of overregulation,” Scharf said.

In recalibrating the commission, the administration hopes to clear the way for the industry to expand to quadruple the current amount of nuclear power production within the next 25 years.

Another order, as others of Trump’s executive orders have done, invokes emergency powers through the Defense Production Act, expanding the president’s powers related to domestic industry. Both Trump and former President Joe Biden have invoked the Defense Production Act for national defense and emergency preparedness reasons throughout their terms.

In this case, it’s to “spur a closer collaboration with private industry to ensure that we have the fuel supplies we need for a modernized nuclear energy sector,” Scharf said. The order also aims to boost the development of a nuclear energy sector workforce, as well as some other key industry “building blocks.”

Another aims to speed up the permitting process for new types of nuclear technology like micro-reactors, small modular reactors, and Generation IV and Generation III+ reactors, which have “revolutionary potential,” according to the order. Within that goal, the order directs the establishment of a new pilot program for reactor construction with the target of having three reactors operating by July 4, 2026.

Campbell power plant, though, has a generation capacity of approximately 1,450 megawatts, enough to supply power to a million Michigan residents.
In Michigan, coal plants generated 21 percent of total electricity in 2024, down from the 66 percent coal generated in 2009.
Wright's order Friday invoked emergency powers conferred on the energy secretary under the Federal Power Act.
Campbell power plant first opened in 1962.","The Department of Energy is invoking emergency powers to keep a decades-old coal-fired power plant in Michigan online, an effort designed to avoid power outages and grid reliability issues as summer, a peak power demand season, fast approaches, the Washington Free Beacon has learned.

In an emergency order signed late Friday afternoon, Energy Secretary Chris Wright directed the region's grid operator to coordinate with the Michigan-based Consumers Energy, ensuring the utility company's J.H. Campbell power plant remains available for operation. The West Olive, Mich., plant was slated to be permanently retired on May 31 as part of Consumers Energy's plans to eliminate its coal fleet and slash carbon emissions by 90 percent.

The J.H. Campbell power plant, though, has a generation capacity of approximately 1,450 megawatts, enough to supply power to a million Michigan residents.

Friday's order signals that the Department of Energy is concerned the plant's closure would have devastating impacts on Michigan's grid and potentially lead to a significant power shortfall. Those concerns are in line with what experts and grid operators have repeatedly expressed—according to the nation's top grid watchdog, the Midwest is at ""high risk"" of shortfalls due in large part to the planned retirements of fossil-fuel-fired power plants.

""Today's emergency order ensures that Michiganders and the greater Midwest region do not lose critical power generation capability as summer begins and electricity demand regularly reach high levels,"" Wright said in a statement provided to the Free Beacon. ""This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families.""

""With President Trump's leadership, the Energy Department is hard at work securing the American people access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy that powers their lives regardless of whether the wind is blowing, or the sun is shining,"" he added.

Driven by state policies heavily incentivizing or mandating green energy investment, coal-fired power generation has dwindled over the last two decades nationwide, federal data show. In Michigan, coal plants generated 21 percent of total electricity in 2024, down from the 66 percent coal generated in 2009.

Overall, utility companies nationwide have announced coal-fired plant closures that would take 9,356 megawatts of power off the grid, even as U.S. power demand is projected to spike in the coming years, according to a report published by the Institute for Energy Economics & Financial Analysis.

""Coal plants are already being phased out precisely because they impose too many hidden costs on our communities—higher utility rates, lost economic productivity, increased healthcare bills, and severe water and air pollution that is costly to control and clean up,"" Bryan Smigielski, a Michigan campaign organizer for the eco-activist group Sierra Club, said in April.

Wright's action, though, illustrates how the Trump administration is undaunted by existing climate goals that seek to rapidly shut down fossil fuel sources and replace them with green energy alternatives.

That contrasts with the Biden Energy Department's approach, which enthusiastically encouraged utility companies to pursue a rapid green energy transition. In fact, Biden energy secretary Jennifer Granholm in January offered a $5.2 billion loan to Consumers Energy to help the company build more solar, wind, and battery storage, and replace fossil fuel infrastructure.

Wright's order Friday invoked emergency powers conferred on the energy secretary under the Federal Power Act. Those powers are rarely invoked—Wright has turned to them once before, while Granholm used them just 11 times.

The automaker is one of several developing EV charging robots, with this tech expecting a demand in the distant future in parking structure and lot settings.

The business case behind charging robots remains murky, while hardware costs for robots, mobile or stationary, have yet to be fully recognized.

When it comes to robots, Hyundai is perhaps best known for its purchase of Boston Dynamics along with its increasingly unnerving menagerie of humanoid machines that now appear to be headed to Hyundai auto plants worldwide, feared to replace human workers.

But it's by no means the only type of robot that Hyundai thinks has a future in the automotive sphere.

Several automakers have been working on EV charging robots, predicting a future in which the task of manually plugging a cord into a car will be deemed dated.

But until now, this futuristic and perhaps slightly decadent technology has not seen a real-world debut on a large enough scale.

Hyundai plans to do just that at Seoul's Incheon International Airport.

The automaker signed an agreement with the busy travel hub to introduce a number of charging robots as a test case for a larger mobility ecosystem.

The robots themselves have already seen testing at Hyundai's own sites starting in 2024.

The value proposition of automatic charging robots, or ACRs, is that it allows a single robot to recharging multiple EVs over the course of hours or days by using a single connector. So when travelers leave their cars in an airport parking garage and fly away on a trip, their cars can be recharged without being repositioned and without taking up space next to a single charging stall for days.

These mobile robots, in effect, act as a multiplier of an existing structure's charging hardware.

Different developers have a different view of charging robots. Volkswagen, for instance, envisions a two-robot team composed of a wheeled battery energy storage system (BESS) unit about the size of a small fridge, and another unit to handle the physical tasks of opening and closing charging ports and connecting cables. This allows a mobile battery to avoid being constrained by the layout of a parking structure and by cable lengths, maximizing the number of cars that can be juiced up over a matter or hours or days.

Once a two-robot team is done recharging a car, both automatically return to a outlet to recharge themselves before heading out again.

Hyundai's approach for the moment is a little simpler, with a single cable-holding stationary robot being able to open charging ports and plug in a charger from a nearby stall. This method, therefore, still implies a 1:1 or 2:1 car and charging stall ratio, rather than being able to visit multiple cars over a period of time.

And the more mundane alternative is still simply paying a human to do this task the old fashioned way.

Both types of robotic solutions carry their own costs, but we see a greater longer-term potential for a system that can serve multiple cars via a single grid connection.

Needless to say, both types of systems are still in their infancy and for the moment do not face real-world business pressures, including profitability.

You may also recall that a decade ago it was expected that inductive charging mats would be a common piece of tech in long-term airport structures, allowing each EV to charge at leisure without requiring too much complex and expensive hardware (such as a whole robot or two).

Whether our Jetsons-style future will indeed have robots just for recharging EVs in car parks remains to be seen, but for now these robots are also in a race with DC fast-charging tech that might place the whole recharging process on par with gas refueling.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/mk03-683086b608472.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.764xh;0,0.199xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-05-24 10:04:48.260087

The plaintiffs argued that Trump lacks the authority to carry out such a radical transformation of government without approval from Congress.

On Friday, the Trump administration appealed this latest decision to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
The government's position is that Trump's executive order and the OMB and OPM memo serve only to ""facilitate"" reductions in force (RIFs), or mass layoffs, within agency workforces and did not order them.","A federal judge in San Francisco has indefinitely paused President Trump's sweeping overhaul of the federal government.

U.S. District Judge Susan Illston issued the preliminary injunction late Thursday, nearly two weeks after temporarily halting Trump's Feb. 11 executive order directing agencies to shut down offices and lay off thousands of people.

A coalition of labor unions, nonprofits and local governments had sued to block that executive order and the subsequent memo issued by the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management instructing agencies on how to carry out Trump's order. The plaintiffs argued that Trump lacks the authority to carry out such a radical transformation of government without approval from Congress.

Illston agreed, writing that ""agencies may not conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force in blatant disregard of Congress's mandates, and a President may not initiate large-scale executive branch reorganization without partnering with Congress.""

She noted that over the last century, nine presidents have sought and obtained authority from Congress to reorganize the executive branch. She pointed out that others, including Trump in his first term, sought approval but were not granted it.

The lawsuit named Trump, Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency, the heads of 21 federal agencies and those agencies themselves as defendants.

Illston's order stops those agencies from issuing new reorganization plans and new layoff notices. It also prevents agencies from formally separating those who have already received such notices and are currently on administrative leave.

She wrote that in some cases, the evidence showed that agencies were making changes that ""intentionally or negligently"" flout the duties given to them by Congress, which funds them.

She cited as examples reports that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, AmeriCorps and the National Science Foundation are planning to cut 50% or more of their employees, while the IRS and the Small Business Administration may cut 40%.

""After dramatic staff reductions, these agencies will not be able to do what Congress has directed them to do,"" she wrote.

Illston stopped short of requiring agencies to bring people already laid off or placed on administrative leave back to work while the litigation continues.

On Friday, the Trump administration appealed this latest decision to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The administration has also already asked the Supreme Court to stay Illston's earlier ruling. The government's position is that Trump's executive order and the OMB and OPM memo serve only to ""facilitate"" reductions in force (RIFs), or mass layoffs, within agency workforces and did not order them.

""Agencies have express statutory authority to conduct RIFs, and the President may tell agencies to use their own statutory authorities to accomplish policy goals,"" government attorneys wrote.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration announced plans to close an office at the Environmental Protection Agency, an office tasked with protecting the most vulnerable Americans from environmental harms. Now many of the tools that communities used to figure out where pollution is happening, they've disappeared. NPR's Nate Perez visited one community in Louisiana where the loss of pollution data is already having an impact.

NATE PEREZ, BYLINE: Eighty-five-year-old Robert Taylor drives me around his hometown, Reserve, Louisiana, in his red pickup truck.

ROBERT TAYLOR: This was originally a dairy farm. All of this was cow pastures.

PEREZ: We end up in front of the two-story brick house Taylor built in St. John Parish in 1969. By then, he noticed a change in the demographics.

TAYLOR: The white people were moving out. This area here, which was maybe 10% Black, is right now 99% Black.

PEREZ: Taylor says the white population in Reserve left before the DuPont plant began operating next door. He says there were other changes, too.

TAYLOR: You know, we noticed the difference in the quality of the air, the odors, the plants that would die.

PEREZ: That synthetic rubber plant announced this month it would indefinitely suspend production. Denka, which runs the plant, cites financial losses as the reason. But Taylor says the damage has already been done.

TAYLOR: That house right there, the father survived the first attack of cancer. Ten years later, it came back and killed him.

PEREZ: Robert, you're telling me there, here, there, all affected?

TAYLOR: I didn't go this way.

PEREZ: Oh, my God.

TAYLOR: They call this place Cancer Alley.

PEREZ: Cancer Alley. This is where more than 150 petrochemical facilities and oil refineries operate along the Mississippi River corridor between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Kim Terrell's with Tulane University's Environmental Law Clinic. She says an environmental protection agency tool called EJScreen helped St. John make a big discovery.

KIM TERRELL: EJScreen indicated that that community had more cancer risk than anywhere else in the nation.

PEREZ: A recent Johns Hopkins study found a total of 45 hazardous air pollutants in Louisiana's River Parishes. National emission standards were set for some of those pollutants under the Biden administration. It was a start, says Gail LeBoeuf, a lifelong resident of St. James Parish, which is not far from St. John.

GAIL LEBOEUF: So you had people trying to trying to work within the system that exists to give some help, but we're seeing all that pushback now.

PEREZ: That pushback she talks about comes from President Trump, who signed an executive order earlier this year to end DEI programs. As part of that, EJScreen was removed in February. Then the administration sent nearly 300 letters to staffers at the EPA's Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights Office that they could be fired. Matthew Tejada's a former official at the EJ office.

MATTHEW TEJADA: It was really under President Biden that you saw the government really start to evolve towards being more equitable and more just.

PEREZ: Tejada points to Justice40 as an example. It promised to deliver at least 40% of federal climate programs to overpolluted communities. Tejada says it was an effort to bring benefits to the most vulnerable communities.

TEJADA: Because they're not making it to the folks that deserve those benefits the most because they're the least protected.

PEREZ: But not everyone agrees with Tejada. The EPA's spokesperson, Molly Vaseliou, said in an email that environmental justice has been used primarily as an excuse to fund left-wing activist groups instead of addressing specific environmental issues. But many in the River Parishes disagree with that. Gail LeBoeuf says they're going to keep fighting for clean air and water.

LEBOEUF: The fight is about democracy and equal justice under the law.

PEREZ: But without EJScreen, LeBoeuf says that fight has only become harder. Researchers have archived EJScreen, but if the data isn't updated, the tool becomes obsolete. That's why the Sierra Club and other groups are now suing the federal government to get EJScreen and other data back as a federal tool so that people like Robert Taylor and others in the River Parishes can fight for a healthy environment.

“Our energy bills are becoming increasingly unaffordable, and we must address this ratepayer inequity.”

The bill has been amended from its original version earlier this month, which had proposed sunsetting all legacy NEM contracts after ten years instead of 20.

The voting of this bill in California came on the same week as the US House of Representatives narrowly passed a bill that seeks to move forward the end date on tax credits for solar residential (Section 25D) to the end of 2025, along with other tax credit provisions for clean energy, including manufacturing.

To better respond to the East Side resident environmental quality questions, DEC established the East Buffalo Environmental Forum, in partnership with the Environmental Protection Agency. The meetings will provide updates on projects like the East Delevan State Superfund clean-up. In addition, experts will be available to answer community questions and provide information on topics such as water, air, and soil quality. Contact Kayla Baker at the contact information below to receive information about the next forum.

Community Air Monitoring Initiative

The statewide Community Air Monitoring (CAM) Initiative worked with a mobile monitoring contractor Aclima, Inc. to collect air quality data in 10 disadvantaged communities for one year ending in August 2023, expanding on the four communities required by the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (Climate Act). Air quality monitoring focused on disadvantaged communities (DACs) with high air pollution burdens. The results will help DEC target strategies to reduce air pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change. Buffalo/Niagara Falls/Tonawanda were included as part of the disadvantaged communities, including the East Side of Buffalo.

DEC released the Phase 1 Community Story Maps. The collection of story maps presents mobile monitoring results for each of the 10 communities with interactive maps which can be used to explore the data. DEC, community members, and other stakeholders will use these mapping tools, results, and other information to identify sources and prioritize areas for air pollution reductions. The collection of story maps also includes a survey tool for valuable input on community air quality concerns. DEC wants to ensure community members and stakeholders are meaningfully informed about the CAM mobile monitoring results and have opportunity to provide valuable input to effectively guide the critical mitigation phase of the CAM process.

Following DEC’s meetings, Community Advisory Committees (CACs) established in study areas across the state are encouraged to hold their own meetings with community members to discuss results and help clarify air quality concerns, priority sources, sensitive sites, and goals for improving air quality in disadvantaged communities. The Buffalo/Niagara Falls/Tonawanda co-convenor for the CAC is Clean Air Coalition of WNY.

The CACs are invited to come together as one group to collaborate with DEC, the Climate Justice Working Group (CJWG), and other state agencies and entities to work on potential strategies to meet air pollution mitigation goals.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration announced plans to close an office at the Environmental Protection Agency, an office tasked with protecting the most vulnerable Americans from environmental harms. Now many of the tools that communities used to figure out where pollution is happening, they've disappeared. NPR's Nate Perez visited one community in Louisiana where the loss of pollution data is already having an impact.

NATE PEREZ, BYLINE: Eighty-five-year-old Robert Taylor drives me around his hometown, Reserve, Louisiana, in his red pickup truck.

ROBERT TAYLOR: This was originally a dairy farm. All of this was cow pastures.

PEREZ: We end up in front of the two-story brick house Taylor built in St. John Parish in 1969. By then, he noticed a change in the demographics.

TAYLOR: The white people were moving out. This area here, which was maybe 10% Black, is right now 99% Black.

PEREZ: Taylor says the white population in Reserve left before the DuPont plant began operating next door. He says there were other changes, too.

TAYLOR: You know, we noticed the difference in the quality of the air, the odors, the plants that would die.

PEREZ: That synthetic rubber plant announced this month it would indefinitely suspend production. Denka, which runs the plant, cites financial losses as the reason. But Taylor says the damage has already been done.

TAYLOR: That house right there, the father survived the first attack of cancer. Ten years later, it came back and killed him.

PEREZ: Robert, you're telling me there, here, there, all affected?

TAYLOR: I didn't go this way.

PEREZ: Oh, my God.

TAYLOR: They call this place Cancer Alley.

PEREZ: Cancer Alley. This is where more than 150 petrochemical facilities and oil refineries operate along the Mississippi River corridor between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Kim Terrell's with Tulane University's Environmental Law Clinic. She says an environmental protection agency tool called EJScreen helped St. John make a big discovery.

KIM TERRELL: EJScreen indicated that that community had more cancer risk than anywhere else in the nation.

PEREZ: A recent Johns Hopkins study found a total of 45 hazardous air pollutants in Louisiana's River Parishes. National emission standards were set for some of those pollutants under the Biden administration. It was a start, says Gail LeBoeuf, a lifelong resident of St. James Parish, which is not far from St. John.

GAIL LEBOEUF: So you had people trying to trying to work within the system that exists to give some help, but we're seeing all that pushback now.

PEREZ: That pushback she talks about comes from President Trump, who signed an executive order earlier this year to end DEI programs. As part of that, EJScreen was removed in February. Then the administration sent nearly 300 letters to staffers at the EPA's Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights Office that they could be fired. Matthew Tejada's a former official at the EJ office.

MATTHEW TEJADA: It was really under President Biden that you saw the government really start to evolve towards being more equitable and more just.

PEREZ: Tejada points to Justice40 as an example. It promised to deliver at least 40% of federal climate programs to overpolluted communities. Tejada says it was an effort to bring benefits to the most vulnerable communities.

TEJADA: Because they're not making it to the folks that deserve those benefits the most because they're the least protected.

PEREZ: But not everyone agrees with Tejada. The EPA's spokesperson, Molly Vaseliou, said in an email that environmental justice has been used primarily as an excuse to fund left-wing activist groups instead of addressing specific environmental issues. But many in the River Parishes disagree with that. Gail LeBoeuf says they're going to keep fighting for clean air and water.

LEBOEUF: The fight is about democracy and equal justice under the law.

PEREZ: But without EJScreen, LeBoeuf says that fight has only become harder. Researchers have archived EJScreen, but if the data isn't updated, the tool becomes obsolete. That's why the Sierra Club and other groups are now suing the federal government to get EJScreen and other data back as a federal tool so that people like Robert Taylor and others in the River Parishes can fight for a healthy environment.

However, threats to federal incentives and tax credits for EVs may derail the momentum.

As part of President Donald Trump's goal to restructure the country's budget, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson has proposed removing a $7,500 tax credit for EV owners, and a $4,000 credit for buying a used EV by the end of this year.

John Higham, a member of the Electric Vehicle Association's board of directors, said he wonders if this will cause potential buyers to back away.

""It's not going to kill the electric vehicle,"" he said. ""It might slow the acceleration of the adoption of the electric vehicle, but it's certainly not going to reverse the trend.""

Higham said he expects a 10% to 12% growth rate for EV purchases, but admits that number could drop to between 8% and 9% if the tax credits disappear. The federal budget proposal could pass between the end of May and the end of July.

The U.S. House has proposed legislation that would extend the tax credits until the end of 2025. And analysts say the largest EV automaker -- Tesla, led by Elon Musk -- would be among those most affected if the tax credits end.

Higham said repealing these tax credits could split opinions along party lines.

Eliminate the tax credit for leased residential solar installations for tax years after the bill’s passage.
A summary of the clean energy tax credit changes in the new bill follows.","On May 22, 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a new version of H.R. 1, “The One, Big, Beautiful Bill” that would effectively repeal the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA’s) clean energy tax credits almost immediately. While the legislation will now be considered by the U.S. Senate—and could change substantially there—industry participants should be aware of the House’s position as the bill moves through the reconciliation process.

The version of the bill includes provisions that would do the following:

Clean energy tax credits. Terminate completely the Section 45Y Clean Energy Production Credit and the Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Credit for any qualified facilities that don’t begin construction within 60 days following the enactment of the bill and that are placed in service after the end of 2028. The original bill would have phased out each credit in a graduated manner and allowed construction to begin within two years of enactment. Notably, Nuclear is exempted from the 60-day start of construction requirement.

Nuclear. Extend the 45U tax credit for qualified nuclear facilities at full value through 2031 (as opposed to a three-year phase down proposed in the earlier version of the bill).

Transferability. Restore transferability for the duration of many IRA credits including sections 45Y, 48E, and 45U (qualified nuclear facilities), rather than repeal transferability after 2027, as was proposed in the original bill. Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credits, 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credits, and 45Q Credits for Carbon Dioxide Sequestration would be subject to transferability limitations after 2027.

FEOCs. Restrict credits relating to Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOCs) beginning January 1, 2026; prior drafts were slated to go into effect on January 1, 2027. These FEOC provisions would prevent energy tax credits from being claimed by any entity that is deemed to be controlled or influenced by an enumerated adversarial foreign country, including China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. Most important for the renewable energy industry, however, the credits would be disallowed by the owner of a renewable energy project if the business receives “material assistance” from an FEOC, which includes component parts, design, or intellectual property for the facility. Given China’s dominance in raw materials, processing, and manufacturing of clean energy facility components, it would be difficult for renewable energy companies to comply with the provisions as drafted.

Residential solar. Eliminate the tax credit for leased residential solar installations for tax years after the bill’s passage.

The amended bill passed the House on May 22 by a narrow, party-line vote and is likely to change significantly. A summary of the clean energy tax credit changes in the new bill follows.

What this means to you

Now is a good time for renewable energy companies to (1) audit project pipelines to identify projects with the highest potential to be placed in service prior to 2028, (2) carefully consider the potential diminishing lead time to secure safe harbored clean energy equipment, and (3) shore up relationships with EPC contractors, suppliers, lenders, investors, and other stakeholders critical for project execution.

The bill now moves to the Senate, where we have another opportunity to advocate for and protect clean energy.

Solar and storage are an American success story, supporting thousands of good jobs, millions in energy savings, and a surging manufacturing sector. However, Congress is considering cutting policies that support this success, threatening billions invested in our communities. This includes harsh restrictions on tax credits while gutting others, or quickly phasing them out.

As it stands, the legislation before Congress falls short of the policies necessary to help the U.S. meet its growing energy demand, create jobs, and continue the successful build-out of the solar and storage supply chain here in the U.S.

We invite you to join us in this effort and urge Congress to defend American energy incentives and protect the economic engine that clean energy has created. In the last two years, American solar and storage have surged. In that time, American-made solar module manufacturing has grown six times.

Solar installations can now provide enough homegrown energy to power more than 40 million homes. This expanding industry also means jobs that pay people well. The solar and storage industry already supports over 280,000 good jobs, many of them right here in Wisconsin.

We already know that solar energy is affordable, abundant, and easy to deploy. So, as America works to meet the rising energy demands of AI, data centers, and advanced manufacturing, clean energy and energy storage are critical to keeping energy bills in check and maintaining our economic competitiveness.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump signed executive orders Friday intended to quadruple domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, a goal experts say the United States is highly unlikely to reach.

To speed up the development of nuclear power, the orders grant the U.S. energy secretary authority to approve advanced reactor designs and projects, taking authority away from the independent safety agency that has regulated the U.S. nuclear industry for five decades.

The order comes as demand for electricity surges amid a boom in energy-hungry data centers and artificial intelligence. Tech companies, venture capitalists, states and others are competing for electricity and straining the nation’s electric grid.

“We’ve got enough electricity to win the AI arms race with China,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said. “What we do in the next five years related to electricity is going to determine the next 50″ years in the industry.

Still, it’s unlikely the U.S. could quadruple its nuclear production in the timeframe the White House specified. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two reactors, at a nuclear plant in Georgia, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.

Trump is enthusiastic

At the Oval Office signing, Trump, surrounded by industry executives, called nuclear a “hot industry,” adding, “It’s time for nuclear, and we’re going to do it very big.”

Burgum and other speakers said the industry has stagnated and has been choked by overregulation.

“Mark this day on your calendar. This is going to turn the clock back on over 50 years of overregulation of an industry,” said Burgum, who chairs Trump’s newly formed Energy Dominance Council.

The orders would reorganize the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission to ensure quicker reviews of nuclear projects, including an 18-month deadline for the NRC to act on industry applications. The measures also create a pilot program intended to place three new experimental reactors online by July 4, 2026 — 13 months from now — and invoke the Defense Production Act to allow emergency measures to ensure the U.S. has the reactor fuel needed for a modernized nuclear energy sector.

The administration is focused on boosting nuclear as “affordable, reliable, safe and secure power,” said Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. The executive orders send a signal that “America will build again,” Kratsios said. Energy Secretary Chris Wright echoed that sentiment on social media, posting that more reliable, secure and affordable energy sources — like geothermal, nuclear and natural gas — are the key to remaining the world’s energy powerhouse.

Trump has signed a spate of executive orders promoting oil, gas and coal that warm the planet when burned to produce electricity. Nuclear reactors generate electricity without emitting greenhouse gases. Trump said reactors are safe and clean, but did not mention climate benefits.

The order to reorganize the NRC will include significant staff reductions but is not intended to fire NRC commissioners who lead the agency. David Wright, a former South Carolina elected official and utility commissioner, chairs the five-member panel. His term ends June 30, and it is unclear if he will be reappointed.

Critics have trepidations

Critics say the White House moves could compromise safety and violate legal frameworks such as the Atomic Energy Act. Compromising the independence of the NRC or encouraging it to be circumvented entirely could weaken the agency and make regulation less effective, said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“Simply put, the U.S. nuclear industry will fail if safety is not made a priority,” he said.

A number of countries are speeding up efforts to license and build a new generation of smaller nuclear reactors to meet a surging demand for electricity and supply it carbon-free. Last year, Congress passed legislation that former President Joe Biden signed to modernize the licensing of new reactor technologies so they can be built faster.

This month, the power company in Ontario, Canada, began building the first of four small nuclear reactors.

Valar Atomics is a nuclear reactor developer in California. Founder and CEO Isaiah Taylor said nuclear development and innovation in the United States has been slowed by too much red tape, while Russia and China are speeding ahead. He said he’s most excited about the mandate for the Energy Department to speed up the pace of innovation.

The NRC is currently reviewing applications from companies and a utility that want to build small nuclear reactors to begin providing power in the early 2030s. Currently, the NRC expects its reviews to take three years or less.

Radiant Nuclear is a clean energy startup based in El Segundo, California, that is building a nuclear microreactor. Chief Operating Officer Tori Shivanandan said the administration’s support for the advanced nuclear industry will help ensure its success, and the executive orders mark a “watershed moment” for nuclear power.

But Hyundai chose Savannah for the Ioniq 9 drive to show off the new factory to the automotive journalists.","Savannah, Georgia ― The day Hyundai broke ground on its Georgia electric vehicle factory in fall 2022, the automaker also staged the car equivalent of a fashion show at this city’s Enmarket Arena.

Hyundai had yet to announce what models it would build at what would become the Metaplant, so locals flocked to the open house in search of hints. The centerpiece display showcased an all-electric SUV, a concept car known as SEVEN.

Last week, the SEVEN’s production model, the Ioniq 9, made its debut on Savannah-area roadways in a preview event for automotive journalists from around the world. The Ioniq 9aims to fill an underserved niche within the company’s electric vehicle fleet — a three-row SUV.

As trade journalists tested the EVs and stopped them at photogenic and video-friendly spots — the downtown historic district, the Tybee Island beach, marsh-side avenues draped in Spanish moss — they were met by Savannahians curious about the cars.

Chad Kirchner, who operates the EV news website Destinationcharged.com, was approached repeatedly while testing the Ioniq 9’s charger attachments at a Tesla supercharger location in the Savannah suburb of Pooler. Most inquired about whether the model was built at the new factory.

“People seemed genuinely excited,” he said. “I’ve never been approached like that at a charging station before in any new car. Doing what I do, I get some attention. But this was next level and exciting.”

The public reaction is similar to when local residents see products made by the region’s other two large-scale equipment makers, the business jet manufacturer Gulfstream and heavy equipment builder JCB.

If sales go as planned, though, Ioniq 9s will be more frequently spotted than luxury private jets, backhoes and skid-steer loaders.

Hyundai is the first auto manufacturer to open a Savannah-area facility — potentially a jolt for the economy here if EV sales continue to accelerate and the South Korean company successfully navigates Trump administration tariffs on auto parts.

Seeing a bright future

The Ioniq 9 is available for sale in limited quantities and is the flagship model for Hyundai’s Ioniq line, which includes the automaker’s bestselling EV, the Ioniq 5, a compact crossover.

Those two models are being produced at the assembly plant 30 minutes west of Savannah along I-16. The factory, the largest economic development project in state history, opened in October with a limited production schedule. Ioniq 9 manufacturing began earlier this year and all models for domestic sale will be made in Savannah.

At full buildout, the Metaplant will have a production capacity of 500,000 vehicles annually and manufacture multiple EV and hybrid car models for Hyundai and its sister brands Kia and Genesis.

Hyundai has yet to detail its ramp-up plans, although the automaker is confident recent sales growth will continue. Hyundai U.S. sales are up 33% over the last six years, with EVs making up 26% of the automaker’s business. In the first three months of 2025, Hyundai sold 42% more EVs than during the same period in 2024. March was the second-highest sales month in company history.

Hyundai has announced a goal of introducing 23 new EV models and manufacturing 1.44 million battery-powered cars annually by 2030, with the Georgia factory as the epicenter of U.S. production. All EVs currently rolling off the Savannah assembly line are for domestic sale.

As part of a $2.1 billion state incentives package, Hyundai is committed to employing 8,500 workers on the $7.59 billion Metaplant manufacturing campus by 2031.

In addition to the 2,600-worker car assembly facility, the site includes a 3,000-employee EV battery factory to open in 2026, a state-run Georgia QuickStart training center, a logistics supplier known as Hyundai Glovis and two major manufacturing partners. One, Hyundai Transys, builds seats while the other, Hyundai Mobis, consolidates parts into modules, including the passenger compartment, that streamline the assembly process.

Why Savannah made sense

Automakers typically stage what is known in the industry as a “drive” event in locales with varied terrain, better to showcase a new vehicle’s performance. But Hyundai chose Savannah for the Ioniq 9 drive to show off the new factory to the automotive journalists.

The Metaplant is a next-generation manufacturing facility using hundreds of robots in highly automated processes as well as self-propelled dollies that use GPS and motion sensors to navigate partially assembled EVs around the factory floor. The assembly plant tour left the journalists wowed and set up the afternoon-long test drives.

Larger vehicles designed for families is a mostly untapped market for EV buyers that Hyundai is aiming to capture, said Kevin Ketels, an assistant professor of global supply chain management at Wayne State University.

“The fact that they’re an early entrant into the marketplace is good news for them,” Ketels said.

The Ioniq 9 is priced from $60,555 for the basic trim to $76,590 for the fully loaded version, the Ioniq 9 Calligraphy Design. The EV is offered in nine paint colors and three interior colors. Competitors include a pair of three-row electric SUVs from Cadillac, the Vistiq and the Escalade IQ, and the Rivian 1RS. Ford Motor Co. had planned to build a three-row electric SUV at a plant in Oakville, Ontario, but scrapped that project, citing an inability to produce it profitably.

Georgia has emerged as Hyundai’s home base for American-made, three-row electric SUVs. Kia, a Hyundai subsidiary that operates a plant in West Point, recently underwent a factory expansion to produce its three-row electric SUV model called the EV9.

With the Trump administration’s tariffs shaking the global trading landscape, Ketels added that it’ll be important for Hyundai to try to source as many of its vehicle parts from North America and comply with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, known as USMCA.

The Ioniq 5 sources its batteries from a Commerce, Georgia, battery factory and meets federal requirements for buyers to receive a $7,500 tax credit, though a budget bill approved by the U.S. House would eliminate the credit. The Ioniq 9 also qualifies for the tax credit and currently sources 60% of its parts from the United States and Canada.

“If they can (get) vehicle content above 85% (USMCA compliant), then they might not have any tariffs that they have to pay on this,” Ketels said. “So it’ll be priced competitively for this vehicle segment.”

Earlier this year, the Trump administration announced plans to close an office at the Environmental Protection Agency, an office tasked with protecting the most vulnerable Americans from environmental harms. Now many of the tools that communities used to figure out where pollution is happening, they've disappeared. NPR's Nate Perez visited one community in Louisiana where the loss of pollution data is already having an impact.

NATE PEREZ, BYLINE: Eighty-five-year-old Robert Taylor drives me around his hometown, Reserve, Louisiana, in his red pickup truck.

ROBERT TAYLOR: This was originally a dairy farm. All of this was cow pastures.

PEREZ: We end up in front of the two-story brick house Taylor built in St. John Parish in 1969. By then, he noticed a change in the demographics.

TAYLOR: The white people were moving out. This area here, which was maybe 10% Black, is right now 99% Black.

PEREZ: Taylor says the white population in Reserve left before the DuPont plant began operating next door. He says there were other changes, too.

TAYLOR: You know, we noticed the difference in the quality of the air, the odors, the plants that would die.

PEREZ: That synthetic rubber plant announced this month it would indefinitely suspend production. Denka, which runs the plant, cites financial losses as the reason. But Taylor says the damage has already been done.

TAYLOR: That house right there, the father survived the first attack of cancer. Ten years later, it came back and killed him.

PEREZ: Robert, you're telling me there, here, there, all affected?

TAYLOR: I didn't go this way.

PEREZ: Oh, my God.

TAYLOR: They call this place Cancer Alley.

PEREZ: Cancer Alley. This is where more than 150 petrochemical facilities and oil refineries operate along the Mississippi River corridor between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Kim Terrell's with Tulane University's Environmental Law Clinic. She says an environmental protection agency tool called EJScreen helped St. John make a big discovery.

KIM TERRELL: EJScreen indicated that that community had more cancer risk than anywhere else in the nation.

PEREZ: A recent Johns Hopkins study found a total of 45 hazardous air pollutants in Louisiana's River Parishes. National emission standards were set for some of those pollutants under the Biden administration. It was a start, says Gail LeBoeuf, a lifelong resident of St. James Parish, which is not far from St. John.

GAIL LEBOEUF: So you had people trying to trying to work within the system that exists to give some help, but we're seeing all that pushback now.

PEREZ: That pushback she talks about comes from President Trump, who signed an executive order earlier this year to end DEI programs. As part of that, EJScreen was removed in February. Then the administration sent nearly 300 letters to staffers at the EPA's Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights Office that they could be fired. Matthew Tejada's a former official at the EJ office.

MATTHEW TEJADA: It was really under President Biden that you saw the government really start to evolve towards being more equitable and more just.

PEREZ: Tejada points to Justice40 as an example. It promised to deliver at least 40% of federal climate programs to overpolluted communities. Tejada says it was an effort to bring benefits to the most vulnerable communities.

TEJADA: Because they're not making it to the folks that deserve those benefits the most because they're the least protected.

PEREZ: But not everyone agrees with Tejada. The EPA's spokesperson, Molly Vaseliou, said in an email that environmental justice has been used primarily as an excuse to fund left-wing activist groups instead of addressing specific environmental issues. But many in the River Parishes disagree with that. Gail LeBoeuf says they're going to keep fighting for clean air and water.

LEBOEUF: The fight is about democracy and equal justice under the law.

PEREZ: But without EJScreen, LeBoeuf says that fight has only become harder. Researchers have archived EJScreen, but if the data isn't updated, the tool becomes obsolete. That's why the Sierra Club and other groups are now suing the federal government to get EJScreen and other data back as a federal tool so that people like Robert Taylor and others in the River Parishes can fight for a healthy environment.

The Federal Highway Administration and Department of Transportation acted without authority, unreasonably, and in violation of the Constitution when they indefinitely froze the NEVI Formula Program. The coalition is seeking the nationwide restoration of NEVI funds to build EV charging stations along highways in every corner of the country.

NEVI is essential as the American public increasingly opts for electric vehicles that are more accessible than ever before. Used EVs are more affordable than used gasoline vehicles, and the lifetime cost of owning an EV is already lower than combustion cars in most cases. More drivers are recognizing these benefits and are opting to go electric: in states like Colorado, a quarter of all car sales are zero-emissions.

Just as the U.S. has invested in building out broadband access and modernizing roads and bridges, developing a network of electric vehicle charging stations is key infrastructure that helps the country stay competitive and move forward with the rest of the world. The NEVI program can deliver thousands of good jobs across the country and ensure that all drivers — from urban to rural areas in all corners of the country — have access to high quality charging stations.

In the May 22 filing, the Sierra Club, Climate Solutions, Earthjustice, NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council), Plug In America, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, CleanAIRE NC, the West End Revitalization Association, and the Southern Environmental Law Center seek to join a lawsuit brought by 16 states and the District of Columbia in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.

QUOTES FROM REPRESENTATIVES OF FILING ORGANIZATIONS:

""Donald Trump is trying to cut jobs, increase pollution, and endanger our health. We refuse to let him,” said Sierra Club Executive Director Ben Jealous. “NEVI benefits everyone, whether you drive an EV or not, and the only people who benefit from blocking it are Big Oil and auto executives seeking to keep us hooked on fossil fuel-powered cars, while communities in every corner of the country lose out on infrastructure investments in our growing clean energy economy. The NEVI Program is working and states are legally entitled to the money allocated to them by Congress. Once again, we are taking the Trump administration to court over its reckless and illegal actions.""

“The Trump administration is going rogue by recklessly freezing funds authorized by Congress. We still have three branches of government in this country,” said Jan Hasselman, senior attorney with Earthjustice. “Without investments to build out EV charging, the United States will be left behind while the rest of the world moves forward.”

""Members of both parties came together to create this program so that owners of electric vehicles could easily drive wherever they need to go. Cutting off this funding with zero process and based solely on political whims is illegal,” said Atid Kimelman, clean vehicles attorney at NRDC. “The halt in funding has thrown state efforts to build charging stations into turmoil, and it will mean workers and drivers suffer. The only winners from this illegal action are billionaire oil barons.”

“Transportation is the leading source of climate pollution in the U.S., and halting the NEVI program directly threatens our progress toward clean, reliable transportation options—especially in the Southeast, where EV infrastructure is still catching up,” said Megan Kimball, Senior Attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. “In rural and urban areas alike, more charging access means cleaner air, economic growth, and real savings for families. We’re defending that future.”

“For decades, communities like ours in Alamance County, North Carolina, have been denied access to basic infrastructure,” said Omega Wilson, co-director of the West End Revitalization Association. “The NEVI Program offers a real chance to change that—with public investment in EV charging that finally includes rural Black and Brown neighborhoods. Suspending the program delays critical investments, widens infrastructure disparities, and sends the message that once again, the taxpayers who’ve been left behind the longest will be the last to benefit. We’re fighting to protect our place in the clean transportation future.”

“Tailpipe pollution is a public health crisis—fueling asthma, heart disease, and respiratory illness in communities already overburdened by environmental harm,” said Jeff Robbins, Executive Director of CleanAIRE NC. “NEVI is a vital step toward reducing that harm through zero-emission transportation. Freezing the program blocks progress and keeps our most vulnerable residents breathing dirty air. Clean air and climate justice cannot be put on hold.”

“We’ve spent years working to accelerate transportation electrification across the South—where clean mobility is critical for climate, health, and economic opportunity,” said Stephen Smith, Executive Director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. “The NEVI Program is one of the most practical tools we have to help states build reliable, accessible EV charging where it’s needed most. Suspending it puts hard-won progress at risk and leaves Southern communities without the resources to lead in the transition to clean energy.”

“Years of work with drivers tells us one thing: lack of reliable charging is a top barrier to going electric,” said Joel Levin, Executive Director of Plug In America. “Drivers were told help was coming—that the NEVI Program would build a dependable, nationwide network and make EVs a real option for everyone. Freezing it breaks that promise. It stalls adoption, shakes consumer confidence, and shuts Americans out of the future of transportation—while other countries race ahead. We’re standing up for drivers and demanding the government keep its word.”

“People want clean, fast and affordable ways to get around now. Anyone living near a highway or in a rural or commuter community, looking for a local job, wanting affordable family road trips or more blue sky summers back – all are going to be impacted if the Trump administration bends to the fossil fuel industry and withholds federal funds for EV fast chargers,” said Gregg Small, Executive Director of Climate Solutions. “The Pacific Northwest will lose out on reliable charging every 50 miles on the highway and this would mean more air pollution at a time that almost everywhere is starting to experience worse air quality with wildfire smoke and heatwaves. Let federal climate and clean air funds flow where they’re needed and intended. We are joining to help stop this road-block to the transition away from oil.”

More Background:

In February, the Trump administration halted the NEVI Formula Program, issuing a letter to states that prohibited new projects and cancelled previously-approved state plans for using the funds. Although $3.27 billion had been allocated to states, only $525 million had been committed to specific projects, leaving $2.75 billion indefinitely frozen.

NEVI is funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that Congress passed in 2021. NEVI is driving innovation in every state across the country, with Texas as the largest beneficiary.

Since 2015, groups of young people have been suing state and federal governments over climate change. Only one of those suits has made it to trial, in Montana. And in December, the young people won at the state Supreme Court. Conservative Montana lawmakers responded with new bills to get around the decision. Those bills have now been signed into law. Montana Public Radio's Ellis Juhlin reports on what's next.

(SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CHIRPING)

ELLIS JUHLIN, BYLINE: University of Montana junior Olivia Vesovich is taking a break between finals, walking on a trail between campus and the Clark Fork River.

OLIVIA VESOVICH: I don't see any snow on these mountains.

JUHLIN: That's concerning at this time of year. Climate change has been shown to extend Montana's wildfire season.

VESOVICH: I would love if my teenage years were not defined by climate change.

JUHLIN: Vesovich is 1 of the 16 youth plaintiffs who won, based on Montana's constitution guaranteeing the right to a clean and healthy environment. The court ruled that includes a stable climate. The decision outraged conservatives, who argued that because climate change is a global issue, Montana cannot be held responsible for it.

VESOVICH: To watch our legislatures actively dismiss a constitutional ruling is devastating.

JUHLIN: That's not how State Senator Wylie Galt sees it. He calls the decision...

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

WYLIE GALT: Gift-wrapped present to radical environment activists, an open door for endless lawsuits designed to shut down Montana's fossil fuel industry.

JUHLIN: The federal government estimates that Montana is home to about a third of America's recoverable coal reserves, but the court ordered the state to consider the climate impacts of developing fossil fuel projects and their greenhouse gas emissions.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

GALT: It had nothing to do with protecting the environment and everything to do with weaponizing the courts to strangle our economy.

JUHLIN: A new law Galt sponsored appears to thread the needle of the court's decision. Montana will now inventory greenhouse gas emissions, but it won't regulate them. Other new state laws go one step further, barring Montana from regulating planet-warming emissions at all unless the federal government does so first. That's unlikely under the Trump administration. Lawmakers could have tried to change Montana's constitution, eliminating its guarantee of environmental protection, but that's very difficult to do. University of Montana law professor Constance Van Kley says, short of that...

CONSTANCE VAN KLEY: There has been a response to the courts striking down the legislation on the part of the legislature, with the legislature kind of claiming that the Montana judiciary is out of control and super liberal.

JUHLIN: That's been a theme for several years - Montana's conservative lawmakers and governor challenging the authority of the judicial branch. Green groups say Montanans won't stand for the new laws passed in response to the state Supreme Court decision, which means, Van Kley says, more confrontation in and with state courts.

VAN KLEY: I think it's very likely to end up being litigated.

(SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CHIRPING)

JUHLIN: Back on the river trail, Olivia Vesovich says she and countless other young people will continue to feel the effects of human-caused climate change. She says she's disappointed by the Montana Legislature's priorities.

VESOVICH: They care more about protecting the fossil fuel industry than they care about protecting the lives of children.

JUHLIN: She says the longer the state delays on climate action, the worse things will be in the future, and she hopes her lawmakers keep that in mind.

According to the memorandum, to conduct this review, DOE may utilize information previously submitted by the award recipient, DOE’s own investigation or analyses or the agency will submit information requests to recipients for information relevant to the project to help inform DOE’s decisional process. The requested information could include information regarding a project’s financial health, a project’s technological and engineering viability, market conditions, compliance with award terms and conditions and compliance with legal requirements, including those related to national security.

If the agency determines a project meets “Standards,” then those projects will proceed. If it is determined that projects do not meet Standards, DOE warns that it may modify the project but that it may also terminate the project.

Finally, the agency warns, “if a recipient of financial assistance fails to respond to information requests within the provided timeframe, does not respond to follow-up questions in a timely manner, or offers incomplete responses that do not reasonably facilitate DOE’s review, DOE may treat as the recipient’s refusal to cooperate as grounds for termination of the award or the withholding of funding.”

This new policy paves the way for DOE to terminate funding agreements without having to rely on conclusory assertions that the agreement or program no longer meets agency priorities. With this policy, the DOE presumably hopes to establish an administrative record that fortifies its defense against any challenges to terminations.

As this process unfolds, it will be important for recipients to fully participate in whatever audits or information requests occur. They also should focus on creating an administrative record that includes all available information supporting an argument that the termination is contrary to DOE priorities or otherwise unreasonable/contrary to law.

LENEXA, KAN. (MAY 23, 2025) – The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the selection of $267 million in Brownfields Grants to communities across the United States, with nearly $4 million going to selectees in Kansas.

These grants put the Agency’s commitment to protect human health and the environment into action, while remaining good stewards of tax dollars and advancing policies to energize the economy.

“The $267 million in Brownfield Grants will transform contaminated properties into valuable spaces for businesses and housing, creating new opportunities that strengthen local economies and directly benefit American families,” said EPA Administrator Zeldin. “EPA’s Brownfields program demonstrates how environmental stewardship and economic prosperity complement each other. Under President Trump’s leadership, EPA is Powering the Great American Comeback, ensuring our nation has the cleanest air, land, and water while supporting sustainable growth and fiscal responsibility.”

“EPA Region 7 is proud to work with our partners across the state of Kansas, advancing cooperative federalism and empowering local and state partners to take the lead in revitalizing their communities,” said EPA Region 7 Administrator Jim Macy. “This collaborative approach ensures fiscal responsibility, promotes economic development, and transforms potentially contaminated properties into clean, usable land that supports long-term growth and sustainability.”

“The Community Wide Assessment Grant for State and Tribal will help increase property values and create jobs across Kansas,” said Kansas Department of Health and Environment Secretary Janet Stanek. “Receiving these substantial dollars to support the redevelopment of brownfields throughout the state not only benefits the environment, but it elevates communities and industries by turning underutilized and vacant properties into productive ones. This is a win for the entire state.”

""The City of Beloit is incredibly grateful and excited to receive EPA Brownfield Cleanup funding. This funding enables our community to repurpose two vacant buildings into housing, a critical need in our rural community,” said Mitchell County Economic Development Director Emily Benedick . “This grant gives us the peace of mind to know we are providing a safe environment for future housing development.""

“I am grateful to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for awarding nearly $4 million to the Sunflower State,” said U.S. Senator Roger Marshall (KS). “This funding will help us revitalize our communities, create opportunities for growth, and protect Kansans’ health. Thanks to President Donald Trump’s leadership, the EPA is restoring American greatness by ensuring we have the cleanest air, land, and water while being good stewards of American taxpayer dollars.”

“These investments through the bipartisan infrastructure law are a win for Kansas communities – turning long-abandoned, contaminated sites into clean, usable spaces that can spur economic growth,” said U.S. Representative Sharice Davids (KS-03). “By supporting local cleanup and redevelopment efforts, we’re protecting public health, revitalizing neighborhoods, and helping lay the groundwork for future opportunity.”

The following organizations in Kansas have been selected to receive EPA Brownfields funding:

The City of Beloit has been selected to receive $418,620. Grant funds will be used to clean up the Kansas Industrial School Campus, located at 1720 N. Hersey Avenue. The 0.8-acre cleanup site operated as a juvenile detention center for girls and has been vacant since 2009. It is contaminated with inorganic contaminants. Grant funds also will be used to conduct community engagement activities.

The Flint Hills Regional Council has been selected to receive $1 million. The grant will be used to capitalize a revolving loan fund (RLF), from which Flint Hills Regional Council Inc. will provide up to three loans and up to two subgrants to support cleanup activities. Grant funds also will be used to establish the RLF, market the program, and support community engagement activities. RLF activities will focus on Chase, Geary, Lyon, Morris, Pottawatomie, Riley, and Wabaunsee counties, with a focus on the cities of Herington, Junction City, and Manhattan.

The Kansas Department of Health and Environment has been selected to receive $2 million. Community-wide grant funds will be used to conduct 116 Phase I and Phase II environmental site assessments. Grant funds also will support the development of at least three cleanup plans and at least one community meeting annually, with each community to provide general updates on the grant. The target area for this grant includes the Oak Grove neighborhood in Kansas City and the cities of Eureka and El Dorado. Priority sites include Land Bank properties in Oak Grove; a former horse racetrack, a former nursing home, sites adjacent to the existing fire department to accommodate its expansion, Memorial Hall, and the former Masonic Lodge in Eureka; and the Grizzly Development in El Dorado.

The City of Topeka has been selected to receive $500,000. Community-wide grant funds will be used to conduct eight Phase I and three Phase II environmental site assessments. Grant funds also will be used to inventory brownfield sites and support reuse planning and community engagement activities. The target area for this grant is the City of Topeka. Priority sites include the 36-acre, former White Lakes Mall and two former schools.

Federal grant recipients must satisfy legal and administrative requirements to receive funds from EPA.

Brownfields Assessment, Revolving Loan Fund, and Cleanup Grants include:

~$121.8 million for 148 selectees for Assessment Grants, which will provide funding for brownfield inventories, planning, environmental assessments, and community outreach.

~$88.2 million for 51 selectees for Cleanup Grants, which will provide funding to carry out cleanup activities at brownfield sites owned by the recipient.

$15 million for 15 selectees for Revolving Loan Fund grants, which will provide funding for recipients to offer loans and subgrants to carry out cleanup activities at brownfield sites.

Brownfields Supplemental Revolving Loan Fund Grants include:

$42 million for 34 high-performing recipients to help communities continue their work to carry out cleanup and redevelopment projects on contaminated brownfield properties. Supplemental funding for Revolving Loan Fund Grants is available to recipients that have depleted their funds and have viable cleanup projects ready for work.

Background

EPA’s Brownfields program began in 1995 and has provided nearly $2.9 billion in Brownfield Grants to assess and clean up contaminated properties and return blighted properties to productive reuse. To date, brownfields investments leveraged over $42 billion in cleanup and redevelopment. Over the years, the relatively small investment of federal funding was able to leverage over 220,500 jobs from both public and private sources.

We’re seeing policies change for the worse, funding cuts, and layoffs. The planetary consequences are real, but there’s also an enormous human impact on all the people who have made working on the transition either their vocation or avocation.

You can make your own list of recent harms, but here are a few:

The US House of Representatives’ passage of a terrible bill that would eviscerate clean energy industries

Executive orders targeting every aspect of clean energy – electricity generation, gas/oil exploitation, clean transportation, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (which is key to a clean energy transition)

Attacks on the rights of states to take action on climate

Layoffs in the offshore wind industry, thanks to executive orders about permitting future and existing projects

Layoffs at the federal Department of Energy (DOE) and Environmental Protection Agency, and basically thedisappearance of the Joint Office on Energy & Transportation

Rescissions of loans made by DOE’s Loan Program Office for cutting-edge new programs and projects

Rescissions of grants already contracted between the federal government and grantees – state, local, for-profit, and nonprofit; There have been so many, but one that stands out is the administration’s freezing of $20 billion appropriated for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (i.e. Green Bank). This has caused layoffs in several places, including at Rewiring America, one of our partners and a leading organization promoting electrification as a cornerstone of the clean energy transition.

Some of the moves are so obviously illegal that one can only assume that they are intended to intimidate and create enough uncertainty to squelch further investment in clean energy. We cannot let that happen.

It’s not just about layoffs.

Green Energy Consumers recently had a job opening for an entry-level position. We received 230 applications. Most were excellent candidates by virtue of their resumes, many were overqualified. Almost unanimously, their cover letters expressed great hope and enthusiasm. We tried to narrow the list down through phone screens and that helped a little, but the candidates were as impressive on the calls as they were on paper. We asked several to write essays about the blogs we post – but the essays were great, too. So, we interviewed a lot – far more than normal. And we diligently checked references before making our selection. The point of this story is that we probably could have put the top 25 candidates in a hat and picked out someone who could do the job well. We wish we could have hired several, and we will if we can raise some more money.

This vignette makes us both sad for the applicants and hopeful for clean energy and society as a whole. There are way more good people looking to create a just transition than the few powerful folks at the top of their corporate empires looking to deceive and delay. We wrote recently about how we can’t afford to ‘other’ when it comes to climate impacts, but in this case, we’re comfortable saying that there are far more of “us” than there are of “them.” To paraphrase a song, each of us is a drop of rain, but together we are a hurricane.

What does solidarity mean in this context?

We have to be empathetic to all those excellent public servants and private sector professionals who have lost their jobs or might soon. And the communities that will face dirtier water, dirtier air, and worse health outcomes as a result of all of these federal actions.

But we can do more than that. If we do our jobs in clean energy well, we can hasten the day when they can return to the cause. While our minds are going haywire over all the chaos, we have an obligation to be as productive as we can, to achieve our corporate or organizational goals, and to be as efficient as possible so that we can grow or at least have staying power. The better we perform, the faster we can bring our friends back. Those of us who are still getting paid to work or have the ability to volunteer on the energy transition are fortunate and must not take it for granted.

What does perseverance look like?

The actions we’re seeing at the federal level are intended to intimidate. The people benefiting from our society’s reliance on fossil fuels want us to feel confused, overwhelmed, and scared, so that we stop doing the work we’re doing. How do we persevere in the fact of these tactics? We rely on each other and we take firm action where we can to mitigate all the bad stuff coming out of Washington. For some groups, it’s about legal defense. For others, particularly Green Energy Consumers Alliance, it’s simply about doing our job and staying true to our mission of speeding a just transition to clean energy by working at the state level. There is so much to be done in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and every state in the country. Our leaders in State Houses might get a little weak in the knees as a result of losing federal support, so we have to prop them up.

Res.88, a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution of disapproval to repeal the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) December 2024 approval of California’s Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II) program, which includes the state’s zero emission vehicle (ZEV) mandates that ban sales of new gas- and diesel-powered cars and pickups. This is wonderful news for automobile consumers, the US auto industry, and all liberty-loving Americans.

The House on May 1 voted 246-164 for the resolution. The measure now goes to President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it into law. This sequence of events will accomplish a sea-change in US public policy.

Aided and abetted by the Obama and Biden administrations, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) was on its way to becoming the nation’s de facto Industrial Policy Czar for Climate and Cars. Moreover, California and its blue state allies were poised to exert cartel-like market power over the auto industry, increasing vehicle prices and decreasing consumer choices beyond their borders.

The CRA provides an expedited process for the House and Senate to overturn agency rules. Critically, CRA resolutions cannot be filibustered in the Senate, requiring only a simple majority of 51 votes for passage. Once an agency rule has been overturned by an enacted CRA resolution, the rule “may not be reissued in substantially the same form.” Nor can litigants rescue a CRA-repealed rule, because CRA resolutions are exempt from judicial review. In the words of those adorable Munchkins, a rule killed by the CRA is “really most sincerely dead.”

Over the past several weeks, Democratic leaders avoided debating the legal and policy arguments against California’s gas-car ban. Instead, they argued that the EPA’s waiver of Clean Air Act (CAA) preemption for the ACC II program is not a “rule” for CRA purposes. My colleague Daren Bakst succinctly explained the common sense of the matter in a recent coalition letter signed by 56 organizations:

The waivers are exactly the type of agency actions that Congress envisioned would be addressed under the CRA: generally applicable policies affecting the rights or obligations of non-agency parties. The waiver for the car ban, for example, will directly affect tens of millions of people and possibly the entire country. It is hard to imagine anything more generally applicable.

The remainder of this post delves into core legal issues Senate Democrats studiously avoided. Here is the big picture in a nutshell. The Obama and Biden administrations collaborated with the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to defy Congress’s express, broad, and categorical preemption of state laws or regulations “related to” to fuel economy standards. Thursday’s vote in the Senate vote positions President Trump to terminate that mischief.

ACC II: Unlawful under the nation’s fuel economy statute

Although the ACC II program does not include any new tailpipe carbon dioxide (CO2) emission standards for combustion engine vehicles, it leaves intact the tailpipe CO2 standards from the first Advanced Clean Car (ACC) program, for which the EPA granted waivers in 2013 and 2022. The major threat to vehicle affordability, automotive choice, and auto industry viability comes from the ACC and ACC II ZEV mandates. The original ACC required that about 15 percent of new passenger cars and pickups in California be electric vehicles (EVs) by 2025 (78 FR 2112, 2114). ACC II requires all sales of new light duty vehicle sales in the state to be EVs by 2035.

As explained in painstaking detail by the Trump administration’s September 2019 One Program Rule, also known as Part I of the Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient Vehicles Rule (SAFE 1), California’s tailpipe CO2 emission standards and ZEV mandates are preempted by Section 32919(a) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), the nation’s fuel economy statute.

EPCA Section 32919(a) states:

When an average fuel economy standard prescribed under this chapter is in effect, a State or a political subdivision of a State may not adopt or enforce a law or regulation related to fuel economy standards or average fuel economy standards for automobiles covered by an average fuel economy standard under this chapter.

EPCA preemption is clear, sweeping, and categorical. The preemption is expressly stated. It applies to state policies merely “related to” fuel economy standards. It allows no exceptions, not even for state regulations identical to federal fuel economy standards. Moreover, neither NHTSA nor any other agency may waive EPCA preemption. Thus, EPCA 32919(a) is not a “general rule of preemption” requiring subsequent regulatory adjudication to fine tune the boundaries of permissible state action. It is absolute and definitive (83 FR 42986, 43233).

Federal preemption statutes derive their authority from the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution (Article VI, Clause 2), which states:

This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.

As the Supreme Court explained in Maryland v. Louisiana (1981), “It is basic to this constitutional command that all conflicting state provisions be without effect.” That means any conflicting state policy is void ab initio—from the moment the policy is adopted or enacted, not when a court later declares it so (Ninth Circuit, Cabazon Band of Mission Ind. v. City of Indio (1982)).

Tailpipe CO2 standards are directly (i.e., physically and mathematically) “related to” fuel economy standards. An automobile’s CO2 emissions per mile are directly proportional to its fuel consumption per mile. Consequently, tailpipe standards calibrated in grams CO2 per mile converts mathematically into Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards calibrated in miles per gallon. If an agency regulates tailpipe CO2 emissions, it also regulates fuel economy, and vice versa (84 FR 51310, 51313). That is because tailpipe CO2 emissions and fuel economy are “two sides (or, arguably, the same side) of the same coin” (83 FR 42986, 44327).

It was only because of such mathematical convertibility that the Obama administration EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) could boast, in their May 2010 joint rule establishing tailpipe CO2 and CAFE standards for model year 2012-2016 light-duty vehicles, that they had achieved a “harmonized and consistent National Program.”

The EPA and NHTSA concisely explained the “very direct and close” relationship (75 FR 25324, 25327) between their respective standards:

The National Program is both needed and possible because the relationship between improving fuel economy and reducing CO2 tailpipe emissions is a very direct and close one. The amount of those CO2 emissions is essentially constant per gallon combusted of a given type of fuel. Thus, the more fuel-efficient a vehicle is, the less fuel it burns to travel a given distance. The less fuel it burns, the less CO2 it emits in traveling that distance. While there are emission control technologies that reduce the pollutants (e.g., carbon monoxide) produced by imperfect combustion of fuel by capturing or converting them to other compounds, there is no such technology for CO2. Further, while some of those pollutants can also be reduced by achieving a more complete combustion of fuel, doing so only increases the tailpipe emissions of CO2. Thus, there is a single pool of technologies for addressing these twin problems, i.e., those that reduce fuel consumption and thereby reduce CO2 emissions as well (emphases added).

The two types of standards will remain mathematically convertible as long as affordable and practical onboard carbon capture technologies do not exist (71 FR 17566,17670). Since the start of the CAFE program in 1975 and for the foreseeable future, all design and technology options for reducing tailpipe CO2 emissions from combustion-engine vehicles, such as aerodynamic streamlining, low rolling resistance tires, and hybridization, are fuel-saving strategies by another name.

The Congress that enacted EPCA in 1975 understood the scientific relationship between CO2 emissions and fuel economy. That is why it approved the EPA’s procedure of testing automotive fuel economy by measuring tailpipe emissions of carbon-based compounds, chiefly CO2 (EPCA Section 503(d)(1)).

While ZEV mandates do not have a direct (one-to-one) relationship to fuel economy standards, they are nonetheless substantially related. Fuel economy standards are fleet-average standards. During the first 21 years of the California ZEV program (1990-2011), ZEV market share in California remained under 1 percent of new vehicle sales, so had negligible impacts on fleet-average fuel economy.

However, as ZEV mandates tighten, fleet-average fuel consumption per mile decreases, and fleet-average fuel economy increases. Conversely, when fuel economy standards (or their CO2-tailpipe equivalents) reach a certain stringency, automakers cannot comply without selling more EVs and fewer combustion engine vehicles. For example, the stringent implicit fuel economy standards in the EPA’s April 2024 vehicle emissions rule is projected to restrict non-electric vehicle sales to less than one-third of the new car market by 2032 (89 FR 27842-27856). Because ZEV mandates are substantially related to fuel economy standards, EPCA also expressly preempts state ZEV programs.

Furthermore, EPCA impliedly preempts state policies regulating or prohibiting tailpipe CO2 emissions because such policies interfere with the CAFE program in three main ways.

First, California’s policies revise regulatory determinations Congress authorized NHTSA to make. EPCA expressly requires NHTSA to weigh and balance four factors when determining CAFE standards: technological feasibility, economic practicability, the effect of other federal emission standards on fuel economy, and the national need to conserve energy (49 U.S. Code § 32902). EPCA, as interpreted by DC Circuit case law, also directs NHTSA to consider the impact of fuel economy standards on occupant safety (CEI v. NHTSA, 1992). California is not bound by those factors and is free to subordinate them to climate ambition.

Only by sheer improbable accident would CARB, when prescribing tailpipe CO2 standards, balance such factors the same way NHTSA does when prescribing fuel economy standards. Indeed, there is no policy rationale for elevating CARB from fuel economy stakeholder to decisionmaker unless its technical assessments and regulatory priorities differ from NHTSA’s. As environmental attorney Marc Marie observes, when Congress directs an agency to balance specific decision criteria, state regulations that disturb that balance are impliedly preempted (Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 405 (2012)).

Second, California’s ZEV mandates conflict with the structure of the CAFE program. ZEV standards are technology-prescriptive, requiring automakers to sell increasing percentages of vehicles powered by batteries or fuel cells. CAFE standards are technology neutral. As the Obama administration EPA explained, under the CAFE program, manufacturers are “not compelled to build vehicles of any particular size or type.” Rather, each manufacturer has its own fleet-wide performance standard that “reflects the vehicles it chooses to produce.”

Third, EPCA as amended prohibits NHTSA from considering the fuel economy of alternative vehicles (49 U.S. Code § 32902), including EVs (49 U.S. Code § 32901), when setting CAFE standards. The amendment aims to ensure that CAFE standards never become so stringent manufacturers must sell EVs to comply (85 FR 24174, 25170). Mandating EV sales is the very purpose of the ZEV program, which logically culminates in banning combustion engine vehicles.

In short, California’s tailpipe CO2 standards and ZEV mandates are both expressly preempted by EPCA 32919(a) and impliedly preempted by their inherent conflicts with the statutory fuel economy program Congress established. Preemption statutes operate ab initio, which means EPCA voided California’s tailpipe CO2 standards and ZEV mandates years before the EPA agreed to review them. EPCA automatically turned those policies into legal phantoms—mere proposals without force or effect.

Fruit of a poisoned tree

Readers may wonder how CARB came to wield regulatory powers denied to it by Congress’s clear, broad, categorical preemption. The answer is a series of underhanded moves by the Obama and Biden administrations.

It all started in 2009, when EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson agreed to reconsider her predecessor Stephen Johnson’s denial of California’s request for a waiver to enforce CARB’s tailpipe CO2 standards of new cars and pickups, adopted pursuant to the state’s greenhouse gas motor vehicle statute, AB 1493. Jackson’s reconsideration raised the fearsome prospect of a patchwork-quilt of market-balkanizing fuel economy requirements. Why so?

As noted, tailpipe CO2 standards are implicit fleet-average fuel economy standards, and under CAA Section 177, other states can opt vehicle emission standards “identical” to those for which the EPA has granted a waiver under CAA Section 209(b). Each automaker typically sells a different mix of vehicles in each state because consumer preferences differ from state to state. Thus, to achieve the same average tailpipe CO2 emissions in two different states, automakers would have to reshuffle the mix of vehicles delivered for sale in those states. If all states were to adopt California’s standards, each automaker would potentially have to manage 50 separate fuel fleets—an extreme version of the market fragmentation Congress enacted EPCA 32919(a) to prevent.

Note, too, that the Obama administration confronted manufacturers with the patchwork peril during the Great Recession, when GM, Ford, and Chrysler tottered on the brink of bankruptcy. Then, in a maneuver resembling a protection racket, the administration made the industry an offer it could not refuse.

In closed-door, “put nothing in writing, ever” negotiations run by Obama climate czar Carol Browner, California and its state allies agreed to deem compliance with EPA’s forthcoming model year 2012-2016 tailpipe CO2 standards as compliance with their own. However, manufacturers, for their part, would have to pledge their support for the new “national” program administered by the EPA, NHTSA, and CARB. That included surrendering their due process rights under EPCA.

As memorialized in the same May 2010 joint rule acknowledging the “very direct and close” relationship between CAFE and tailpipe CO2 standards, automakers’ obligations included “not contesting the final GHG and CAFE standards for MYs 2012–2016, not contesting any grant of a waiver of preemption under the CAA for California’s GHG standards for certain model years, and to stay and then dismiss all pending litigation challenging California’s regulation of GHG emissions, including litigation concerning preemption under EPCA of California’s and other states’ GHG standards” (75 FR 25324, 25328).

For all we know, Browner also conditioned the availability of bailout money on automakers’ fealty to the so-called national program. As a House Government Oversight Committee report observed, “The negotiations on the 2009 auto industry bailout occurred simultaneously with the negotiations on the Model Year (MY) 2012 to 2016 fuel economy standards.”

However, EPCA 32919(a) was still in force. How then did NHTSA square California’s new role as de facto fuel economy regulator with EPCA preemption? About midway through the 405-page rule, we find this answer: “NHTSA is deferring further consideration of the preemption issue” (75 FR 25324, 25546).

Two years later, in the Obama administration’s 2012 joint rule establishing CO2/fuel economy standards for model year 2017-2025 light duty vehicles, NHTSA again announced it was “deferring consideration of the preemption issue” (77 FR 62624, 63147). NHTSA did not stop deferring until the Trump administration proposed the SAFE Rule in August 2018.

In both the 2010 and 2012 vehicle rules, NHTSA’s excuse for “deferring” was that “it is unnecessary to address the issue further at this time because of the consistent and coordinated Federal standards that will apply nationally under the National Program.”

But then, five years later, the Obama administration tossed consistency out the window. The 2012 rule required the agencies to conduct mid-term evaluations (MTEs) of their respective standards for model years 2022-2025 light duty vehicles. The MTEs were to be completed “concurrently” “in order to align the agencies proceedings’ for MYs 2022-2025 and to maintain a joint national program” (77 FR 62624, 62784). The plan, posted on NHTSA’s Website, was for the EPA to publish its draft MTE in mid-summer 2017 and finalize it by April 1, 2018 deadline specified in the rule.

However, when Trump won the November 2016 election, the EPA rushed out a proposed MTE on November 30, and then finalized it in January 2017, just in time to confront the incoming Trump administration with a regulatory fait accompli. This precluded meaningful coordination with NHTSA, scuttling the “harmonized, consistent national program.”

The Trump administration’s April 2020 SAFE Rule put the band back together, promulgating coordinated and consistent tailpipe CO2 and CAFE standards for model year 2021-2026 light duty vehicles.

However, the Biden administration dismantled the revived national program by adopting EPA tailpipe CO2 standards for model year 2023-2026 light duty vehicles in December 2021 (86 FR 74434, 74493) and model year 2027-2032 LDVs in April 2024 (89 FR 27842, 27856) that “necessitate” ZEV sales. Those standards are increasingly inconsistent with NHTSA’s CAFE standards.

At the risk of belaboring the obvious, CARB’s ZEV mandates are manifestly not “harmonized, consistent, and coordinated with” NHTSA’s CAFE standards.

The point here is that even if “consistent and coordinated federal standards” that “apply nationally” render EPCA preemption an “unnecessary” consideration, as the 2010 and 2012 rules contend, Democratic administrations scuttled the so-called national program not once but twice.

Trashing SAFE I

In the Trump administration’s September 2019 SAFE 1 Rule, NHTSA determined that EPCA 32919(a) preempts California’s tailpipe CO2 standards and ZEV mandates. The EPA, partly in affirmation of NHTSA’s preemption analysis, but also because vehicular CO2 emissions in California have no relevance to the state’s air quality challenges, withdrew the 2013 EPA waiver for California’s ACC program, including its ZEV mandates for model year 2017-2025 motor vehicles.

The Biden administration EPA could not reinstate the EPA waiver for the ACC program, much less grant a waiver for ACC II, without repealing SAFE 1. Accordingly, one might suppose the Biden administration would present a detailed rebuttal of SAFE 1’s preemption argument.

However, that is not what the Biden administration did. Rather, NHTSA’s December 2021 SAFE 1 Repeal Rule simply “withdraws” SAFE 1’s preemption analysis without rebutting or even summarizing it.

Yes, NHTSA acknowledged EPCA 32919(a) preempts state laws or regulations “related to” fuel economy standards but professed agnosticism about which types of state standards might be “related.” As if the agency had not been administering the EPCA program for the previous 46 years.

Indeed, NHTSA even acknowledged the agency had interpreted EPCA preemption along the lines of SAFE 1 in its 2006 (71 FR 17566, 17654-17670) and 2003 (68 FR 16868, 16896) CAFE standards rulemakings. But here too, NHTSA announced it was “withdrawing” those views without summarizing them or explaining why it no longer considered them valid.

This peculiar behavior is not hard to explain. The proposition that policies regulating or prohibiting tailpipe CO2 emissions are directly or substantially related to fuel economy standards is very close to being self-evident. The mind assents as soon as it understands the terms in which the proposition is framed.

The SAFE 1 Repeal Rule was a travesty of reasoned decision making. The agency was tied to a position it could not defend by an agenda (forced national vehicle electrification) it could not admit.

Unlawful ACC II waiver

In its December 2024 ACC II waiver decision, the EPA takes the position that the agency may not—or at least need not—consider EPCA preemption when reviewing California’s request for a waiver of Clean Air Act preemption (pp. 51, 179-180).

According to the EPA, its sole job under CAA 209(b) is to grant the waiver unless it makes one or more of three judgments: (A) California’s determination that its standards in the aggregate are at least as protective as federal standards is arbitrary and capricious, (B) the state does not need such standard to “meet compelling and extraordinary conditions,” or (C) such standards are inconsistent with CAA Section 202(a) requirements for adopting and enforcing federal vehicle emission standards. Thus, the EPA contends, it may not, or not need, consider any legal factors other than the three decision criteria specified in 209(b). That is incorrect.

Statutory construction is a holistic endeavor. As the Supreme Court stated in Food and Drug Administration v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. (2000):

It is a “fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.” Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803, 809 (1989). A court must therefore interpret the statute “as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme,” Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 569 (1995), and “fit, if possible, all parts into a harmonious whole,” FTC v. Mandel Brothers, Inc., 359 U. S. 385, 389 (1959).

A proper reading of CAA 209(b) must consider other parts of the CAA that provide context and shape its role in the overall statutory scheme. A relevant provision is CAA Section 110, which sets forth the requirements for State Implementation Plans (SIPs) under the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) program.

When repealing its portion of SAFE 1, NHTSA repeatedly invoked the “federalism interests” of California and other states seeking to incorporate ZEV mandates into their SIPs. The EPA’s ACC II waiver decision document makes the same argument (p. 181).

And there’s the rub. CAA Section 110(a)(2)(E) states that each SIP “shall … provide necessary assurances” the state is “not prohibited by any provision of Federal or State law from carrying out such implementing the plan or portion thereof.” The EPA is responsible for reviewing SIPs and approving or rejecting SIP elements. Therefore, when the EPA reviews a waiver request under CAA 209(b), it may not turn a blind eye to potential conflicts between SIP elements contained in the waiver request and other federal statutes. It may not ignore EPCA 32919(a), which expressly and impliedly prohibits California’s ZEV mandates.

Conclusion

Years of regulatory evasion, prevarication, and usurpation propped up California’s automotive central planning ambitions for many years. The House and Senate’s CRA votes upend this unlawful power grab that threatened to price millions of Americans out of the market for new cars, undermine US automakers’ competitiveness by forcing them to discontinue many of their best-selling models, and rob Americans of their freedom to purchase the types of vehicles that best meet their needs.

It is now President Trump’s turn to deliver the coup de grace. Restoring the rule of law in the US automotive sector will foster more competitive manufacturers, happier consumers, and a freer society.",https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1972985806-1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 22:03:07.055262

Citizens’ Climate Lobby is deeply disappointed to see that the House passed legislation that would gut America’s clean energy tax credits.

Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, these clean energy tax credits have spurred private investment, lowered energy costs, and created high-quality jobs — especially in manufacturing and construction. These credits help attract billions of dollars in clean energy projects to communities across the country, revitalizing local economies and positioning the U.S. as a global leader in the clean energy transition.

CCL’s grassroots volunteers have worked hard in recent months to convey these benefits to Republican representatives, and our efforts succeeded in supporting dozens of Republicans to speak up for the tax credits throughout the negotiations.

Unfortunately, the pull of partisanship is incredibly strong during a budget reconciliation process, and nearly every House member voted along party lines.

But CCL’s work to defend these tax credits isn’t over. We urge each Senator to recognize the vast benefits these tax credits bring to their state, and to preserve the clean energy tax credits in the Senate version of the legislation.

The online event — “Powering Kentucky’s Economic Development” — focused on current industrial development trends, the state of Kentucky’s power grid and strategies to promote economic growth through sound energy policies.

“The current state of Kentucky’s power grid is fragile, and we need to continue to focus on adding capacity,” said Sen. Mills, the keynote speaker. “I think that everybody is slowly awakening to what people in the power industry have known for years — that there is going to be a stranglehold on energy if we continue down the path of ideology versus practicality in electric generation.”

Panelists for the event included the following Kentucky energy and economic development experts:

– Tony Campbell – President/CEO, East Kentucky Power Cooperative

– Don Gulley – President/CEO, Big Rivers Electric Corporation

– Missy Vanderpool – Executive Director, Henderson Economic Development

– Chris Girdler – President/CEO, Somerset-Pulaski Economic Development Authority

Campbell and Gulley explained the vital importance of a long-term, coordinated energy policy among federal, state and local partners for power providers.

“Electric reliability and affordability are the cornerstone of economic development,” said Campbell. “We’re seeing unprecedented grid load growth, and if we don’t have reliable and affordable power, it’s going to impact economic development.”

“I’m so appreciative of the support that Kentucky elected officials are giving to prioritizing reliability and dispatchable energy — because that’s the only way we’re going to continue to power economic development,” said Gulley.

Vanderpool and Girdler emphasized the pivotal role that an abundant, stable power supply plays in regional economic development efforts.

“Collaboration is key to every project that we pursue,” said Vanderpool. “When it comes to economic development, we can sell our communities; but before we get the opportunity to sell our communities, we have to make sure that we have the energy infrastructure.”

“All of our work toward comprehensive economic development — industrial, commercial and retail recruitment, arts and entertainment, education, workforce development and tourism — is for naught, if we do not have dependable, reliable and affordable power,” said Girdler.

Dependable Power First Kentucky is a statewide coalition working to promote a reliable, resilient, and affordable electricity supply for all Kentuckians by bringing together diverse stakeholders from across the state to shift the conversation around reliability and support policies that achieve this goal.

It is a breakthrough that could advance the potential for more efficient and scalable power generation using sCO2, which is a technology that harnesses the unique properties of CO2 in a supercritical state to improve energy transfer.

While conducting material testing for a high-pressure, high-temperature sCO2 turbine, SwRI achieved conditions of 1,150°C at 300-bar. Before this, the highest recorded pressure and temperature for sCO2 was 800°C at 300-bar. The oxy-fuel turbine was designed to operate at a maximum temperature of 1,150°C.

To achieve these higher temperatures, the research team had to overcome major challenges associated with the extreme conditions needed to keep CO2 in a supercritical state.

“We assessed the performance of different materials and coatings under extreme conditions,” said Dr Florent Bocher of SwRI.

He explained that the team aimed to build a vessel to test materials at the highest temperatures and pressures based on the turbine design.

“The mechanical properties of the vessel materials decline as temperatures rise. This makes it impossible to safely use a traditional high-pressure and high-temperature experimental setup, which uses external heating.”

To achieve the necessary conditions, the team modified an autoclave – a sealed container typically used for sterilising materials under pressure – by installing an induction coil. This kept the vessel’s exterior cool while allowing the interior to reach the required temperatures.

“This new capability is crucial for both current and future research areas and technologies that demand extreme testing conditions,” said Bocher.

The extreme conditions needed to keep CO2 in its supercritical state put immense stress on materials used in the construction and operation of the power plant, particularly in turbines.

High temperatures and high pressures can impact the materials through mechanical stress, and CO2 – although not corrosive when in its normal gaseous or liquid states – can interact with impurities like water and oxygen when supercritical. These contaminants can form carbonic acid, which is highly corrosive.

This technology is likely to prove useful in testing materials for other extreme applications, such as molten salt energy production and storage, as well as hypersonics research.

The $6.4m project, funded by the US Department of Energy, is focused on designing an oxy-fuel turbine for a direct-fired sCO2 power plant. This work serves as a key step in developing the turbine for a planned sCO2 demonstration facility.

In contrast, the $170m, 10-megawatt sCO2 demonstration facility is a separate project underway at SwRI, which will serve as a larger-scale application of this technology.

In addition to SwRI’s demonstration projects, major energy companies and research institutions worldwide are exploring sCO2 systems, including projects like the 50-megawatt Allam Cycle plant in the UK and an initiative led by NET Power in the US that promises to generate power from natural gas with zero emissions and no water usage.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2025/05/shutterstock_2462578741.jpg",N,,2025-05-23 20:06:26.500691

Campbell coal plant to remain open past its planned retirement.

Since coming into office, Donald Trump has weakened domestic energy production by pausing all wind energy projects and proposing to slash hundreds of clean energy projects in the U.S.

In 2021, the J.H. Campbell plant’s parent company Consumers Energy announced plans to retire the plant. After a lengthy and robust review process, the Michigan Public Service Commission approved this retirement in 2022. Both Consumers Energy and MPSC have confirmed repeatedly that the retirement will not affect reliability in the plant’s service region.

According to the Clean Air Task Force’s Toll from Coal dashboard, the J.H. Campbell plant that the administration wants to extend is responsible for 44 premature deaths and 455 asthma attacks every year. On top of the drastic health consequences, customers in the region will also have to pay more on their utility bills to cover the costs to keep the plant operational.

In response, Sierra Club Senior Attorney Greg Wannier issued the following statement:

“Donald Trump invoking the Federal Power Act is an illegal abuse of his presidential authority. Coal is expensive, outdated, and deadly, and all of the relevant parties, including MISO, the grid operator ultimately responsible for keeping the lights on in Michigan, concluded years ago that J.H. Campbell could retire without causing any grid reliability problems. Consumers Energy is right to finally retire this hugely expensive plant that is costing Michiganders their lives.

“If Trump’s made-up energy emergency had an ounce of truth to it, he wouldn’t be banning wind energy and cancelling renewable energy projects. This so-called energy emergency is a sham and we will not stand by and let this administration prop up a dying industry so Trump’s fossil fuel buddies can make more money at the expense of Americans.”

Sierra Club Michigan Campaign Organizer Bryan Smigielski added:

“Michigan’s decision to close Campbell came after years of rigorous analysis by local experts and regulators and extensive public input. The results were clear: retirement is the best path to cleaner air and water, lower costs, and real economic growth.

“This blatant act of federal overreach—forcing the plant to stay online—is being imposed against the wishes of Michigan consumers, businesses, regulators, and elected leaders. Don’t be fooled: there is no ‘energy emergency’ here—just a payday for the coal industry that leaves us with higher bills and dirtier air.”

Shannon Fisk, Earthjustice Attorney and Director of State Electric Sector Advocacy, added:

“The Campbell plant was scheduled to retire in 8 days as part of a well-thought out plan to ensure reliability and protect the wallets and lungs of Michiganders. Such plan was agreed to by the utility, energy regulators, the state Attorney General, and numerous other stakeholders. This last-minute outside interference by the Trump Administration is unnecessary, unreasonable, and would require utility customers to foot the bill for the administration’s ideological agenda.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-23 20:06:31.451854

The moves were thorough and unambiguous. The Senate sank California’s effort to remove gasoline-powered cars from its roads within a decade, while the House in its budget reconciliation bill erased nearly every special treatment that Democrats created a few years ago to make EVs easier to buy or manufacture.

It could not be a starker turn from four years ago, when then-new President Joe Biden made EVs the centerpiece of his efforts to create jobs, fight climate change and combat China.

Reactions to Congress’ actions revealed how divisive federal support for EVs has become. Republicans see the government picking winners, while Democrats see a crucial nation-building tool — and both sides claim their approach is best for countering China’s rise.

Ben Prochazka, the executive director of the Electrification Coalition, a nonprofit that promotes EVs, said in a statement that the House’s bill “takes a sledgehammer to the U.S. EV industry and undermines efforts to build robust, secure and reliable access to critical minerals.”

Meanwhile, two oil and gas industry groups, the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers and the American Petroleum Institute, issued a joint statement calling the Senate’s vote “a victory for American consumers, manufacturers, and U.S. energy security.”

The Senate’s ending of the California clean-cars waiver also drew strong support from the auto industry, including parts makers and auto dealers. “Congress has safeguarded this important hub of innovation and American engineering prowess,” said the Specialty Equipment Market Association, which represents manufacturers of auto parts. It noted that a third of its members’ products are meant for internal-combustion engines.

While the GOP’s moves were decisive, they were not conclusive. The House’s giant bill faces a rewrite in the Senate, and the Senate’s killing of the waiver immediately drew a court challenge from California.

Nonetheless, the consequences could be profound for the trajectory of Americans’ EV adoption and of U.S. auto manufacturing. Observers of the EV market worry that Congress’ withdrawal of support at best discourages investment in EVs and at worst clears the field for China to further dominate advanced cars and their batteries.

“This market is less certain than it was a few days ago, and that’s going to be bad for investment,” said Nick Nigro, the founder of Atlas Public Policy, which studies EV trends.

The objectors cave

Ever since Trump returned to office with a united Republican Congress behind him, supporters of EVs have wondered: Could a small band of House Republicans buck their party and take a stand for the EV?

On Thursday, the answer came back with a resounding no.

Only two Republicans voted against the bill, which sought to removed virtually every stick and carrot to promote the electric vehicle, while adding a few penalties besides.

EV advocates had been hoping for a different outcome. The benefits of Biden’s policies, especially from the giant Inflation Reduction Act, spurred $208 billion of factory investment, the vast majority of it in Republican congressional districts.

Yet as the vote came in, it was clear that Republicans like Buddy Carter of Georgia, whose district includes Hyundai’s huge new EV plant outside Savannah, and Mark Amodei of Nevada, whose district encompasses a battery cluster around Reno, would not vote against the EV tax cuts, even though they threatened to do so last year.

Thursday “didn’t win the day for anyone to demonstrate that profile in courage,” said Nigro.

Other days are ahead: The Senate has members who are on the record in support of clean energy rules, including Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.).

What the House did

The House bill removed most of the incentives that Biden and a Democratic congress created in 2022 in the Inflation Reduction Act, while making the purchase of an EV more expensive than a comparable gasoline vehicle.

The actions are a reflection of the gulf between the Biden and Trump views of how to grow the U.S. auto industry. Biden focused on government incentives and regulations, while Trump has erected tariffs against foreign-made vehicles.

Biden’s approach was “more about manufacturing and trade policy, to get both domestic and foreign companies to build their supply chains in America,” said Loren McDonald, an analyst for Paren, an EV data consultancy.

Trump’s attitude is “the exact opposite,” McDonald added, “putting everyone in the penalty box with tariffs.”

The increase in price came in the form of a $250 fee to be assessed on an EV’s annual registration. Republicans say the fee is necessary to offset the fact that electric vehicles bypass gas stations and in doing so, don’t pay into the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded by taxes on sales of gasoline.

Hybrids would also pay a $100 fee, including milder hybrids that can’t plug into an electric socket.

The most well-known EV incentive, a $7,500 tax credit to buy a new EV, would sunset at the end of 2026, instead of 2032. Furthermore, the only vehicles that would be eligible are those from automakers that have not yet sold 200,000 EVs — a measure that would remove any car made by Tesla, General Motors and possibly Toyota, Nissan and Ford.

A $4,000 tax credit for buying a used EV also would go away by the end of this year, along with a $7,500 credit for businesses buying EVs as fleet vehicles.

Other sweeteners are less visible but key to the sprawling EV ecosystem. For example, one provision would end a tax credit that gives a substantial tax discount for homeowners and businesses that build charging stations. Another would end a program to fund electric heavy-duty trucks, and yet another halts billions of dollars that is underwriting a transition to electric goods movement at ports.

A modification to another part of the tax code, called 45x, might have immediate impacts on battery-makers and their suppliers, because it would drastically curtail their ability to use materials from China.

The House bill bars battery supplies from “foreign entities of concern,” a government classification of unsavory countries to trade with and that is designed to exclude China from benefiting from U.S. industry.

Republicans often criticize Biden’s EV policies for not fully slamming the door on Chinese inputs. The Inflation Reduction Act did close that door, but more slowly.

The Biden administration applied the limit by stepping down Chinese content over seven years and never cutting Chinese supply off completely. That was an acknowledgment of the fact that it is currently impossible to make a China-free battery.

China overwhelmingly controls the battery supply chain, from mines and chemical refineries to cathode materials and finished battery cells.

Senate wastes the waiver

Meanwhile, the Senate took the unprecedented step of tossing out a waiver that allowed California to set its own aggressive goals for EV adoption.

The 51-44 vote included all Republicans and one Democrat, Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.). The House voted to overturn the waiver earlier this month.

The vote was especially controversial because the Senate brushed aside both its own parliamentarian and the Government Accountability Office, both of which said that the body did not have the authority to overturn the rule.

Shortly after the Senate’s vote on Thursday, California said it would sue to save its waiver.

EPA has granted more than 75 clean-vehicle waivers to California since the relevant law passed in 1967, according to a tally by the Natural Resources Defense Council.

This waiver, for a program known as Advanced Clean Cars II, is the first to be overturned, alongside two others that reduce pollution from diesel trucks.

The waiver would have required 35 percent EV sales as of next year, by each automaker, a number that no state including California was close to achieving.

It was the growing gap between tepid EV sales and the ambitious California mandate that led to strenuous opposition from groups like the National Automobile Dealers Association.

“This unrealistic mandate, coupled with an insufficient and unreliable charging infrastructure, would have drastically reduced consumer choice and raised prices for new and used cars and trucks for all Americans,” the group said.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/a6/45/6f2cb1cc4147ac115eedd921a43b/u-s-congress-45581.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 20:07:36.185797

Now, those advocates and clean energy companies are gearing up for a fight in the Senate with a similar playbook — but there’s no guarantee that it’ll work this time either.

Defenders of the Democrats’ 2022 climate law are hoping senators — operating in different political realities than House members — will soften the rapid phase-outs and strict new requirements for the tax incentives.

“We’re going to urge our supporters in the Senate to make significant changes to this bill,” said Frank Macchiarola, Chief Advocacy Officer of the American Clean Power Association, a leading trade group. “We’re going to work with them to show the flaws in this legislation that the House passed.”

Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.), co-chair of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, helped lead an effort to protect the tax credits. After initial legislation emerged, he and others called for “thoughtful changes.” But the changes ended up being in the opposite direction.

As he left House Speaker Mike Johnson’s office Wednesday night as the latest version of the bill was taking shape, Garbarino said he was “not happy.” He ended up missing the vote but released a statement saying he would have been a “yes.”

The tax, energy and national security package proposes some of the most significant changes to energy policy in years. Senators on Thursday were still digesting the late-stage changes to the megabill.

It would eliminate “technology neutral” production and investment tax credits in 2028 for projects that have not started construction within 60 days of the law’s enactment. There are big exceptions for nuclear power and biofuels — both sectors with long-running GOP support.

While the renewable energy credits have fueled projects in Republican districts and states across the country, conservative hardliners are hellbent on finding savings. President Donald Trump has been adamant that the “Green New Scam,” as he calls it, be eliminated.

As such, the clean energy lobby has spent more than a year trying to cozy up to Republican lawmakers, contributing generously to their campaigns and targeting advertisements in red congressional districts.

But some observers stressed that the American Clean Power Association is still just a few years old, and that the groups, think tanks and nongovernmental organizations that helped pass the Inflation Reduction Act were ill-equipped to defend the climate law with Republicans and Trump officials.

Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), a former state utility regulator and informal adviser to the president, said on Thursday, “The IRA to some people is Joe Biden,” Cramer said. “But when I see IRA, I don’t think Joe Biden.”

Still, he suggested the House may have found the right balance between climate law defenders and its foes. “I think they did pretty well,” said Cramer.

Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah), who founded the Conservative Climate Caucus in the House, said Thursday he wanted to take a closer look at the incentives for the GOP-favored nuclear industry and left the door open to more tweaks.

“I don’t know where that lands,” he said of the final tax break language, stressing the importance of protecting business certainty. “Many of these things are very important to President Trump’s agenda, and included is that where is this power going to come from.”

‘Screaming and hollering’

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) has insisted his chamber would have a deliberative committee process to leave their imprint on the legislation. He told reporters Thursday that the Senate is “going to write our own bill.”

While some observers assume the clean energy sections will be modified, many are skeptical it would be a complete overhaul. After all, the deal struck in the House had the Trump stamp of approval and worked to balance fiercely opposed factions.

“I think it looks like some screaming and hollering right until the last minute and suddenly there will be 50 votes,” Cramer said. “And I would not expect anything less and would encourage it. And I don’t think anyone should give up on their ambitions until they have to — until they’re confronted with the binary moment.”

Moderates like Curtis and Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) have expressed reservations about gutting the IRA, but neither specified Thursday what they would change in the clean energy tax provisions.

Tillis, a Finance Committee member, expressed concern about potentially “devastating” businesses that have invested millions or billions of dollars, causing a “chilling effect” throughout the economy, but he also stressed fiscal prudence.

“We need to get closer to deficit neutrality,” he said. “And if you take a look at some of the production or investment tax credit policy, we need to look at it through a lense of a business person.”

ACP will be among the groups trying hard to influence Republican senators in the coming weeks. The group, born out of the defunct American Wind Power Association, has been working for years to woo Republicans.

But Trump and his allies have been deeply hostile to renewables, particularly wind. Asked about lessons learned, Macchiarola suggested it was too soon for such reflection.

“We certainly don’t do everything right all of the time,” he said. “But we do have the right message. And we do have the right messengers. The message is that clean energy tax incentives have provided enormous benefits for this country, both its energy security and its economic vitality. The messengers are twofold: the men and women who work in this industry every day to keep the lights on and power our lives and the consumers.”

Macchiarola said the group’s rough estimates were that the House bill would drive electricity bills up $400 per individual per year.

“We’ve put a lot of time and resources and our political capital as an industry into that message because it’s so critically important,” he said.

ACP has donated considerably to Republicans in recent years, including to Garbarino, who emerged as one of the leading House moderates signaling his support for parts of the climate law.

A 40-year-old lawmaker from a blue state, Garbarino earned praise Thursday from Johnson for his help during days of negotiations. Aside from the energy credits, Garbarino worked to raise limits on state and local tax dedications.

“My great friend Andrew played an essential role in negotiations among Members, and is a primary reason we were able to secure the deals which allowed us to pass our nation-shaping legislation this morning,” Johnson said.

A statement from Garbarino said, “I am proud to have been the leading voice on Long Island during negotiations on this key reconciliation bill. I fought to lift the cap on SALT and ensure hardworking Long Island families see the benefits of this important legislation.”

‘Not a good look’

Lawmakers like Garbarino and Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va.) fired off letters and statements this year and last urging leaders to protect at least some climate law credits. It was akin to a soft red line. But they never publicly threatened to tank the bill to get their way.

Republican lobbyist Mike McKenna had nothing but contempt for Garbarino’s efforts, saying the “pro-IRA caucus started its work with that embarrassing, nonsensical letter and wrapped up by having its lead dog basically taking a pee while the vote was going on.”

“Not a good look,” he said.

In recent months, ACP and the Solar Energy Industries Association tried to influence dozens of Republicans with fly-in days, bringing executives from hundreds of companies to Capitol Hill to talk to lawmakers about new battery factories or manufacturing plants employing their constituents. SEIA even passed around “American energy dominance” stickers, a clear nod to Trump.

But this week when ACP convened for its annual CleanPower conference in Phoenix, one attendee asked the chief advocacy officer on a panel why there weren’t phone booths all around so people could call their representatives, according to one person in attendance granted anonymity to speak freely. When asked about this exchange later, an ACP spokesperson noted that everyone there had a cellphone.

Jeff Navin, founder of consulting firm Boundary Stone, worried the clean energy industry would make the same mistake again.

“Here we are, the day of the passage, and I’m hearing a lot of people saying they felt confident things would be OK because of the letter Republicans sent,” he said. “They are now saying the exact same things in the Senate — that things are just automatically going to get better?”

Indeed, advocates and lobbyists say their messaging to lawmakers is unlikely to change in the Senate, even though their efforts in the House did not yield the results they had hoped for.

‘This fight is far from over’

Renewable energy boosters say the Senate, where members represent broader constituencies, is a different ball game.

“The Senate traditionally is a place where cooler heads prevail,” said Zach Friedman, senior director for federal policy at the sustainability group Ceres. “Being elected statewide and for six-year terms and larger staff, etc., senators look at this differently and we’re going to be continuing to educate folks.”

House passage means advocates can focus their pitches to senators on the impacts that particular provisions could have on business interests or electricity rates in their states, rather than on broad demands and hypotheticals.

“You can talk about the specifics of a billion-dollar project, an energy infrastructure project, that produces affordable, reliable, homegrown energy, and [how] that won’t happen” because of the phase-outs and restrictions that the House bill proposes, Friedman said.

The House’s legislation “is an effective way to freeze investment, and if folks want investment back home, then specific changes have to be made,” he said.

“This fight is far from over,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director at Advanced Energy United, a trade association. “And while it might not be visible at the moment, I think that profound frustration will continue to play out as this bill moves forward.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/64/1b/5704241a43daafcb065e406bc300/trump-congress-gaetz-05909.jpg,N,,2025-05-24 03:01:18.552851

The White House hopes to have three new experimental reactors by July 4th of next year.

The fourth Executive Order is focused on reinvigorating the U.S. nuclear industrial base, specifically expanding U.S. uranium mining and enriching capabilities.

The President also signed an Executive Order redefining standards for scientific research, criticizing past scientific basis.

“In recent decades, we've seen a decline in disruptive research, disruptive scientific patents and papers, diminishing returns on investments in biomedical research and serious cases of irreproducibility, fraud and misconduct in the scientific enterprise.""

“This EO sets out common sense, back to basics, principles any scientist will recognize, per the EO gold standard, science is defined as reproducible, transparent, transparent and falsifiable. It is subject to unbiased peer review, clear about errors and uncertainties, skeptical of assumptions, interdisciplinary and collaborative, accepting of negative results as positive outcomes and free from conflicts of interest.

Trump’s actions on nuclear energy come as the demand to power things like data centers and generative Artificial Intelligence have grown exponentially.

The third order will rehaul the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the independent federal agency charged with regulating the production of nuclear energy, as well as the building and maintaining of nuclear energy facilities. Specifically, Trump’s Executive Order will require the agency to make decisions on nuclear reactor licenses within 18 months, speeding up the timeline for nuclear reactors to be built. The White House hopes to have three new experimental reactors by July 4th of next year.

The fourth Executive Order is focused on reinvigorating the U.S. nuclear industrial base, specifically expanding U.S. uranium mining and enriching capabilities.

The President also signed an Executive Order redefining standards for scientific research, criticizing past scientific basis.

“In recent decades, we've seen a decline in disruptive research, disruptive scientific patents and papers, diminishing returns on investments in biomedical research and serious cases of irreproducibility, fraud and misconduct in the scientific enterprise.""

“This EO sets out common sense, back to basics, principles any scientist will recognize, per the EO gold standard, science is defined as reproducible, transparent, transparent and falsifiable. It is subject to unbiased peer review, clear about errors and uncertainties, skeptical of assumptions, interdisciplinary and collaborative, accepting of negative results as positive outcomes and free from conflicts of interest. President Trump is directing federal research agencies to incorporate gold standard science into their existing programs and activities,” said Kratsios.

Trump’s actions on nuclear energy come as the demand to power things like data centers and generative Artificial Intelligence have grown exponentially.

According to a new report by the International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental agency that provides policy recommendations, analysis and data on the global energy sector, data centers in the U.S. will account for nearly half of electricity demand growth between now and 2030.

A separate analysis by the sustainable energy publication “Joule” found that by the end of 2025, energy consumption by AI systems worldwide could approach up to 49% of total data center power consumption.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dc4983d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3845x2019+0+272/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2Fd7%2F6f%2F6e7be28a446bacdaf84f539c7f1d%2Fap25143660432436.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 22:03:37.650884

Tori Shivanandan, chief operating officer of Radiant Nuclear, a California-based startup, said the executive orders mark a “watershed moment” for nuclear power in the U.S., adding that Trump's support for the advanced nuclear industry will help ensure its success.","Washington — President Donald Trump signed executive orders Friday intended to quadruple domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, a goal experts say the United States is highly unlikely to reach.

To speed up the development of nuclear power, the orders grant the U.S. energy secretary authority to approve some advanced reactor designs and projects, taking authority away from the independent safety agency that has regulated the U.S. nuclear industry for five decades.

The order comes as demand for electricity surges amid a boom in energy-hungry data centers and artificial intelligence. Tech companies, venture capitalists, states and others are competing for electricity and straining the nation's electric grid.

“We’ve got enough electricity to win the AI arms race with China,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said. “What we do in the next five years related to electricity is going to determine the next 50"" years in the industry.

Still, it's unlikely the U.S. could quadruple its nuclear production in the time frame the White House specified. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two reactors, at a nuclear plant in Georgia, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.

The nation's 94 nuclear reactors supply about 19% of U.S. electricity, compared to about 60% for fossil fuels and 21% for renewables, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Trump is enthusiastic

At the Oval Office signing, Trump, surrounded by industry executives, called nuclear a “hot industry,” adding, ""It’s time for nuclear, and we’re going to do it very big.”

Burgum and other speakers said the industry has stagnated and has been choked by overregulation.

“Mark this day on your calendar. This is going to turn the clock back on over 50 years of overregulation of an industry,'' said Burgum, who chairs Trump's newly formed Energy Dominance Council.

The orders would reorganize the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission to ensure quicker reviews of nuclear projects, including an 18-month deadline for the NRC to act on industry applications. The measures also create a pilot program intended to place three new experimental reactors online by July 4, 2026 — 13 months from now — and invoke the Defense Production Act to allow emergency measures to ensure the U.S. has enough uranium and other reactor fuel for a modernized nuclear energy sector.

The orders also call for the Energy and Defense departments to assess the feasibility of restarting closed nuclear power plants and explore siting reactors on federal lands and military bases.

The NRC is assessing the executive orders and will comply with White House directives, spokesperson Scott Burnell said Friday.

Jacob DeWitte, chief executive officer of the nuclear energy company Oklo, brought a golf ball to the Oval Office. He told Trump that's the amount of uranium that can power someone’s needs for their entire life.

“It doesn’t get any better than that,” he said, holding up the ball.

“Very exciting indeed,” Trump said.

Trump has signed a spate of executive orders promoting oil, gas and coal that warm the planet when burned to produce electricity. Nuclear reactors generate electricity without emitting greenhouse gases. Trump said reactors are safe and clean, but did not mention climate benefits. Safety advocates warn that nuclear technology still comes with significant risks that other low-carbon energy sources don’t, including the danger of accidents or targeted attacks, and the unresolved question of how to store tens of thousands of tons of hazardous nuclear waste.

The order to reorganize the NRC will include significant staff reductions but is not intended to fire NRC commissioners who lead the agency. David Wright, a former South Carolina elected official and utility commissioner, chairs the five-member panel. His term ends June 30, and it is unclear if he will be reappointed.

Critics have trepidations

Critics say the White House moves could compromise safety and violate legal frameworks such as the Atomic Energy Act. Compromising the independence of the NRC or encouraging it to be circumvented could weaken the agency and make regulation less effective, said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

""Simply put, the U.S. nuclear industry will fail if safety is not made a priority,” he said.

Gregory Jaczko, who led the NRC under President Barack Obama, said Trump’s executive orders look like someone asked an AI chatbot, “How do we make the nuclear industry worse in this country?”

He called the orders a “guillotine to the nation’s nuclear safety system” that will make the country less safe, the industry less reliable and the climate crisis more severe.

A number of countries are speeding up efforts to license and build a new generation of smaller nuclear reactors to meet a surging demand for electricity and supply it carbon-free. Last year, Congress passed legislation that President Joe Biden signed to modernize the licensing of new reactor technologies so they can be built faster.

This month, the power company in Ontario, Canada, began building the first of four small nuclear reactors.

Valar Atomics is a nuclear reactor developer in California. Founder and CEO Isaiah Taylor said nuclear development and innovation in the United States has been slowed by too much red tape, while Russia and China are speeding ahead. He said he's most excited about the mandate for the Energy Department to speed up the pace of innovation.

The NRC is currently reviewing applications from companies and a utility that want to build small nuclear reactors to begin providing power in the early 2030s. Currently, the NRC expects its reviews to take three years or less.

Tori Shivanandan, chief operating officer of Radiant Nuclear, a California-based startup, said the executive orders mark a “watershed moment” for nuclear power in the U.S., adding that Trump's support for the advanced nuclear industry will help ensure its success.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/23/PDTN/83826142007-ap-25143680386068.jpg?crop=5851,3291,x0,y305&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-23 19:10:03.437169

According to a White House statement, Trump's directives ""will usher in a nuclear energy renaissance,"" in part by allowing Department of Energy laboratories to conduct nuclear reactor design testing, green-lighting reactor construction on federal lands, and lifting regulatory barriers ""by requiring the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to issue timely licensing decisions.""

The Trump administration is seeking to shorten the yearslong NRC process of approving new licenses for nuclear power plants and reactors to withinf 18 months.

""If you aren't independent of political and industry influence, then you are at risk of an accident.""

White House Office of Science and Technology Director Michael Kratsios said Friday that ""over the last 30 years, we stopped building nuclear reactors in America—that ends now.""

""We are restoring a strong American nuclear industrial base, rebuilding a secure and sovereign domestic nuclear fuel supply chain, and leading the world towards a future fueled by American nuclear energy,"" he added.

However, the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) warned that the executive orders will result in ""all but nullifying"" the NRC's regulatory process, ""undermining the independent federal agency's ability to develop and enforce safety and security requirements for commercial nuclear facilities.""

""This push by the Trump administration to usurp much of the agency's autonomy as they seek to fast-ttrack the construction of nuclear plants will weaken critical, independent oversight of the U.S. nuclear industry and poses significant safety and security risks to the public,"" UCS added.

Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the UCS, said, ""Simply put, the U.S. nuclear industry will fail if safety is not made a priority.""

""By fatally compromising the independence and integrity of the NRC, and by encouraging pathways for nuclear deployment that bypass the regulator entirely, the Trump administration is virtually guaranteeing that this country will see a serious accident or other radiological release that will affect the health, safety, and livelihoods of millions,"" Lyman added. ""Such a disaster will destroy public trust in nuclear power and cause other nations to reject U.S. nuclear technology for decades to come.""

Friday's executive orders follow reporting earlier this month by NPR that revealed the Trump administration has tightened control over the NRC, in part by compelling the agency to send proposed reactor safety rules to the White House for review and possible editing.

Allison Macfarlane, who was nominated to head the NRC during the Obama administration, called the move ""the end of independence of the agency.""

""If you aren't independent of political and industry influence, then you are at risk of an accident,"" Macfarlane warned.

On the first day of his second term, Trump also signed executive orders declaring a dubious ""national energy emergency"" and directing federal agencies to find ways to reduce regulatory roadblocks to ""unleashing American energy,"" including by boosting fossil fuels and nuclear power.

The rapid advancement and adoption of artificial intelligence systems is creating a tremendous need for energy that proponents say can be met by nuclear power. The Three Mile Island nuclear plant—the site of the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history—is being revived with funding from Microsoft, while Google parent company Alphabet, online retail giant Amazon, and Facebook owner Meta are among the competitors also investing in nuclear energy.

Speaking at the Energy Thought Summit at San Antonio's Boeing Tech Port Arena on May 22, Khalil Shalabi, Lower Colorado River Authority executive vice president for strategic initiatives and transformation, said electric utilities have gone through three paradigms, driven by technology and regulation.

""We spent 100 years with these big central stations as a traditional network,"" Shalabi said during a panel discussion entitled ""VPPs, AI and Storage: Which will save us, which will doom us?""

""Then in the 1990s, with a different regulatory model and coming up with a combined-cycle gas turbine type technology -- which has lower initial capital cost and high operating costs -- we were able to have all these deregulated markets, and that was the second phase,"" Shalabi added. ""The third phase was incentivizing a lot of renewables, right? Between that technology really advancing and regulatory models that allow it, that's the third one. Now we're struggling with building more resources in the fourth paradigm. I think the tech is advancing, but we're not seeing the sort of regulatory model that allows you to go into this kind of fourth paradigm. So I'm waiting for that.""

Moderator Brent Sitterly, founder and CEO of Fixed Point Analytics, a data management company, asked how the power sector can ""start to use VPPs, storage and AI to optimize our energy usage over time and do it in a way that prioritizes community?""

Using the 'most important asset'

Panelist Jeremy Adelman, manager of emerging technologies and innovation at Arizona's Tucson Electric Power, said utilities ""have moved from a one-way static valuation environment of our assets to a two-way dynamic valuation environment for our assets.""

""Everything has a market on the grid, even on the distribution level,"" Adelman said. ""We need to start to think about the value of our systems differently and more dynamically as a result of both the storage and the VPPs that go on top of them to optimize them on behalf of our customers. The other piece of that, then, is how do all of us as utilities continue to be on this journey of getting much, much better with bringing our customers into these conversations as the core of the system, right? The customers are the most important asset we have.""

Panelist Anissa Rodriguez, CEO of Pecan Street, a company that provides data research and product testing for energy, water, transportation and agriculture sectors, acknowledged that centralized control of the grid has been reliable, ""but decentralized control is what is going to help us to build resilience.""

""I look forward to this imaginary Utopian future where things are adaptive, they're inclusive, they're community-driven,"" Rodriguez said. ""These technologies help the grid to learn faster and in real time in a way that is inclusive of everyone.""

Rodriguez said its energy monitoring equipment network, which includes solar and storage customers and electric vehicles drivers, covers 10 states plus Puerto Rico and treats project customers as ""participants in that project with us.""

""The projects that we design are coalitions between universities, utilities, regulatory agencies, other community-based organizations,"" Rodriguez said. ""The most important of that coalition I just think is probably the community-based organizations because they help us to co-create solutions that are hyper-localized to that community. That's how we assure them that the data we're collecting through these behind-the-meter devices that we're installing in their homes is going to be safe and that it's going to be secure and that the research is for a good purpose. And it's even given back to them in the form of this amazing user-intuitive platform so that they can actually adapt their behavior, even if it's just for ... lowering their electricity bill.""

Panelist John Choi, vice president for strategic partnerships and inorganic growth at OCI Energy, which develops utility-scale solar and battery storage projects, said ""it's extremely important"" that AI helps power remain affordable for consumers below the poverty line.

""One of the ways AI can do in the near term is probably just price transparency at the level of the residential customer, so they can decide how it will help drive their habits,"" Choi said.

Machine learning can fall short

LCRA's Shalabi and TEP's Adelman differed over how helpful AI can be for utilities.

""We run drones, we take pictures, and now we have humans go through thousands of pictures,"" Shalabi said."" We've been trying to train a model with this vendor, but we just don't have enough defects for the model to start finding out what a defect is and telling us what's there, so we don't rely on it. We just have to keep going back to basically supervisor viewing the drone pictures and saying, 'Okay, this is a broken insulator, this is rusty bulge.' ... So I think that part of the risk is maybe overselling AI or just having the wrong model right now.""

Adelman acknowledged that AI needs enough data to ""identify the outliers ... so there may be some use cases where you just can't make machine learning work yet.""

""But I think there are a lot of use cases such as propensity modeling around EV adoption or community growth, or even looking at predictive modeling for distribution systems, which are becoming more and more prevalent in terms of grid planning,"" Adelman said. ""At least we have a propensity for the idea that some parts of the system are more risky than other parts of the system.""",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-24 05:02:49.593859

The NRC has failed to license new reactors even as technological advances promise to make nuclear power safer, cheaper, more adaptable, and more abundant than ever.

This failure stems from a fundamental error: Instead of efficiently promoting safe, abundant nuclear energy, the NRC has instead tried to insulate Americans from the most remote risks without appropriate regard for the severe domestic and geopolitical costs of such risk aversion. The NRC utilizes safety models that posit there is no safe threshold of radiation exposure and that harm is directly proportional to the amount of exposure. Those models lack sound scientific basis and produce irrational results, such as requiring that nuclear plants protect against radiation below naturally occurring levels. A myopic policy of minimizing even trivial risks ignores the reality that substitute forms of energy production also carry risk, such as pollution with potentially deleterious health effects.

Recent events in Europe, such as the nationwide blackouts in Spain and Portugal, underscore the importance of my Administration’s focus on dispatchable power generation –including nuclear power — over intermittent power. Beginning today, my Administration will reform the NRC, including its structure, personnel, regulations, and basic operations. In so doing, we will produce lasting American dominance in the global nuclear energy market, create tens of thousands of high-paying jobs, and generate American-led prosperity and resilience.

Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to:

(a) Reestablish the United States as the global leader in nuclear energy;

(b) Facilitate increased deployment of new nuclear reactor technologies, such as Generation III+ and IV reactors, modular reactors, and microreactors, including by lowering regulatory and cost barriers to entry;

(c) Facilitate the expansion of American nuclear energy capacity from approximately 100 GW in 2024 to 400 GW by 2050;

(d) Employ emerging technologies to safely accelerate the modeling, simulation, testing, and approval of new reactor designs;

(e) Support the continued operation of, and facilitate appropriate operational extensions for, the current nuclear fleet, as well as the reactivation of prematurely shuttered or partially completed nuclear facilities; and

(f) Maintain the United States’ leading reputation for nuclear safety.

Sec. 3. Reforming the NRC’s Culture. The Congress has mandated that the NRC’s “licensing and regulation of the civilian use of radioactive materials and nuclear energy be conducted in a manner that is efficient and does not unnecessarily limit — (1) the civilian use of radioactive materials and deployment of nuclear energy; or (2) the benefits of civilian use of radioactive materials and nuclear energy technology to society.” Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy Act of 2024, Public Law 118-67, sec. 501(a). Just as the Congress directed, the NRC’s mission shall include facilitating nuclear power while ensuring reactor safety. When carrying out its licensing and related regulatory functions, the NRC shall consider the benefits of increased availability of, and innovation in, nuclear power to our economic and national security in addition to safety, health, and environmental considerations.

Sec. 4. Reforming the NRC’s Structure. (a) The current structure and staffing of the NRC are misaligned with the Congress’s directive that the NRC shall not unduly restrict the benefits of nuclear power. The NRC shall, in consultation with the NRC’s DOGE Team (as defined in Executive Order 14158 of January 20, 2025 (Establishing and Implementing the President’s “Department of Government Efficiency”)), and consistent with its governing statutes, reorganize the NRC to promote the expeditious processing of license applications and the adoption of innovative technology. The NRC shall undertake reductions in force in conjunction with this reorganization, though certain functions may increase in size consistent with the policies in this order, including those devoted to new reactor licensing. The NRC shall also create a dedicated team of at least 20 officials to draft the new regulations directed by section 5 of this order.

(b) The personnel and functions of the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) shall be reduced to the minimum necessary to fulfill ACRS’s statutory obligations. Review by ACRS of permitting and licensing issues shall focus on issues that are truly novel or noteworthy.

Sec. 5. Reforming and Modernizing the NRC’s Regulations. The NRC, working with its DOGE Team, the Office of Management and Budget, and other executive departments and agencies as appropriate, shall undertake a review and wholesale revision of its regulations and guidance documents, and issue notice(s) of proposed rulemaking effecting this revision within 9 months of the date of this order. The NRC shall issue final rules and guidance to conclude this revision process within 18 months of the date of this order. In conducting this wholesale revision, the NRC shall be guided by the policies set forth in section 2 of this order and shall in particular:

(a) Establish fixed deadlines for its evaluation and approval of licenses, license amendments, license renewals, certificates of compliance, power uprates, license transfers, and any other activity requested by a licensee or potential licensee, as directed under the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act, rather than the nonbinding “generic milestone schedules” guidelines the NRC has already adopted. Those deadlines shall be enforced by fixed caps on the NRC’s recovery of hourly fees. The deadlines shall include: (1) a deadline of no more than 18 months for final decision on an application to construct and operate a new reactor of any type, commencing with the first required step in the regulatory process, and (2) a deadline of no more than 1 year for final decision on an application to continue operating an existing reactor of any type, commencing with the first required step in the regulatory process. The regulations should not provide for tolling those deadlines except in instances of applicant failure, and must allow a reasonably diligent applicant to navigate the licensing process successfully in the time allotted. Moreover, these are maximum time periods; the NRC shall adopt shorter deadlines tailored to particular reactor types or licensing pathways as appropriate.

(b) Adopt science-based radiation limits. In particular, the NRC shall reconsider reliance on the linear no-threshold (LNT) model for radiation exposure and the “as low as reasonably achievable” standard, which is predicated on LNT. Those models are flawed, as discussed in section 1 of this order. In reconsidering those limits, the NRC shall specifically consider adopting determinate radiation limits, and in doing so shall consult with the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Environmental Protection Agency.

(c) Revise, in consultation with the Council on Environmental Quality, NRC regulations governing NRC’s compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act to reflect the Congress’s 2023 amendments to that statute and the policies articulated in sections 2 and 5 of Executive Order 14154 of January 20, 2025 (Unleashing American Energy).

(d) Establish an expedited pathway to approve reactor designs that the DOD or the DOE have tested and that have demonstrated the ability to function safely. NRC review of such designs shall focus solely on risks that may arise from new applications permitted by NRC licensure, rather than revisiting risks that have already been addressed in the DOE or DOD processes.

(e) Establish a process for high-volume licensing of microreactors and modular reactors, including by allowing for standardized applications and approvals and by considering to what extent such reactors or components thereof should be regulated through general licenses.

(f) Establish stringent thresholds for circumstances in which the NRC may demand changes to reactor design once construction is underway.

(g) Revise the Reactor Oversight Process and reactor security rules and requirements to reduce unnecessary burdens and be responsive to credible risks.

(h) Adopt revised and, where feasible, determinate and data-backed thresholds to ensure that reactor safety assessments focus on credible, realistic risks.

(i) Reconsider the regulations governing the time period for which a renewed license remains effective, and extend that period as appropriate based on available technological and safety data.

(j) Streamline the public hearings process.

Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or

(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d) The Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall provide funding for publication of this order in the Federal Register.

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has supported the development of community air monitoring programs through grants and by loaning air sensors to communities, the complaint states.
“Simply put, it’s punitive,” Amy Stelly, a community activist, said of the Louisiana law on a May 22 press call.
The law’s requirement that “any release or communication of the collected monitoring data shall include clear explanations of data interpretation” is a clear First Amendment violation, said Joshi.

A new Louisiana law violates federal air quality protections by preventing community groups from using data collected with certain types of monitoring equipment to call out air quality violations in polluted industrial areas, according to a lawsuit filed Thursday by environmental and health organizations.

The stated intent of the Louisiana Community Air Monitoring Reliability Act (CAMRA), signed into law last May, is to provide the public “with access to accurate air quality information.” But the plaintiffs allege that instead of protecting the public, the law saddles community monitoring groups with “unique and onerous restrictions” by requiring them to use high-priced monitoring equipment instead of affordable alternatives that can offer adequate results.

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has supported the development of community air monitoring programs through grants and by loaning air sensors to communities, the complaint states. Such marginalized “fenceline” communities across the country are located near heavily polluting industrial plants known to release chemicals into the air that can be harmful to human health. These communities often lack adequate air quality monitoring needed to alert residents and policymakers about dangerously high levels of pollutants, such as such as ethylene oxide, a known human carcinogen, and fine particulate matter, which can harm the lungs.

Louisiana is home to “Cancer Alley” a string of communities along the Mississippi River riddled with petrochemical plants, where residents have a 95% higher-than-average chance of developing cancer compared to other Americans.

“Simply put, it’s punitive,” Amy Stelly, a community activist, said of the Louisiana law on a May 22 press call. “This law is oppressive and seeks to keep citizens in the dark.”

The state law also prevents groups from analyzing the data themselves, requiring that they use state-approved laboratories or provide an unspecified “quality assurance certification” with their analysis.

Under the law, the groups face penalties of up to $32,500 per day for alleging air quality violations based on data they obtained using cheaper, commercially available equipment to measure harmful chemicals, plus a $1 million fine for intentional violations, according to the lawsuit.

“The legislature wrote into the law that it wants to police the accuracy of air pollution monitoring information disseminated by community members,” Nandan Joshi, an attorney with the Public Citizen Litigation Group, one of the groups that filed the complaint, said on a press call. “This is a constitutional red flag. The First Amendment does not allow the government to silence voices that the government thinks are wrong.”

CAMRA singles out community groups, he added – it does not apply to industry or the state government.

The law’s requirement that “any release or communication of the collected monitoring data shall include clear explanations of data interpretation” is a clear First Amendment violation, said Joshi.

“CAMRA makes speech illegal if groups release their air monitoring data without providing the state-mandated explanation,” he said. “These restrictions do not only apply when community groups want to talk to the public. These groups cannot talk to federal or state regulators or make allegations in court unless their speech conforms to CAMRA’s requirements.”

The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) declined to comment.

Research has revealed gaps in federal and state data for harmful air pollutants in Louisiana, including ethylene oxide. A 2024 report by Johns Hopkins University analyzed air monitoring data funded by the Beyond Petrochemicals Campaign, finding that ethylene oxide concentrations were nine times higher than pollution modeling by the EPA and LDEQ.

“The state doesn’t monitor for many carcinogens, or not where it’s needed most, and doesn’t require polluting industry to conduct public monitoring, either,” Caitlion Hunter, director of research and policy for the group RISE St. James, said on the call.

Last year, LDEQ announced that it was adding several new air monitors to its network for monitoring ethylene oxide and other harmful volatile organic compounds.

The goal of CAMRA is not to silence community voices but to ensure that regulatory action is based on high quality science, David Cresson, the president and CEO of the Louisiana Chemical Association, which has supported the legislation, said in a statement.

“Community members are fully free to raise concerns, publish findings, and engage with the public or agencies to promote awareness,” said Cresson. “What this law clarifies is that if air monitoring data is going to be used to trigger regulatory enforcement, penalties, or as the sole source for a lawsuit, it must meet the same EPA-approved standards already required of industry and government agencies.”

As far as the parties filing the lawsuit are aware, LDEQ has not attempted to fine any group for their monitoring, said David Bookbinder, director of Law and Policy at the Environmental Integrity Project. Even so, community group representatives said on the press call that they are taking precautions by removing air monitoring data from their websites or ceasing to share findings on social media.

“It’s about silencing communities like mine,” said Cynthia Robertson, executive director of the group Micah 6:8 Mission in Sulphur, Louisiana. The small city sits in Calcasieu Parish, a center of activity for the petrochemical industry and a community threatened by the development of liquified natural gas infrastructure.

The high levels of illness in her region “wouldn’t be accepted anywhere else without outrage and action, but here in southwest Louisiana it’s our reality,” she said. “And the state’s response is to silence us instead of protecting us.”",https://www.thenewlede.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/1748px-Exxon_Mobil_oil_refinery_-_Baton_Rouge_Louisiana.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 19:09:52.608106

""The spending and tax bill that takes away manufacturing (tax) credits and (EV) credits will play into this as well.
The head of the state's emissions regulator, the California Air Resources Board, forcefully spoke against the congressional action Thursday.
Waiver Opponents Celebrate Still, opponents of the California rules treated a Thursday morning U.S. Senate vote as a major policy victory.
'More Room, Less Innovation' Brinley, of S&P, predicted that most automakers would ""stay steady"" with their EV investments even without the California rules.","(TNS) — The auto industry basked in a moment of celebration Thursday after Congress moved to cancel California emission standards that would have required an aggressive transition to electric vehicles across much of the country over the next decade.

""It's a sigh of relief,"" Stephanie Brinley, S&P's associate director of auto intelligence, said in a phone interview. ""The regulation is stiffer than consumers are ready to come along to. Something had to change.""

Analysts were quick to note, however, that turbulence still looms for Michigan and its signature auto sector. Even with the likely end of California rules, industry observers said that companies will need to balance an EV future with a gas-powered present — all while facing steeper competition from China and strategizing for President Donald Trump's tariff-heavy, regulation-light agenda.

""There's still a lot in play,"" Brinley said. ""The spending and tax bill that takes away manufacturing (tax) credits and (EV) credits will play into this as well. And what will the actual fuel economy regulations be that the White House delivers?""

She added: ""Today is waiver day, but all of these things matter for an automaker. You can't make a decision based on one. We still have a lot of uncertainty.""

Brinley also noted that legal challenges from California and environmental groups are likely to follow, which adds to that uncertainty.

The head of the state's emissions regulator, the California Air Resources Board, forcefully spoke against the congressional action Thursday. CARB Chair Liane Randolph decried the environmental ramifications of the regulatory rollback and confirmed that the state would fight back.

""California profoundly disagrees with today's unconstitutional, illegal and foolish vote attempting to undermine critical clean air protections,"" she said in a statement. ""It’s an assault on states’ rights the federal administration claims to support that puts national air quality standards out of reach and will have devastating effects for the 150 million Americans who breathe unhealthy air every day.""

Randolph continued: ""California will pursue every available remedy to challenge these actions and defend our right to protect the public from dangerous air pollution. Turning the clock back on both cleaner combustion engine requirements and zero-emission technology is an attack on clean air.""

Waiver Opponents Celebrate

Still, opponents of the California rules treated a Thursday morning U.S. Senate vote as a major policy victory. Industry groups had lobbied hard on Capitol Hill in recent months to revoke a Biden-era waiver allowing the Golden State to enact regulations requiring 100% electrified vehicle sales by 2035.

""We thank those in the nation’s community of automotive enthusiasts and the aftermarket businesses who engaged in the advocacy process, many for the first time, to remind lawmakers that this is the United States of America, not the United States of California,"" said Mike Spagnola, president and CEO of the Specialty Equipment Market Association.

Even though the regulations originated from California, a handful of mostly coastal states voluntarily adopted the ambitious plan. States have adopted California rules for decades thanks to a provision of the federal Clean Air Act, but the latest regulations caused serious concerns from auto dealers in states that had signed on to California's standards.

Mike Stanton, head of the National Automobile Dealers Association, joined the chorus of industry voices lauding lawmakers.

""NADA applauds the Senate for its passage of legislation which stops California regulators from banning gas and hybrid vehicles in twelve states,"" he said in a statement. ""This unrealistic mandate, coupled with an insufficient and unreliable charging infrastructure, would have drastically reduced consumer choice and raised prices for new and used cars and trucks for all Americans.”

Michigan was not among the states that signed on to use California's rules. But other states' commitments meant that billions of dollars were at stake for automakers, parts suppliers and workers in and around Detroit.

General Motors Co. praised the congressional action Thursday.

""GM appreciates Congress’ action to align emissions standards with today’s market realities,"" company spokesperson Bill Grotz said in a statement. ""We have long advocated for one national standard that will allow us to stay competitive, continue to invest in U.S. innovation, and offer customer choice across the broadest lineup of gas-powered and electric vehicles.”

Ford Motor Co. referred back to a statement earlier in the week, praising the Senate's decision to vote on the matter at all despite controversy over parliamentary procedure.

“In America, the customer chooses, and we need national emissions standards that not only drive progress but also reflect market realities,"" Ford spokesperson Robyn Jackson said in the Tuesday statement.

Stellantis earlier in the week declined to comment on the topic, instead deferring to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a top automotive lobbying group. Toyota Motor Corp., the second-leading automaker in the United States last year behind GM, also deferred to the trade group.

""There’s a significant gap between the marketplace and these EV sales requirements. In reality, meeting the mandates would require diverting finite capital from the EV transition to purchase compliance credits from Tesla,"" said John Bozzella, the group's president and CEO, as part of a Thursday statement.

He continued: ""This doesn’t help EV adoption or build charging infrastructure but does create a domino effect leading to job and manufacturing losses, higher auto prices and fewer vehicle choices.""

'More Room, Less Innovation'

Brinley, of S&P, predicted that most automakers would ""stay steady"" with their EV investments even without the California rules.

""This isn't a situation where automakers are not investing in electric vehicles and consumers aren't buying them in greater numbers,"" the analyst said. ""It's just that the rule right now was too aggressive to be met.""

The California regulations would have required 28% fully electric and 7% plug-in hybrid sales in participating states for model year 2026, a threshold many states were far from reaching. Nationwide, EV and plug-in sales have stagnated at around 10% for the past two years.

Other analysts warned that the lack of a regulatory push on automakers to boost EV growth would severely hamper them in the long-term battle for global automotive supremacy.

""Instead of the mandate forcing them to disrupt themselves, they're left to their own devices to disrupt themselves. And I don't know if that's ever worked in real life,"" said Tu Le, managing director of Sino Auto Insights, an innovation and management consulting firm with offices in Detroit and China. ""GM is digging their own grave.""

He acknowledged the challenges facing EV development in the United States, including affordability issues and lagging charging infrastructure. But he said that ""you need these types of mandates in order to make change.""

Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis at AutoPacific, a market research and consulting firm, agreed with that assessment.

""This is kind of stymying potential innovation,"" he said in a phone interview. ""It is labeled as a mandate, but we all know it was really just a target that probably would get moved if needed. Pulling that back just leaves more room for less innovation.""

""Automakers are still planning for a future of EVs,"" he said. ""This is just putting us, from a geopolitical standpoint, in a position where we're not forced to move as fast as other places like China.""

Waatti added: ""We're kind of handing them the ball to run with.""

However, the strategy will make public charging, one of the biggest barriers to EV adoption, even more confusing and opaque.
“There’s been this pressure to make sure EV charging is cheaper than gas,” Puri explained.
Charging rates — even when they aren’t being whipsawed by dynamic pricing algorithms — are plenty confusing.
“Customer confusion and surprise around EV charging prices is a significant challenge nationwide,” the report reads.","When Jeffrey Raun drives his Tesla Model 3 far from his Anchorage home, he pays some of the highest public charging rates in the nation. Juicing the car’s battery from 10% to 90% full costs somewhere around $32 at the Three Bears grocery and sporting goods outpost in Chugiak, roughly triple what he pays at home.

“This is a choice we’ve made and we’re all in and we’re going to charge where and when we need to charge,” Raun explained. “I firmly believe I’m still money ahead in the use of my EV.”

Soon, however, Raun and other EV drivers may see prices swing dramatically higher (and occasionally lower) as fast-charging networks roll out dynamic pricing. Nearly 40% of the country’s 10,700 or so public fast-charging stations recently started adjusting rates often and aggressively, based on a myriad of factors that skew the supply-demand equation, from weather and events to holiday travel spikes and fluctuating electricity rates.

For charging companies, the strategy is arguably a no-brainer — a page from the gas station playbook that analysts say will help long-struggling networks finally plug into fatter profits. There are benefits for consumers as well. Shifting prices will mitigate congestion by spreading demand throughout the day and giving price-sensitive drivers — particularly Uber and Lyft workers — windows of steeply discounted rates, typically in the wee hours of the morning.

However, the strategy will make public charging, one of the biggest barriers to EV adoption, even more confusing and opaque.

Consider a driver plugging into the EVgo Inc. station outside the Denny’s in Rancho Cordova, California. If she is a night owl topping up between midnight and 6 a.m., 70 kWh of charging costs about $35. However, from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m., that same session will run about $48, nearly 38% more, according to EVgo’s pricing a few days ago.

While much of the industry has hesitated to tinker with prices, EVgo, which operates about 1,100 fast-charging stations in the United States, says algorithms are now constantly tweaking prices throughout its network.

EVgo declined a request for comment. But in its recent earnings report, the company said its dynamic pricing has pushed overnight utilization at its stations into double-digit figures on average. The company, in short, is now doing business at times when it used to do little, which is making its cords less crowded during peak periods.

“We’re looking to maximize margin,” CEO Badar Khan explained on a conference call. “We’re not talking about something being reinvented here. We’re taking, kind of, concepts that have been very successfully executed in other parts of the economy into the space.”

Chris Pierce, an analyst covering charging networks at the Needham & Co. Inc. investment bank, considers EVgo’s new pricing strategy a major competitive advantage. “There’s no doubt it’s working,” he explained. “And I don’t think this train is stopping anytime soon. … You have a bunch of EVs on the road and not enough infrastructure in the ground.”

Tesla Inc., which did not respond to requests for comment, has a similar pricing program for its 2,500 or so U.S. fast-charging stations. The rest of the charging industry isn’t far behind. Driivz, a Raleigh, North Carolina-based software and analytics company that serves 150,000 chargers around the world, promises its dynamic pricing models can increase revenue by up to 20%.

“It’s becoming a very hot topic,” explained Oren Halevi, Driivz’s chief product officer. “It’s just a really good way for networks to make money.”

Stable Auto, a consultancy that helps charging companies decide where to put stations, started pitching dynamic pricing about a year ago. It’s now actively shifting rates at some 5,000 U.S. chargers, including many operated by Blink Charging Co. and EV Connect Inc.

Stable CEO Rohan Puri said he talks to lots of charging executives who are intrigued by dynamic pricing but hesitant to embrace it. They are concerned about further confusing customers, being accused of price gouging and possibly slowing EV adoption.

“There’s been this pressure to make sure EV charging is cheaper than gas,” Puri explained. “It’s an ethical pressure … but most (networks) are not making money, so we have to pull whatever levers we have.”

Public charging has long been one of the most frustrating parts of EV ownership and opaque pricing is a big reason why. In a recent J.D. Power survey, EV drivers gave fast-charging costs a satisfaction score of 429 out of 1,000.

Charging rates — even when they aren’t being whipsawed by dynamic pricing algorithms — are plenty confusing. They vary by network, by state and by station and though most locations charge by the kilowatt-hour, some still charge by the minute. What’s more, unlike gas station pumps, charging stations don’t prominently display their rates, and often tack on extra fees and surcharges.

And then there’s the question of how drivers find stations. Half of EV drivers use three or more apps to choose chargers, but many of those apps don’t display real-time prices, according to a recent study by the state of California.

State regulators found that almost half of EV drivers considered it difficult or very difficult to find information about charging costs in advance of a fueling session and nearly 40% said they paid surprise fees or a significantly higher price for charging than expected.

“Customer confusion and surprise around EV charging prices is a significant challenge nationwide,” the report reads. “This especially impacts low-income or disadvantaged drivers, who rely more on public chargers, have less access to digital payments, have tighter budgets, and may struggle to understand information presented in inaccessible ways.”

Dynamic pricing will exacerbate this frustration to some degree. Consumers have come to expect that prices are on a pendulum that never stops swinging, from airline and concert tickets to gasoline. Still, they tend to bristle at dynamic pricing. Almost one in four Americans say they won’t spend money at a business that uses it, according to a recent NerdWallet survey.

If gasoline is any gauge, EV pricing will only get more complex. Not only will networks shift prices through the day, but the people tinkering with the algorithms say drivers will pay big premiums at stations hit by a charging rush, say outside an NFL stadium on game day or on a busy travel corridor during Thanksgiving week.

Puri at Stable thinks drivers will eventually choose their own pricing.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he was recommending a straight 50% tariff on goods from the European Union starting from June 1, saying that the EU has been hard to deal with on trade.

Samuelsson told Reuters that a 50% tariff would limit the ability of Volvo Cars to sell its Belgium-made EX30 electric vehicle in the United States.

""That would of course be almost impossible,"" he said, adding that given the fluid nature of the tariff threat he would not speculate further.

Trump's tariffs on automotive imports and car components have caused turmoil in the global auto industry, with some companies altering production plans to ease costs related to the duties, while others wait to see if the policies change.

The EX30, which Samuelsson said was ""very severely hit,"" by tariffs because it was initially produced in China, has been Volvo's attempt at providing its customers with an affordable electric car.

With a planned starting price of $35,000, hefty tariffs imposed on cars made in China led Volvo to delay selling the car in the U.S. market until production started in Ghent, Belgium, which happened in April of this year. The car's starting price is now at $46,195.

Vehicles from other carmakers with lower price tags, including Ford Motor F.N General Motors GM.N and Toyota Motor 7203.T, are imported to the U.S. from Mexico, South Korea or Japan, putting their price points at risk in the face of tariff uncertainty.

Samuelsson said he was hopeful that Europe and the United States will soon come to an agreement despite the threat of rising tariffs.

""I believe there will be a deal soon. It could not be in the interest of Europe or the U.S. to shut down trade between them.""

Most of Volvo Cars' vehicles for the U.S. market, which last year accounted for 16% of group sales, are imported from Europe. The company aims to increase production at its Charleston, South Carolina factory in the near term by adding a new model, which Samuelsson has previously said could be a mid-sized plug-in hybrid.

Volvo's shares were down 5.0% at 1337 GMT.

It’s the cradle of Big Tech, the birthplace of Tesla and a global trendsetter in environmental and public health policy. For decades, it has championed ambitious clean air rules, projecting its influence not only to other U.S. states but also to the rest of the world. But Congress just took a sledgehammer to that legacy this week, revoking a decades-old waiver that let California write its own emissions rules which allowed it to create healthier, more breathable cities.

30%: California Will Sue The Feds Over Emissions Rules

California’s decades-long crusade against air pollution and its ambitious plan to fully electrify its roads took a gut punch this week. In a 51-44 vote, the Republican-led Senate moved to overturn the state’s landmark plan to end sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035.

The plan, backed by a waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Clean Air Act of the 1970s, allowed California to impose stricter emissions rules than the federal standard. That waiver helped the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to pass the Advanced Clean Cars II regulation—a roadmap requiring all new car sales to be zero-emissions by 2035. Eleven other states follow California’s emissions rules. Now that vision seems to be in question.

But ending California’s 2035 gas car ban using the Congressional Review Act seems to be set on murky legal foundations. So California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state is fighting back, marking its 23rd lawsuit against the Trump administration this year.

Here’s more from Politico:

“The federal government’s overreach is illogical,” Bonta said in a press conference in Sacramento. “It’s politically motivated, and it comes at the expense of Californians’ lives and livelihoods.”

“I think the fact that the Senate parliamentarian, the Government Accountability Office, have all rejected this approach, this reliance on the Congressional Review Act, that the Congressional Review Act has never been used for this purpose ever in 30 years, and that Clean Air Act waivers have been given over the 55-year duration of the statute by both Republican and Democratic administrations, and never been challenged in this way, probably tells you all you need to know,” he said on Thursday.

California leads the country in EV adoption with over 2 million EVs sold so far. Battery-powered models accounted for about 25% of the state’s overall vehicle sales in the final quarter of last year. But lately, EV sales in California have been growing more slowly as the market has moved past its early adopter phase.

Mass market buyers tend to have more concerns over costs, range and charging infrastructure, so adoption has been more cautious rather than explosive. And Tesla no longer enjoys the same popularity in the state like it used to a few years ago, as rivals have stepped up and CEO Elon Musk’s politics are pushing some buyers away.

With national EV adoption already facing headwinds, the rollback of California’s emissions waiver threatens to stall the country’s broader climate goals. The last stronghold for aggressive zero-emission policy has been kneecapped—at least for now. Automakers are celebrating this move as it will allow them to sell more high-profit-margin gas-powered vehicles in the state for a longer period of time.

Now it’s up to the courts to decide whether California can retain its right to set its own emissions rules.

60%: EV Sales Could Slow Down In The U.S.

Photo by: InsideEVs

EV sales in the U.S. reached record highs last year and the first quarter of this year, thanks to an influx of new and affordable models, generous federal incentives and steadily improving charging infrastructure.

But House Republicans dealt an untimely blow to the EV industry this week by passing a bill to end the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits for consumers and for local EV factories. If the bill passes in the Senate, it would effectively mean that the U.S. is surrendering to China’s technological lead in EVs, setting the country back after years of progress.

Here’s more from The New York Times:

“It’s a big win for China and bad for American manufacturing,” said Mike Murphy, a veteran Republican political operative who is chief executive of the EV Politics Project, a group that seeks to end what it calls “the needless partisan divide over E.V.s.”

“In the long term we’ll get there,” said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds.com. “It feels like the next decade is going to be bumpy.”

The EV market has to grow organically some day. Before it can, it needs a bit of help getting off the ground. That's the phase we're in now—as charging infrastructure is still being built out, companies are still refining their EV designs and battery costs are coming down.

But ending the $7,500 consumer tax credit for EVs will mean automakers might have to roll back their lease and financing offers and also make outright purchasing more expensive. And ending the tax credits for EV and battery plants would drill a large hole in automakers’ bottom line.

Opponents of the tax credits argue that the EV industry is being unfairly subsidized. Let’s not forget that the gas car industry has been unfairly subsidized for decades—that too at a scale that dwarfs any EV investments the U.S. has ever made.

One conservative estimate by the Environmental and Energy Study Institute says the U.S. government spends about $20 billion per year in direct and indirect subsidies to the fossil fuel industry.

That includes deductions on drilling and reduced taxes on income from coal, oil and natural gas businesses. The fossil fuel industry also enjoys deductions on royalties paid abroad and lower corporate tax rates on domestic production. Plus, the U.S. uses a lot of its international political capital to make sure oil prices stay low.

90%: Panasonic’s Second U.S. EV Battery Plant May Open Soon

Japanese battery giant Panasonic’s second EV battery plant in the U.S. could be operational in July after facing several delays and mounting pressure from Tesla, its main customer.

Panasonic is building a second U.S. factory in De Soto, Kansas as it looks to expand its local battery manufacturing capacity amid President Trump’s 25% tariffs on foreign auto parts. It already has a huge facility in Sparks, Nevada, within the Tesla Gigafactory complex.

The new 300-acre complex in Kansas comes at an uncertain time, as EV subsidies are on track to get rolled back on the federal level, which could threaten demand and make EVs more expensive. Plus, Panasonic says this plant was the most difficult ever to set-up.

Here’s more from Nikkei:

One equipment supplier involved in the Kansas plant told Nikkei Asia that construction was ""the toughest we've ever had in terms of meeting the schedule,"" citing, among other things, America's more ""relaxed"" working culture, a natural disaster and uncertainty over U.S. tariffs.

The source said some of the local construction workers were less reliable than those in Japan, less willing to work overtime and more likely to ""complain that they can't ensure safety due to the slightest irregularity.""

When operational, it will supply EV batteries to Tesla and other automakers. Even then, it won't be 100% localized and may continue relying on imports from Japan and China. Unless the U.S. strikes a trade deal with those countries anytime soon, things may continue to be uncertain for Panasonic.

100%: Fossil Fuels Get Subsidies. Shouldn’t EVs Get Them Too?

The federal gas car tax has been stagnant since 28 years, not raised since 1993 and standing at a little over 18 cents per gallon. But the EV industry is now facing multiple headwinds: a new proposed tax of $250, rollback of tax credits and an end to California’s gas car ban.

Do you think the federal government should continue subsidizing EV purchases and manufacturing to compete with China, or should the industry be left to stand on its own? Should the government try to incentivize EVs for public health reasons, or trust that the market will one day sort it out?",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/KbY04N/s1/california-to-sue-feds-cm-5-23.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 19:08:34.297119

President Trump is leveraging the Defense Production Act to seek voluntary agreements with domestic nuclear energy companies for the procurement of enriched uranium and for consultation regarding methods to enhance domestic capability to manage spent nuclear fuel.

The Secretary of Energy is authorized to support the establishment of nuclear industry consortia by ensuring offtake for newly established domestic fuel supply across milling, conversion/deconversion, enrichment, fabrication, and recycling and reprocessing.

ACCELERATING NEW NUCLEAR ENERGY PRODUCTION: President Trump is leveraging the full suite of Federal financial resources to support the restart, completion, uprate, and construction of nuclear plants.

The Department of Energy will prioritize the facilitation of 5 GW of power uprates to existing nuclear reactors and construction on 10 new large reactors by 2030.

Federal loans and loan guarantees will be prioritized to support increased nuclear energy, including restarting closed nuclear power plants and completing construction of prematurely suspended plants.

The Order tasks the Secretary of Energy, in coordination with the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, to prioritize funding for companies with potential for near-term deployment of advanced nuclear technologies.

EXPANDING THE AMERICAN NUCLEAR WORKFORCE: President Trump is taking action to expand pathways for Americans to gain employment in the domestic nuclear workforce.

Nuclear engineering and nuclear energy-related careers will be considered priority areas for actions directed pursuant to Executive Order 14278.

STRENGTHENING THE DOMESTIC NUCLEAR FUEL SUPPLY CHAIN: To enable the long-term expansion of nuclear energy, the Federal government shall pursue policies to maximize the value of nuclear fuel and expand the domestic nuclear fuel supply chain.

The Nation’s nuclear fuel cycle infrastructure has severely atrophied, with domestic fuel sources supplying only about 5% of the fuel used in U.S. reactors. In addition to permitting challenges in mining the relevant minerals, in 1977 the Federal government introduced a policy that did not allow reprocessing of used fuel for commercial reactors, leaving the United States heavily dependent on foreign sources of uranium as well as uranium enrichment and conversion services.

The United States possesses ample deposits of uranium and thorium that can power advanced nuclear reactors. The President has already taken decisive action to advance mining activities relevant to these minerals pursuant to his Executive Order “Immediate Measures to Increase Domestic Mineral Production.”

This Executive Order supplements the Administration’s actions on mineral production to ensure that we can not only mine, but also process and refine, nuclear fuel domestically. This is crucial for energy independence and national security.

Treatment of nuclear waste is one of the most difficult problems in the nuclear supply chain, and this Order brings together all relevant Federal agencies to develop implementable solutions.

60% of the nuclear workforce is between the ages of 30 and 60, and this Order takes decisive action to generate a pipeline of workers to supply the demand for this crucial industry.

Section 1. Purpose. The United States originally pioneered nuclear energy technology during a time of great peril. We now face a new set of challenges, including a global race to dominate in artificial intelligence, a growing need for energy independence, and access to uninterruptible power supplies for national security.

It took nearly 40 years for the United States to add the same amount of nuclear capacity as another developed nation added in 10 years.Further, as American deployment of advanced reactor designs has waned, 87 percent of nuclear reactors installed worldwide since 2017 are based on designs from two foreign countries.At the same time, the Nation’s nuclear fuel cycle infrastructure has severely atrophied, leaving the United States heavily dependent on foreign sources of uranium as well as uranium enrichment and conversion services.These trends cannot continue.

Swift and decisive action is required to jumpstart America’s nuclear energy industrial base and ensure our national and economic security by increasing fuel availability and production, securing civil nuclear supply chains, improving the efficiency with which advanced nuclear reactors are licensed, and preparing our workforce to establish America’s energy dominance and accelerate our path towards a more secure and independent energy future.

Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to expedite and promote to the fullest possible extent the production and operation of nuclear energy to provide affordable, reliable, safe, and secure energy to the American people, to power advanced nuclear reactor technologies, as defined in 42 U.S.C. 16271(b)(1)(A), and to build associated supply chains that secure our global industrial and digital dominance, achieve our energy independence, protect our national security, and maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of nuclear fuel through recycling, reprocessing, and reinvigorating the commercial sector.

Sec. 3. Strengthening the Domestic Nuclear Fuel Cycle. (a) Within 240 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Energy, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), shall prepare and submit to the President, through the Chair of the National Energy Dominance Council and the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, a report that includes:

(i.) a recommended national policy to support the management of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste and the development and deployment of advanced fuel cycle capabilities to establish a safe, secure, and sustainable long-term fuel cycle;

(ii.) a review of relevant statutory authorities to identify any legislative changes necessary or desirable to achieve the national policy recommended under subsection (a)(i) of this section;

(iii.) an evaluation of the reprocessing and recycling of spent nuclear fuel from the operation of Department of Defense and Department of Energy reactors and other spent nuclear fuel managed by the Department of Energy, along with a discussion of steps the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy are taking or must take to improve such reprocessing and recycling processes;

(iv.) an analysis of legal, budgetary, and policy considerations relevant to efficiently transferring spent nuclear fuel from reactors to a government-owned, privately operated reprocessing and recycling facility;

(v.) recommendations for the efficient use of the uranium, plutonium, and other products recovered through recycling and reprocessing;

(vi.) recommendations for the efficient disposal of the wastes generated by recycling or reprocessing through a permanent disposal pathway;

(vii.) a recommended process for evaluating, prior to disposal, nuclear waste materials for isotopes of value to national security, or medical, industrial, and scientific sectors;

(viii.) a reevaluation of historic and current nuclear reprocessing, separation, and storage facilities slated for decommissioning and that are identified as having valuable materials, isotopes, equipment, licenses, operations, or experienced workers, and that may have potential fuel cycle or national security benefits if operations are continued or increased; and

(ix.) a program to develop methods and technologies to transport, domestically and overseas, used and unused advanced nuclear fuels and advanced nuclear reactors containing such fuels in a safe, secure, and environmentally sound manner, including any legislation required to support this initiative (b) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Chair of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Director of OMB, shall develop a plan to expand domestic uranium conversion capacity and expand enrichment capabilities sufficient to meet projected civilian and defense reactor needs for low enriched uranium (LEU), high enriched uranium (HEU) and high assay, low enriched uranium (HALEU), subject to retention of such stockpiles as are necessary for tritium production, naval propulsion, and nuclear weapons.

The coalition has been in the works for some time now, but official announcement couldn’t come at a better time.

Just yesterday, Congressional republicans moved on two separate efforts to increase pollution and harm the US auto industry, both by illegally voting to rescind a waiver they don’t have the authority to rescind and voting to send US EV jobs to China and give trillions of dollars to wealthy elites instead.

The new coalition includes 11 states whose governors want to protect their residents from these attacks, and to keep pushing forward on clean cars.

Here’s the list of governors:

Gavin Newsom, California

Jared Polis, Colorado

Matt Meyer, Delaware

Maura Healey, Massachusetts

Wes Moore, Maryland

Phil Murphy, New Jersey

Michelle Lujan Grisham, New Mexico

Kathy Hochul, New York

Tina Kotek, Oregon

Dan McKee, Rhode Island

Bob Ferguson, Washington

The coalition represents over 100 million Americans and around 30% of the US car market. It’s a subset of the 24 states in the US Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of 24 governors that represents ~60% of the US economy and 55% of the US population.

The US Climate Alliance has worked on several initiatives, including on cleaner construction materials, modernized grids, and of course clean cars.

The governors in the new Clean Cars Coalition closely (but not exactly) track the group of “section 177” states which follow California Air Resources Board’s clean air rules.

Section 177 is the portion of the federal Clean Air Act which allows California to ask for a waiver to set its own emissions rules, as long as those rules are stronger than federal rules, and lets other states follow the same rules, as long as they follow California’s rules exactly.

Not every state follows every rule, and each individual rule has somewhere around 10-12 states that follow it. Each of the states involved in today’s effort are section 177 states, but not every section 177 state is represented in this coalition.

States participating in the Affordable Clean Cars Coalition will collaborate to:

Develop solutions that make cleaner vehicles more affordable and accessible to all Americans who want them, including by reducing cost barriers, increasing availability of options, and expanding accessible charging and fueling infrastructure at home and in our communities.

Continue making progress toward the goals of states’ clean vehicle programs.

Defend longstanding authority under the Clean Air Act for states to adopt transportation solutions that best meet their needs and most effectively support their families and communities.

Explore opportunities to develop and adopt next-generation standards and programs to further reduce vehicle pollution, as permitted under the Clean Air Act or otherwise, such as solutions that increase consumer access to cleaner cars and low-carbon fuels.

Collaborate with one another, share evidence-based practices, engage experts, and develop solutions that can be shared across state lines and eventually scaled by the federal government.

Foster meaningful engagement with manufacturers, suppliers, dealers, labor unions, business associations, utilities, community-based organizations, charging and fueling infrastructure providers, and others in developing and successfully implementing state transportation solutions.

Prioritize efforts that bolster America’s ability to compete and innovate in a growing global market.

Electrek’s Take

Today’s coalition is a similar effort to that which came out of the last time the federal government tried to force dirty air on states.

In fact, the US Climate Alliance was originally formed in 2017, in response to former reality TV host Donald Trump declaring that the US should pull out of the Paris Agreement (which Tesla CEO Elon Musk opposed at the time, but now relishes his chance to be “not good for America or the world“).

Mr. Trump also tried to attack California’s clean air rules many times the first time he squatted in the Oval Office (after losing the 2016 election by 3 million votes), but through a combination of being both morally and legally correct, California eventually won that fight.

Along the way, coalition-building like today’s made it clear who the eventual winner would be. California negotiated a clean car deal on its own with automakers, and several states took California’s side in a lawsuit against republican big government overreach. California even made international agreements and went to international climate conferences in the US’ stead, as Mr. Trump committed itself to diminishing the US on the international stage.

This time, the story looks like it’s starting to play out similarly. And since the players are the same (though some, somehow, are even stupider), and the importance and dominance of electric cars is more apparent now than ever, I wouldn’t bet on the outcome being all that different.",https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/IMG_9694-scaled-1-e1747948929611.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-23 19:09:13.833381

From the Poconos to the Jersey Shore to the mouth of the Delaware Bay, what do you want to know about climate change? What would you like us to cover? Get in touch.

At Tina Alishia Brown’s rowhouse in Southwest Philadelphia, Clean Air Council organizer Russell Zerbo ties a small white device to a post on the porch.

“You want it to be 5, 6 feet off the ground — an average person’s height,” he said.

Zerbo makes sure the device sits at “nose level,” because it’s measuring the air people breathe.

It’s one of 60 PurpleAir monitors the Clean Air Council installed this spring at homes and churches in Delaware County and South and Southwest Philadelphia, along the I-95 corridor.

These monitors let residents track pollution coming from traffic, industrial facilities and construction sites in real time, said Jendaiya Hill, Clean Air Council community organizer. Then, neighbors can make decisions about how to protect their health — for example, by wearing a mask or postponing outdoor gatherings.

“Literally just like checking the weather,” Hill said.

Brown, the homeowner, has a 12-year-old son with asthma. She’s hoping the air monitor will help her keep him safe.

“I can just check it periodically to see how the air quality is and decide whether or not to keep my windows open or closed — or should my little one stay in for the day?” she said.

Filling in the gaps

Federal law already requires a network of thousands of government-run air quality monitors across the country. But Amanda Northcross, a professor in the Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering at the University of North Carolina’s Gillings School of Global Public Health, said this network is not dense enough to capture air quality on a block-by-block basis.

“It won’t tell you exactly what air pollution looks like within your neighborhood,” Northcross said. “If you live near a very high polluting source such as a freeway or a power plant, for example, looking at the closest [government] monitor near you commonly won’t give you much information about the kind of small-scale changes in air pollution that could be happening where you live.”

Northcross said community networks using PurpleAir monitors, like the one Clean Air Council installed, tend to be less accurate than the government monitors. But they’re good for filling in the gaps.

The Clean Air Council project is funded by a grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The agency terminated another grant the organization received to launch a similar air monitoring network near the Delaware City Refinery.

As the EPA plans to reconsider dozens of environmental regulations, Hill said local efforts like this one are increasingly important.

“No matter what’s happening on a federal level, in this area that we’re in, we can grow awareness and advocacy efforts around protecting our air — even if the structure of the EPA is not functioning in the ways that it previously was,” she said.

The PurpleAir monitors, like the one on Brown’s porch, measure fine particulate matter, a pollutant that can make symptoms worse for people with respiratory conditions, like Brown’s son. High levels can even trigger heart attacks for people with cardiovascular disease.

Community monitor data is publicly accessible

The monitors feed data to a publicly accessible, color-coded online map of similar monitors nationwide.

“If you go on there and all the dots are green, we’re having a great air quality day,” Hill said. “If you go on there and it starts being orange, anyone who has sensitive conditions — asthma, COPD, any kind of lung cancer or underlying health issues — may start to experience symptoms. Once you get into the red … that’s when it’s unhealthy for anyone.”

Brown is well aware of the ties between air quality and health, because she works as a doula — supporting pregnant people, who can be particularly sensitive to air pollution, through pregnancy, birth and the post-partum period.

Now that her air monitor is up and running, she plans to share information about the air on her block with her neighbors, as well.

“Some of us are so busy working and raising families that we don’t even think about air quality, until [an alert] flashes on the TV,” Brown said. “I’d love to be that person to just share — not to instill fear in anybody — just to inform and educate, just so we all can be aware.”",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/monitor-s-schmidt-2025-05-22-3.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 19:09:56.339631

Dove told lawmakers Wednesday that he has officially informed the Corps that the state plans to restart the Myrtle Grove project.","Gov. Jeff Landry’s plan to abandon the $3 billion Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion, once considered the cornerstone of Louisiana's coastal restoration efforts, may see the state revive an old project to replace it that his administration says will be cheaper, faster and more effective.

Not everyone is convinced.

The Mid-Barataria project is on life support after the Corps suspended a key permit for it. Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) Chairman Gordon “Gordy” Dove is signaling a major shift in strategy that prioritizes protecting coastal fisheries over the original plan that took years to develop and has already cost $500 million.

In a detailed presentation before the Senate Transportation Committee on Wednesday, Dove said that he supports the construction of a smaller river diversion in Plaquemines Parish called Myrtle Grove — a diversion project first proposed before Mid-Barataria was conceived. He presented it as a shovel-ready alternative to Mid-Barataria, which the state could pursue instead and save itself $1 billion in costs, all while freeing up funds to advance other restoration projects throughout the state.

But the project is in reality far from shovel-ready, while proponents of the Mid-Barataria plan question the ultimate effectiveness and cost savings of what Dove is proposing.

Myrtle Grove would be far smaller than Mid-Barataria. While Mid-Barataria would send 75,000 cubic feet of river water — roughly equivalent to the volume of 30 shipping containers — into the basin every second, Myrtle Grove would divert between 2,500 and 15,000 cubic feet of river water per second, roughly the volume of six shipping containers.

Alongside the smaller diversion, Dove advocated for building a 24-mile tract of manmade wetlands extending across the Barataria Basin from Bayou Dosgris to Port Sulphur, which is already part of CPRA’s master plan for restoring parts of the coast.

“Congress authorized the design, engineering and construction of Myrtle Grove, with a long-distance pipeline to build land,” Dove said in an interview. “Look, the best alternative is to go back to the Corps and let the Corps go ahead and move forward with it.”

Ricky Boyett, a spokesperson for the Corps, noted that the project does not have final authorization, and that its current design calls for using dredged sediment to build land without a pipeline.

Commercial fishing vs. diversions

Mid-Barataria aimed to build 21 square miles of land over 50 years by slicing open the Mississippi River near Ironton and diverting its flow and land-building sediment into Barataria Basin. The state has lost an area the size of Delaware to coastal erosion over the last century, and the rate of loss is expected to increase with intensifying hurricanes and sea level rise driven by human-caused climate change.

It was seen as the centerpiece of the state’s $50 billion plan to restore parts of its coastline, but fishermen and shrimpers in coastal parishes have long opposed it on the grounds that the introduction of freshwater into brackish estuaries would destroy fisheries.

Mitch Jurisich, a Plaquemines Parish Council member who owns about 16,000 acres of oyster bed leases and stands to lose business if the diversion is built, celebrated the prospect of an alternative project.

“For 15 years we've been fighting this project because we knew it would not do the proper job,” said Jurisich, who has sued in federal court to stop the Mid-Barataria plan. “Let’s get it right this time.”

Landry sided with the fishing communities last year when he signaled his opposition to the project, saying that it would “break our culture."" He has blamed his predecessor John Bel Edwards’ administration for withholding a 500-page report from the Corps that modeled how the diversion would perform under specific circumstances, an accusation that Edwards has strongly rebutted.

The Corps ultimately suspended a crucial permit for the project last month, noting as part of its justification that Edwards’ administration had “deliberately withheld” the report. It has also acknowledged, though, that the data in question would not have affected its permit decision.

The Corps also singled out the Landry administration’s disinterest in the project as part of its reasoning to suspend the permit. In a May 5 letter, Dove said he would inform the Corps of next steps within 60 days, or by July 4.

Dove also this week said publicly for the first time that the CPRA would move to cancel another planned river diversion on the east bank of the river, the Mid-Breton Sediment Diversion. Fishers and oyster growers oppose that project, too.

Outdated studies, changed landscapes

Dove argues that the smaller diversion and landbridge projects would ultimately create more land than Mid-Barataria, and do so more quickly.

“You would make 19,000 acres [about 30 square miles] in 12 to 14 years,” he said in an interview. “You’ll be around to see I’m right. You won’t be around to see whether that experiment works or not,” he added, referring to Mid-Barataria.

He appeared to be referencing a report the Corps produced in 2010, which estimated that the project, which also includes moving 2 million cubic yards of river sediment into the basin, would build 19,700 acres over the project’s lifetime.

The state's marsh-building projects with dredged sediment typically have a 20-year lifespan since they erode like the rest of the coast, though the accompanying features Dove proposes may extend that.

Mid-Barataria proponents note that the larger diversion would work with nature, could continue to be a land-building tool well beyond the 50-year evaluation period and matches the scale of Louisiana's devastating land loss crisis.

But cost is also a concern for Landry and Dove, who says that scrapping Mid-Barataria would save taxpayer money, which coastal advocates have called into question. It’s not clear whether the more than $500 million in BP oil spill settlement funds that have been spent on Mid-Barataria will have to be returned if the project isn’t built.

“You’re going to save over a billion,” Dove insists. “It will probably be about $4 billion but I’m being conservative at a billion.”

The Corps and, eventually, Congress would also have to approve the plan Dove advocates — usually a complex and years-long process. Sen. Pat Connick, R-Marrero, questioned the project’s timeline at the hearing on Wednesday, noting that the Mid-Barataria project had gone through a long permitting process and that Myrtle Grove would undergo the same.

He said it was “upsetting and shameful” that the state had spent so much money on a project just to “toss it away.”

“Now you're saying here today and the governor saying here today we can make it better. So that's going to be on you,” he added. “We’ll be watching.”

Simone Maloz, campaign director of Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a coastal advocacy coalition that supports Mid-Barataria, notes that the studies and cost estimates that support Myrtle Grove are likely outdated.

She pointed out that a version of the Myrtle Grove project was first considered in the mid-1980s. In 2005, the cost of the project was estimated to be $278 million, a price tag likely far out of date, Maloz said, and though the Corps studied it on and off over the years, the last published study was issued in 2013.

“In terms of coastal restoration, 2013 is a really long time ago,” she said. “That was before Ida ripped through that basin pretty well.”

Bureaucratic hurdles

The Corps, in a letter to Dove, began to lay out the process for restarting the Myrtle Grove diversion. The state would need to tell the Corps definitively that it plans to abandon Mid-Barataria and formally signal its intent to restart Myrtle Grove. Dove told lawmakers Wednesday that he has officially informed the Corps that the state plans to restart the Myrtle Grove project.

The state and the Corps would also have to come to a financial agreement in order to restart the environmental and technical studies for Myrtle Grove. The state would likely have to foot half the bill for those studies, which the Corps estimates would take three years and cost $3 million. The total costs of construction would be determined in the course of that study.

Dove said that Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement funds could be used to pay for the state’s share of those costs, but that would need to be approved by the trustees that oversee those funds.

“If the Myrtle Grove project’s benefits outweigh its costs, if it’s environmentally compliant and technically feasible, then we can make a recommendation to headquarters that can recommend it to Congress,” said Boyett of the Corps. “And then Congress can decide whether to fund it for construction.”

All of that will take years.

“Energy security is national security,” said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, adding that troops need reliable energy.

Kratsios said the U.S. has been the world leader in nuclear innovation in the past, but that in the last three decades, has only started and built two reactors. As of August 2023, the U.S. had 93 operating commercial nuclear reactors at 54 nuclear power plants across 28 states, with the average age of those reactors about 42 years old, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

A senior White House official also said the administration is hoping to test and deploy nuclear reactors before the president’s term concludes.

It’s not yet clear what the “substantial reorganization” of the National Reactor Commission would look like.

“Just like any substantial reorganization, there will be turnover and changes in roles,” one senior White House official said. “Total reduction in staff is undetermined at this point, but the executive orders do call for a substantial reorganization of the organization.”

The president was asked to address any concerns that speeding up the permitting process could affect safety.

The “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” passed the House by one vote, with votes predominantly falling along party lines . Two House Republicans, Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio, joined the entire House Democratic Caucus in voting against the bill.

Included in the package were provisions pushing Trump and Republicans’ policy around increasing domestic energy, timber and mineral production, and restoring the federal multiple-use mandate on public land. These were passed earlier this month through the House Natural Resources Committee, where Republicans claimed that the new oil and gas leases, energy development, and rollbacks of environmental protections in the bill could generate around $15 billion in savings.

In a recent interview with The Aspen Times, Republican U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd, who represents much of western Colorado and who voted to approve the final House bill, said it is “about finding balance” and approaching public lands “pragmatically.”

Hurd added that he believes the bill does a good job advancing the agenda he and other Republicans campaigned on. This includes his campaign promise that decisions around federal public lands should be made with the input and buy-in of those who would be affected as well as “making sure we unleash the energy agenda.”

“In areas, especially in Western and Southern Colorado, energy production isn’t just an issue — it’s a livelihood,” he said. “I think, when it comes to this reconciliation legislation, that we’re reflecting that mentality.”

U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Republican who represents the 4th Congressional District in eastern Colorado, issued a press release applauding the bill’s passage as “a​​ major step towards implementing the America First mandate voters delivered to us last November.”

“This critical legislation makes the Trump tax cuts permanent, unleashes American energy producers, invests billions in support of our farmers and ranchers by responsibly reforming SNAP benefits, strengthens Medicaid to focus on American citizens who truly need help, and delivers a final net deficit reduction of $1.5 trillion,” she stated.

House Democrats in the committee, who have criticized Trump’s reconciliation package as a way to fund tax cuts for billionaires, referred to the legislation as one of the most destructive and extreme anti-environment bills in the country’s history.

Some of the natural resource committee’s most controversial proposals — including a last-minute amendment that proposed the sale of over 500,000 acres of public land in Nevada and Utah — were stripped from the final version in a manager’s amendment.

Also removed from the bill was a section that would have repealed five resource management plans approved under former President Joe Biden, including two plans in Colorado for the Bureau of Land Management’s Colorado River Valley and Grand Junction field offices.

Colorado Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse fought against the plans’ removal from the package through a failed amendment at the committee hearing and after the hearing in a submission to the Rules Committee, according to an aide from his office. In a statement, Neguse said he was “proud that we were successful in our pursuit of removing the provision from the bill.”

“Republicans’ effort to overturn Resource Management Plans for two Bureau of Land Management field offices in Colorado was an attempt to roll back years-long community efforts, backed by public input and on-the-ground expertise,” he stated.

The two Colorado plans were finalized last fall , and according to the bureau, made around 85% of lands that have “high potential” open to future oil and gas leases, while closing “low and medium potential” areas to leases. The plans also extended wilderness protections and conservation areas.

Even with these changes, Democrats and environmental advocates are concerned about what remains in the package.

“I continue to be deeply concerned for the sweeping threats this bill still poses to critical conservation and public oversight programs,” Neguse stated.

Still included are proposed changes to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), including changes that would allow private entities to pay a fee and bypass public review; funding cuts to the National Park Service; mandating quarterly lease sales for oil and gas on federal land (including in Colorado); requiring offshore and Arctic drilling and more.

In a statement, Tracy Stone-Manning, president of The Wilderness Society, referred to what remains as “one big giveaway.”

“By opening hundreds of millions of acres to drilling, mining, and logging to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, this bill harms the tens of millions of people who like to hike, recreate, or find solace in the outdoors,” Stone-Manning stated.

Now, the big bill is heading to the Senate, where advocates are hopeful changes will continue to be made. Louis Geltman, the vice president of policy and government relations for the recreation member group Outdoor Alliance, said in a statement that the act is still “very bad for public lands and waters.”

“But at the same time, it’s really encouraging that a growing group of lawmakers are standing up for public lands, and that doesn’t happen without our community showing up,” Geltman stated. “We can continue to make a difference as this conversation shifts to the Senate.”

At a time when climate-related headlines often read like obituaries for our planet, Earth Day 2025 offered something rare – a reason for hope. Not the naïve optimism that suggests salvation is assured, but rather compelling evidence that we can make people act for good when we get the messaging right.

This lesson isn’t new – it’s been Earth Day’s secret weapon from the beginning. Earth Day started 55 years ago, in 1970, initially as a student-led campaign to demand action on cleaner air and water. Organizers picked April 22 to mark Earth Day as it fell between spring break and final exams and they were hoping this would maximize the greatest student participation.

There was no political litmus test to join the march. It wasn’t driven by climate scientists, policy experts, or environmental professionals. It saw a staggering 20 million everyday Americans out on the streets demonstrating —Democrats and Republicans, factory workers, teachers, farmers, firemen, parents, grandparents and college students—all united by a simple urgent message: we need clean air to breathe and clean water to drink.

This year proved that formula still works. When we unite behind a common cause, partisan-free with language that stops dividing people into “them” and “us,” we are far more effective at getting our message to stick.

A language of solutions

Earth Day 2025 focused on the universal benefits of renewable energy: millions of new jobs, greater energy independence and lower electricity bills. This clearly resonated, and here’s why: A recent Power Lines and Ipsos poll revealed in March, just weeks before Earth Day, that 73% of Americans worry about rising energy costs, with nearly two-thirds reporting higher gas and electric bills in the past year. More than 60% said they felt increased financial stress on their families due to rising energy costs. The concerns were noted across political affiliations.

We know that people have not stopped caring, they just needed to be invited back into the conversation again in language that resonates with their daily lives, in ways that make things more personal and immediate. By stripping away the notion that environmentalism requires ideological “belief” and instead showcasing tangible results, we give people space to embrace the reality— making it a kitchen table issue that impacts every single person’s life, wealth, and future. This approach mirrors that first Earth Day in 1970.

By listening to people’s fears and then offering solutions that actually create economic opportunities – rather than prophesying climate apocalypse — environmentalism made more sense again.

Action Matters

This year over 100 mayors and elected officials, across red and deep blue districts representing over 33.5 million Americans, hosted sustainability roundtables. From Boise, Idaho, to Gainesville, Florida, communities discussed how they can make smart climate decisions through the lens of local job creation, renewable energy and neighborhood cleanups.

Nashville, Tennessee is rapidly expanding clean energy production through rooftop solar installations on government buildings. Boise is leading Idaho’s clean energy transition with a goal of achieving 100% clean electricity by 2035, a fiscally responsible alternative to the $250 million annually that the community currently spends on energy. Mesquite, Texas, has attracted a Canadian Solar manufacturing plant to the area, generating over 1,500 new jobs.

College campuses saw a 60% increase in Earth Day events over 2024, with the universities of Loyola, Southern Florida, Alabama, Utah, Arizona, and many more joining the growing chorus of students marking Earth Day.

For those of us in this movement, we have to keep showing up on Main Street. This doesn’t mean compromising on science or ambition. It means all of us in the movement have to speak in a language broad enough to build large-scale unity and respect.

The first Earth Day in 1970 launched a movement from the ground up that cleaned America’s air and water through landmark bipartisan legislation. The world followed suit. We need to return to that same inclusive approach — and none too soon. The present administration is already slashing safeguards on water quality. That is an issue every single parent will care about. We need to make sure we take this message to every mayor’s town hall meeting and every parent association meeting too.

We need determination and the strength of solutions, not slogans. Earth Day is proof that when we get the message right, Americans are ready to act.

Here, we bring you the latest reports from the GPB newsroom. On today's episode, energy advocates warn President Trump's new spending bill could hurt Georgia's green energy industry. A scathing new report details problems with Augusta's VA healthcare system. And Momocon is this weekend in Atlanta, and it finds its economic strength in its diverse fan base.

Thomas Smith: It lends itself to people who are into lots of different elements of fantasy, adventure, things of this nature. The right combination of fans.

Peter Biello: Today is Friday, May 23rd. I'm Peter Biello, and this is Georgia Today.

Story 1:

Peter Biello: The multi-trillion dollar package of tax breaks and spending cuts approved by the U.S. House yesterday would gut clean energy initiatives enacted under the Biden administration. Environmental advocates are warning the measure threatens to upend Georgia's position as a powerhouse in green energy manufacturing. GPB's Grant Blankenship has more.

Grant Blankenship: Perhaps no other state in the nation has seen growth in clean energy manufacturing and jobs like Georgia, nurtured largely through the Inflation Reduction Act. Kristina Costa served as director of the Office of Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation under President Joe Biden. She says while the current budget reconciliation process doesn't repeal the IRA outright, It could hinder the way the IRA is used.

Kristina Costa: We had, in the Inflation Reduction Act, an approach to onshoring American manufacturing that was working, you know, in Georgia, because many of those facilities are located in Georgia. And this would just throw all of that into chaos.

Grant Blankenship: The vote in Georgia's House delegation broke along party lines, with yeas even from Republicans whose districts have seen explosive green job growth. For GPB News, I'm Grant Blankenship in Macon.

Story 2:

Peter Biello: A scathing federal report details multiple problems affecting employees and patients at the Department of Veterans Affairs' health care system in Augusta. The U.S. Office of Inspector General released the report yesterday. The agency inspector who worked on it, Julie Kroviak, says the system's management treated its staff in ways that were...

Julie Kroviak: ...unprofessional, rude, condescending, inappropriate in their communication style, retaliatory, which is a huge red flag. When your staff feel that if they say something, they're going to be punished, that sweeps culture below zero.

Peter Biello: The report also details staff and supply shortages. It was based on a routine inspection in September. Since then, the systems director and another top official have been reassigned. The Augusta VA cares for patients at facilities in East Georgia and parts of South Carolina.

Story 3:

Peter Biello: Appalachee High School graduating seniors received their diplomas last night, eight months after a deadly mass shooting devastated the community. Class valedictorian Kaylee Spencer offered her fellow classmates words of encouragement, hope and perseverance.

Kaylee Spencer: We carry our parts and baggages in certain situations, a restless night due to studying, working, trying to help pay family bills, conflicts and friendships, and ultimately what happened on September 4th all travels through us throughout the school day. Yet we are all here today, looking towards whatever comes next.

Peter Biello: A student, Colt Gray, is accused of killing four people in the shooting.

Story 4:

Peter Biello: State policymakers need better data on data centers. That's according to industry watchdogs who spoke to state lawmakers yesterday. A legislative panel is studying the impact these centers have on Georgia's electricity and water supplies. Relatively inexpensive land, power, and water, and extensive broadband are making Georgia a leading state for the energy and water-hungry sites, but Amy Sharma of Science for Georgia told lawmakers they still don't have reliable data about their impact.

Amy Sharma: We have zero concrete numbers about them. And so how are you guys supposed to plan for the future if you don't actually know what you got right now? And these are easy questions that their accountant should be able to answer. How much water do you use? How much did you pay for your water?

Peter Biello: Tax incentives for the centers cost the state millions of dollars a year in revenue while providing relatively few jobs. The committee is scheduled to hold hearings across the state this summer.

Story 5:

Peter Biello: Emory Healthcare is saying its Hillendale Hospital in metro Atlanta's DeKalb County has become the nation's first to be fully powered by Apple products integrated into Epic, the national electronic records giant behind MyChart. The integration continues Apple's push into the healthcare sector, long dominated by PCs. Emory says the move is about efficiency and patient experience.

Story 6:

Peter Biello: Momocon, a conference for fans of gaming, animation, cosplay, and comics, kicks off its 20th anniversary this week in Atlanta. Over the years, it's grown from a 700-person on-campus event to the largest such event, where you'll see costumed attendees celebrating Japanese anime, Star Wars, Dungeons & Dragons, and maybe even your favorite character from a Netflix series. But this year, event planners are expecting more than the 56,000 people who attended last year, and they'll be bringing more than costumes and 20-sided die. They'll be bringing their wallets. With me now to talk about the economic impact of MomoCon is economist Thomas Smith, professor in the practice of finance at Emory University Goizueta Business School. Welcome to the program.

Thomas Smith: Thank you very much. I'm glad to be here.

Peter Biello: So what segments of Atlanta's economy stand to benefit the most, do you think, from a conference like Momocon?

Thomas Smith: I think it's important to at least mention that this is an Atlanta-based company. This is a family that started this conference, and unlike other conferences or even other events that come to town, where you're likely to have a larger lion's share of money leaving as the corporate foundation leaves town, this is staying here because they're from Atlanta. That's why I think it's so important to note that it's gonna have an economic impact. So the areas are going to be, of course, entertainment in and around the convention center. So transportation, hotels, dining, things of that nature. But there are gonna be ancillary effects that are hitting a lot of Centennial Park. I do know some events are gonna taking place. People are gonna to be hitting the sky wheel and things of the nature. So, I mean, there's lots of ancillary elements they're going to receive money because of this.

Peter Biello: And what do you think the planners of Momocon get right to help it grow to the extent that it has?

Thomas Smith: The conference lends itself to lots of different audiences, right? It is specific enough in terms of gaming—not only electronic but also you mentioned the tabletop games which I think is important—but lots of characters and the cosplay element. I think it lends itself to people who are into lots of elements of fantasy, of adventure, things of this nature. And they just hit the nail on the head in terms of finding the right combination of fans. And one of the things you should note is that Momocon isn't anywhere else. It's only in Atlanta. So unlike DragonCon or Comic Con, which may be, you know, across the country in LA and Vegas and what have you, no, Momocan is only in the Atlanta. So you've got a huge footprint.

Peter Biello: Are there ripple effects for people who depend on Atlanta's economy to do well? To put it another way, if you don't attend MomoCon, do you somehow reap a secondhand benefit?

Thomas Smith: Well, the economic multiplier does work in these kind of events, and that's because a lot of the money stays in place. If you're driving an Uber, if you've got a restaurant, if got a hotel, and ten MARTAs going to see a lot people, you now, jumping on the train and going downtown, lots of opportunities for people to walk around afterwards. And so the event, even though at the Georgia World Congress Center, it's going to sort of splash across most of the downtown Atlanta area. Fifty thousand people, 60,000 people, a lot of people are staying in town, and as a result, you're going to see people going out in the evenings, grabbing a bite to eat and things like that. So the ripple effect is going to hit a lot in the entertainment sector.

Peter Biello: I know you have prior commitments so you won't be able to attend Momocon, but if you could, what would be the draw for you? Is it the tabletop games? Is it dressing up like something? What do you think?

Thomas Smith: My daughter and her friends are going. My older son is going. He's actually even taking my grandson to the event. So I think if I was going, I would wanna hang out with my 11-year-old grandson, Harrison, and see him enjoy it. I think the tabletop game area, they're gonna have an entire room for tabletop games. I think that that's an awesome opportunity to sit down, enjoy a game that you like, and you can play it with. There's gonna be people from all 50 states, there's gonna people from dozens and dozens of countries. I mean people come from all over the world for this event because it's the only place where this event is held. So I think sitting down at the tabletop game with someone from Germany or someone from Brazil or something like that would be a hoot.

Peter Biello: A wonderful chance to make friends from across the world right here in Atlanta.

Thomas Smith: Absolutely, and what better medium to do it than a conference where you could dress up like your favorite character from Star Wars if you wanted to.

Peter Biello: Thomas Smith is an economist and professor in the practice of finance at Emory University Goizueta Business School. Thank you so much for speaking with me.

Thomas Smith: Thank you, sir.

Story 7:

Peter Biello: In Georgia sports, in baseball, Ronald Acuna, Jr. Is ready to make his season debut for the Atlanta Braves tonight. The Braves announced last night that 2023 National League MVP Acuna will return from a knee injury that has sidelined the star outfielder for nearly a year. The Bravers open a three game series against the San Diego Padres tonight. Chris Sale is expected to get the start for the Braves. And in women's basketball, the Indiana Fever overcame Caitlin Clark's unusually lackluster long-distance shooting to beat the Atlanta Dream 81 to 76 in Atlanta last night. Clark missed all five of her three-point attempts, the first time she's failed to score a three-pointer in three years.

The new target implies a downside of about 20% based on Thursday’s closing price at $10.44.

The firm maintained the Underperform rating on the stock as it expects a “weaker” second half of the year due to “production cuts and tariff headwinds.”

Late last year, the Detroit automaker announced a cut of 14% on its workforce that would affect factories in Germany and the UK, citing losses caused by weak demand and insufficient government support regarding electric vehicles.

Analyst Daniel Roeska said in a new research note that the first half of the year “drives optimism,” with Ford’s positive first quarter and likely “continued strength” in the second one.

However, commenting on the June-December period, the analyst said it “is already in reverse.”

Ford reported a sharp drop in first-quarter earnings, with revenue totaling $40.66 billion and net income plunging 72% to $552 million.

Automotive revenue came in at $37.42 billion, $1.21 billion above the Wall Street consensus. The company burned through $2.22 billion in cash, the largest outflow since 2021.

Citing uncertainty over the tariff scenario, the company suspended its financial forecast as it reported its first quarter financial results. It expects a $1.5 billion hit from Donald Trump’s 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts.

On the earnings call following the report, CEO Jim Farley mentioned “ongoing cooperation (…) with the [Trump] administration.”

Ford’s domestic production stands at 77%, importing 23% mostly from Canada and Mexico. Reuters reported earlier this month that the automaker was raising prices up to $2,000 for vehicles produced in Mexico after May 2, which includes the fully electric Mustang Mach-E, the Bronco SUV and the Maverick pickup.

Earlier this month, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that “USMCA [United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement] parts will not carry tariffs, no change in that approach.”

Daniel Roeska’s note pointed out that “tariff mitigation efforts, BEV production discipline and strong performance from Ford Credit present the company with some options to steer through forthcoming market uncertainty.”

Ford’s EV unit ‘Model e’ reported a first-quarter EBIT loss of $849 million, with the company saying its arm “remains focused on improving gross margins and exercising a disciplined approach to investments in battery facilities and next-generation products.”

Berstein lowered their Ford‘s earnings per share (EPS) forecast by 5.8% to $1.66, citing “a lower tariff impact in 2025 than previously estimated,” as the U.S. is negotiating tariff rates with several countries.

On Friday, Donald Trump wrote on social media that he is “recommending a straight 50% tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025” causing a market slump across most industries.

The U.S. President added that “there is no tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States.”",https://i0.wp.com/eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-Mustang-Mach-E-Premium-Sport-Appearance-Package_03_converted.webp?fit=1200%2C690&quality=80&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-23 20:08:20.462555

16th District Republican Congressman Darin LaHood of Dunlap spoke about the bill in East Peoria on Thursday, after it passed by one vote in the House earlier in the morning.

LaHood says issues with SALT, Medicaid, and tax credits were solved in the final moments before the bill’s passage in the House. It now moves to the Senate, where he says the House worked with that chamber on most of the bill and expects it to pass there as well.

LaHood says without the passage of the bill, around $4.5 trillion in taxes would have gone in place. He says reforms in the bill include areas such as energy production, environmental reform, as well as some of the executive orders from President Trump regarding the southern border.

Some of the taxes LaHood says were cut or eliminated include taxes on tips, overtime, Social Security, and car loans.

“These are provisions that help working people that President Trump wanted to prioritize, and I think are important,” LaHood said. “So when people say ‘oh these are benefits for the rich,’ that’s in fact not true. It benefits working people throughout my district.”

LaHood says he would have liked to see more support for energy production tax credits, citing electric vehicle maker Rivian and nuclear plant sites in his district.

LaHood says safety nets for Medicaid continue in the bill, to keep the “backbone and structure” of who needs it on it.

“Really a social safety net for people with disabilities, senior citizens, single moms, people that cannot afford to have a birth that need Medicaid, that’s still going to be in this bill, we protect that,” LaHood said.

LaHood says there’s provisions in the bill to move people who can work off of Medicaid.

Neighboring 17th District Democratic Congressman Eric Sorensen of Moline says he voted no on the bill. He claims the bill takes away Medicaid ”so the rich can get a big break on their taxes.”",https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/2326/files/2023/03/20230302-090934-scaled-e1677774816644-1000x630.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 19:08:39.045079

The orders represented the president’s latest foray into the policy underlying America’s electricity supply.
Nuclear does not carry oil and gas’s carbon emissions, but produces radioactive waste that the United States lacks a facility to permanently store.
This is going to turn the clock back on over 50 years of overregulation of an industry,” the interior secretary, Doug Burgum, said at an Oval Office event where Trump signed the orders.

The orders represented the president’s latest foray into the policy underlying America’s electricity supply. Trump declared a national energy emergency on his first day in office over and moved to undo a ban implemented by Joe Biden on new natural gas export terminals and expand oil and gas drilling in Alaska.

Nuclear does not carry oil and gas’s carbon emissions, but produces radioactive waste that the United States lacks a facility to permanently store. Some environmental groups have safety concerns over the reactors and their supply chain.

Trump signed four orders intended to speed up the approval of nuclear reactors for defense and AI purposes, reform the Nuclear Regulatory Commission with the goal of quadrupling production of electricity over the next 25 years, revamp the regulatory process to have three experimental reactors operating by 4 July 2026 and boost investment in the technology’s industrial base.

“Mark this day on your calendar. This is going to turn the clock back on over 50 years of overregulation of an industry,” the interior secretary, Doug Burgum, said at an Oval Office event where Trump signed the orders.

“President Trump here today has committed to energy dominance, and part of that energy dominance is that we’ve got enough electricity to win the AI arms race with China.”

High-profile accidents at nuclear plants in the United States and abroad stirred public opposition to nuclear energy in decades past, but Trump described the technology as “very safe”.

However, the effort of the “department of government efficiency” to downsize the federal workforce has created snafus like the temporary firings of some employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the US nuclear arsenal. It is also feared to hamper a long-running nuclear waste cleanup operation in Washington state.

In Congress, Trump’s Republican allies have moved to implement his energy policies and repeal Biden’s.

A sprawling tax-and-spending bill the House of Representatives passed this week changes the rules for tax incentives created under Biden for renewable energy power plants to make them available only for projects that begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment, and are completed by 2028.

With planned cuts totaling billions of dollars, the two agency chiefs outlined their priorities during a pair of congressional hearings May 21.

Energy Secretary Christopher Wright said he aims to “unleash a golden era of American energy dominance, strengthen national security and lead the world in energy innovation."" The 2026 White House budget request would cut the department budget by $4.7 billion compared to this year.

“The Dept. of Energy will advance these critical missions while cutting red tape, increasing efficiency and unleashing innovation and ensuring we are better stewards of taxpayer dollars,” Wright said.

Planned cuts include $15.2 billion in unobligated funds from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to various renewable energy, carbon dioxide emissions, electric vehicle and battery storage programs. Another $2.6 billion would be cut from energy efficiency and renewable energy programs to reorient them away from climate change and environmental justice focus, and $1.1 billion would be eliminated from climate change-related research.

The budget proposal also targets additional research funds, the federal program managing cleanup sites and other areas. The reduced budget will enable Energy to return “to its core mission of advancing energy innovation and global competitiveness through research and development,” Wright said.

Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), chair of the Senate energy and water development subcommittee, praised the planned cuts, saying that department spending “is unsustainable.” Its budget climbed from $61 billion in 2021 to $160 billion this year.

“That’s pretty dramatic,” he said. “And I know your skinny budget is addressing some of that. I hope we can address the spending with a scalpel, not a meat ax. But we’re going to have to address it.”

Other lawmakers expressed concern about the level of cuts. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), ranking member on the subcommittee, called the spending plan “completely inadequate.” She and other members questioned Wright about canceled grants, unpaid invoices and staff buyouts and firings.

“We must give the programs DOE manages their due in terms of funding and in terms of oversight necessary to make sure that funding actually gets to our communities,” Murray said. “But I believe those goals are in jeopardy because of some of your actions over the last few months, like a truly sweeping funding freeze, unprecedented contract cancellations, mass staffing reductions and uncertainty that is hurting communities across our country.”

EPA Cuts

The budget proposal would cut $5 billion from EPA. Administrator Lee Zeldin highlighted its work completing a cleanup after the Los Angeles wildfires, addressing PFAS contamination, advancing redevelopment at 21 Superfund sites and completing 25 State Implementation Plans. He said the agency is making moves to reduce regulatory costs.

The White House budget request for EPA calls for nearly $2.5 billion to be cut from the clean and drinking water state revolving loan funds, $1 billion from EPA’s categorical grant programs, $254 million from the Superfund program and $235 million from the Office of Research and Development.

“By reducing EPA’s budget by billions of dollars, the president’s fiscal year 2026 budget demands maximum efficiency ... while we continue to fulfill all of our statutory obligations,” Zeldin said.

However, senators on the committee raised concerns about the extent of the cuts and about grant funding that EPA has terminated. Questioning between some Democrats and Zeldin turned argumentative at times as they asked about canceled grant awards, the agency’s move to terminate the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and reorganization within EPA research offices.

“EPA’s actions have made families worse off, ignored science and eroded America’s trust in your agency—and all for the benefit of polluters,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I), ranking member on the Senate environment and public works committee. “The ongoing destruction at EPA violates legal contracts, violates the Constitution, violates the rule of law and flouts many court orders.”

Even some Republicans shared reservations about the extent of the cuts while voicing support for the agency’s moves to rescind Biden-era regulations. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), chair of the environment and public works committee, said EPA “restored accountability to grant programs” but added that nonpartisan programs to help ensure clean air, water and lands would be impacted by the proposed budget if enacted, including an 89% cut to the clean and drinking water State Revolving Funds, which put money toward infrastructure projects.

“I and many of my colleagues have long been vocal about the importance of federal assistance for water infrastructure through the State Revolving Funds,” Capito said.",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/05/23/Christopher_Wright_ENRweb.jpg?height=635&t=1748028254&width=1200,N,,2025-05-23 18:09:22.655055

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report on Thursday that said the Trump administration violated the Impoundment Control Act by blocking spending on electric vehicle charging stations.

The $5 billion in funding was from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Act. Blocking the spending has put construction projects planned by states into limbo. The GAO said the Trump administration needed to go through a formal rescissions process — where Congress agrees to the cuts — in order to stop the spending, rather than unilaterally cutting it off.

Trump's budget director Russ Vought on social media dismissed the GAO report — and other similar GAO investigations — saying they were ""non-events with no consequence. Rearview mirror stuff.""

""They are going to call everything an impoundment because they want to grind our work to manage taxpayer dollars effectively to a halt,"" Vought said.

A spokesperson for the Department of Transportation told NPR that the GAO report ""shows a complete misunderstanding of the law"" but they added that the department is reviewing and updating the guidance on the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program ""because the implementation of NEVI has failed miserably.""

This is the newest salvo in a fight about government spending

Under the Constitution, Congress has the power of the purse. After funding disputes with President Richard Nixon, Congress passed the Impoundment Control Act in 1974 that requires presidents to spend money as Congress directs.

Trump said on the campaign trail that he would challenge that law — and Vought, who also led the Office of Management and Budget in Trump's first term, has long championed this fight.

Vought has argued the 1974 law is unconstitutional. In Trump's first term, he was involved in an effort to block aid to Ukraine — a move that Congress pushed back against, and which eventually led to Democrats' first impeachment of Trump. On Friday, Vought accused the GAO of being partisan because of its role during that debate.

In Trump's second term, the issue is expected to eventually head to the Supreme Court.

Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who is the vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a statement that Trump is breaking the law by blocking the funding passed by Congress.

""I don't care about Russ Vought's personal interpretation of our spending laws; the Constitution is clear, and President Trump simply does not have the power of the purse — Congress does,"" Murray said.

As of April, the GAO was looking into 39 other potential instances of impoundment under the Trump administration.

Guest Blog

I first learned about climate change when I was in the eighth grade at my public middle school in Atlanta. The evidence back then was already clear: the fossil fuels we burn to power our buildings and transportation were causing the climate to change.

As my science teacher illustrated future climate projections on the blackboard, I remember thinking that surely the way we power our system would change by the time I grew up.

That was more than 30 years ago. Average temperatures have already climbed 2 degrees. And while more people than ever care about climate and are taking individual steps to reduce their carbon footprints, we still haven’t made the systemic change required to solve the problem.

Now that my own children are learning the truth about climate change, I want their experience to be different from mine. I want them to understand the problem and to know the adults they rely on–their parents, their school district, their government–are actually addressing it. Imagine what they could learn from that!

On the heels of the Athens-Clarke County government taking the bold step in 2017 to adopt a 100% clean and renewable energy plan for all public facilities, I began to wonder how our school district could opt into that plan. Our schools and buses are public facilities so it only made sense to me. I began meeting with local clean energy advocates and individual members of our school board to brainstorm.

Taking Action at the School District?

In the meantime, a group of students at my son’s middle school had begun advocating for solar panels on the roof of their soon-to-be constructed new school building. Their action provided the impetus for me to draft a clean energy resolution and present it before the Clarke County School Board.

As a result, the board appointed an ad hoc committee of community members, district staff, teachers, students and sustainability experts from the University of Georgia and the local government to provide recommendations to minimize risks and maximize opportunities for our students related to climate resilience.

Serving on the transportation subcommittee of this group opened my eyes to the immediate health impacts of bus emissions, learning that fossil fuel air pollution is responsible for 1 in 5 deaths worldwide. Children riding on diesel buses are exposed to 4 times more air pollutants than the general population. Diesel exhaust can cause respiratory illness, chronic respiratory inflammation, and trigger asthma attacks. Children are especially vulnerable to any air pollution because their lungs are still growing and they breathe more air for their body size than adults.

School buses also contribute an outsized amount to Georgia’s greenhouse gas emissions. Nearly one million children attend K-12 public schools in Georgia, and 55% of those children ride buses to school. Replacing one diesel school bus with an electric bus is estimated to eliminate 54,000 pounds of carbon dioxide annually, according to Drawdown Georgia.

The statistics are universal, but when your kids ride the bus, the desire for a healthier alternative is personal. So many of my kids’ classmates suffer from asthma exacerbated by poor air quality. Our Athens-Clarke County transit runs hybrid buses, and UGA began adopting electric buses in 2019. The fact that Clarke County’s K-12 students still ride on predominantly diesel buses feels like an injustice.

I found other advocates addressing that injustice through SACE, Moms Clean Air Force, and Mothers and Others for Clean Air. These organizations helped me understand how our district could afford electric buses with the help of the EPA’s Clean Bus Program.

Our advocacy resulted in the district purchasing its first two electric buses, which will serve as a pilot program to monitor their performance, range, charging times, and maintenance needs. The district will use that data to inform future bus purchases.

Funding and Progress Threatened

Now that the federal funding for the Clean Bus Program is threatened, the urgency to advocate is greater than ever. When I had the opportunity to visit Senator Ossoff’s office last week for World Asthma Day, I took my kids out of school to experience a day of advocacy with me. We thanked Ossoff for his past support and asked that he continue fighting for the release of the clean bus funds that were approved and appropriated through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021.

It’s unprecedented and illegal that the executive branch could withhold public funding that has already been appropriated. School districts have already worked these funds into their budgets, kids need these buses and the buses are already in production in plants based here in the Southeast.

With so much at stake, we must continue to build coalitions of folks who understand that fighting climate change offers a powerful way to address other issues like health and safety, equity, and economic development. There’s truly a seat for everyone at this table, and there is strength in numbers. Ever since I brought kids into this world, climate action has felt like an act of love. We have a moral responsibility to create a safe and healthy climate for our children, and so we must demand action from our government.",http://www.cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/DSC02831.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 17:10:48.841150

The US has no commercial nuclear plants under construction, with the last two plants to have been brought online being Vogtle-3 and -4 in Georgia, in 2023 and 2024 respectively.

Dozens of startups and established nuclear firms have been in recent years working towards preparing the development and deployment of small and advanced reactors as the eventual future backbone of nuclear power in the US.

This year, as many buyers have veered away from Tesla, the percentage of EV sales could drop.

In China, more than half of new car sales last year were all-electric.","Four years ago, GM set an audacious goal: By 2035, the automaker planned to go all-electric.

The company says it’s still aiming for that target. But it simultaneously lobbied the Senate to end California’s ban on new gas car sales—which was also supposed to go fully into effect in 2035. In theory, California’s policy should have supported GM’s transition.

GM even recruited employees in the lobbying effort. “We need your help!” the company wrote in an email to staff, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. “Emissions standards that are not aligned with market realities pose a serious threat to our business by undermining consumer choice and vehicle affordability.”

The lobbying worked. Yesterday, the Senate voted to revoke an Environmental Protection Agency waiver that allowed California to set clean air rules that are stricter than national standards. (Congress arguably didn’t have the legal right to revoke the waiver; more on that later.)

In a statement, the company said, “GM appreciates Congress’ action to align emissions standards with today’s market realities. We have long advocated for one national standard that will allow us to stay competitive, continue to invest in U.S. innovation, and offer customer choice across the broadest lineup of gas-powered and electric vehicles.”

GM CEO Mary Barra has said that the company believes in an all-electric future. The company, which began seriously investing in battery design in 2018, spent $11 billion on EV infrastructure between 2020 and 2024. It has a massive battery factory, co-owned with LG Energy, near Nashville, and another in Ohio, making thousands of battery cells per minute. It’s racing to bring down the cost of batteries, the biggest factor in the overall cost of EVs.

In the first quarter of this year, GM sold 31,887 EVs in the U.S., a 94% increase over its electric vehicle sales in the same period last year. It’s now the second-largest seller of EVs in the U.S., quickly gaining on Tesla. The company plans to nearly double the number of EVs it makes this year compared to last. It has 11 models on the market, including the Chevy Equinox EV, currently the most affordable EV in the country. The popular Chevy Bolt, another affordable EV, will come back later this year.

But the company argues that California’s clean car rule is moving faster than market demand. The rule sets targets that automakers have to hit each year. For model year 2026 cars, 35% of a manufacturer’s car sales in the state have to be zero-emission, or the manufacturer has to pay a fine. The target jumps up to 43% in 2027, 51% in 2028, and keeps going until new cars are 100% zero-emission by 2035. Last year, in California, around 25% of new cars registered in the state were electric. This year, as many buyers have veered away from Tesla, the percentage of EV sales could drop. GM declined to comment on whether it expects to hit the 35% target for model year 2026 cars in the state.

Other states have followed California’s regulation, with the same annual targets: Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. Those states have even lower percentages of EV sales now. Car companies say it would be unrealistic for them to immediately meet the targets for model year 2026 that those states require.

Critics argue that if demand is lower than expected, automakers themselves bear some responsibility. “That’s like the kid who says, ‘Look, I didn’t study for the test, and it’s unfair that you’re giving me a bad grade,'” says Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign at the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, noting that GM has “the best engineers in the world. They know how to make vehicles that meet standards and that are attractive to consumers. And they’ve chosen not to market their electric vehicles. . . . The auto industry in the United States spends $14 billion a year on advertising and other marketing. Very little of that goes to advertising electric vehicles.”

EVs are facing other major challenges. The House just voted to phase out the $7,500 tax credits to buy or lease new EVs (companies that have not yet sold 200,000 EVs will be able to continue to qualify for the credits until the end of 2026; GM has already passed that limit). The House bill also ends a $4,000 tax credit for used cars that was introduced in the Inflation Reduction Act, and another tax credit for home chargers. Since EVs haven’t quite reached price parity with gas cars, the tax credits are crucial.

Car companies are also facing steep costs from tariffs. The California rules could cost the company billions at a time when profits are already being squeezed by tariffs—and that’s money that the company needs to continue to be able to invest in EV development to bring costs down. GM is still losing money making EVs, though costs are decreasing as production scales up and the technology continues to advance.

The Senate vote on California isn’t definitive. The Senate parliamentarian ruled that Congress didn’t have the authority to overturn the waiver that allows California to make its own clean air rules. Waivers aren’t included in the Congressional Review Act, the law that the Senate used to revoke the waiver. (The CRA allows Congress to overturn recent laws with a simple majority vote; the waiver was also granted in 2022 and would also not be considered recent.)

“Congress doesn’t get to amend [laws] along the way by saying, ‘Oh, well, we really meant it to be this,” says Becker. “It’s a Pandora’s box that they’re opening. If the CRA isn’t limited to rules, then you’ve opened the door as to what can be undone by the congressional action—corporate mergers that are allowed by the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission], cost-of-living adjustments by different agencies, offshore drilling permits—who knows how this will ultimately be used. And the Republicans will not always be in charge.”

California now plans to sue the Trump administration when Trump signs off on the law. “That will result in uncertainty for the industry,” Becker says. “They keep saying they want certainty. And they’re getting rid of it by demanding that Congress use an illegal mechanism to undo protections for people with lungs.”

Meanwhile, EVs are growing faster outside the United States. Globally, more than one in four cars sold this year is likely to be an EV. In China, more than half of new car sales last year were all-electric. In Norway, 97% of all cars sold last month were electric. As federal support reverses in the U.S., American automakers will fall behind.

Speaking of the Senate, Republicans can lose only three votes as some look to scale back changes to the IRA, James Bikales and Kelsey Tamborrino write.","Remember how the government was going to help America become an electric vehicle superpower? On Thursday, Congress said that’s over.

The Republican message was crystal clear. The Senate voted to kill the waiver that California relied on to require a giant ramp-up of EV sales. Meanwhile, the House passed a budget reconciliation bill that would methodically destroy the incentives that the Biden administration had used to support EVs, as I wrote today.

Depending on one’s view, these actions amounted to a correction of Democrats’ meddling in the auto market, or a historic retreat from leadership in climate-friendly technology.

Big U-turn

The killing of the waiver created a surge of relief among automakers and dealers, who saw California’s Advanced Clean Cars II rule — adopted also by 11 other states — as requiring automakers to produce far more EVs than customers are now interested in buying.

The House’s rollbacks didn’t evince that kind of celebration. The politics are trickier. Automakers, after all, have invested billions of dollars to produce EVs, assuming the government would have their back by offering tax breaks for vehicle purchases and battery factories.

America’s EV sales declined last month, according to Cox Automotive. Nonetheless, automakers presume that interest will rebound as batteries get cheaper and charging stations become more common. That job becomes harder if the House gets its way and ends tax breaks —for batteries and charging stations.

A crucial part of the House bill reflects sharp partisan differences in strategy over China.

The House essentially voted to forbid Chinese content in EV batteries. That’s a departure from the Biden approach, which was to require less Chinese content each year, stepping up domestic capacity while weaning off China as the globe’s overwhelmingly dominant battery supplier. The approach that Republicans adopted — more of a crash diet — “undermines efforts to build robust, secure and reliable access to critical minerals,” said Ben Prochazka, the executive director of the Electrification Coalition, a pro-EV nonprofit.

Still not the end of the road?

Nothing that happened Thursday is the last word. California immediately went to court to challenge the Senate’s reversal of California’s waiver. And the Senate counts some Republicans who object to voiding EV subsidies, because that would forestall new battery and automaking jobs back home.

Meanwhile on Thursday, a different Trump-inspired campaign against EV subsidies took an intriguing turn.

The Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, accused Trump’s Department of Transportation of acting illegally when it shut off states’ access to $5 billion in congressionally approved money for building EV charging stations.

Trump’s budget chief dismissed the GAO finding as a “non-event,” but it could preview a conflict down the road if Congress takes umbrage at Trump usurping the legislative branch’s spending decisions.

“It could be that this is one of the programs that brings a crazy battle between the executive branch and what powers it has,” said Loren McDonald, an analyst for the EV data consultancy Paren.

EPA’s ‘gold bars’ quest gets complicated

The Environmental Protection Agency’s bid to claw back billions in climate finance grants is facing internal contradictions as it continues, Jean Chemnick writes.

Administrator Lee Zeldin claimed again this week that the funds are being withheld because of fraud and misconduct. Meanwhile, Justice Department lawyers defending EPA’s move have downplayed any malfeasance in court.

“To be clear, we’re not accusing anybody of fraud,” Yaakov Roth, an acting assistant attorney general, told a U.S. Court of Appeals panel in D.C. in a Monday hearing. “I don’t want to suggest otherwise.”

Climate advocates regroup for Senate fight

Climate action defenders are pinning their hopes on the Senate after moderate House Republicans who had defended renewable energy tax credits voted in favor of their chamber’s budget reconciliation megabill, Kelsey Brugger and Andres Picon write.

The bill that passed Thursday took a sledgehammer to a host of green incentives included in the Democrats’ 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Some Republican senators have been skeptical of dramatic changes to the IRA.

“We’re going to urge our supporters in the Senate to make significant changes to this bill,” said Frank Macchiarola, vice president of the American Clean Power Association.

Changes coming?

Speaking of the Senate, Republicans can lose only three votes as some look to scale back changes to the IRA, James Bikales and Kelsey Tamborrino write.

The upper chamber is expected to moderate the version passed by the House.

“We have a lot of work that we need to do on the timeline and scope of the production and investment tax credits,” said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.). “Undoubtedly, there’s going to be changes.”

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued a modified NPDES permit to Ocean Era for the proposed Velella Epsilon offshore fish farm, located approximately 40 miles off the Sarasota County coast. The project has sparked widespread opposition from environmental groups and local communities for the significant risks it poses to water quality, marine life, and coastal resilience.

The EPA issued this modified permit in response to Ocean Era's request to alter the initial project, changing the type of fish and facility to be used. During the public comment period, organizations including Suncoast Waterkeeper, Food & Water Watch, Sierra Club Florida, Center for Food Safety, Recirculating Farms, and others submitted extensive comments raising serious concerns about the farm's environmental impacts.

The project threatens to worsen nutrient pollution in an area already vulnerable to harmful algal blooms like red tide, which have devastated the Suncoast's ecosystems and economy. While the modified permit reduces the number of fish and projected nutrient discharge, advocates warn that even small-scale operations can have substantial negative impacts—especially in sensitive areas.

""It's worrisome how we even got to this point when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) found the Florida Gulf Coast unsuitable for aquaculture due to concerns regarding environmental suitability especially with pollution, disease, proximity to sensitive habitats, and harmful algal bloom risks. Industrial fish farming just doesn't make sense for the Suncoast,"" states Dr. Abbey Tyrna, Waterkeeper and Executive Director of Suncoast Waterkeeper

Additional concerns include risks from hurricane damage, microplastic and monofilament pollution, negligent release of produced fish, and threats to endangered species such as sea turtles. The EPA's responses largely deferred responsibility to Ocean Era, stating the company must ensure facility stability and protected species monitoring.

Marianne Cufone, Executive Director and Counsel for Recirculating Farms said, ""It's so disappointing to see the Environmental Protection Agency approve a permit for a widely opposed offshore finfish aquaculture project in U.S. waters. The Gulf states are already dealing with spinning and dying smalltooth sawfish and rays, massive coral die off, giant mats of rotting sargassum, algal blooms, and a dead zone. We simply cannot handle more pollution in our ocean waters.""

""As a resident of Nokomis, FL, I am acutely aware of how nearly every ordinary rainy-season flow of land-based nutrient pollution into the gulf fuels the Red Tide that brings dead fish strewn (and the concomitant stench) across our beaches that destroys our quality of life and property values, and runs tourists and their money away. What were they thinking when they decided to plague us with a new source of year-round pollution that is placed directly in the water? It is as if they've decided to completely destroy our local economy!"" said Cris Costello, Senior Organizing Manager, Sierra Club Florida.

In other responses, the EPA cited the small scale and duration of the project to reason that the environmental impact would not warrant further review. However, as stated in an EPA response, Velella Epsilon ""was designed by the applicant to be a small, pilot-scale demonstration project that would help assess the viability of aquaculture in the Gulf…on a larger scale"". Opponents stress that the precedent it sets could enable larger, more harmful operations in the future.

""The EPA's decision to approve this permit for the Velella Epsilon project is deeply disappointing and dangerous. Industrial aquaculture operations like this introduce pollution, threaten native fish populations with disease and genetic disruption, and put Gulf Coast communities that rely on clean water and healthy fisheries at risk. This project is a gateway for the expansion of factory fish farms in our open waters. The Gulf is already burdened by pollution and climate impacts; adding floating industrial feedlots to the mix is irresponsible and shortsighted. We urge federal agencies to prioritize the health of our marine ecosystems and coastal communities over experimental ventures that benefit private industry at public expense,"" said Martha Collins, Executive Director for Healthy Gulf

Friday’s orders, signed by Trump at an Oval Office event, called on the nation’s independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission to cut down on regulations and fast-track new licences for reactors and power plants.

One order requires the body to make decisions on new nuclear reactors within 18 months. That would severely pare down a process that can take more than a decade. Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump described the nuclear industry as “hot”.

“It’s a brilliant industry. You have to do it right,” he said, flanked by CEOs of nuclear companies, as well as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.

Burgum told reporters that the president’s actions would “turn the clock back on over 50 years of overregulation” in the nuclear industry.

Trump’s orders also called for assessing staffing levels at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and directed the US Departments of Energy and Defense to work together to build nuclear plants on federal land.

Building more nuclear reactors, an official told reporters in advance of the signing, is aimed in part at addressing the increased energy needs created by artificial intelligence (AI) technology.

It was not immediately clear how much authority Trump and the executive branch could assert over the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which Congress created as an independent agency in 1974.

Trump’s orders also called for growth in the domestic production and enrichment of uranium, the primary fuel used in nuclear power.

‘National energy emergency’

Trump has focused heavily on energy industry deregulation since taking office for a second term in January, but much of the emphasis has been directed at fossil fuels.

On January 20, the day he returned to the White House, Trump declared a “national energy emergency”.

As part of that order, he called on the heads of federal agencies to identify any emergency powers they could use to “facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources” on federal and non-federal land.

He further called high energy prices an “active threat” to US citizens and national security.

Nuclear energy has long been a thorny issue in the US, splitting those who seek alternatives to fossil fuels.

On one hand, the industry offers a means of producing energy with low levels of greenhouse gas emissions. But on the other hand, the production of nuclear energy creates waste that can remain radioactive for long periods of time, and requires special storage to ensure public safety.

Nuclear power also carries the risk of rare, but potentially cataclysmic, accidents.

For many, incidents like the Three Mile Island accident represent the possible dangers. In 1979, the nuclear generator on Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania suffered a mechanical failure, releasing radioactive gases into the air and spurring a backlash against nuclear power.

Even with Trump’s regulatory rollback, many experts in the field believe it would take years for the US to scale up its nuclear infrastructure.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-05-23T182304Z_983460481_RC2ALAAVFI6U_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-NUCLEAR-1748024858.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-05-23 18:09:30.450812

To speed up the development of nuclear power, the orders grant the U.S. energy secretary authority to approve advanced reactor designs and projects, taking authority away from the independent safety agency that has regulated the U.S. nuclear industry for five decades.

The order comes as demand for electricity surges amid a boom in energy-hungry data centers and artificial intelligence. Tech companies, venture capitalists, states and others are competing for electricity and straining the nation’s electric grid.

“We’ve got enough electricity to win the AI arms race with China,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said. “What we do in the next five years related to electricity is going to determine the next 50″ years in the industry.

Still, it’s unlikely the U.S. could quadruple its nuclear production in the timeframe the White House specified. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two reactors, at a nuclear plant in Georgia, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.

Trump is enthusiastic

At the Oval Office signing, Trump, surrounded by industry executives, called nuclear a “hot industry,” adding, “It’s time for nuclear, and we’re going to do it very big.”

Burgum and other speakers said the industry has stagnated and has been choked by overregulation.

“Mark this day on your calendar. This is going to turn the clock back on over 50 years of overregulation of an industry,” said Burgum, who chairs Trump’s newly formed Energy Dominance Council.

The orders would reorganize the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission to ensure quicker reviews of nuclear projects, including an 18-month deadline for the NRC to act on industry applications. The measures also create a pilot program intended to place three new experimental reactors online by July 4, 2026 — 13 months from now — and invoke the Defense Production Act to allow emergency measures to ensure the U.S. has the reactor fuel needed for a modernized nuclear energy sector.

The administration is focused on boosting nuclear as “affordable, reliable, safe and secure power,” said Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. The executive orders send a signal that “America will build again,” Kratsios said. Energy Secretary Chris Wright echoed that sentiment on social media, posting that more reliable, secure and affordable energy sources — like geothermal, nuclear and natural gas — are the key to remaining the world’s energy powerhouse.

Trump has signed a spate of executive orders promoting oil, gas and coal that warm the planet when burned to produce electricity. Nuclear reactors generate electricity without emitting greenhouse gases. Trump said reactors are safe and clean, but did not mention climate benefits.

The order to reorganize the NRC will include significant staff reductions but is not intended to fire NRC commissioners who lead the agency. David Wright, a former South Carolina elected official and utility commissioner, chairs the five-member panel. His term ends June 30, and it is unclear if he will be reappointed.

Critics have trepidations

Critics say the White House moves could compromise safety and violate legal frameworks such as the Atomic Energy Act. Compromising the independence of the NRC or encouraging it to be circumvented entirely could weaken the agency and make regulation less effective, said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“Simply put, the U.S. nuclear industry will fail if safety is not made a priority,” he said.

A number of countries are speeding up efforts to license and build a new generation of smaller nuclear reactors to meet a surging demand for electricity and supply it carbon-free. Last year, Congress passed legislation that former President Joe Biden signed to modernize the licensing of new reactor technologies so they can be built faster.

This month, the power company in Ontario, Canada, began building the first of four small nuclear reactors.

Valar Atomics is a nuclear reactor developer in California. Founder and CEO Isaiah Taylor said nuclear development and innovation in the United States has been slowed by too much red tape, while Russia and China are speeding ahead. He said he’s most excited about the mandate for the Energy Department to speed up the pace of innovation.

The NRC is currently reviewing applications from companies and a utility that want to build small nuclear reactors to begin providing power in the early 2030s. Currently, the NRC expects its reviews to take three years or less.

They would rather take heat from clean energy folks and people affected by the projects.” It wasn’t supposed to be this way.
White House officials and outside analysts frequently touted job creation linked to IRA investments in Republican House districts and states as a tangible benefit of the law that would make it politically impossible to overturn, even as Congress and the White House turned over.
“A [freaking] battery factory is not going to save democracy,” the official told me, referencing more ambitious claims that the tax credits could lead to more Democratic electoral victories.
Clean energy and energy-dependent sectors, they thought, should be able to effectively advocate for themselves.","In the end, it was what the letters didn’t say.

For months — since well before the 2024 election — when asked about the future health and safety of the clean energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, advocates and industry folks would point to the 20 or so House Republicans (sometimes more, sometimes fewer) who would sign on to public statements urging their colleagues to preserve at least some of the law. Better not to pull out the rug from business investment, they argued. Especially not investment in their districts.

These letters were “reassuring to a lot of folks in clean energy and climate communities,” Chris Moyer, the founder of Echo Communications and a former staffer for longtime Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, told me.

“I never felt reassured,” Moyer added.

Plenty of people did, though. The home solar company Sunrun, for instance, told investors in a presentation earlier this monththat a “growing number of Republicans in Congress — including 39 overall House members and four Senators — publicly support maintaining energy tax credits through various letters over the past few months.” The company added that “we expect a range of draft proposals to be issued, possibly including draconian scenarios, but we expect any extreme proposals will be moderated as they progress.”

Instead, the draft language got progressively worse for the residential solar industry, with the version that passed the House Thursday morning knocking billions of dollars off the sector, as tax credits were further squeezed to help make room for other priorities that truly posed an existential threat to the bill’s passage.

What Sunrun and others appear to have failed to notice — or at least publicly acknowledge — is that while these representatives wanted to see tax credits preserved, they never specified what they would do if their wishes were disregarded. Unlike the handful of Republicans who threatened to tank the bill over expanding the deduction for state and local taxes (each of whom signed one of the tax credit letters, at some point), or the Freedom Caucus, who tend to vote no on any major fiscal bill that doesn’t contain sizable spending cuts (so, until now, every budget bill), the tax credit Republicans never threatened to kill the bill entirely.

Ultimately, the only Republicans to outright oppose the bill did so because it didn’t cut the deficit enough. All of the House Republicans who signed letters or statements in support of clean energy tax credits voted yes on the legislation, with a single exception: New York’s Andrew Garbarino, who reportedly slept through the roll call. (He later said he would have voted for it had he been awake.)

“The coalition of interests effectively persuaded Republican members that tax credits were driving investment in their districts and states,” Pavan Venkatakrishnan, an infrastructure fellow at the Institute for Progress, told me in a text message. “Where advocates fell short was in convincing them that preserving energy tax credits — especially for mature technologies Republicans often view skeptically — should take precedence over preventing Medicaid cuts or addressing parochial concerns like SALT.”

The Inflation Reduction Act itself was, after all, advanced on a party-line basis, as was Biden’s 2021 American Rescue Plan. Combined, those two bills received a single Democratic no vote and no Republican yes votes.

In the end, Moyer said, Republican House members in the current Congress were under immense political pressure to support what is likely to be the sole major piece of legislation advanced this year by President Trump — one that contained a number of provisions, especially on SALT, that they agreed with.

“There are major consequences for individual house members who vote against the president’s agenda,” Moyer said. “They made a calculation. They knew they were going to take heat either way. They would rather take heat from clean energy folks and people affected by the projects.”

It wasn’t supposed to be this way.

White House officials and outside analysts frequently touted job creation linked to IRA investments in Republican House districts and states as a tangible benefit of the law that would make it politically impossible to overturn, even as Congress and the White House turned over.

“President’s Biden’s policies are leading to more than 330,000 new clean energy jobs already created, more than half of which are in Republican-held districts,” White House communications director Ben LaBolt told reporters last year, previewing a speech President Biden would give on climate change.

Even after Biden had been defeated, White House climate advisor Ali Zaidi told Bloomberg that “we have grown the political consensus around the Inflation Reduction Act through its execution,” citing one of the House Republican letters in support of the clean energy tax credits.

One former Biden White House climate official told me that having projects in Republican districts was thought by the IRA’s crafters to make the bill more politically sustainable — but only so much.

“A [freaking] battery factory is not going to save democracy,” the official told me, referencing more ambitious claims that the tax credits could lead to more Democratic electoral victories. (The official asked to remain anonymous in order not to jeopardize their current professional prospects.) Instead, “it was supposed to make it slightly harder for Republicans to overturn the subsidies.”

Congresspeople worried about jobs weren’t supposed to be the only things that would preserve the bill, either, the official added. Clean energy and energy-dependent sectors, they thought, should be able to effectively advocate for themselves.

To the extent that business interests were able to win a hearing with House Republicans, they were older, more traditionally conservative industries such as nuclear, manufacturing, agriculture, and oil and gas.The biofuels industry (i.e. liquid Big Agriculture) won an extension of its tax credit, 45Z. The oil and gas industry’s favored measure, the 45Q tax credit for carbon sequestration, was minimally fettered. Nuclear power was the one sector whose treatment notably improved between the initial draft from the House’s tax-writing committee and the version voted on Thursday. Advanced nuclear facilities can still claim tax credits if they start construction by 2029, while other clean energy projects have to start construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage and be in service by the end of 2028.

“I think these outcomes are unsurprising. In places where folks consistently engaged, things were protected,” a Republican lobbyist told me, referring to manufacturing, biofuels, and nuclear power, requesting anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. “But assuming a project in a district would guarantee a no vote on a large package was always a mistake.”

“The relative success of nuclear is a testament to the importance of having strong champions — predictable but notable show of political might,” a second Republican lobbyist told me, who was also not allowed to speak publicly about the bill.

But all hope isn’t lost yet. The Senate still has to pass something that the House will agree with.

In early April, despite news of EPA canceling grants across the country, federal officials assured Thomasville that their funding was on track.
As climate change makes storms worse, the Biden-era EPA had doled out grants aimed at improving health and severe weather preparedness in communities that have long lacked the resources.
In addition to the planned work on the wastewater collection system, the city needs to update its treatment plant to meet EPA standards.
Other cities and nonprofits, as well as a group of Democratic state attorneys general, have sued, arguing that terminating their grants without following proper procedures is illegal.","This coverage is made possible through a partnership between WABE and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.

Thomasville, Georgia, has a water problem: The system that handles and treats wastewater to make sure it’s safe is far out of date, posing serious health and environmental risks.

“We have wastewater infrastructure that is old,” said Sheryl Sealy, the assistant city manager for this city of 18,881 near the Florida border, about 45 minutes from Tallahassee. “It’s critical that we do the work to replace this.”

The system is especially bad in underserved parts of the city, Sealy said, but it’s expensive to replace.

So Thomasville got some help from the federal government. The city and its partners received a nearly $20 million Community Change grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to make the long-overdue wastewater improvements, create a resilience hub and health clinic and upgrade homes in several historic neighborhoods.

“The grant itself was really a godsend for us,” Sealy said.

In early April, despite news of EPA canceling grants across the country, federal officials assured Thomasville that their funding was on track. Then, on May 1, the city received a termination notice.

“We felt, you know, a little taken off guard when the bottom did let out for us,” said Sealy.

Thomasville isn’t alone.

As climate change makes storms worse, the Biden-era EPA had doled out grants aimed at improving health and severe weather preparedness in communities that have long lacked the resources.

Under the Trump administration, the EPA has canceled or interrupted hundreds of those grants because the agency “determined that the grant applications no longer support Administration priorities,” according to an emailed statement to WABE.

The cuts are part of a broader gutting of federal programs aimed at furthering environmental justice, an umbrella term for the effort to help communities that have been hardest-hit by pollution and other environmental issues, which often includes low-income communities and communities of color.

In Thomasville’s case, the city has a history of heavy industry that has led to poor air quality.

Critics argue there’s a disconnect between the Trump administration’s attack on the concept of environmental justice and the realities of what the funds are paying for.

“What is it about building a new health clinic and upgrading wastewater infrastructure…that’s inconsistent with administration policy?” Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff from Georgia asked EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in a recent hearing. “Is a new health clinic for Thomasville, Georgia, woke?”

Thomasville’s Sealy said she understands that the federal government has to make hard funding decisions — that’s true locally too — but losing this grant has left her city in the lurch. In addition to the planned work on the wastewater collection system, the city needs to update its treatment plant to meet EPA standards. That overhaul will likely cost $60-70 million, she said.

“How do you fund that?” Sealy asked. “You can’t fund that on the backs of the people who pay our rates. You just can’t do that when you’re looking at that amount of money.”

The funding cuts have left cities across Georgia — including Athens, Norcross and Savannah — as well as nonprofit groups, in a state of uncertainty: some grants terminated, some suspended then reinstated, some still unclear. This puts city officials in an impossible position, unable to wait or to move forward, according to Athens-Clarke County Sustainability Director Mike Wharton.

“Do you commit to new programs? Do you commit to services?” he said. “Here you are sitting in limbo for months.”

Like Thomasville, Athens received a nearly $20-million Community Change grant. The city was going to use the money for backup generators, solar power and battery storage at its public safety complex — ensuring 911, police, the jail, a domestic violence shelter and other services could all operate, even during a power outage. That grant has been terminated.

The problem, Wharton said, goes beyond that money not coming in; the city had already spent time, resources and money to get the grant.

“We spent $60,000 in local funding hiring people to write the grants,” he said. “Over a period of 14 months we invested over 700 hours of local personnel time. So we diverted our services to focus on these things.”

These frustrations are playing out for grant recipients throughout the state and country, according to Zealan Hoover, a former Biden administration EPA official who’s now advising the advocacy groups Environmental Protection Network and Lawyers for Good Government. He said it’s not just confusing — it’s expensive.

“They are causing project costs to skyrocket because they keep freezing and unfreezing and refreezing projects,” he said. “One of the big drivers of cost overruns in any infrastructure project, public or private, is having to demobilize and remobilize your teams.”

Thomasville and Athens officials both said they’re appealing their grant terminations. They’re also reaching out to their elected officials, hoping that pressure from their senators and members of congress can get them the federal money they were promised.

Other cities and nonprofits, as well as a group of Democratic state attorneys general, have sued, arguing that terminating their grants without following proper procedures is illegal. But that’s a difficult step for many places to take.

“Suing the federal government to assert your legal rights is very daunting, even if the law is on your side,” Hoover said.",https://www.wabe.org/app/uploads/2025/05/AP23131556441372-1440x810.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 17:11:36.696798

While the country has the world’s largest fleet of nuclear power plants, only three new reactors have come online since 1996.
Some nuclear proponents and companies have blamed the sluggish pace on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which must approve new designs before they are built.
It is unclear whether the president can order sweeping changes at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which Congress established to be independent from the White House.
Skeptics of nuclear power fear that pressure from the White House could cause the agency to take shortcuts on safety.","President Trump signed four executive orders on Friday aimed at accelerating the construction of nuclear power plants in the United States, including a new generation of small, advanced reactors that offer the promise of faster deployment but have yet to be proven.

One order directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the nation’s independent safety regulator, to streamline its rules and to take no more than 18 months to approve applications for new reactors.

Another order directs the Energy and Defense departments to explore siting reactors on federal lands and military bases, possibly alongside new data centers. That could allow the departments to bypass the N.R.C. and develop their own, faster processes for approving reactors.

“This is a huge day for the nuclear industry,” said Doug Burgum, the interior secretary, as he stood behind Mr. Trump at a signing ceremony in the Oval Office. “Mark this day on your calendar. This is going to turn the clock back on over 50 years of overregulation.”

In one of his first acts in office, Mr. Trump declared a “national energy emergency,” saying the country did not have enough electricity to meet its growing needs, particularly for data centers that run artificial intelligence. While most of Mr. Trump’s actions have focused on boosting coal, oil and natural gas, administration officials have supported nuclear power, too.

Nuclear power enjoys bipartisan backing in Congress. While some Democrats remain opposed because of concerns about safety and disposal of nuclear waste, an increasing number have embraced the technology because it doesn’t produce planet-warming emissions. Republicans support it because it can run at all hours, unlike wind and solar power.

Even so, developing new reactors in the United States has proved enormously difficult.

While the country has the world’s largest fleet of nuclear power plants, only three new reactors have come online since 1996. Many utilities have been scared off by the cost: The two most recent reactors built at the Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia totaled $35 billion, double the initial estimates, and arrived seven years behind schedule.

In recent years, more than a dozen companies have begun developing a new generation of smaller reactors a fraction of the size of those at Vogtle. The hope is that these reactors would have a lower upfront price tag, making them a less risky investment for utilities. They might also be based on a design that could be repeated often, as opposed to custom-built, to reduce costs.

So far, however, none of these next-generation plants have been built, although projects are underway in Wyoming, Louisiana and Tennessee.

Some nuclear proponents and companies have blamed the sluggish pace on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which must approve new designs before they are built. Critics say that many of the regulations that the agency uses were designed for an earlier era and are no longer appropriate for advanced reactors that are designed to be less susceptible to meltdowns.

“This is an agency that needs be shaken up a bit,” said Jacob DeWitte, chief executive of Oklo Inc., a startup that has developed a small advanced reactor that it plans to build at Idaho National Laboratory. He called the executive orders “incredibly exciting on multiple fronts.”

The Trump administration is planning a “substantial reorganization” of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which could involve staff turnover, said a White House official who spoke on a condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

It is unclear whether the president can order sweeping changes at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which Congress established to be independent from the White House. In recent months, Mr. Trump has sought to exert greater authority over independent agencies, setting up a showdown in the courts.

Skeptics of nuclear power fear that pressure from the White House could cause the agency to take shortcuts on safety. Since the partial meltdown of the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania in 1979, in which there were no fatalities, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has ratcheted up safety requirements. While that has made it harder to build new plants, the country has also not experienced another major nuclear accident.

“Simply put, the U.S. nuclear industry will fail if safety is not made a priority,” said Edwin Lyman, the director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists and a frequent critic of the industry. He added that if another large radiological release were to occur, it would “destroy public trust in nuclear power and cause other nations to reject U.S. nuclear technology for decades to come.”

Even a few nuclear companies and proponents have been nervous about a major shake-up at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. They note that the agency has already started streamlining its approval processes in response to bipartisan bills passed by Congress, and that a hasty reorganization could, paradoxically, end up delaying approvals for the nuclear companies that are in the process of getting permits.

Another order calls on the secretary of energy to develop a plan to rebuild U.S. supplies of enriched uranium and other nuclear fuels, which in recent years have largely been imported from Russia.

But speeding up regulatory approvals won’t be sufficient to revive the nuclear industry, some experts said. The first few reactors that do get built are likely to be enormously expensive, and some sort of government support would likely be required to help companies build reactors at a pace that could drive down costs.

Chris Wright, the secretary of energy, has talked about using his department’s Loan Programs Office, which currently has $400 billion in lending authority, to finance initial nuclear projects. Yet the office has lost more than half its staff after a wave of Trump administration buyouts and layoffs, and House Republicans sought to cut funding for the office in their domestic policy bill.

The executive orders “might help us build a few first-of-a-kind demonstration reactors, but that’s it,” said Armond Cohen, executive director of the Clean Air Task Force, an environmental group that supports nuclear power. “We still need a strategy for getting an entire commercial industry scaled up.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/23/multimedia/23cli-nuclear-01-tvfh/23cli-nuclear-01-tvfh-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 17:11:06.875667

And there are some provisions in it that are bound to affect millions of drivers across America: namely, the bill adds a $250 federal registration fee for electric vehicles.

The text of the Big, Beautiful Bill states that the federal government will ""propose for each year the following registration fee"" of $250 for a covered electric vehicle and $100 for a covered hybrid vehicle. If the bill goes into law as written, this kind of broad, federal registration tax on electric vehicles would be the first of its kind in the United States.

Rep. Sam Graves.

""The bill includes provisions from the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to provide historic investments in the United States Coast Guard to strengthen our national and border security, as well as … ensuring that electric vehicles begin contributing to the Highway Trust Fund,"" Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.), chairman of the influential Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said.

This rhetoric from Republican lawmakers is not surprising. Back in February, Senator John Barrasso (R-WY) spearheaded an initiative to add a $1000 annual road use fee for electric vehicle owners, as legislators claimed such a steep annual tax was necessary to recoup a decade of lost gas taxes from battery-powered vehicles. This more recent push to add annual registration fees is motivated by the same mission, though its enforcement will actually rest on the states.

You read that right: The federal government expects each state to implement this new federal EV tax at a state level and will provide grants to each state to aid in the process. Now, this expectation isn't radical on paper, as each state is naturally responsible for its own vehicle licensing and registration rules, but language in the bill suggests that failing to implement this EV tax will not be an option.

""The Administrator shall withhold, from amounts required to be apportioned to any State under section 104(b), an amount equal to 125 percent to the amount required to be remitted under subsection (c)(2). The Administrator shall withhold the amount on the first day of each fiscal year beginning after September 30, 2026, in which the State does not meet the requirements of subsection (c),"" the text of the bill reads.

Translating that threat into plain English equates to the federal government saying that non-compliant states will be charged 25% on top of the calculated amount of funding the state was expected to bring into the Highway Trust Fund. Essentially, the bill extends an enforcement arm for the federal government to force states to pay up whether they implement the fee or not — and it will be more costly for states that choose not to. (These sorts of monetary tactics aren't unheard of, as in federal highway funding before it reversed its course on raising the drinking age to 21 years old in 1996.)

What can EV owners across the nation expect if this bill becomes law? Well, it will likely depend on your state. States like California and Washington have already added an extra fee for EV registration in a localized effort to pad their gas tax and road repair funds, indicating that owning an electric or hybrid vehicle could get significantly more expensive. It puts states with existing EV registration fees in a tough spot, as they could pull back on statewide initiatives to relieve EV owners of undue costs but could lose their state and local road repair funds in the process. States that don't yet have an EV registration fee, like Florida, would see an immediate rise in costs for EV owners.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/in-an-aerial-view-electric-cars-sit-parked-at-a-charging-news-photo-1748013485.pjpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.700xh;0,0.123xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-05-23 17:10:19.334391

These hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy tax incentives were part of former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) agenda.
According to online data, clean energy companies are making their way towards the Southern Tier.
“And that’s really important because tax revenue helps improve schools, transit and other local services.","WASHINGTON, D.C. - In the President’s tax and spending plan that passed the House earlier this week, it cuts several clean energy tax credits. Those Biden-era tax incentives were aimed at building up US manufacturing and competition against foreign manufacturers.

“It will certainly raise a lot of revenue this is the biggest sort of tax increase category in the reconciliation package,” said Alex Muresianu, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation.

These hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy tax incentives were part of former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) agenda.

“In the overall economy: GDP, investment, consumer spending, that sort of big picture, I don't think the impact is going to be very big because these are sort of narrowly targeted at specific industries,” said Muresianu. “So, I think the broad impact won’t be that big, but the impact for specific industries will be significant. This changes the economics of a lot of clean energy projects.”

Maria Martinez with the Clean Economy Project said these tax credits helped boost US production of materials and energy technologies while giving the US a more competitive edge in the energy industry.

Martinez said since the credits were updated in the IRA a few years ago, companies have announced they intend to build more than 300 manufacturing facilities across the country, which could bring in millions of jobs and revenue to local communities. According to online data, clean energy companies are making their way towards the Southern Tier. One example, Electrovaya, a producer of lithium-ion batteries for transportation and storage, announced they will open up their first US plant in Chautauqua County. Martinez said there could be a devastating impact if these incentives are gutted. She shares the economic impact over the next ten years:

“Not building would translate to something in the order of a trillion dollars in lost economic output, about four million jobs, something like 130-billion in tax revenue,” said Martinez. “And that’s really important because tax revenue helps improve schools, transit and other local services. So, we’re not just losing the direct jobs, we would be losing a lot of spillover, positive economic benefits that would come to these communities locally.”",https://WENY.images.worldnow.com/images/26564139_G.jpeg?lastEditedDate=1748015156000,N,,2025-05-23 18:09:03.388160

Nuclear power has been undergoing a resurgence in recent years as countries look for carbon-free energy and confront rising prices, fueled by the war in Ukraine.","President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders Friday to boost nuclear energy in the United States, including by rolling back regulatory processes on a still divisive technology.

""We're signing tremendous executive orders today that really will make us the real power in this industry,"" Trump told reporters as he penned the four orders in the Oval Office. Trump's orders aim to speed up the building of new reactors and to boost domestic mining and enriching of uranium, with the United States relying on imports for most of the crucial fuel.

The US president said the focus would be on building smaller reactors, such as those required by tech and artificial intelligence companies that have huge energy needs. The orders will also overhaul the US nuclear watchdog so that it pushes through decisions on building new reactors within 18 months, amid reports that the White House found the regulator too risk averse.

Trump denied that speeding up the regulation process could compromise nuclear safety. ""We're going to get it very fast and very safe,"" Trump said. ""It's time for nuclear and we're going to do it very big."" The move comes with growing interest in nuclear energy in the United States, despite being expensive to build and still politically sensitive in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster. ""President Trump is taking truly historic action to usher in the American nuclear renaissance,"" Michael Kratsios, Director for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, told reporters earlier.

'Energy emergency'

A senior White House official said the administration hopes to ""test and deploy"" new reactors before the end of Trump's second term in January 2029. Trump's order ""fundamentally rehauls"" the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which grants permission for new reactors, by ""lowering regulatory burdens and shortening the licensing timeline."" Republican Trump declared an ""energy emergency"" on his first day back in office to expand drilling for oil and gas and to roll back Democratic predecessor Joe Biden's climate policies.

But he is now also looking at nuclear to meet growing demand. Much of the demand is fueled by US tech giants, with some including Amazon, Microsoft and Google having recently signed deals for nuclear power as they seek carbon-free electricity sources. Two US energy companies are also preparing to bring nuclear stations back online, including Three Mile Island − the site in 1979 of the worst commercial nuclear power accident in US history.

Trump's drive to boost mining and enrichment also reflects the fact that the United States imports most of the uranium that is needed to fuel nuclear power stations. The US imported most from Canada, Australia, Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in 2023 but in 2024 it banned uranium imports from Russia over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

Nuclear power has been undergoing a resurgence in recent years as countries look for carbon-free energy and confront rising prices, fueled by the war in Ukraine.

The company plans to cut its investments by £3bn (US$4bn) over the next five years, including a £1.5bn (US$2bn) cut to its SSE Renewables business.

These strategic cutbacks are attributed to the ""changing macroeconomic environment and wider delays to the planning processes"" over the past year.

This follows an announcement in April 2025 that it would cut 200 jobs from its renewables business.

The investment plan was presented with its preliminary results for FY2024/25.

Alistair Phillips-Davies, CEO at SSE, said: “SSE continues to prove the benefits of a portfolio that is built to withstand risk and uncertainty and a strategy that is focused on creating sustainable value.

“We have met our financial goals for the year and evolved our investment plans to reflect the changing world around us – leaning into the opportunities presented in networks and redoubling our capital discipline across our energy businesses.”

Clean energy in the UK

In 2024, the UK's energy demand was around 281 TWh according to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.

Should energy demands remain similar in 2030, SSE's 50 TWh objective would be a considerable contribution towards the UK government's goal to reach a net zero carbon energy system.

Over the past 12 months, the UK’s grid has been powered roughly 30% by gas, 29% by wind and just over 14% by nuclear.

The government aims to achieve 95% clean power generated in the UK by 2030.

It remains uncertain which particular SSE projects will be affected by the reduction in investments, but the company is now planning to achieve 7 GW of installed renewable capacity by the end of 2026/27 with 1 GW under construction.

Trouble for clean energy

SSE is not the first to cut down on renewables investments and it may not be the last.

Ørsted decided to scrap Hornsea 4, an offshore wind farm project that was expected to deliver 2.4 GW of clean power.

In February 2025, Equinor announced that it is “reducing investments to renewables and low-carbon solutions to around US$5bn in total after project financing for 2025-2027”.

In the same month bp announced a strategy overhaul, cutting its renewable investments by more than US$5bn annually and ramping up its commitment to fossil fuels.

This followed a downturn in profits for the business in 2024.

SSE’s upcoming projects

Despite reduction plans, SSE remains proactive with various renewable projects across the UK, including what is expected to be the world's largest offshore wind farm.

The Dogger Bank wind farm project is anticipated to have an installed capacity of 3.6 GW, enough to power six million homes annually.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/44d6fb65527d0cccdc3c89addc1419bf:093ac57687ae241062b4d48b745cfc7a/strathy-south-wind-farm.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 20:06:22.899339

When businesses don’t know what to expect, they hesitate, and this uncertainty ultimately leads to fewer jobs, less economic opportunities and fewer tools to lower energy costs for Arizonans.
With smart planning and investment, we can connect cheaper energy to the grid without having to build costly new infrastructure.
Policymakers should also modernize how we plan and build energy infrastructure, through updated transmission planning and streamlined permitting for clean energy projects, and support local, customer-owned energy resources like battery storage and rooftop solar.
With the right policies, Arizona can secure its energy future, supporting local jobs and building a grid ready to power the next decade of growth.","Arizona has long prided itself on being a state where businesses can thrive. But lately, we’re seeing more uncertainty about investing here. Kore Power decided earlier this year to cancel its long-planned $1.2 billion battery storage plant in Buckeye. Last year, Arizona slipped from 5th to 8th nationally in residential solar installations. These are not isolated incidents, but rather a stark warning sign: inconsistent market signals and unpredictable regulatory hurdles are making Arizona a more challenging place for clean energy to invest. When businesses don’t know what to expect, they hesitate, and this uncertainty ultimately leads to fewer jobs, less economic opportunities and fewer tools to lower energy costs for Arizonans.

As lawmakers finish up their work this session, Arizona is at a crossroads. We can either continue down a path marked by mixed signals and missed opportunities, or we can recommit to policies that are friendly to markets, welcome innovation and support long-term economic growth.

It’s not all bad news. Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoed several harmful bills this year that would have stalled clean energy progress, driven up electricity costs, created regulatory uncertainty and jeopardized Arizona’s ability to attract and retain business investment. These vetoes were a big win toward restoring investor and business confidence.

Another encouraging step was the reinstatement of the state’s Efficiency Arizona program. This program, supported by $153 million from the Inflation Reduction Act, will help residents upgrade to energy-efficient appliances: lowering energy costs, reducing peak demand and making the grid more reliable. This will not only benefit Arizona families, but also create jobs for local contractors and electricians, stimulating small businesses. Programs like these align the state’s policies with the needs of its economy.

But while these are signs of progress, they’re not enough. To stay competitive and ensure long-term growth, Arizona must do more than maintain the status quo – we have to lead.

As an example, Arizona should pass legislation that requires utility companies to invest in advanced grid technologies. Our electric grid is outdated and struggles to meet growing energy demand, and these technologies help more electricity flow through existing transmission lines, lowering electricity costs and improving grid reliability. With smart planning and investment, we can connect cheaper energy to the grid without having to build costly new infrastructure.

Policymakers should also modernize how we plan and build energy infrastructure, through updated transmission planning and streamlined permitting for clean energy projects, and support local, customer-owned energy resources like battery storage and rooftop solar. Policies like these would not only strengthen reliability and control costs but also position Arizona as a leader, sending a clear signal that the state is serious about competing in the modern economy and embracing forward-looking, investment-friendly policies.

With the right policies, Arizona can secure its energy future, supporting local jobs and building a grid ready to power the next decade of growth.

But to remain competitive, we can’t afford hesitation. With more than 300 days of sunshine a year and an energy-hungry economy ready to grow, we should be leading in the development of clean, low-cost energy, not standing still while other states surge ahead. Investing in home-grown, abundant and low-cost sources of energy should be a top priority for the state.

Arizona’s future is on the line. We can either lean into competition, reliability and innovation, or double down on monopoly-era rules that stifle progress and raise costs. Businesses are watching. Families are watching. And if Arizona fails to modernize, we risk falling behind.",https://azcapitoltimes.com/files/2023/09/Clean-Energy-Jobs.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 19:08:52.793191

Ford’s goal with the battery factories was actually to massively expand electromobility.
For Nissan, on the other hand, the use of the Ford plant offers a welcome opportunity.
It announced 20,000 job cuts and halted the construction of its own battery plant in Japan.","Ford and SK On founded their joint venture called BlueOval SK in 2022 and began building two battery factories in Glendale, Kentucky. These were to produce batteries for electric cars from Ford and its subsidiary brand Lincoln, each with an annual capacity of 43 GWh. According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, both factories are complete, but one of them is currently not being used at all, and only part of the other factory is producing batteries for Ford.

The active factory will now also produce batteries for Nissan, according to the business newspaper’s insider sources. For Nissan, this offers the opportunity to manufacture batteries in the USA, and thus a quick option to reduce the risks of tariffs on imported vehicles and components.

Ford’s goal with the battery factories was actually to massively expand electromobility. The fact that the plant in Kentucky is to produce batteries not only for Ford but also for Nissan in future can be interpreted as a further sign of Ford’s current reluctance when it comes to electromobility. The company had been banking heavily on rising demand, which has so far failed to materialise. In the last quarter alone, Ford’s Model e electric car division made a loss of 850 million dollars, while electric car sales rose from 10,000 to 31,000 units. At the same time, Ford is said to have abandoned the development of a new E/E architecture.

Demand for electric vehicles has recently been declining on the US market. It is likely to come under even greater pressure in the future because the Republican party now wants to abolish the tax credit of 7,500 dollars for the purchase of an electric car, as demanded by U.S. President Donald Trump with a corresponding bill. At the same time, production costs are rising. There is also the threat of billions in losses looming due to new tariffs.

For Nissan, on the other hand, the use of the Ford plant offers a welcome opportunity. The Japanese company recorded a loss of 4.5 billion US dollars in the first quarter of 2025. It announced 20,000 job cuts and halted the construction of its own battery plant in Japan. In future, however, Nissan plans to build electric SUVs in Canton, Mississippi. Nissan had already announced in March that it would purchase batteries from SK On for these models.

Neither Ford nor the BlueOval SK joint venture officially commented on the collaboration with Nissan. SK On also left it open as to where exactly it would be producing for Nissan in future.

Other manufacturers are also drawing conclusions from the sluggish ramp-up of electromobility: General Motors recently parted with a battery plant under construction in Michigan and handed it over to its partner LG Energy Solution. Existing GM plants are operating well below capacity. Honda, on the other hand, announced that it would reduce its planned investments in electric cars and software from 61 to 43 billion euros and put the planned construction of a new plant for e-cars and batteries in Canada on hold for two years.",https://batteryindustry.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ford-e-Nissan.jpeg.webp,N,,2025-05-24 05:03:05.397718

At a press conference this week, the Japanese automaker announced it was reducing its planned investment in EVs and software by 30 percent—to 7 trillion yen (approximately US$48.4 billion)—and revising its target for EVs to account for 30 percent of sales by the 2030 financial year.

""It's really hard to read the market, but at the moment, we see EVs accounting for about a fifth by then,"" said CEO Toshihiro Mibe.

Instead, Honda will expand its hybrid lineup with 13 new models slated for global release between 2027 and 2030. The company is also developing a hybrid system for large-size vehicles, which is expected to be released later this decade.

The company aims to sell between 2.2 million and 2.3 million hybrids by 2030, representing a sharp increase from the 868,000 sold in 2023. That compares with a total of 3.8 million vehicles sold overall by Honda in 2023.

The strategic pivot comes amid a broader recalibration across the auto industry, with several manufacturers scaling back EV investment as consumers favor hybrids and governments ease back on emissions mandates and EV targets. In the U.S., President Donald Trump recently revoked a Biden-era executive order pushing for all new vehicles to be electric by 2030.

Earlier this month, Honda paused a C$15 billion ($10.7 billion) plan to build an EV production facility in Ontario, citing weakening demand. Despite this, the company maintains its long-term goal of selling only zero-emission vehicles—including battery-electric and hydrogen fuel-cell models—by 2040.

Honda joins other carmakers retreating from aggressive EV expansion. Nissan recently scrapped plans for a $1.1 billion battery plant in Kyushu, while Jaguar Land Rover has reportedly shelved its electric vehicle plans for Tata's upcoming factory in southern India.

At about $54,000 for the Luxury 1 all-wheel-drive trim, notching 302 miles of range, it's a proper sweet-spot vehicle for a lot of entry-level EV buyers who have some financial means.
According to CNBC, citing Edmunds analyst Joseph Yoon, Cadillac EV buyers aren't actually cross-shopping Tesla — they're Tesla owners who want to ditch their rides.
The obvious question in this budding Caddy versus Tesla showdown, of course, is will the battle ever actually be joined, or is the sudden surge in Cadillac EV interest a fluke?
Cadillac has the EVs — now what it needs to do is prove that it can sustain that impressive first-time interest in the brand.","Ah, Cadillac! The undisputed king of General Motors, the car that every American at one time aspired to own. They don't call the most expensive health care plans ""Cadillac"" for nothing! Well, unfortunately the moniker now applies more to insurance than it does to actual automotive status. These days, Cadillacs are sort of cool if you want to evoke the ""Mad Men"" era, buck the new money types who drive BMWs and Audis, or need a hulking Escalade to, you know, drive your and your family to airport while wearing a black suit, if you catch my drift.

In this context, electrification is the best thing that ever happened to Cadillac. I was in Detroit for a battery showcase at GM, on the eve of the COVID-19 lockdowns, when CEO Mary Barra and President Mark Reuss stressed that Cadillac was going to become the General's lead electric brand, carrying it into future battles against Tesla.

Progress has been made! Cadillac is now selling four pure EVs, all of which are SUVs: there's the compact Optiq, the midsize Lyriq, the three-row Vistiq, and the huge Escalade IQ. Well, it's actually five EVs if you count the bespoke Celestiq, a hand-built four-door grand tourer that will set you back something like $350,000. As CBNC reports, capturing a whole gaggle of newbies to the 122-year-old brand. A whopping 8 out of 10 buyers choosing one of the brand's EVs are Cadillac first-timers.

This isn't going to shock anybody, but many of the buyers are being, in the parlance of the auto industry, ""conquested"" from Tesla. The trend makes sense for two reasons. First, Tesla is barely supporting the increasingly slim part of its portfolio that competes with GM's luxury marque; the Model S sedan and Model X SUV have basically been left to wither. The Model 3 and Model Y aren't particularly luxurious, and to top matters off, Cadillacs such as the Optiq, Vistiq, and Lyriq all look appealing, once you get past the goofy naming convention.

Second, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has done just about everything he can think of in the past year or so to alienate customers and inspire defections from the brand. I'm reminded, without putting too fine a point on it, of people who back in the 1980s would never consider a German car because of, you know, the war. Volvo and Saab benefited greatly.

For my money, the new Optiq somewhat defies the timeworn advice to never buy the cheapest Cadillac. At about $54,000 for the Luxury 1 all-wheel-drive trim, notching 302 miles of range, it's a proper sweet-spot vehicle for a lot of entry-level EV buyers who have some financial means. They don't want a cheap EV, but they don't want to shell out for the larger and slightly pricier Lyriq, especially when the base trim is a single-motor rear-wheel-drive model.

According to CNBC, citing Edmunds analyst Joseph Yoon, Cadillac EV buyers aren't actually cross-shopping Tesla — they're Tesla owners who want to ditch their rides. 10% of Caddy's trade-ins are Teslas, and when it comes to the Lyriq in particular, 25% of customers have traded in a Tesla. It's easy to blame that urge on Elon. But one might also want to figure that anybody who has owned a Model S or Model X for a while and has grown weary of Tesla's relatively spartan attitude toward luxury is naturally eyeballing Cadillac because, well ... it's Cadillac!

Before we get too excited, however, let's note that while that 80% headline figure is impressive, Cadillac isn't exactly setting the world on fire with sales overall. The division's dealers moved about 42,000 vehicles in the first quarter of 2025, with the Escalade leading the way at 12,683 units. At 4,300 cars sold, the Lyriq accounted for 1,500 fewer cars than in Q1 2024. It was Escalade and the CT5 sedan, both burners of a lot of good old-fashioned gasoline, that carried the quarter.

The obvious question in this budding Caddy versus Tesla showdown, of course, is will the battle ever actually be joined, or is the sudden surge in Cadillac EV interest a fluke? Smart money might be on the former. Tesla has shown little interest in expanding its portfolio and now seem to be preoccupied (obsessed?) with developing a robotaxi service.

Rosan P. Roeslani, CEO of Danantara, emphasized the government's commitment to strengthening Indonesia’s strategic position in the EV battery sector. Speaking at a press conference at the Presidential Palace in Jakarta on Thursday, May 22, 2025. Rosan cited that Danantara’s involvement is expected to overcome recent financial obstacles.

“Danantara is stepping in to help with financing because we see the immense potential in this project − not only in terms of returns but also in job creation,” he said.

He added that Indonesia’s participation will cover the entire value chain of battery production, from mining to manufacturing.

“This project will operate as one comprehensive package − from upstream mining to battery output,” he cited.

Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM), Bahlil Lahadalia, noted that the move is also a strategic effort to increase Indonesia’s equity share in these international collaborations.

“Our president has instructed us to aim for ownership stakes above 40 percent, ideally reaching up to 50 percent. Negotiations are ongoing, but we have already secured 51 percent ownership in upstream operations,” Bahlil said on Thursday, May 22, 2025.

The Titan Project, formerly led by LG Energy Solution (LGES), will now be spearheaded by Huayou in collaboration with Indonesian State-owned companies including PT Indonesia Battery Corporation (IBC), PT Aneka Tambang (Antam), PT Pertamina, and PT PLN. The consortium aims to drive forward a US$9.8 billion (Rp165.3 trillion) venture.

Although LGES is no longer part of the main EV battery consortium, the company has already invested US$1.2 billion in building a battery production facility in Karawang, West Java, with a 10 GWh capacity in its first phase.

The government aims to hold a groundbreaking ceremony for the Titan Project before August 2025.

A pivotal lab The Human Studies Facility and predecessor laboratories have played a pivotal part in the regulation of US air pollution.","A US laboratory that has been instrumental in documenting the impact of air pollution on human health is being shut down by the administration of US President Donald Trump. Scientists are rallying to save it.

US environmental agency halts funding for its main science division

Located on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), the Human Studies Facility is home to nine sealable chambers where government and academic scientists can safely test the physiological effects of wildfire smoke, vehicle exhaust fumes and other pollutants on willing human participants, often university students seeking cash.

The US government’s General Services Administration, which manages federal properties, cancelled its long-standing lease with the university in February, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which runs the lab, is now moving out of the state-of-the-art facility. The decision has sparked alarm in the research community that relies on the lab for its work, which scientists say cannot be replicated anywhere else in the United States.

“We need this capability,” says Dan Costa, a former EPA toxicologist whose division used the chambers to collect data that supported air-pollution regulations crafted by the agency. “Virtually all of the air-quality standards that we have today are built around evidence from this exposure facility.”

The EPA did not respond to Nature’s queries about the future of the facility, or scientists’ concerns over its abrupt shutdown.

On the chopping block

The decision to not renew the lease comes as the Trump team works to downsize the US government. The Department of Government Efficiency, launched by billionaire Elon Musk, says that the administration has terminated 563 leases worth US$262 million for facilities used by federal agencies including the EPA.

The annual budget for running the Human Studies Facility, which opened in 1995, has been in the range of US$3 million to $4 million in recent years, Costa says.

A White House budget proposal released earlier this month would cut the EPA’s budget by more than half in the 2026 fiscal year, which begins in October. But sources inside the agency indicate that the administration has already moved to halt funding and wind down laboratory operations in the EPA’s main science arm, the Office of Research and Development, which includes the exposure lab.

A pivotal lab

The Human Studies Facility and predecessor laboratories have played a pivotal part in the regulation of US air pollution. Here, researchers have tested hypotheses about the physiological effects on humans of breathing in particulate matter, chemicals and more in a controlled environment, multiple researchers told Nature. Experiments with human volunteers — at rest or on exercise bicycles, with or without face masks — yield direct evidence that cannot be provided by epidemiological studies and animal experiments.

Trump gutted two landmark environmental reports — can researchers save them?

“It’s a three-legged stool, and these different lines of evidence are mutually reinforcing,” says one EPA epidemiologist, who relies on the clinical exposure data to help verify work analysing vast public-health data sets. Without experimental data that can help to provide a mechanistic understanding of how pollution affects the human body, it’s going to be more difficult for the agency to craft safety regulations, says the scientist, who — like others in this story — was granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press.

Over the years, experiments at the facility have shown that breathing in fine particles from fossil-fuel combustion harms the heart as much as, if not more than, the lungs. And some of the most important toxicology data on smoke inhalation have come from the human-exposure chambers, says Mary Rice, a pulmonologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts.",https://media.nature.com/lw1200/magazine-assets/d41586-025-01632-9/d41586-025-01632-9_51013694.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 18:09:56.972014

The Columbia station received its first operating license in December 1983, and entered commercial operation a year later, with a 40-year operating license.

The Columbia Generating Station in Richland, Washington, with a current capacity of 1,207 MW, will undergo an extended power uprate (EPU) that will be done during the plant’s next three biennial spring refueling outages in 2027, 2029, and 2031.

The project is a collaboration of Energy Northwest, which owns and operates the Columbia facility, and the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). The Columbia station received its first operating license in December 1983, and entered commercial operation a year later, with a 40-year operating license. The power plant in 2012 received a 20-year operating license renewal, extending the facility’s operations until at least December 2043.

BPA on May 20 approved the EPU project, which would increase Columbia’s generation capacity by 162 MW by 2031. Additional energy efficiency upgrades would boost the station’s output by another 24 MW, for a total increase of 186 MW. The Columbia station features a General Electric BWR-5 (boiling water reactor).

“We applaud BPA for its decision to approve this project and for its strategic vision in advancing our region’s future with additional, reliable capacity that nuclear energy can provide,” said Bob Schuetz, CEO of Energy Northwest, a joint operating agency of Washington state that serves as a consortium of public power utilities. “Their leadership in supporting this initiative underscores a commitment to affordable and carbon-free electricity for the Northwest region, including our public power member utilities and their customers.”

Enhancing Reliability of the Power Supply

Energy Northwest in a May 22 news release said increasing the capacity of Columbia Generating Station will enhance “the reliability of the region’s power supply and contributing to a sustainable future,” noting that “the combined efforts of both organizations [Energy Northwest and BPA] will ensure that the Pacific Northwest continues to benefit from affordable and secure electricity, supporting the needs of regional customers.”

BPA serves consumer-owned utilities across six states in the U.S. Northwest.

“This is a great value for ratepayers in the Pacific Northwest,” said BPA Administrator and CEO John Hairston. “Upgrading an existing resource to provide additional reliable energy will help BPA keep pace with its customers growing electricity needs and keep rates low.”

Michael Goff, the acting undersecretary for Infrastructure at the Dept. of Energy, said, “This project exemplifies the energy vision for America by unleashing new power generation for the people of the Pacific Northwest without raising costs.”

Energy Northwest said the plan to increase reactor output at Columbia was approved by BPA on Tuesday after 18 months of analysis. The two groups will collaborate on planning and implementation of the improvements to the nuclear power station. As noted earlier, Energy Northwest owns and operates the Columbia station, though BPA markets the electricity produced at the plant, and is responsible for costs included in the revenue requirements of the power services rate structure.

Work at the facility during the project will involve replacing and upgrading reactor equipment, including turbines, heat exchangers and the generator, according to Energy Northwest. BPA in a workshop presentation in April of this year provided details of the EPU, noting, “With the implementation of the Extended Power Uprate and efficiency improvements, Columbia is anticipated to have an output of ~1,393 MWe post 2031 outage.” BPA said it anticipates modifications will be needed on major pieces of equipment at the plant, but much of the work would coincide with equipment replacement that already was planned. The groups said about 30 individual upgrades are expected, work that will primarily focus on increasing the size of pumps and motors.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/columbia-generating-station-1024x677.png,N,,2025-05-23 16:07:30.517016

Trump signs executive orders seeking to fast-track new nuclear licenses and overhaul regulatory agency

Donald Trump has ordered the nation’s independent nuclear regulatory commission to narrow regulations and expedite new licenses for reactors and power plants, seeking to shrink a multi-year process down to 18 months, Reuters reports.

The requirement was part of a batch of executive orders signed by Trump just now aiming to boost US nuclear energy production amid a boom in demand from data centers and AI.

Licensing for reactors in the US can take over a decade at times, a process designed to prioritize nuclear safety but which has discouraged new projects.

“With these actions, President Trump is telling the world that America will build again, and the American nuclear renaissance can begin,” said Michael Kratsios, director of the White House office of science and technology policy.

The moves include a substantial overhaul of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that includes looking at staffing levels and directing the energy and defense departments to work together to build nuclear plants on federal lands, a senior White House official said.

The administration envisions the Department of Defense taking a prominent role in ordering reactors and installing them on military bases.

The orders also seek to reinvigorate uranium production and enrichment in the United States, the senior White House official said.

Trump declared a national energy emergency in January as one of his first acts in office, saying the US had inadequate supplies of electricity to meet the country’s growing needs, particularly for data centers that run artificial intelligence systems.

Most of Trump’s actions have focused on boosting fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas, but administration officials also support nuclear power, which in recent years has attracted growing bipartisan support.

Trump’s Harvard visa threat could wipe out several of school’s sports teams

Some of Harvard’s sports teams would be virtually wiped out by the Trump administration’s move to make the Ivy League school with the nation’s largest athletic program ineligible for international student visas.

Harvard’s 42 varsity sports teams are the most in the nation, and Sportico reported last month that 21% of the players on the school’s rosters for the 2024-25 seasons – or 196 out of 919 athletes – had international home towns. The site noted that some could be US citizens or green card holders who wouldn’t need one of the international visas at issue in the Trump administration’s escalating fight with the university.

Seven of the eight rowers on the men’s heavyweight crew team that just won the Eastern Sprints title – and is headed to the national championships – list international home towns on the school’s website. Mick Thompson, the leading scorer last season, and Jack Bar, who was a captain, are among a handful of Canadians on the men’s hockey roster; 10 of the 13 members of the men’s squash team and more than half of the women’s soccer and golf rosters also list foreign home towns.

Supreme court temporarily halts access sought by watchdog group to Doge records

The supreme court temporarily paused judicial orders requiring the so-called “department of government efficiency”, established by Donald Trump and spearheaded by his billionaire adviser Elon Musk, to turn over records and answer questions in the coming days and weeks concerning its operations.

The court put on hold Washington-based US district judge Christopher Cooper’s orders for Doge to respond to a government watchdog group’s requests for information after finding that Doge is probably a government agency covered by the federal Freedom of Information Act.

The supreme court’s action, called an administrative stay, gives it additional time to consider the justice department’s formal request to block Cooper’s order while litigation proceeds in a lower court.

The day so far

This morning a federal judge in Boston swiftly blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to revoke Harvard’s ability to enrol international students, mere hours after the university sued the DHS. In its lawsuit Harvard condemned the administration for unconstitutional retaliation over its refusal to surrender to the White House’s political demands. It said the government’s move would “erase a quarter of Harvard’s student body”, force it to retract admissions for thousands of people, and has already thrown “countless” academic programs, clinics, courses and research laboratories into disarray. “Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” the university wrote in its legal complaint.

Harvard’s president Alan Garber wrote in a letter to the university’s community:

The revocation continues a series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence and to submit to the federal government’s illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body.

We condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action. It imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars across Harvard and serves as a warning to countless others at colleges and universities across the country who have come to America to pursue their education and fulfill their dreams.

US district judge Allison Burroughs granted the university’s request for an immediate temporary restraining order, which she said was necessary because Harvard had “made a sufficient showing … that, unless its motion for a temporary restraining order … is granted, it will sustain immediate and irreparable injury before there is an opportunity to hear from all parties”. She has set a hearing for 29 May to consider the administration’s actions.

Trump doubled down earlier, telling reporters that “Harvard’s going to have to change its ways” and said he was also “looking at a lot of things” when asked if his administration was looking at stopping other universities besides from taking in foreign students. Before Burroughs’s ruling, a White House spokesperson had also earlier dismissed Harvard’s lawsuit as “frivolous”.

While there are now two weeks of reprieve, there were reports of Chinese students at Harvard cancelling flights home today and seeking legal advice on staying in the United States as the Trump administration continues to wage war on the Ivy League university – and others - and amid years of tensions between the two countries. Per the New York Times (paywall), Trump’s attacks on elite institutions like Harvard have the potential to “reshape the broader relationship between [the US and China] by cutting off one of the few remaining reasons that people in China still admire the United States”.

The Trump administration accused Columbia University of violating the civil rights of Jewish students by “acting with deliberate indifference” toward what it described as a “hostile environment” for Jewish students on campus.

Trump ordered the nation’s independent nuclear regulatory commission to narrow regulations and expedite new licenses for reactors and power plants, seeking to shrink a multi-year process down to 18 months. The requirement was part of a batch of executive orders signed by Trump earlier today aiming to boost US nuclear energy production amid a boom in demand from data centers and AI.

Vice-president JD Vance said that the US under Trump will choose carefully when to use military force and will avoid involvement in open-ended conflicts in a speech that signalled a huge shift in 21st-century US foreign policy.

Trump said that a 25% tariff he said he will impose on Apple will also apply to Samsung and other smartphone makers who don’t make their products in the United States. “When they build their plant here, there’s no tariffs,” he said.

Trump said he’s not looking for a trade deal with the EU – which he announced earlier today will be slapped with 50% tariffs from 1 June – but said he’d be open to talking about a delay if companies were willing to build their plants in the US.

US special envoy Steve Witkoff held more than two hours of talks with an Iranian delegation in Rome today about Tehran’s nuclear program and agreed to meet again in the near future, a senior US official said.

Trump says he's not looking for a deal with the EU

Trump says he’s not looking for a trade deal with the EU – who he announced earlier today will be slapped with 50% tariffs from 1 June.

He says the EU is “too slow-moving” and “if they build their plants [in the US] then they have no tariff at all”.

I’m not looking for a deal. We’ve set the deal, it’s at 50%. But there’s no tariff if they build their plant here … If somebody wants to build a plant here I can talk to them about a little bit of a delay, while they’re building their plant, which is something that might be appropriate, maybe.

Trump says that a 25% tariff he said he will impose on Apple will also apply to Samsung and other smartphone makers.

“Or it would not be fair,” he says, adding that the White House will “appropriately have that done by the end of June”.

“When they build their plant here, there’s no tariffs. So they’re going to be building plants here,” he says.

Most of Trump’s actions have focused on boosting fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas, but administration officials also support nuclear power, which in recent years has attracted growing bipartisan support.

Trump expected to sign executive orders to boost nuclear industry – Reuters

Executive orders were on Donald Trump’s schedule for 1pm ET today. It’s obviously now way past that time but, as you may know, Trump often runs a tad late to these things. He has also been unusually quiet on Truth Social for the past six hours … so I’ll bring you the latest on what’s happening with the orders when we know more.

Earlier, Reuters reported that as early as today Trump was due to sign executive orders meant to accelerate nuclear energy development. Trump is expected to streamline the regulatory process for new reactor approvals and enhance fuel supply chains, the news agency reported citing four sources familiar with the matter. The report saw shares of nuclear power companies surge.

The measure passed the House early Thursday, 215‑214, and now moves to the Senate. Supporters say the rollback reins in costly subsidies; critics warn it could raise utility bills and chill billions of dollars in planned investment.

Credits on the chopping block

The bill would:

Terminate the technology‑neutral production and investment credits (Sections 45Y and 48E) for new wind, solar and battery projects unless construction begins within 60 days of the bill’s enactment and the project is online by 2028.

the $7,500 new‑EV credit and $4,000 credit for used EVs;

the 30% credit for rooftop solar and home batteries;

credits for heat pumps, high‑efficiency HVAC, insulation and other home upgrades;

and the 30% credit for home and commercial EV chargers.

Repeal the clean‑hydrogen production credit and restrict the sale (“transferability”) of remaining credits.

What issues to watch as 'big, beautiful bill' moves to the Senate

Incentives that stay largely benefit existing nuclear plants, carbon‑capture projects and certain low‑carbon fuels.

“We’re pleased the House recognized the importance of nuclear energy,"" said Duke Energy spokesperson Bill Norton. ""We will continue our work to advocate for policies that lower costs for our customers as this process continues in Congress.”

How much could bills rise?

Rhodium Group, an independent research firm, estimates the changes could lift average U.S. household energy costs about 7% by 2026. A separate study by NERA Economic Consulting for the Clean Energy Buyers Association projects a similar jump — roughly $110 a year for a typical customer.

Matt Abele, executive director of the N.C. Sustainable Energy Association, said wiping out the credits “will make every new solar, wind and battery project more expensive for utilities and for ratepayers.”

Jon Sanders, energy policy director at the conservative John Locke Foundation, argues that scrapping the credits would end “government favoritism.”

“Tax credits make winners in the boardroom but losers in the tax office,” Sanders said. “They lure investors yet still burden taxpayers.”

One incentive the bill keeps is the zero‑emission nuclear production credit. Former state Rep. John Szoka of the Conservative Energy Network supports that move, noting only a few small modular reactors are likely to come online before 2034. “We need every electron,” he said.

Appalachian Voices called the proposal “catastrophic,” saying higher power prices combined with cuts to nutrition and health benefits would hurt Appalachian families. “This may be a beautiful bill for the wealthy in their beach houses, but it’s a terrible bill for everyday Appalachians,” said Chelsea Barnes, the group’s director of government affairs.

The American Petroleum Institute welcomed the House plan for “preserving competitive tax policies,” expanding federal leasing for oil and gas, and scrapping the Biden administration’s methane fee.

What it means for North Carolina

Since 2022, at least 34 clean‑energy manufacturing or generation projects have been announced or started construction in North Carolina, according to state and industry tallies. Together they represent nearly $13 billion in investment. Some could still proceed without federal help, but developers warn financing will be tougher if the credits vanish.

By David French

NEW YORK (Reuters) -President Donald Trump's pro-energy policies were meant to speed the construction of the United States' next generation of energy infrastructure, but many oil and gas pipeline operators would still rather buy than build their way to expansion due to a host of factors impeding large projects.

Trump declared an energy emergency on his first day in office and has issued directives to support exports, reform permitting and roll back environmental standards. Since his November election, a number of large-scale projects have been greenlit, including a liquefied natural gas terminal and a handful of pipelines.

But higher costs from a global trade war sparked by U.S. tariffs, labor shortages, low oil prices, and the risk of legal snags mean many companies are generally reluctant to commit to bold new construction.

Instead, operators see mergers and acquisitions as a more efficient way to grow. In the first quarter of this year, 15 U.S. midstream deals were struck, the highest quarterly number since the final three months of 2021, according to energy tech company Enverus.

""We have spent a lot of time thinking about the buy versus build question and, at this time, we're seeing more opportunities to buy assets,"" said Angelo Acconcia, a partner at ArcLight Capital Partners, which invests in energy infrastructure.

Acconcia said factors including tariffs and high demand for supplies and labor made it challenging to calculate the economics of building a project.

One of the most prevalent trends in dealmaking so far in 2025 has been pipeline companies buying back stakes in joint ventures, previously sold to help fund the initial development costs of prior-year builds.

Targa Resources said in February it would acquire preferred equity in its Targa Badlands pipeline system from Blackstone for $1.8 billion, while MPLX said in the same month it would buy the 55% interest in the BANGL natural gas pipeline previously owned by WhiteWater Midstream and Diamondback Energy for $715 million.

Private equity owners of energy infrastructure are keen sellers, having spent recent years developing systems that are now online.

Northwind Midstream, a New Mexico-focused pipeline operator, is currently being marketed for sale by Five Point Infrastructure, for example.

TARIFFS WEIGH

In recent years, U.S. oil and gas pipeline projects have faced regulatory hurdles and robust environmental opposition, resulting in years of delay and substantial cost overruns.

The Mountain Valley Pipeline, a natural gas conduit owned by an EQT Corp-led group, started operating last June but took six years to build and cost more than double its initial $3.5 billion budget.

While the industry has welcomed Trump's pro-fossil fuel sentiment, some of his other policies - including tariffs on products like steel - are pushing up the cost of new energy projects.

Weak global crude prices have also prompted warnings from U.S. oil and gas producers that they could curtail output growth, making pipeline firms cautious about new spending.

Some companies, including Kinder Morgan, said they believe there are better economics in smaller-scale projects that expand existing infrastructure than in big new ones.

Others are wary of even those types of projects.

DT Midstream CEO David Slater said last month that while some bite-size expansion may continue on the company's LEAP system in the Haynesville basin, he wanted to see how local producers react to commodity price movements before considering new plans.

""I think we just need to let the clock run here a little bit, see how the basin responds,"" he told analysts on a call.

OPTING TO BUILD

Despite the hurdles, the math still favors new construction for some companies.

Energy Transfer said it will build the $2.7 billion Hugh Brinson natural gas pipeline in Texas, and Tallgrass Energy plans to construct a pipeline to move natural gas from the Permian to its Rockies Express Pipeline running through Colorado and Wyoming.

""Generally, on buy versus build, if you have the opportunity to build, you build because the returns are largely better,"" said Ali Akbar, managing director of energy investment banking at Greenhill, a Mizuho affiliate.

He said buying an asset like a pipeline can sometimes cost two times more than building something similar.

Williams Companies unveiled in March its $1.6 billion Socrates project to build natural gas infrastructure to support data center development in Ohio and has said Washington's newfound support for projects is a welcome change.

""It's nice to see some people that actually think their job is to help get infrastructure built as opposed to being obstructive,"" outgoing CEO Alan Armstrong said on an earnings call this month.

Climate and ecological challenges are fundamentally linked, demanding solutions that address both environmental and social issues. Multibenefit projects–like levee realignments that reconnect floodplains–can combine climate adaptation, water management and ecosystem restoration efforts. However, most funding programs focus on single-purpose projects, making it difficult to support multibenefit solutions.

Our new article studies the Pajaro River flood risk management project in California, exploring how funding can support and hinder multibenefit solutions. We find that local champions were able to integrate multiple benefits into a single-purpose project. However, relying on local innovation is not a general solution to a structural problem. We therefore recommend that agencies and policymakers adapt funding programs to support multibenefit solutions.

The Pajaro River flood risk management project is a valuable example

The lower Pajaro Valley on California’s Central Coast has repeatedly struggled with severe flooding, most recently in 2023. Congress approved an overhaul of the aging levees in 1960, but the project was delayed until 2019 because of cost-benefit concerns and coordination challenges. The $600 million project is funded by the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Pajaro River Flood Risk Management Agency (PRFMA), with the California Department of Water Resources covering PRFMA’s share of the construction costs.

While the main project purpose is flood risk management, champions from PRFMA and the Army Corps saw the opportunity to reconnect floodplains and enable natural processes. They pursued additional benefits like groundwater recharge and habitat restoration, but these benefits fell outside the scope of single-purpose funding sources.

Multibenefit solutions rely on champions

Single-purpose funding provisions, like those of the Pajaro River project, challenge multibenefit solutions: They exclude cobenefits from funding decisions and limit spending to a primary goal, such as flood risk management. Despite these challenges, champions in the Pajaro Valley collaborated to design a levee realignment project that integrates flood protection and ecological benefits. Yet, funding gaps for cobenefits remained.

To extend flood protection and floodplain restoration beyond the project’s core footprint, PRFMA, the Army Corps and partners secured additional funding from more than 10 different grants. This piecemeal funding approach is complex and resource-intensive: Project proponents must navigate multiple grant applications and reporting requirements, while agencies are left with administering multiple programs.

The Pajaro River project demonstrates how champions can break through siloes to advance multibenefit projects. However, it also shows that these projects hinge on individual efforts rather than institutional structures, potentially leaving valuable benefits on the table.

Multibenefit solutions need multibenefit funding programs

The Pajaro River project shows that an integrated flood risk management is possible despite siloed single-purpose funding. However, it also highlights the challenges of funding multibenefit solutions and raises the question: What more could projects achieve if funding programs explicitly supported cobenefits? Integrated funding could facilitate more multibenefit projects, close funding gaps, and ease the burden on project proponents.

We recommend that policymakers and agencies use their respective authorities to modernize funding to reflect the integrated nature of ecosystems and communities. They can support multibenefit solutions by a) creating dedicated single-agency grant programs that fund a project’s full lifecycle and encourage or require multiple benefits; and b) coordinating funding across agencies to produce complementary programs and create joint funding programs for projects that span multiple agency priorities.

We understand that these changes would be significant and non-trivial. At the same time, the transition from traditional limited purpose projects to multibenefit projects has significant and non-trivial positive impacts on social-ecological systems. Policymakers and agencies must consider these options within their own institutional realities.

Institutionalizing cross-sector collaboration is key to addressing climate change impacts and biodiversity loss, and using public resources more efficiently. Multibenefit projects should be the default, not the product of champions. It is time for funding that matches the scale and the complexity of today’s challenges.

Bottom line: The bill is a threat to the industry.

SolarEdge (SEDG), Sunrun (RUN), Complete Solaria (SPWR), and Enphase Energy (ENPH) were among the biggest decliners this week. All were down by double-digit percentages despite a mild relief rally in the sector on Friday.

Most of the damage came after the House passed Trump's ""big, beautiful bill,"" which proposes ending key investment and production tax credits from the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act three years earlier than Wall Street expected. The bill also requires eligible wind and solar projects to begin construction within 60 days of becoming law.

While analysts believe the current version of the bill is unlikely to survive intact in the Senate, the prospect of tighter restrictions has spooked investors.

To be finalized and signed into law in its current form — that would create a lot of disruption and layoffs, project cancellations, potentially bankruptcies,"" Raymond James investment strategy analyst Pavel Molchanov told Yahoo Finance.

Molchanov expects the industry to ramp up lobbying efforts in the coming weeks to persuade the Senate to roll back the more severe provisions. Key senators representing states with large solar and wind industries are also likely to push for a more measured approach.

""Dialing back these last-minute modifications from the last 48 hours, that would be a victory from the perspective of solar and wind,"" he added. Molchanov noted that the US installed a record 38 gigawatts of solar capacity last year; further records were in sight this year.

""After the tax credit expires — whenever that may be — there will be a decline in the amount of wind and solar installations. Will it go to zero? No, absolutely not,"" he added. ""There will always be solar and wind projects getting built. It's just a matter of how many.""

The clean energy industry has had a volatile year as elevated interest rates have kept borrowing costs high. President Trump's return to the White House has added pressure to the sector, with his administration talking down green energy initiatives in favor of fossil fuels.

On the manufacturing side, companies involved with batteries and panels have leaned into plans to onshore operations in response to Trump's tariff policies.

In a move welcomed by the solar sector, the US Department of Commerce announced plans to impose tariffs as high as 3,521% on panel imports from four Southeast Asian countries.

Despite a recent rally fueled by hopes that clean energy tax credits might be preserved, the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) is down more than 6% year to date, falling over 7% in the wake of the House vote.

“President Trump is taking truly historic action to usher in the American nuclear renaissance,” White House science adviser Michael Kratsios said Friday in a briefing for reporters.

One of four executive orders signed by Trump assigns DOE and the Defense Department to oversee construction of new reactors “to power and operate critical defense facilities” and to power data centers and artificial intelligence programs.

According to a White House official who briefed reporters, the two departments apparently would oversee development of these projects without reliance on regulatory reviews by the NRC, previously known as the Atomic Energy Commission, which has overseen nuclear reactor development since just after World War II.

“The NRC will not have a … direct role in that,” the official said.

Texts of the executive orders were not immediately available Friday. Drafts that circulated recently indicated that important NRC regulatory decisions on design safety would likely be reviewed by the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). The administration’s assertion of policy oversight of nuclear power is part of the upheaval in the federal bureaucracy Trump has launched.

The administration will undertake a “substantial reorganization” of the NRC, according to the official, who could not be identified by name. “There will be turnover and changes in roles. Total reduction in staff is undetermined at this point,” the official said.

The demotion of the NRC has alarmed some former commissioners and energy experts.

“This is the detailed, agency-specific effort to override the historic independent agency construct,” Stephen Burns, who was chair of the NRC during the Obama administration, said in an interview with E&E News earlier this month, based on review of the draft orders.

Many of the actions to speed up reactor licensing in the draft orders are already underway, following congressional enactment of the ADVANCE Act last year, he said. Burns questioned the necessity and justification of what he called White House micromanagement.

“Everybody should be worried about that, especially because we depend on nuclear power plants for about 20 percent of our electricity across this country,” Emily Hammond, a former DOE deputy general counsel and current George Washington University law professor, said in response to the draft orders viewed by E&E News.

“That’s an important segment of low-carbon electricity, and if it’s not safe, that’s a huge gap to fill,” Hammond said.

Kratsios, in remarks Friday, placed the blame for the decline of nuclear power development on regulatory and political roadblocks. “America’s great innovators and entrepreneurs have run into brick walls when it comes to nuclear technology,” he said.

But the two full-sized Vogtle nuclear reactors now operated by Georgia Power, the only new plants completed in a generation, suffered enormous construction costs overruns and ran years behind schedule.

However, a cluster of energy and technology companies have been developing designs for small modular reactors (SMRs) with strong bipartisan congressional support and financial backing from the Biden administration’s DOE.

The SMR developers hope that their plants, once established commercially, could be built in factories and at a lower construction cost.

“The poor precedent set this week by some members of Congress compounds the Trump administration’s efforts to strip away New York’s legal right to implement environmental laws and initiatives that protect air quality and help safeguard communities from pollution,” DEC Acting Commissioner Amanda Lefton said. “New York strongly believes in the importance of states’ authority under the Clean Air Act and, more specifically, clean vehicle programs that continue to be supported by consumers. Despite the Senate’s vote to revoke the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s order granting California’s waiver and with it the authority of New York and other states to act in the best interests of residents, New York will continue supporting the transition to electric vehicles.

“Car and truck manufacturers need certainty amidst the recent supply chain and other production challenges driven by the instability of recent federal policies and pronouncements. DEC is issuing additional enforcement discretion to help promote ongoing clean vehicle sales and ensure that we have a workable program. We will also continue collaborating with other states, car and truck manufacturers, labor, and other partners through the Affordable Clean Cars Coalition and other initiatives that invest in charging infrastructure and increase use of electric cars, trucks, buses, and other vehicles across all sectors of New York’s economy. We will continue to show the leadership necessary to promote market stability, economic certainty, and prevent pollution – leadership that is lacking at the federal level,” Acting Commissioner Lefton continued.

Amidst uncertainties stemming from federal actions, New York State issued enforcement discretions that ease manufacturers’ near-term compliance with the State’s Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT) and Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II) requirements. The enforcement discretion aims to provide clarity to consumers while working to keep New York on track to achieve its clean transportation goals and the many health and environmental benefits communities will see from the increased deployment of zero-emission vehicles (ZEV) and reducing pollution.

To sustain New York State’s progress, DEC’s enforcement discretion actions for ACT (PDF) and ACC II (PDF) will pause penalties associated with any shortfalls of ZEV sales during the first two years of implementation of each program – for ACT model years 2025 and 2026, and for ACC II model years 2026 and 2027.

To sustain New York State’s progress in the transition to cleaner vehicles and making sure consumers have the ability to purchase EVs, enforcement discretion for ACT and ACCII will be provided to manufacturers that show good faith efforts in working toward the sales requirements. This will include keeping records of vehicle sales and reporting vehicle supply conditions, and discourage the practice of ‘ratio-ing’ internal combustion engine vehicles for EVs to dealerships, which has caused hardships among car and truck dealers.

The enforcement discretions are the latest step in helping promote the ongoing adoption of electric vehicles in New York State. Earlier today, Governor Kathy Hochul joined 10 other states as part of the U.S. Climate Alliance’s launch of the Affordable Clean Cars Coalition (ACCC)(link is external). The initiative was launched by a group of governors whose states have chosen to use their authority under the Clean Air Act to adopt and implement clean vehicle programs.

ACCC will sustain America’s transition to cleaner and more affordable cars, support U.S. automotive manufacturers and workers, and preserve states’ clean air authority. Alongside the launch, the Alliance announced the availability of resources to help states tackle vehicle pollution and lower barriers for consumers to more affordably own, drive, charge, and maintain cleaner cars.

State Investments in Electric Vehicles

To date, New York State’s nearly $3 billion investment in electrifying its transportation sector has supported a range of initiatives aimed to increase access to EVs and charging while improving air quality and health outcomes for all New Yorkers. These programs include EV Make Ready(link is external), EVolve NY(link is external), Charge Ready NY 2.0, the Drive Clean Rebate, the New York Truck Voucher Incentive Program, the New York School Bus Incentive Program, the Direct Current Fast Charger program, and the Municipal ZEV and ZEV Infrastructure grant programs.",https://dec.ny.gov/themes/custom/gesso/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-23 18:10:01.062164

California used to be able to set its own emissions standards above and beyond those set by the Federal government. It was a provision of the Clean Air Act, signed into law by republican president Richard Nixon. But not anymore. The house and senate passed sweeping legislation yesterday axing, among many other things, the Golden State’s ability to create tougher standards for cars, trucks, SUVs, and even weed whackers. The president is expected to sign it into law.

It’s not just a West Coast Story. California’s tougher emission standards were followed by nearly a dozen other states and the District of Columbia, so it has nationwide effects. Along with language in the bills that appears to wipe out standards set by the EPA and even NHTSA, the legislation will have a direct effect on clean air across the country.

The U.S. House of Representatives

The legislation represents a joint resolution that nullifies the Environmental Protection Agency notice titled, “California State Motor Vehicle and Engine Pollution Control Standards; Advanced Clean Cars II; Waiver of Preemption; Notice of Decision (90 Fed. Reg. 642),” published on January 6, 2025. That was what allowed California to set its own standards. The expected law nullifies the California Air Resources Board waiver to establish Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II) regulations.

Under CARB’s ACC II mandate, 35% of new 2026 model cars sold in the state would have to be zero-emission vehicles, ramping up to 68% in 2030 and 100% in 2035, ambitious goals.

Some entities were happy with the development.

“SEMA today is rejoicing in the successful, bipartisan effort to end EV mandates,” the aftermarket parts organization said. “California’s Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II) regulation jeopardized a significant sector of the American economy. A third of the specialty automotive aftermarket is based on ICE technology. Today’s Senate vote to end California’s national EV mandate and ICE vehicle ban protects $100 billion of annual economic impact to the nation’s economy and the more than 330,000 American jobs these policies threatened.”

How this will affect Tesla is still unknown.

Others were less enthusiastic.

“California profoundly disagrees with today’s unconstitutional, illegal and foolish vote attempting to undermine critical clean air protections,” said California Air Resources Board Chair Liane Randolph. “It’s an assault on states’ rights the federal administration claims to support that puts national air quality standards out of reach and will have devastating effects for the 150 million Americans who breathe unhealthy air every day.”

“Senate Republicans just launched an unlawful assault on clean air at the behest of fossil fuel lobbyists and short-sighted car and truck manufacturers who’d rather gut our future than let America lead in clean technology,” said Katherine Garcia, Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All campaign director. “These destructive corporate polluters are intent on overwhelming Americans with health-threatening vehicle pollution for decades to come.”

Just when the charging network was starting to work...

California governor Gavin Newsome’s office released a statement of its own: “Senate Republicans are trying to illegally wipe out California’s clean air rules—the same rules that have reduced pollution and kept generations of Californians healthy. They’re selling out America’s economic dominance to China and Making America Smoggy Again.”

It’s all part of what is known by some as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the republicans’ sweeping mandate affecting almost every facet of life and legislation in America.

The BBBA will have wide-ranging effects, including imposing a $250 annual tax on EVs.

""Repealing clean energy tax credits will gut America’s clean energy production–including EV production and battery recycling–raising costs for families and killing hundreds of thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs, all to fund massive tax breaks for billionaires,"" said Lindsey Perkins, Director of Communications and Marketing for EV advocacy group Plug In America. ""Without these tax credits for consumers and businesses, electricity prices will increase by more than $110 per year for American households starting next year (according to the Clean Energy Buyers Association).

""Additionally, this bill will impose a punitive tax of $250 on EV drivers every year. At the current federal gas tax rate of 18.4 cents per gallon, the average gas-powered light-duty vehicle pays only $82.25 in gas taxes each year. EV drivers want to pay their fair share, but this $250 annual tax is unfair.""

The Energy & Commerce committee section of the BBBA cuts Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for 2024-26, plus CAFE standards for passenger cars and light trucks for Model Year 2027 “and beyond,” as well as fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans for MY30 and beyond.

The Environmental Protection Agency under the Biden administration in March 2024 issued standards that would mandate EVs reach 30% to 56% of passenger vehicle and light-duty truck production and 20-32% of medium-duty truck production, by 2030-32. The House budget bill mandates those standards “shall have no force or effect.”","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/republican-presidential-candidate-former-president-donald-news-photo-1747956172.pjpeg?crop=1xw:0.75xh;center,top&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-05-23 16:07:09.628835

Kratsios said the U.S. has been the world leader in nuclear innovation in the past, but that in the last three decades, has only started and built two reactors.

History's greatest transformations are rarely slow and measured, they are explosive. The Industrial Revolution didn't politely knock; it forced its way in, reshaping economies, industries and societies. Today, we're at the cusp of another shift: the transition to clean energy. But this time, we're moving too slowly. Here, Christoph Dorigatti, Vice President Global Business Development at automation supplier COPA-DATA, explores five steps that the energy sector must prioritize to drive the energy revolution.

Despite record-breaking growth in renewable energy, the world is dangerously off track to meet crucial climate goals. If we are serious about securing a sustainable, equitable and resilient energy future, we must act now.

1. Empower people for an inclusive energy future

The clean energy shift will create millions of jobs — but only if workers are given the tools to transition. In the UK alone, National Grid estimates 400,000 new roles will need to be filled by 2050. However, without effective workforce planning, economic disparities will deepen. This ‘just transition' is crucial, ensuring workers in carbon-intensive sectors have access to reskilling programs and vocational training.

The transition must also provide for everyone, not just those who can afford it. Right now, rising energy costs are hitting low-income communities hardest, with 10.6 per cent of Europeans in 2023 unable to afford adequate heating. Without targeted support, millions more risk being left behind.

Stronger social safety nets, direct financial assistance and affordability-focused policies must be non-negotiable. The EU's Social Climate Fund is a step forward to protecting the most vulnerable, but deeper reforms are needed to avoid widening equality.

2. Drive innovation and accelerate efficiency

Innovation is the backbone of the energy transition, and without it, the transition will stall. A recent European Commission study highlights key research areas such as next-gen batteries, offshore wind and green hydrogen as heavyweights in the energy sector, but funding and policy support remain inconsistent.

Scaling up investment in these technologies is crucial. Smart solutions — like AI-driven energy optimization, analytics and automation — can also help maximize efficiency and reduce waste. Energy efficiency is one of the fastest, most cost-effective ways to slash emissions and improve energy security. Yet despite ambitious targets — like the goal set at COP28 to double efficiency by 2030 — progress remains slow.

Businesses must embrace smarter energy optimization technologies. Governments should introduce incentives and enforce efficiency targets to support private sector investments and accelerate progress. The technology exists — now it's about putting it into action.

3. Modernize grids and infrastructure

The world's energy grids were built for the energy mix of the past, not the future. Renewables require a more flexible approach. Transmission and distribution investments must increase to keep grids running reliably even with variable, and often unpredictable, renewable loads.

Smarter grids, real-time energy management, energy storage and microgrids are critical to handling this switch. Expanding transmission networks will also be essential to connect renewable-rich regions with demand-heavy areas. Without these investments, the International Energy Agency (IEA) states that CO2 emissions will soar — and climate goals will slip further out of reach.

Focusing on challenging sectors such as heavy industry, manufacturing and transport is also essential. According to the IEA, the industry sector emitted 9.0 gigatons of CO2 in 2022 alone, while transport accounts for more than a third of emissions from end-use sectors.

Scaling up investment in electrification, reducing emissions intensity, automation and clean energy alternatives is crucial. Policy clarity, financial incentives and regulatory certainty will also be key to making green technologies the norm rather than the exception in sectors that are tougher to decarbonize.

4. Rethink regulation and financing

Despite massive capacity expansion, renewable deployment still falls short. Slow permitting and continued fossil fuel subsidies are creating an uneven playing field, making it even harder for clean energy to compete and giving legacy sources an unfair advantage.

Governments must double down on policies and incentives that supercharge green energy development, cutting red tape and fast-tracking projects. Energy companies need policy certainty, predictable returns and confidence that decarbonisation pathways are bankable. Unlocking private capital starts with bold, long-term regulatory clarity.

However while investment in clean energy is booming in wealthier nations, many developing countries are struggling to keep up. Without access to financing, they risk being locked into outdated, high-carbon systems.

To ensure that efforts are inclusive, wealthier nations must step up, providing not just money, but also technology and expertise to help these regions move to cleaner energy. Developed countries and international organizations can create partnerships to further support the transition. A global, collaborative approach can accelerate clean energy infrastructure worldwide and ensure no country is left behind.

5. A united approach

The transition to clean energy is still fragmented, making it harder to integrate solutions and share knowledge effectively. Policymakers, innovators and utilities often work in silos when they should be working together — governments creating the right frameworks, utilities driving innovation and adoption and innovators providing the tools and technologies to make the transition seamless.

Working with philanthropies, finance institutions and investors can unlock much-needed funding. To overcome challenging financial barriers, public and private entities should offer competitive financing terms that offset high interest rates and support the long-term success of clean energy projects. Real-time knowledge sharing through digital platforms can further accelerate innovation and modernize the global energy system. When it comes to tackling climate challenges, taking a united approach is the only way forward.

The time to act is now

Just as the Industrial Revolution reshaped economies with bold action and innovation, today's energy transition is our opportunity to build a cleaner, fairer and more resilient world.

This cannot be an isolated effort. Governments, businesses and innovators must unite to drive this transformation. The stakes couldn't be higher — but with decisive action, we can revolutionize the global energy system and secure a sustainable future.

The limited availability of public transport, long distances between shops and workplaces, and dispersed demand make offering attractive public transport services more of a challenge. As a result, most people choose to drive, causing an increase in car traffic.

""In rural regions, the car is an important means of transport and the road is a major transport route,"" said transport minister Patrick Schnieder. ""At the same time, we are creating the conditions for complementary, networked and intelligent mobility services.""

The report, intended as a guideline for local authorities, looked at successful examples from various German regions to make sustainable mobility more attractive to citizens. It found that introducing many alternatives to cars, as opposed to a single new offering, and integrating them so users can complete a journey using multiple modes of transport, is the most successful approach to best meet the specific mobility needs of different residents in rural areas.

This includes, for example, strong regional rail offerings, together with traditional local public transport services, and complementary services like a well-developed network of cycle paths, car sharing services, and park and ride services.

The text of President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill,” which passed the U.S. House of Representatives early Thursday, contains a provision that would impose a new annual registration fee on electric and hybrid vehicles, a move that experts say will disincentivize purchases of zero- and low-emission vehicles across the country.

The legislation outlines fees of $250 a year for EVs and $100 a year for hybrid vehicles, to be imposed by the Federal Highway Administration. If passed by the Senate, the law would also require the fees to increase in line with inflation.

By proposing a new registration fee for EVs, Congress is following the lead of a number of states seeking a way to make up for lost gasoline tax revenue as more and more drivers turn to electric transportation.

Both states and the federal government rely heavily on gasoline taxes for construction and maintenance of roads and bridges. The average gasoline car driver will pay about $279 per year in federal gasoline taxes this year, based on gas at $3.10 per gallon, the average price that federal energy forecasters have projected for 2025. (According to the American Petroleum Institute, the average U.S. driver purchases 489 gallons of gasoline per registered vehicle annually, and the federal highway tax is 18.4 cents per gallon.)

Thirty-nine states now require a special registration fee for EVs or other alternative fuel vehicles, ranging from a low of $50 in Colorado to a high of $290, planned in New Jersey to start in 2028, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

But some energy economists have argued that imposing high registration fees for EVs is not a good way to address funding of highway costs, because it discourages EV purchases. Instead, they have analyzed other approaches that would be more technology neutral, like charging all drivers a fee based on how many miles per year they travel.

The new registration fees would be imposed on top of these existing state charges, further penalizing those drivers who choose to drive hybrids and EVs.

Daniel Tait, who leads Energy Alabama, a nonprofit organization that has advocated for clean energy in the state for more than a decade, said the newly proposed fees are a bad idea.

“These proposed registration fees would be new taxes that not only hurt regular people trying to save on gas, they are a direct threat to Alabama’s burgeoning EV manufacturing sector,” he said. “For a state that has invested heavily in becoming a leader in EV production, this move is not just counterproductive, it’s economically reckless.”

Alabama already imposes an annual registration fee of $200 for each electric vehicle and $100 for each plug-in hybrid vehicle, according to its Department of Revenue. The fees were first imposed on Jan. 1, 2020, with a $3 increase beginning in 2023 and every fourth year after.

“Added to Alabama’s existing EV registration fees, which are already among the highest in the nation, these new proposed federal fees would create a hostile environment for EV adoption,” Tait added. “This not only discourages consumers from purchasing EVs but also sends a negative signal to manufacturers considering investment in the state.”

The proposed EV and hybrid fees come as governors from 11 states have announced a concerted effort to “sustain America’s transition to cleaner and more affordable cars.”

On Friday, the U.S. Climate Alliance announced that 11 of its member governors have launched the Affordable Clean Cars Coalition, an effort to resist actions aimed at rolling back electrification of the transportation sector that they say “undermine American competitiveness in the global automotive market and constrain innovation.”

“The federal government and Congress are putting polluters over people and creating needless chaos for consumers and the market, but our commitment to safeguarding Americans’ fundamental right to clean air is resolute,” the group said in a statement.

So far, Republican supporters of the president’s “big beautiful bill” have remained mum on the fee increase, instead touting the legislation as critical to cutting taxes.

“The House did its part,” Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) posted on social media. “We must pass meaningful tax cuts and help hardworking Americans ASAP before the 2018 tax cuts expire.”

The White House did not immediately respond to questions about how the proposed increase aligns with its goal of lowering taxes for Americans.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2155471173-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 18:09:48.707644

A senior White House official said the goal is to have a new nuclear reactor operating before Trump leaves office in early 2029.
The backstory: Trump’s first order speeds up testing of advanced nuclear reactors at DOE national laboratories and launches a pilot reactor construction program over the next two years.
Additional context was provided by the White House, U.S. Department of Energy, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Quotes from officials, including OSTP Director Michael Kratsios, were taken from a White House media briefing.","President Donald Trump on Friday signed a sweeping set of executive orders designed to dramatically accelerate nuclear reactor construction, focusing on federal sites and reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to speed up licensing timelines.

The move is part of a broader push by the administration to meet rapidly growing energy demands driven by artificial intelligence and domestic manufacturing expansion. A senior White House official said the goal is to have a new nuclear reactor operating before Trump leaves office in early 2029.

The executive actions include reforms across four fronts: testing and construction at Department of Energy (DOE) labs, a new partnership with the Department of Defense (DOD), restructuring of the NRC, and expansion of uranium mining and enrichment in the U.S.

Why is Trump invoking emergency powers for nuclear energy?

The backstory:

Trump’s first order speeds up testing of advanced nuclear reactors at DOE national laboratories and launches a pilot reactor construction program over the next two years. A second order establishes a joint effort between DOE and DOD to build and operate nuclear reactors on federal sites.

The third and most controversial order targets the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, requiring it to cut reactor license approval times to 18 months—a dramatic shift from the current five-year timeline. The NRC has been under congressional mandate to lead in approving advanced reactor technologies, but now faces pressure to act faster with limited resources.

A fourth order focuses on boosting domestic uranium mining and enrichment, citing national security and fuel independence.

What they're saying:

Michael Kratsios, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, told reporters Friday that U.S. developers ""have run into brick walls when it comes to nuclear technologies.""

""With these actions, the president has shown the world that America will build again, and the American nuclear renaissance can begin,"" Kratsios said.

The White House emphasized that the NRC would remain the key regulator for non-federal reactors, but not for facilities built on DOE or DOD lands. That responsibility would fall to those agencies under their own statutory authorities.

What’s next for U.S. nuclear policy?

The other side:

Critics argue that pushing the NRC to accelerate license reviews could compromise safety and strain an already understaffed agency. Others caution that federal site construction alone may not resolve cost and fuel supply barriers that have slowed nuclear development for decades.

Big picture view:

Despite bipartisan support for nuclear power as a zero-emissions energy source, new reactor construction has lagged due to financial, regulatory, and logistical challenges. Trump’s orders mark the most aggressive federal push for nuclear expansion since the early 2000s.

However, according to the Inside EVs report, GM is currently planning to hold steady on consumer pricing through the rest of the year.
The low price, coupled with the vehicle's 300-plus mile range, has made Chevrolet the fastest-growing EV brand in the country.
While there is an environmental impact, the process is getting cleaner over time and has minimal negative effects in comparison to the 16.5 billion tons of fuel required for powering traditional gas vehicles.
""We feel good about where pricing is versus where we started the year, so we've assumed things remain constant from here,"" Jacobson said, according to Inside EVs.","Inside EVs reported that General Motors is not planning to raise prices due to the current administration's tariff policies.

""We now expect pricing to be relatively consistent for the remainder of the year."" GM CFO Paul Jacobson stated, according to the report.

This announcement is surprising. Several of GM's EVs are assembled in Mexico, so the company is bracing for a huge cost impact in the billions of dollars. However, according to the Inside EVs report, GM is currently planning to hold steady on consumer pricing through the rest of the year.

The article cites that the Equinox EV is currently the most affordable EV in the U.S. and that GM credits its Mexico build location for keeping costs so low. The low price, coupled with the vehicle's 300-plus mile range, has made Chevrolet the fastest-growing EV brand in the country.

GM said it is expecting a $4 billion to $5 billion impact based on the current tariff policy, affecting imports from Korea, Mexico, and Canada. It plans to offset some of the costs with ""self-help initiatives"" and increased U.S. production of battery components, according to the report.

Switching from a gas-powered vehicle to an EV has environmental and financial benefits. EVs do not produce air pollution that contributes to the warming of the planet, so it is a more eco-friendly transportation choice. EV owners can say goodbye to rising, fluctuating gas prices, saving money over time.

Watch now: How bad is a gas stove for your home's indoor air quality?

Some EV skeptics cite the negative environmental effects that are a result of the pollution created during the battery manufacturing and charging process. While there is an environmental impact, the process is getting cleaner over time and has minimal negative effects in comparison to the 16.5 billion tons of fuel required for powering traditional gas vehicles. Roughly 30 million tons of minerals are dug up annually for the more affordable energy transition to EVs, and these minerals can often be reused, further reducing the environmental impact.

Jacobson is confident that GM's wide EV lineup – from the $35,000 Equinox EV to the $130,000 Cadillac Escalade IQ – will help the company maintain pricing.

The legislation, with some amendments from the originally proposed version, cleared the House narrowly with 215 yeas and 214 nays. Going by the amendments, the entire residential solar ecosystem would be ‘gutted’ according to analysts at ROTH.

According to the amendments introduced, installers that lease energy equipment to customers and collect investment tax credit (ITC) under Section 48E will be prohibited from doing so. Tax credits under 45Y and 48E will be available to projects that begin construction within 60 days after the enactment of the law and placed in service by December 31, 2028.

Additionally, the amendments propose an immediate end to residential ITC under 25D. These will not be available after December 31, 2025.

Philip Shen, Managing Director and Sr. Research Analyst at ROTH, believes ending 25D could ‘effectively shut down’ the residential solar industry from January 1, 2026.

Princeton University’s Andlinger Center for Energy & Environment lists the expected impact of the bill, saying that the potential impact of the bill passed by the House is substantively similar to the full repeal scenario. In case of the full repeal of the current federal energy and climate policies would imperil $522 billion in announced but pending investments in the US clean energy supply and manufacturing.

A positive element is that the amended bill leaves 45X credits and phaseout unchanged from the previous version (see US Legislation Proposes Earlier Phase Out Of Clean Energy Tax Credits).

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) has already warned that the bill could jeopardize nearly 300 solar and storage factories and erase $220 billion in local investments by 2030. Energy Innovation Policy & Technology estimates a decline in new power generation capacity, including a 33 GW decrease in solar additions (see SEIA: 300 Solar & Storage Factories At Risk With US Legislation).

SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper calls it an ‘unworkable’ legislation that will ensure that America effectively surrenders the AI race to China and prepare for blackouts.

“But that’s not all: Americans’ electric bills will soar. Hundreds of factories will close. Hundreds of billions of dollars in local investments will vanish. Hundreds of thousands of people will lose their jobs. Families will lose the freedom to control their energy costs. And our electric grid will be destabilized,” added Hopper.

Another association of labor unions and environmental organizations, the BlueGreen Alliance, criticized the amended version of the budget reconciliation bill, saying that the provisions would kill job-creating investments made under the IRA, as there will likely be cancellations of planned clean energy manufacturing facilities.

“We urge all Americans to call their Senators and remind them who they work for. We will not stand by as they kill family-sustaining, union jobs, increase energy prices, and surrender our manufacturing future to China while trashing our clean air and water,” stated BlueGreen Alliance Executive Director Jason Walsh.

Having cleared the House, the legislation now heads to the Republican Party-dominated Senate before being signed into law by the US President.

In the US nuclear power has bipartisan support, with Democrats in favour of building new reactors because it is virtually free from carbon emissions.","Donald Trump is poised to sign an executive order that would create a new nuclear “Manhattan Project” designed to help the US win the global race for artificial intelligence.

The order is expected to fast track the development of nuclear power stations in the United States, which would then supply the huge data centres required for AI.

The Trump administration is seeking ways to counter the “huge resources” being deployed by China to develop the nascent technology.

Chris Wright, the US energy secretary, warned earlier this year that the clamour to build the power sources required to meet the growing need from AI had become “Manhattan Project 2”, in reference to the country’s programme to develop atomic bombs during the Second World War.

He said: “It is critical, just like Manhattan Project 1, that the United States wins this race.

“China has huge resources. They are massively focused on artificial intelligence.

“If we don’t unleash American innovation and American entrepreneurs and American construction and bold moves, we will lose Manhattan Project 2.”

The executive order aims to ease the process to approve new nuclear reactors and will also bolster supply chains.

In a sign of his focus on America’s power needs, Mr Trump declared a national energy emergency on his first day back in the White House in January.

The US was the first country to develop nuclear power and has 94 nuclear reactors, supplying 97 gigawatts of energy, which gives it the largest nuclear capacity in the world.

Technology companies including Microsoft and Google have embraced nuclear power as a way to meet their expanding energy needs as the US government seeks to catch up with the boom in demand.

In September last year, Microsoft agreed a 20-year deal to purchase power from the Three Mile Island energy plant in Pennsylvania.

The tech giant said the agreement would provide a carbon-free source of energy to power its data centres which are used in AI.

Constellation Energy, the owner of the plant, is expected to reopen it in 2028 following improvements.

Google has also signed a contract with energy company Kairos Power to use its small nuclear reactors to power its AI data centres.

It aims to be powered by Kairos’s first reactor before the end of the decade, with the company set to open more by 2035.

Trump is also expected to use the Defense Production Act, which dates back to the Cold War-era, to declare a national emergency over the US’s dependence on Russia and China for enriched uranium, which is crucial for nuclear power generation.

McKinsey predicted that power demand from US data centres will rise from 178 terawatt hours per year to 606 terawatt hours by the end of this decade. South Korea produced about 595.6 terawatt hours of electricity in 2024.

Data centres will go from consuming 4.3pc of all power in the US to 11.7pc, the consultancy predicted. Demand from data centres alone is forecast to be equivalent to the entire annual output of more than 70 nuclear power plants by 2030.

A draft summary of the executive order is also said to direct government agencies to permit new nuclear facilities. The departments of energy and defence will also be required to identify federal lands and facilities that can be used for nuclear deployment.

In the US nuclear power has bipartisan support, with Democrats in favour of building new reactors because it is virtually free from carbon emissions.

By contrast Republicans are supportive of new nuclear plants as they provide a reliable source of electricity compared to intermittent energy from wind and solar power, which rely on batteries to provide a consistent supply of power.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2025/05/23/TELEMMGLPICT000425650656_17480039842270_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-05-23 14:14:02.102537

""California got special permission from the Biden administration to ban gas-powered cars.
""We're not going to let that happen... Our lawsuit will be about ensuring California can enforce its state laws.""","The Republican-led Senate revoked a waiver instituted under then-President Joe Biden that allowed the state to set aside national pollution standards for cars and set its own more stringent regulations.

But the rubber stamp of a House-passed bill was immediately set for a challenge, with California's government announcing it would sue President Donald Trump's administration.

California Governor Gavin Newsom said the vote was a ""big day for big oil, big day for GM and Toyota, big day for China.""

""Terrible day for your kids, terrible day for air quality, terrible day for innovation and entrepreneurship.""

The state, especially its biggest city, Los Angeles, experienced the nation's worst smog before decades of efforts to clean up.

Part of that push was a mandate ensuring that a third of new 2026 model cars sold in the state must be zero-emission, rising to two-thirds in 2030 and 100 percent in 2035.

Republicans in Washington argue that this is costly, unworkable, and goes against consumer choice.

""California got special permission from the Biden administration to ban gas-powered cars. Because of their market share, this would impact the entire nation,"" said right-wing Utah Senator Mike Lee. ""But Gavin Newsom doesn't get to ruin 49 other states.""

Republicans argue that the Congressional Review Act gives them the right to overturn California's carve-out on a simple majority vote.

But Democrats say Thursday's move was illegal, as nonpartisan watchdogs including the Government Accountability Office and the Senate Parliamentarian said the act could not be applied to waivers.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta said he would sue over the Senate's move.

""The president and his administration are attempting to trample on our authority to maintain long-standing clean vehicle standards and keep our air breathable,"" he said. ""We're not going to let that happen... Our lawsuit will be about ensuring California can enforce its state laws.""

The Senate has only overruled its parliamentarian a handful of times since the role was launched in the 1930s.

Trump went after EVs as he sought reelection, despite significant federal funding allocated to projects in Republican districts, where thousands of jobs are expected to be created.

These include mandates for oil and gas lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, the removal of tax incentives for large-scale renewable energy development, and the repeal of billions of dollars in funding for conservation and restoration.

“We are glad to see the provision that would have authorized the sale of public lands removed, and that there remains a continued commitment to conserving important lands in the West. However, we are disappointed that these fixes did not extend to protection of the fragile ecosystems in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge that provide critical bird habitat,” said Felice Stadler, vice president of government affairs at National Audubon Society. “Also concerning is the significant erosion of support for maintaining a U.S. commitment to an ‘all of the above’ energy agenda that includes critical incentives for clean energy development that has already jumpstarted U.S. manufacturing, job growth, and economic activity in communities across the country.”

“Throughout our 120-year history, Audubon has worked across the aisle to ensure the conservation of birds and the places they need to survive. That work continues and is as important as ever, so as the focus turns to the Senate, we stand ready to work collaboratively and push for critical improvements to mitigate harmful provisions for birds, communities, and our planet,” said Stadler.

Catalysts, Not Causes: Why Disruption Is Inevitable For most people, the clearest recent example of punctuated equilibrium is the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chief investment officers are well-versed in economic models that offer precision and clarity. While these familiar frameworks offer powerful and focused attention, they often neglect seemingly peripheral factors that quietly simmer beneath the surface. Such overlooked elements—political tensions, demographic shifts, technological disruptions—gradually accumulate pressure, setting the stage for sudden, sometimes radical market transformations.

To understand the current volatility, a wider lens, borrowed from both evolutionary biology and political science, provides a vital perspective to today’s markets and a means to explain and alleviate the anxiety of investors: punctuated equilibrium.

Originally coined by paleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould to explain the evolution of species, the idea was later adapted by political scientists Frank Baumgartner and Bryan Jones to explain policy change. Unlike popular assumptions, their insight is that systems don’t usually change gradually. Instead, they remain stable for long stretches while underlying pressures build. Then, seemingly all at once, those pressures break through, producing sudden, dramatic change—a punctuation—before a new equilibrium emerges.

Punctuated equilibrium argues that attention and resources can remain focused on the same assumptions, problems and solutions for years in government and markets. During these periods, incremental adjustments are the norm: policies, regulations and investments change only at the margins. However, as hidden pressures—public frustration, economic disparity, new technology, geopolitical risk—intensify, the likelihood of a disruptive event increases. When a catalyst emerges, a surge of activity and public attention follows. Old policies and norms are swept away, new paradigms are swiftly embraced, and market behavior can shift in new directions.

Why This Matters for Markets and Investors

Markets, much like political systems, are subject to this logic. For most of the post-World War II era, the global economic system experienced a remarkable degree of stability. Liberalized trade, predictable interest rates, centralized supply chains and consistent U.S. leadership formed the foundations for relatively steady growth, low inflation and expanding capital markets. The underlying global order remained predictable despite disruptions such as the dot-com bust and the 2008 financial crisis.

But underneath, seemingly peripheral and unrelated forces were converging, and pressure was mounting:

Demographic trends such as global aging and declining birth rates began to stress social welfare systems and labor markets;

Economic inequality grew in developed nations;

Public trust in institutions, particularly among younger people, was falling;

Manufacturing jobs shifted from traditional regional powerhouses like Detroit in the U.S. to other countries, causing economic and political stresses;

Geopolitical rivals, most notably China, rose in economic and political influence;

Climate change emerged as a global economic risk;

Digital technologies disrupted the way people work, shop and communicate;

Artificial intelligence became not just a new technology, but the promise of a revolution in nearly everything; and

The Ukraine war and conflicts in the Middle East pressured food and energy markets.

The theory of punctuated equilibrium argues that policymakers and market analysts tend to overlook or downplay these pressures. They are rarely captured neatly in existing investment models. When they are acknowledged, they are viewed separately, rather than as a collective stress on the system. In short, they are disregarded until they can no longer be ignored.

A central lesson from political science’s application of punctuated equilibrium is the power of public attention. Markets are not driven by numbers alone; they are driven by what people, leaders and institutions notice and act on. When attention is fixated elsewhere, even large risks can go unaddressed. But once the spotlight swings—because of a crisis, a scandal, an election, a technological breakthrough or a geopolitical event—change happens fast. Policy and market responses are swift, sweeping and often disorderly.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs serve as a prime example. They mark a sharp break from decades of trade policy, causing a reevaluation of economic assumptions and revealing fractures that had quietly built up over the years. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic forced attention onto supply chain fragility, workforce dynamics and digital readiness, revealing vulnerabilities that had gone unaddressed.

These events—tariffs, pandemics, wars and inflation surges—are not the root causes of market turmoil. They are the catalysts that expose and accelerate deeper, systemic change. The turbulence we’re experiencing now is not random collapse or the result of one policy change, but a punctuation in the system: a rapid transition from one equilibrium to another.

Catalysts, Not Causes: Why Disruption Is Inevitable

For most people, the clearest recent example of punctuated equilibrium is the COVID-19 pandemic. Before 2020, daily life and work appeared stable. But beneath the surface, dissatisfaction with commuting and work-life balance had grown, and workforce aging, falling employee engagement in the workplace and digital infrastructure had quietly matured.

When the pandemic hit, these pressures erupted. Millions went remote, digital commerce exploded, health care rapidly adopted telemedicine, and supply chains cracked. The system did not evolve incrementally—it transformed rapidly. Three years later, we live in a new normal, a new equilibrium: hybrid work is mainstream, consumers expect digital-first experiences, and resilience has become a corporate priority.

The key insight? The pandemic didn’t cause all the change—it revealed the need and readiness for it.

Investment strategists and analysts might initially dismiss punctuated equilibrium as a reframing of Nassim Taleb’s “Black Swan” theory, since both concepts address sudden, dramatic market shifts. However, black swans are fundamentally rare, unpredictable outlier events that demand general resilience against unknown risks. Punctuated equilibrium suggests that attentive observers can identify building pressures before they erupt.

This difference fundamentally alters investment strategy—rather than focusing solely on building resilience against unpredictable shocks, the punctuated equilibrium framework recommends that investors adopt a broader perspective and actively monitor seemingly peripheral factors often dismissed as outside economics or mere social noise, such as slow demographic shifts or the erosion of institutional trust, factors easily overlooked until they reach a breaking point. By recognizing these accumulating pressures, investors can position themselves not just to survive disruption, but also to anticipate and capitalize on the emergence of new market equilibria.

Now, markets are experiencing their own shift. Sharp downturns, uneven recoveries and persistent uncertainty are not necessarily signs of a broken system. They indicate a system adjusting to new realities: slower globalization, geopolitical instability, demographic transition and rapid technological change (AI, automation, decarbonization).

The Trump tariffs—breaking with a bipartisan tradition of open trade—highlighted that postwar economic assumptions were beginning to fray. The tariffs acted as an unanticipated catalyst, propelling the system toward a new, yet undefined, equilibrium.

Take the Long View—Prepare for the Next Equilibrium

What does this mean for investors? The most important lesson is that disruption is not failure—it’s transition. Political science suggests that while no equilibrium is permanent, every period of volatility is followed by the establishment of a new order.

The implications:

Stop waiting for things to “go back.” They won’t. Punctuated equilibrium is a new set point;

Invest in adaptability. Companies and organizations that prioritize flexibility, not perfection, under what appears to be the new order, will be more resilient;

Rethink global exposure. Markets may become more regionalized and less dependent on just-in-time global supply chains;

Redefine risk. Traditional economic models often overlook or downplay social and geopolitical drivers, treating them as ancillary, too distant or too difficult to measure to be investment-relevant until they become too significant to ignore. It is important to account for the market impacts of demographic transition, climate events, social unrest, declines in institutional trust and political shifts; and

Prioritize people and talent. Demographic changes and shifting preferences will gradually reshape labor and consumer markets in unexpected ways until a tipping point is reached, shocking those who are focused on the predictable and well-modeled norms today and not watching what is evolving on the edge.

Take the long view. Like political history, market history is a story of stability interrupted by dramatic change, which leads to the emergence of a new equilibrium. Investors who understand this will survive the volatility and be better positioned to capitalize on the next wave of stability and growth.

The good news is that systems don’t remain in turmoil permanently. Just as they punctuate, they also re-equilibrate. Today’s uncertainty is real, but it’s part of the cycle. Eventually, markets will stabilize—not by returning to what they were, but by aligning with new realities.

The businesses and investors that succeed will be those who view disruption not as a detour, but as an inevitable turn in the road toward opportunity.

Congress provided $5 billion to build the network as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021.

President Donald Trump in the “Unleashing American Energy” executive order signed on the first day of his second term outlined policies including eliminating the “electric vehicle mandate” and directing agencies to “immediately pause” sending out funds from the infrastructure law, including for electric vehicle charging.

In early February, the Trump administration sent letters to states notifying them of the suspension of the charging infrastructure program and cancellation of state plans that had already been approved.

In the Thursday filing, the nonprofits are seeking to join a lawsuit filed in federal court in Seattle on May 7 by Washington and 15 other states plus the District of Columbia.

The groups — the Sierra Club, Climate Solutions, Earthjustice, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Plug In America, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, CleanAIRE NC, the West End Revitalization Association and the Southern Environmental Law Center — seek restoration of funding nationwide to build the charging stations.

“We want a seat at the table, and the law gives us that,” said Jan Hasselman, senior attorney with the Earthjustice law firm in Seattle. “If there could be a settlement negotiated, we want to be part of that. The court has to shape a remedy … We want to be part of that so we have the full national perspective on the question, and not a regional one or not a partial one.”

The fast-charging network funded by the program was expected to boost the adoption of electric vehicles, the complaint says.

The federal government has withheld more than $2.74 billion in the congressionally appropriated funds, according to the groups’ complaint. These funds were slated to cover the bulk of costs for fast chargers along highways, “ensuring … reliable charging stations located at least every 50 miles,” in targeted areas.

Absent the federal funding, states have halted development of the chargers, the complaint says.

Advertising

Washington was set to get $71 million to build electric car infrastructure, according to the states’ lawsuit, but most of it is being withheld.

The state had hoped to expand charging on Interstate 5 and other highways, according to reporting by the Washington State Standard, but has had to stop work related to the program. It received 40 proposals, according to the lawsuit, but without federal funding the state has not been able to award a contract for the work.

Washington has vehicle standards that require an increasing percentage of the vehicles sold in the state to be zero emissions, starting this year. State law mandates that all new passenger vehicles sold by 2035 have to be plug-in hybrid or fully electric, and Washington drivers have been fast to adopt these vehicles.

“Suspending the program delays critical investments, widens infrastructure disparities, and sends the message that once again, the taxpayers who’ve been left behind the longest will be the last to benefit,” Omega Wilson, co-director of the West End Revitalization Association, said in a statement.

The environmental groups have members who wish to purchase electric cars, but are waiting for the expansion of the fast-charging network, others who have had to forgo or alter travel plans, or experienced challenges because of the existing limitations on the charging network, the groups’ complaint says, in addition to members who are overburdened by highway-related air pollution, and would see improvements with the increased use of electric vehicles.

“Without (federally funded charging) stations, members confronting climate-related disasters may be left without the dependable infrastructure that is necessary for emergency travel,” the complaint says.

Following the House of Representatives' passage of three Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions in late April and early May, the Senate passed all three resolutions on May 22, 2025. President Donald Trump is expected to sign them.

This congressional action represents the most significant challenge ever to the exercise of California's unique authority under CAA section 209(b), a provision that traces its roots over a half-century back to the Air Quality Act of 1967. This latest action calls into question the fate of several major programs, including California's Advanced Clean Trucks, the ""Omnibus"" Low NOx regulation and Advanced Clean Cars II, some of which have been adopted by more than a dozen other states.

Beyond the CAA, Congress' action also raises the specter of CRA actions on a wide swath of other agency actions that the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) had previously determined not to be ""rules"" under the CRA, touching on topics as diverse as drug approvals,1 broadcast licenses,2 hydroelectric dam licenses,3 oil leases4] and more.

Congressional Action

With the Senate's votes on May 22, 2025, Congress has now passed three CRA resolutions targeting different aspects of California's vehicle emissions program:

H.J.Res. 87 disapproves the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) waiver for multiple California heavy-duty vehicle programs, including Advanced Clean Trucks (requiring increasing percentages of zero-emission truck sales), Zero Emission Airport Shuttles and Zero-Emission Power Train Certification.5]

H.J.Res. 88 disapproves the EPA's waiver for Advanced Clean Cars II, which required all new passenger cars, trucks and SUVs sold in California to be zero-emission by 2035.6

H.J.Res. 89 disapproves the EPA's waiver for the ""Omnibus"" Low NOx regulation, which establishes more stringent emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles.7

Unprecedented Congressional Procedural Battle

Passage of the resolutions came after a procedural battle with potentially far-reaching implications for congressional and agency operations. The House and Senate moved forward with CRA resolutions for the EPA-granted waivers despite both the GAO and Senate Parliamentarian determining that California waivers are not ""rules"" subject to the CRA.

Before advancing the resolutions, the Senate voted 51-46 on a point of order regarding the types of joint resolutions ""entitled to expedited procedures"" under the CRA. The party-line vote effectively set aside decisions of the GAO and Senate Parliamentarian – a move that Senate Democrats strongly opposed as a ""procedural nuclear option."" In a May 1, 2025, letter, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and top Democrats warned that this approach could allow the CRA to be ""weaponized to retroactively invalidate decades of agency actions"" never previously considered to be rules, including ""adjudications, permits, and licensing decisions."" """"If Congress can itself decide what is subject to the CRA, many agency actions previously thought to be outside the CRA realm could now be invalidated—and agencies would arguably be prevented by the CRA from issuing other ""rules"" that are ""substantially the same"" as the disapproved ones.8

Republican Majority Leader John (R-S.D.) defended the Senate's actions by arguing that GAO had inappropriately inserted itself into the process, that the Trump Administration EPA had submitted the waivers to Congress as ""rules,"" and that the Senate has the right to determine its own procedures. Majority Leader Thune pushed back against arguments by Senator Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) that the move was ""setting a precedent that the filibuster is essentially now meaningless,""—stating that, ""While Republicans are in charge, the legislative filibuster will remain in place, and you can take that to the bank'.""

Implications for Regulated Entities, California and Section 177 States

With the CRA resolutions headed to President Trump's desk for signature, California and the 17 states that have adopted its light-duty vehicle standards, along with the 10 states that have adopted its heavy-duty vehicle standards under CAA Section 177, face significant regulatory uncertainty.

Many have questioned whether the CRA may lawfully be used to review the EPA's waivers, and litigation is all but certain. Assuming Congress' actions survive judicial scrutiny, the effect will be to invalidate EPA's waiver decisions—thereby preempting California's authority to enforce these standards, and precluding other states from adopting the California rules as well. Additionally, absent new congressional authorization, EPA would be prohibited from issuing new ""rules"" in the future that are ""substantially the same"" as the disapproved waivers.

For vehicle and engine manufacturers, fleet operators and other stakeholders, these developments create both immediate compliance questions and longer-term planning challenges:

With these regulations already in effect in California and many other states, companies may need to reassess their compliance obligations and recalibrate product development plans, including the degree to which they plan to accelerate deployment of zero-emission vehicles covered by these California rules.

However, major original engine manufacturers (OEMS) entered into agreements with California promising to comply with regulations, including those subject to the CRA resolutions, ""regardless of the outcome of any litigation challenging the waivers/authorizations for those regulations, or [the state's] overall authority to implement those regulations."" The Clean Truck Partnership and similar voluntary agreements between states and manufacturers may thus take on increased importance as nonregulatory mechanisms for emission reductions.

California and other states may pursue alternative regulatory approaches that do not require CAA waivers, potentially creating a patchwork of requirements. Notably, regulation of indirect sources such as warehouses has become of increasing interest in both California and New York as a means for states to target mobile sources without the need for CAA waivers.

What's Next?

Once signed by President Trump, several developments are likely:

Legal Challenges. California and environmental groups will likely challenge the application of the CRA to these waivers, including on the basis that they were not ""rules"" subject to CRA disapproval. As discussed in Holland & Knight's previous alert, the CRA has an unusual judicial ""non-review"" provision that could complicate these efforts"""".

Alternative State Actions. California may pursue alternative regulatory approaches, including Indirect Source Review (ISR) rules targeting facilities, such as ports and warehouses, and enhanced incentive programs to encourage the transition to zero-emission vehicles.

Federal Agency Actions. The EPA may take additional steps to limit state authority over vehicle emissions, potentially revisiting other CAA waivers not covered by these CRA resolutions, including on ""major question"" doctrine grounds. The EPA and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration may also seek to resurrect arguments from the first Trump Administration that California standards are preempted by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.

Congressional Activity. Congress may consider using the CRA for other agency actions previously thought to be outside the CRA's scope, including federal permits, leases, adjudications, drug approvals, and licensing decisions. The consequences could be far-reaching, especially in the Senate, where these actions continue a trend of seeking routes to legislate that avoid the Senate legislative filibuster.

“The CRA also says that federal agencies cannot do something substantially similar to a rule that gets CRA’ed.
They are like passengers on an airplane far out over the ocean that has lost one of its engines.","The party that is always screaming about “states’ rights” and “government overreach” at the top of its lungs has now revealed itself to be nothing more than a bunch of braying jackasses. For 30 years, California has been granted waivers by both Republican and Democratic administrations that allowed it to enact stricter exhaust emissions standards than those prescribed by the federal government. But on May 22, 2025, the US Senate voted to revoke those waivers.

It was a smashmouth moment for Republicans. Two years ago, Texas announced it would enforce its own border, despite that task being specifically delegated to the federal government by the Constitution. Seeking to avoid a confrontation between state and federal law enforcement personnel, the Biden administration sent a strongly worded letter to the governor of Texas, who immediately tore it up and threw it in the trash.

Republicans cheered their duly chosen lunatic, Greg Abbott, and nominated him for sainthood. They also punished bankers for backing “woke” fiscal theories that encouraged companies to make at least a token effort to comply with the Paris climate Accords, accusing the banks of conspiracy and racketeering because they dared to devise a common strategy to avoid turning the Earth into a burnt cinder.

But now Senate Republicans are talking out of the other side of their mouths as they move to crush California’s desire to protect its citizens from tailpipe emissions that not only contribute to rising temperatures but also create a greater risk of respiratory and cardiac disease.

Many people today are suffering from asthma or have family members who are. Asthma is related to many things, and oxides of nitrogen, which are created when gasoline and diesel fuel are burned inside internal combustion engines, are one of those things. Medical professionals claim that breathing in oxides of nitrogen is like giving the inside of our lungs a sunburn. Shouldn’t a state have the ability to reduce that risk if it can? Republicans don’t think so.

CleanTechnica readers, being a savvy lot, remember that when the Moron of Mar-A-Loco was on the rampage the last time, he tried to get the EPA to strip California of the waiver that allows it to set its own exhaust emission standards. That effort was unsuccessful, but the right wing crazies have been plotting their revenge ever since. This time around, the used a legal device to do what they could not do before. Hiding behind the Congressional Review Act, a law signed by Bill Clinton in 1966 as part of his Contract With America initiative., Senate Republicans (and one Democrat) blew up California’s waiver once and for all.

According to Wikipedia, the CRA “empowers Congress to review, by means of an expedited legislative process, new federal regulations issued by government agencies and, by passage of a joint resolution, to overrule a regulation. Once a rule is thus repealed, the CRA also prohibits the reissuing of the rule in substantially the same form or the issuing of a new rule that is substantially the same form unless the reissued or new rule is specifically authorized by a law enacted after the date of the joint resolution disapproving the original rule. Congress has a window of time lasting 60 legislative days to disapprove of any given rule by simple-majority vote; otherwise, the rule will go into effect at the end of that period.”

California Gets Mugged By The Senate

Most readers will notice the CRA was the brain child of a Democratic administration. This is not the only time a Democratic initiative has come back to bite progressives. In 2013, Senate president Harry Reed engineered a work-around that prevented Republicans from blocking federal appointments by Barack Obama. He changed the Senate rules to require a simple majority rather than the 60 votes previously required to bring an end to filibusters for all nominations except those to the Supreme Court.

According to USA Today, after the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell said, “So all you Democrats, if it wasn’t for your party changing the rule in 2013 you would now have the votes to stop Trump from replacing Ginsburg. If you want to blame somebody for screwing you out of the chance to stop Trump from filling this seat, you can put the blame right where it belongs, your own party and the people you elected to run it.”

That was when McConnell changed the Senate rules again to permit the confirmation of Supreme Court nominees by a simple majority. So it is not true, as many believe, that Democrats changed the rules for Supreme Court nominees, but it is true that they created the precedent and McConnell simply seized the opportunity presented. Logicians call this the “slippery slope” argument. Others simply caution, “Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.”

Democrats created the CRA and now Repugnicans are using it to hammer California. What a mess. According to NPR, the Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian, both of whom serve as referees within the federal government, determined that using the CRA was not a proper use of that law. But the GAO’s opinion is merely advisory. The parliamentarian’s guidance is also non-binding. Nevertheless, their input has traditionally been followed by the Senate except on very rare occasions.

“Historically, leaders of both parties have feared that if they act unilaterally to change the Senate’s norms, the other party will do the same when they’re in power. That’s exactly what happened in 2013 and 2017, when first Democrats and then Republicans deployed the ‘nuclear option’ to eliminate the filibuster for judicial nominees,” NPR says in its report.

Right on cue, Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader in the Senate, reacted with predictable fury, “Today it’s all about California emission waivers. But tomorrow, the CRA could now be used to erase any policy from an agency that the Trump administration doesn’t like at a simple majority threshold, Republicans should tread carefully today. What goes around comes around.” Indeed it does, Chuck. In fact it just did.

Let The War Of Words Begin

Reaction has been swift on all sides of the issue, with fossil fuel interests and automakers celebrating as if they had won a great victory by forcing Californians to keep breathing polluted air and environmentalists wringing their hands in despair. For its part, the government of California has rushed to the nearest federal courthouse to get an order that will prevent the Senate’s action from taking effect. One argument that may have some merit is that the CRA does not apply to waivers.

California governor Gavin Newsom, who many think may be positioning himself for a presidential campaign in 2028, said in a statement after the last election, “The freedoms we hold dear in California are under attack — and we won’t sit idle. California has faced this challenge before, and we know how to respond.” But Michael Buschbacher, an attorney who represent groups opposed to the waiver, told the Detroit Free Press that said California is “pretty limited” in its legal options. “The CRA has a provision that says that, basically, anything Congress does under the CRA is not subject to judicial review.”

He also questioned California’s ability to get a waiver for similar rules later on, if or when Democrats return to power in Washington. “The CRA also says that federal agencies cannot do something substantially similar to a rule that gets CRA’ed. That phrase has not really been tested in court. The way I would interpret it would be: California can’t get a waiver from the EPA for electric vehicle mandates.”

A number of other states have adopted the California exhaust emissions rules, but some have already begun walking back their position, no doubt fearing what retaliatory action the failed administration might take against them if they do not.

What is happening here may not be clear to all, but it amounts to this. The anti-EV crowd have won a victory, but are losing the war. They are like passengers on an airplane far out over the ocean that has lost one of its engines. Instead of taking corrective action, the passengers are urging the pilot to pile on more power because they are afraid they will miss their connection if the plane is late arriving at its destination. The idea that they may never reach their destination is conveniently overlooked. Short sighted solutions to long term problems are not very effective.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/to-decarbonize.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 17:12:22.947568

For more information, visit www.spencerfane.com — 1 See my earlier blog discussing California’s unique vehicle emission standards promulgated pursuant to federal Clean Air Act.","In my May 6, 2025, blog post I discussed the U.S. House of Representatives May 1 resolution ostensibly passed pursuant to the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to overturn President Biden’s Clean Air Act “waiver” related to California’s vehicle emission mandates. The next step was consideration of the same issue in the U.S. Senate, action on which had to occur before the June 1, 2025, deadline.

The Senate’s May 22, 2025, passage of its own disapproval resolution completes the Congressional action, for now, in the attempt to repeal California’s electric vehicle mandate.1

And the Senate’s action skirts guidance from the Senate Parliamentarian as well as the non-partisan General Accountability Office (GAO) (aka the “Congressional watchdog”) that both concluded that the CRA did not provide the Congress with the authority to overturn the Biden-era waiver because the waivers are not “rules” but rather are adjudicatory orders issued pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Specifically, after an extensive analysis of the CAA preemption waivers, the Notices of Decision that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) submitted as “rules to Congress” and the limitations of the CRA, the GAO concluded in a letter to Congress:

In these circumstances, our view is that our prior analysis and conclusion in B-334309 that the [California] Advanced Clean Car Program Waiver Notice was not a rule for purposes of CRA (because it was an order under APA) would apply to the three notices at issue here.

Senate Employs the Nuclear Option. To avoid direct confrontation with the Senate’s Parliamentarian’s interpretation, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) set up an elaborate series of procedural votes to allow the Senate to settle the controversial question of what qualifies under the CRA; an action that is typically referred to as the “nuclear option.” Historically used to avoid a filibuster, the nuclear option allows the majority party to use a simple majority vote to overturn a point of order and thus avoid existing procedural constraints.2

Thus, Republicans avoided a Senate floor confrontation over the Parliamentarian’s interpretation of the CRA by sending the question about what qualifies under the CRA back to the full Senate.

Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, authored the joint resolution and applauded the Senate’s action stating:

Today, the Senate voted to end California’s EV mandate and send my joint resolution of disapproval under the CRA to President Trump’s desk. . . . I’m proud to have led this effort to protect American workers and consumers from this radical and drastic policy.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said, “By weaponizing the CRA, Republicans … cross a point of no return for the Senate, expanding what this chamber can do with a majority threshold.”

Next Steps – EPA Rescission – and The Courts? Based on the joint resolution, the EPA will likely rescind the Biden-era waiver and thus stop California (and the 11 other Section 177 states that have embraced similar limits) from implementing the electric vehicle mandates.

Is There Judicial Review Under the CRA? Not for Congressional Action. But, What About Agency Action?

Ultimately, the legal question as to whether the Congress is acting properly pursuant to the authority of the CRA may end up in court; but there are hurdles.

Section 805 of the CRA states: “No determination, finding, action, or omission under this chapter shall be subject to judicial review.” Thus, courts will not review matters falling within the scope of Section 805 but will instead leave the resolution of these CRA-related issues to the political branches.

Courts disagree, however, regarding which CRA-related matters are within Section 805’s scope. A wide range of actions are clearly barred from judicial review. Most courts have interpreted Section 805 to broadly prohibit judicial review of claims alleging CRA violations. But a few courts conclude that certain types of CRA-related claims can be reviewed by courts.

What about judicial review of agencies’ compliance with the CRA? One appellate court drew a distinction between statutory and constitutional claims, concluding that Section 805 barred it from reviewing a claim premised on compliance with the CRA, but did not prevent it from considering a constitutional challenge to a joint resolution of disapproval enacted under the CRA. See Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Bernhardt, 946 F.3d 553, 561 (9th Cir. 2019). Although the appellate court ultimately rejected both arguments made by the plaintiffs, the panel took the time to consider whether the joint resolution of disapproval failed to comply with the constitutional requirements of bicameralism and presentment, and that the subject joint resolution interfered with the executive branch’s constitutional duty under the Take Care Clause to ensure that laws are faithfully executed. Id. at 562,

And as the U.S. Supreme Court said in Elgin v. Dep’t of the Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 9 (2012), the general rule is that statutes that would deny courts the ability to review constitutional claims raise constitutional concerns themselves. Courts will interpret laws barring judicial review to allow constitutional challenges “unless Congress explicitly directs otherwise.” Id.

The Ninth Circuit in Biological Diversity noted that Section 805 does not expressly foreclose review of constitutional claims. 946 F.3d at 561. Therefore, the court ruled that Section 805 did not bar its review of the plaintiff’s constitutional challenge – although the court ultimately rejected the claim on its merits.3

The Courts Will Have to Address the GAO’s Take on the Topic

The GAO provided a detailed discussion of the CRA authority in its March 6, 2025, letter that responded to a request from Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Alex Padilla (D-C.A.), and Adam Schiff (D-C.A.) to the Comptroller General dated February 21, 2025, asking for a legal decision as to whether the EPA’s Clean Air Act preemption waivers and Notices of Decision that the EPA submitted as rules to Congress and GAO in late February 2025 are rules subject to the CRA. The letter states in part:

EPA did not submit CRA reports to Congress or GAO for any of the Notices of Decision when they were initially issued on April 6, 2023, and January 6, 2025, and each notice states that CRA does not apply because the relevant action is not a rule for purposes of the Act. . . . We determined that the Advanced Clean Car Program Waiver Notice was not a rule under CRA because it did not meet the APA definition of a rule. We concluded that the notice was, instead, an “order” under APA. (Emphasis added.)

And further, referring back to its 2023 determination,

We also concluded that even if the Advanced Clean Car Program Waiver Notice met the APA definition of a rule, it would still not be subject to CRA because of CRA’s exclusion of rules of particular applicability. B-334309, Nov. 30, 2023.

A rule of particular applicability is addressed to an identified entity and also addresses actions that entity may or may not take, taking into account facts and circumstances specific to that entity. B-334309, Nov. 30, 2023 (citing B-334995, July 6, 2023).

We noted that the notice concerned a specific entity – California – and addressed a statutory waiver specific to California’s Advanced Clean Car Program; therefore, the notice would be a rule of particular applicability. B-334309, Nov. 30, 2023. (Emphasis added.)

The GAO then addresses what happens if Congress passes disapproval resolutions:

If Congress were to treat the EPA Notices of Decisions as rules under CRA and subsequently enact resolutions of disapproval, there is a question as to the precise effect those resolutions would have.

As described above, if a resolution of disapproval is enacted, then the rule has no force or effect. 5 U.S.C. § 801(b)(1). However, two of the three Notices of Decision submitted by EPA to Congress, the Low NOX Waiver Notice and the Advanced Clean Cars II Waiver Notice, appear to merely notify the public of previously issued decision documents granting California the requested preemption waivers and, in the Low NOX Waiver Notice, the requested authorization for its regulations. . . EPA did not include the underlying decision documents in its submission to Congress and GAO. In contrast, the Advanced Clean Trucks Waiver Notice, like the Advanced Clean Car Program Waiver Notice we examined in B-334309, appears to be the decision document. See 88 Fed. Reg. at 20688 (stating that EPA “is granting . . . California[’s] . . . requests for waivers”).

Accordingly, if Congress were to enact resolutions disapproving the Low NOX Waiver Notice or the Advanced Clean Cars II Waiver Notice under CRA, it is unclear whether or how those resolutions would affect the underlying waivers and authorizations. (Emphasis added.)

Both the House and Senate have acted. Now, back to the EPA – will it rescind the waiver? And the courts – does Congress have the authority it claims under the CRA?

Introduction

Governors can effectively advance their energy policy goals — such as system modernization, reliability, cost reductions or addressing resource adequacy — by leveraging innovative state funding and financing mechanisms alongside federal programs and funding opportunities and private-sector investment. By creating tailored financing mechanisms that reduce barriers for investments, establishing state-level green banks and state energy financing institutions (SEFIs), and incentivizing private-sector investment, Governors can expertly leverage private and household investments to address the energy needs of their states and territories. While often used together, the terms “funding” and “financing” have distinct meanings:

Funding concerns the ultimate source of revenue used to support a project over time. This can include revenue derived through federal grants, state taxation, user charges such as utility rates, and so forth.

Financing refers to agreements put in place to accommodate a timing mismatch between upfront costs and longer-term revenue sources. Financing methods include bonds, federal loans, state revolving loans, tax credits, private financing as part of public-private-partnerships or other arrangements. Funding and financing mechanisms can be “stacked” to provide the capital for large-scale infrastructure projects and invest in new technologies.

This policy brief will highlight several state case studies of effective funding and financing mechanisms for energy projects, including the braiding of private, state, and federal funding or financing sources to maximize investment and strategies for Governors to accelerate project delivery to meet their energy goals.

Case Studies of Gubernatorial Leadership

Early Cost Recovery in Advanced Energy Generation Projects: Virginia’s Innovative Approach to Developing Advanced Nuclear Generation

Virginia has seen significant growth of data centers and large industrial manufacturing within the state, which are contributing to rising electricity demand. Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin has championed the commonwealth’s existing energy generation and has also advanced the development of new generation, including advanced nuclear. In 2022, Virginia published a State Energy Plan which advances an all-of-the-above approach to energy. To continue to grow Virginia’s economy, keep energy affordable and reliable, and meet the demand needs of the future, Virginia has taken an innovative approach to funding and financing energy generation projects.

Advanced nuclear generation projects like small modular rectors (SMRs) have shown promise for reliable, clean energy generation at a lower cost for development than traditional nuclear generation facilities. In Virginia’s 2022 State Energy Plan, Governor Youngkin set a goal for Virginia to host the nation’s first commercial SMR within the next decade. Currently, the SMR industry is still in its infancy and faces cost barriers for siting, permitting, construction and deployment. To address these challenges, in 2024, Governor Youngkin played a key role in crafting and supporting legislation that allows utilities to petition for SMRs. The legislation also allows SMR developers in Virginia to seek regulatory approval for cost recovery on “evaluation, design, engineering, federal approval and licensing, environmental analysis and permitting, early site permitting, equipment procurement, and an authorized rate of return” on SMR projects. Subject to regulatory approval, this would allow developers to recover development-related costs for SMRs, reducing barriers of entry into the emerging energy sector. Traditional cost recovery occurs over the life cycle of the facility and typically begins upon completion of a project.

SMR development in Virginia has been spurred by the enactment of this policy. Following Governor Youngkin’s signing of this legislation, Dominion Energy Virginia (DEV) and Appalachian Power Company (APCo) have announced plans to develop SMRs in Virginia. Dominion Energy has also announced a partnership with Amazon to utilize SMRs to power data centers located in Virginia. located in Virginia.

In addition to encouraging the development of new power generation, this approach seeks to grow Virginia’s energy sector and create jobs. The Governor’s office worked with the legislature as the legislation developed to ensure that ratepayers will be protected under this new process. For example, APCo would be limited to a total of $125 million in overall cost recovery and cost recovery for Dominion Energy Virginia is unable to exceed a $1.40 individual increase of ratepayer monthly bills, subject to regulatory approval.

State Matching Funds to Leverage Federal Opportunities: Massachusetts Federal Funds and Infrastructure Office (FFIO)

When Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey took office, she made a commitment to take a systematic approach to pursuing and leveraging federal funds to maximize infrastructure investments in Massachusetts. This effort was executed through two actions. First, Governor Healey issued an Executive Order establishing a new state entity—the Federal Funds and Infrastructure Office (FFIO)—that would spearhead a whole-of-government approach to seeking federal opportunities. The FFIO is situated within the Executive Office for Administration and Finance and reports directly to the Governor. In the systematic pursuit of federal funds, the FFIO facilitates an interagency taskforce composed of state agency leads and other key stakeholders. In addition, the FFIO maintains a clearing house of federal funds, which tracks and consolidates information on upcoming grant opportunities for state, quasi-state, municipal and tribal entities within Massachusetts.

Secondly, in 2024, Governor Healey filed legislation that was subsequently signed into law that established a plan to allow the FFIO to utilize state funds and leverage federal infrastructure opportunities, including but not limited to those created in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPs) and Science Act. The FFIO will utilize interest from the Commonwealth Stabilization fund to create a matching pool of $750 million to pursue federal grant funding; allocate $12 million for technical assistance for local, tribal, and nongovernmental entities as they pursue federal funding or financing; and $50 million for state grant and loan programs. The Commonwealth Stabilization Fund, the state’s rainy day fund, has grown to approximately $9 billion, and the FFIO will not utilize any of the principal fund value. In years where the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund grows and interest is capitalized, those revenues are allocated for use by FFIO to support the outlined efforts in pursuit of federal funds as an alternative to state bonding.

This approach combines several best practices. Governor Healey directed the FFIO to serve as the lead agency for seeking federal opportunities, coordinating a whole-of-government strategy. In addition, the FFIO takes an innovative approach to capitalizing the fund for federal grant matching through interest from Massachusetts’ rainy-day fund. By providing the match funds for grant-seekers within the state, the FFIO reduces barriers for applicants across the state to seek federal funding. Technical assistance for local and tribal entities, including grant writing, elective pay and tax credit filing assistance, and program implementation support, will allow for capacity building across the commonwealth, municipalities, and nongovernmental sector. This grows the capacity for under-resourced potential applicants to seek federal funds and bring more investment to Massachusetts.

State Energy Financing Institutions (SEFIs) and Green Banks: Virginia’s Clean Energy Innovation Bank

State Green Banks and State Energy Financing Institutions (SEFIs) are entities that leverage public funds to facilitate or incentivize private capital investment in energy projects. In 2023, NGA published an overview of Green Banks for Governors, including actions Governors can take to establish a state green bank and common Green Bank financing offerings.

The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), passed in 2021, expanded the lending capacity of the U.S. Department of Energy Loan Programs Office (DOE LPO) to include $62 billion for Title 17 loans, which allow for low-cost debt financing for large energy projects (greater than $100 million) with financial support from a SEFI. SEFIs are defined by the U.S. Department of Energy as a state entity that can lend or invest in energy projects using state funds. According to DOE LPO, SEFIs can support energy projects by either providing grant funding or loan financing to an LPO applicant or by bundling smaller projects into a capital pool to apply directly to DOE LPO for financing. In both cases, the SEFI contribution is part of the capital stack, combining with LPO financing and private capital, for example. Many state entities have received SEFI designation. SEFIs can be state green banks but also can be other state entities with financing authority, such as economic development authorities, housing agencies, state energy offices or other state financing authorities.

The Virginia 2022 State Energy Plan establishes goals to grow the commonwealth’s economy and energy sector. Driven largely by the growth of data centers and industrial manufacturing sites across the commonwealth, the Virginia Energy Office projects that energy demand will increase by 100% by 2035. Leveraging federal opportunities like the DOE LPO financing and mobilizing public and private capital investment can grow the energy sector, create energy jobs, and meet the energy needs of growing technology and industrial sectors within the state. With this goal in mind, in 2024, Governor Youngkin launched the Virginia Clean Energy Innovation Bank (VCEIB) within the Virginia State Energy Office. VCEIB is a green bank that is seeking SEFI designation in order to leverage federal opportunities alongside private investment to address financing gaps and accelerate project delivery for clean power generation and energy infrastructure projects across Virginia.

Seeded with $10 million through the 2024 state budget, VCEIB will offer loans and credit enhancements and is exploring financing mechanisms like private co-investment, securitization and aggregation. The VCEIB will also manage implementation of several grant programs, including the U.S. DOE Grid Resilience Formula Grant (40101D), the U.S. DOE Grid Resilience Investment Program (GRIP) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Solar-for-all program.

Since its inception, VCEIB has announced several funding opportunities in innovative energy projects in Southwest Virginia. A funding announcement was released in December 2024 for grants to spur investment in blue and green hydrogen production and a feasibility study of carbon capture and storage[1]. In addition, in December 2024 Governor Youngkin announced a large-scale investment by the Commonwealth Fusion Systems, the largest private fusion company, to build the world’s first grid-scale commercial fusion power plant. The Virginia Department of Energy partnered with Virginia Economic Development Partnership, Chesterfield County, and Dominion Energy to secure this project, and the VCEIB will provide a $1 million grant for initial siting costs to advance this project, known as ARC, at the James River Industrial Center in Chesterfield County, Virginia, on a site owned by Dominion Energy. ARC intends to utilize fusion technology to generate 400 megawatts of electricity. These projects advance Virginia’s all-of-the-above energy strategy and take key steps to advance energy generation projects to meet growing electricity needs in the commonwealth.

Stacking Multiple Sources of Capital: Combining State Funding and Federal Incentives: Pennsylvania’s Solar for Schools Program

Pennsylvania’s plentiful natural resources have given the state a long history as an energy leader. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro released a State Energy Strategy which outlines the Governor’s all-of-the-above approach to energy. Through the State Energy Strategy, Governor Shapiro seeks to expand Pennsylvania’s energy workforce, reduce ratepayer costs and invest billions in energy projects across Pennsylvania.

In an effort to facilitate these objectives, in July 2024, Governor Shapiro signed into law the Solar for Schools grant program. The program designated $25 million in state grant funding to the Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED) for solar installation projects on school property.

Under this program, DCED may issue grants that fund up to50% of the costs for solar and storage installation. Schools can apply to the DCED program to reduce energy costs and increase resilience through the deployment of solar panels. These projects may also qualify for elective pay federal tax credits, reducing the cost burden of installation for school districts, community colleges, technical schools and other education entities. The Inflation Reduction Act enables tax exempt entities, like school districts, to claim tax credits on projects like rooftop solar installation through elective pay. Through the Solar for Schools Grant Program and the deployment of solar on schools across Pennsylvania, school districts and community and technical colleges can reduce energy cost burdens and hedge the increasing cost of energy.

Additionally, the Pennsylvania Energy Development Authority (PEDA), an independent public financing authority and Pennsylvania’s state “green bank,” applied for $100 million in financing from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office to establish a revolving loan program for solar projects on schools. Through this program, loans would be available to schools to fill their financing gaps and will include bridge financing for the value of the applicable tax credits available through the elective pay provision.

Strong Gubernatorial Leadership of State Funding and Financing Institutions: North Dakota Industrial Commission

The North Dakota Industrial Commission was established in 1911 to facilitate certain utility, industry and business projects established by the state. Since its inception, the Commission has grown to administer or operate numerous programs and authorities, including the Bank of North Dakota, Clean Sustainable Energy Authority, Oil and Gas Research Program, Lignite Research, Development and Marketing Program, Transmission Authority, and more. The Board of the Commission is composed of the Governor, Attorney General and Agriculture Commissioner of North Dakota, with the Governor serving as the Chairman. The portfolio of programs and authorities within the Industrial Commission has grown and evolved over the century that it has operated within North Dakota, but the Commission has always operated solely on funding from the 10% oil, gas, and coal extraction and production tax as established by the state legislature. This allows the energy industry within North Dakota to reinvest in itself, creating a sustainable and innovative energy sector and cementing North Dakota’s role as an energy leader.

Throughout more than a century of operation within North Dakota, the strong role of the Governor as Chairman of the Commission has allowed for many Governors of North Dakota to leverage the various programs and authorities of the Commission to advance their energy policy goals. Through appointments to leadership or boards of funding and financing institutions, Governors can encourage innovation in mechanisms and facilitate energy project delivery. For each grant or financing program, the Governor appoints Advisory Boards that review applications for funding or financing and makes recommendations to the Industrial Commission Board. Then, the Board makes final determinations as to which projects are funded or financed. The direct role of the Governor as Chairman of the Industrial Commission furthers the ability of the Governor to advance innovation in funding and financing and accomplish the Governor’s energy policy goals and priorities.

In 2021, former Governor Doug Burgum, then the Chairman of the North Dakota Industrial Commission, signed legislation that created the Clean Sustainable Energy Authority (CSEA) within the Commission. The CSEA was capitalized with $25 million to provide grants and loans to projects focused on low-emission technologies and affordable sustainable energy solutions, including clean manufacturing, carbon capture, mineral extraction, and developing alternatives to plastics, among other uses. This legislation also authorized a $250 million line of credit to the Bank of North Dakota, a state entity also within the Industrial Commission, for loans and financing for riskier projects within the state’s interest. In 2024, a new loan opportunity through the Clean Sustainable Energy Fund Fertilizer Development Loan Program was created through legislation. NextEra Resources Development was authorized $50 million in forgivable loan financing for the production of hydrogen through water electrolysis.

In 2023, the Industrial Commission approved $15 million in matching grants and $222.5 million in loan financing for energy projects through the Commission’s CSEA and Oil and Gas Research Program. Projects included grant funding for a carbon dioxide storage hub and advanced oil recovery as well as loan financing for a carbon capture system and oilfield water recycling facility. Both the CSEA and Oil and Gas Research Program are funded by state oil and gas production tax and state mineral royalty revenues.

North Dakota Governor Kelly Armstrong, the current Chairman of the Industrial Commission, recently penned an op-ed along with his fellow board members advocating for the expansion of electric transmission infrastructure to meet the state’s economic growth in energy, data processing and other sectors. The Industrial Commission is the state Transmission Authority.

The analysis, based on 680 inspections across more than 70 BESS manufacturing facilities representing over 65 GWh of lithium-ion storage projects, reveals growing challenges in the integration phase as the industry scales rapidly. CEA reports this is 64% of Tier 1 BESS cell manufacturers worldwide.

Fire suppression systems emerged as the most problematic area, with defects identified in 28% of inspected units. These issues ranged from non-responsive smoke and temperature sensors to malfunctioning fire alarm abort buttons and release actuators that failed to deploy extinguishing agents when commanded.

Auxiliary circuit panels displayed faults in 19% of inspected systems. The report attributes many system-level problems to the highly manual and labor-intensive nature of BESS integration processes, often carried out by third parties with limited long-term performance incentives.

Thermal management systems showed defects in 15% of units, primarily involving coolant circulation failures from deformed flange plates, loose pipe connections, and defective valves. These issues can lead to coolant leakage, potentially triggering internal short circuits and thermal runaway events.

Overall quantities of defects were not shared by CEA, only percentages of failures.

CEA also highlighted that 6% of systems failed capacity tests via performance failures, directly impacting energy delivery and project performance.

At the component level, cell manufacturing accounted for 15% of total findings despite higher automation levels, while module manufacturing represented 13% of findings. Balance of system components accounted for 64% of system-level findings, with enclosure-related issues representing 30%.

The analysis covered facilities in the United States, China, India, Vietnam, and South Korea Clean Energy Associates noted that none of the audited systems were shipped with unresolved safety-critical issues, following their protocol requiring manufacturers to address critical and major defects before shipment.

For comparison, the United States is responsible for about 5.2 gigatons of greenhouse gas pollution each year.
This turned out to be an accidentally well-timed intervention in the U.S. energy supply.
The IRA’s energy tax credits have helped make this situation slightly less harrowing by providing more incentives to boost electricity supply.
Republicans are now trying to remove these tax bonuses in order to finance tax cuts for high-earning households.","When President Barack Obama signed the Budget Control Act in August of 2011, he did not do so happily. The bill averted the debt ceiling crisis that had threatened to derail his presidency, but it did so at a high cost: It forced Congress either to agree to big near-term deficit cuts, or to accept strict spending limits over the years to come.

It was, as Bloomberg commentator Conor Sen put it this week, the wrong bill for the wrong moment. It suppressed federal spending as America climbed out of the Great Recession, making the early 2010s economic recovery longer than it would have been otherwise. When Trump came into office, he ended the automatic spending limits — and helped to usher in the best labor market that America has seen since the 1990s.

On Thursday, the Republican majority in the House of Representatives passed their megabill — which is dubbed, for now, the “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” — through the reconciliation process. They did so happily. But much like Obama’s sequestration, this bill is the wrong one for the wrong moment. It would add $3.3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next 10 years. The bill’s next stop is the Senate, where it could change significantly. But if this bill is enacted, it will jack up America’s energy and environmental risks — for relatively little benefit.

It has become somewhat passé for advocates to talk about climate change, as The New York Times observed this week. “We’re no longer talking about the environment,” Chad Farrell, the founder of Encore Renewable Energy, told the paper. “We’re talking dollars and cents.”

Maybe that’s because saying that something “is bad for the climate” only makes it a more appealing target for national Republicans at the moment, who are still reveling in the frisson of their post-Trump victory. But one day the environment will matter again to Americans — and this bill would, in fact, hurt the environment. It will mark a new chapter in American politics: Once, this country had a comprehensive climate law on the books. Then Trump and Republicans junked it.

The Republican megabill will make climate change worse. Within a year or two, the U.S. will be pumping out half a gigaton more carbon pollution per year than it would in a world where the IRA remains on the books, according to energy modelers at Princeton University. Within a decade, it will raise American carbon pollution by a gigaton each year. That is a significant increase. For comparison, the United States is responsible for about 5.2 gigatons of greenhouse gas pollution each year. No matter what happens, American emissions are likely to fall somewhat between now and 2035 — but, still, we are talking about adding at least an extra year’s worth of emissions over the next decade. (Full disclosure: I co-host a podcast, Shift Key, with Jesse Jenkins, the lead author of that Princeton study.)

What does America get for this increase in air pollution? After all, it’s possible to imagine situations where such a surge could bring economic benefits. In this case, though, we don’t get very much at all. Repealing the tax credits will slash $1 trillion from GDP over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan group Energy Innovation. Texas will be particularly hard hit — it could lose up to $100 billion in energy investment. Across the country, household energy costs will rise 2% to 7% by 2035, on top of any normal market-driven volatility, according to the energy research firm the Rhodium Group. The country will become more reliant on foreign oil imports, yet domestic oil production will budge up by less than 1%.

In other words, in exchange for more pollution, Americans will get less economic growth but higher energy costs. The country’s capital stock will be smaller than it would be otherwise, and Americans will work longer hours, according to the Tax Foundation.

But this numbers-driven approach actually understates the risk of repealing the IRA’s tax credits. The House megabill raises two big risks to the economy, as I see it — risks that are moresignificant than the result of any one energy or economic model.

The first is that this bill — its policy changes and its fiscal impact — will represent a double hit to the capacity of America’s energy system. The Inflation Reduction Act’s energy tax credits were designed to lower pollution and reduce energy costs by bringing more zero-carbon electricity supply onto the U.S. power grid. The law didn’t discriminate about what kind of energy it encouraged — it could be solar, geothermal, or nuclear — as long as it met certain emissions thresholds.

This turned out to be an accidentally well-timed intervention in the U.S. energy supply. The advent of artificial intelligence and a spurt of factory building has meant that, in the past few years, U.S. electricity demand has begun to rise for the first time since the 1990s. At the same time, the country’s ability to build new natural gas plants has come under increasing strain. The IRA’s energy tax credits have helped make this situation slightly less harrowing by providing more incentives to boost electricity supply.

Republicans are now trying to remove these tax bonuses in order to finance tax cuts for high-earning households. But removing the IRA alone won’t pay for the tax credits, so they will also have to borrow trillions of dollars. This is already straining bond markets, driving up interest rates for Americans. Indeed, a U.S. Treasury auction earlier this week saw weak demand for $16 billion in bonds, driving stocks and the dollar down while spiking treasury yields.

Higher interest rates will make it more expensive to build any kind of new power plant. At a moment of maximum stress on the grid, the U.S. is going to pull away tax bonuses for new electricity supply and make it more expensive to do any kind of investment in the power system. This will hit wind, solar, and batteries hard; because renewables don’t have to pay for fuel, their cost variability is largely driven by financing. But higher interest rates will also make it harder to build new natural gas plants. Trump’s trade barriers and tariff chaos will further drive up the cost of new energy investment.

Republicans aren’t totally oblivious to this hazard. The House Natural Resource Committee’s permitting reform proposal could reduce some costs of new energy development and encourage greater power capacity — assuming, that is, that the proposal survives the Senate’s byzantine reconciliation rules. But even then, significant risk exists for runaway energy cost chaos. Over the next three years, America’s liquified natural gas export capacity is set to more than double. Trump officials have assumed that America will simply be able to drill for more natural gas to offset a rise in exports, but what if higher interest rates and tariff charges forbid a rise in capacity? A power price shock is not off the table.

So that’s risk No. 1. The second risk is arguably of greater strategic import. As part of their megabill, House Republicans have stripped virtually every demand-side subsidy for electric vehicles from the bill, including a $7,500 tax credit for personal EV purchases. At the same time, Senate Republicans and the Trump administration have gutted state and federal rules meant to encourage electric vehicle sales.

Republicans have kept, for now, some of the supply-side subsidies for manufacturing EVs and batteries. But without the paired demand-side incentives, American EV sales will fall. (The Princeton energy team projects an up to 40% decline in EV sales nationwide.) This will reduce the economic rationale for much of the current buildout in electric vehicle manufacturing and capacity happening across the country — it could potentially put every new EV and battery factory meant to come online after this year out of the money.

This will weaken the country’s economic competitiveness. Batteries are a strategic energy technology, and they will undergird many of the most important general and military technologies of the next several decades. (If you can make an EV, you can make an autonomous drone.) The Trump administration has realized that the United States and its allies need a durable mineral supply chain that can at least parallel China’s. But they seem unwilling to help any of the industries that will actually usethose minerals.

Does this mean that Republicans will kill America’s electric vehicle industry? Not necessarily. But they will dent its growth, strength, and expansion. They will make it weaker and more vulnerable to external interference. And they will increase the risks that the United States simply gives up on ever understanding battery technology and doubles down on internal combustion vehicles — a technology that, like coal-powered naval ships, is destined to lose.

It is, in other words, risky. But that is par for the course for this bill. It is risky to make the power grid so exposed to natural gas price volatility. It is risky to jack up the federal deficit during peacetime for so little gain. It is risky to cede so much demand for U.S.-sourced critical minerals. It is risky to raise interest rates in an era of higher trade barriers, uncertain supply shocks, and geopolitical instability.

This is what worries me most about the Republican megabill: It takes America’s flawed but fixable energy policy and replaces it with, well, a longshot parlay bet that nothing particularly bad will happen anytime soon. Will the Senate take such a bet? Now we find out.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDMwNDQ2My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NjQ4MTY4NH0.LQNe4OGK977cJuzscbMgo8gc61Eb9_QNwTIrNfcHLGk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-05-23 16:08:00.991869

A federal judge in San Francisco has indefinitely paused President Trump's sweeping overhaul of the federal government.

U.S. District Judge Susan Illston issued the preliminary injunction late Thursday, nearly two weeks after temporarily halting Trump's Feb. 11 executive order directing agencies to shut down offices and lay off thousands of people.

A coalition of labor unions, nonprofits and local governments had sued to block that executive order and the subsequent memo issued by the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management instructing agencies on how to carry out Trump's order. The plaintiffs argued that Trump lacks the authority to carry out such a radical transformation of government without approval from Congress.

Illston agreed, writing that ""agencies may not conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force in blatant disregard of Congress's mandates, and a President may not initiate large-scale executive branch reorganization without partnering with Congress.""

She noted that over the last century, nine presidents have sought and obtained authority from Congress to reorganize the executive branch. She pointed out that others, including Trump in his first term, sought approval but were not granted it.

The lawsuit named Trump, Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency, the heads of 21 federal agencies and those agencies themselves as defendants.

Illston's order stops those agencies from issuing new reorganization plans and new layoff notices. It also prevents agencies from formally separating those who have already received such notices and are currently on administrative leave.

She wrote that in some cases, the evidence showed that agencies were making changes that ""intentionally or negligently"" flout the duties given to them by Congress, which funds them.

She cited as examples reports that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, AmeriCorps and the National Science Foundation are planning to cut 50% or more of their employees, while the IRS and the Small Business Administration may cut 40%.

""After dramatic staff reductions, these agencies will not be able to do what Congress has directed them to do,"" she wrote.

Illston stopped short of requiring agencies to bring people already laid off or placed on administrative leave back to work while the litigation continues.

On Friday, the Trump administration appealed this latest decision to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The administration has also already asked the Supreme Court to stay Illston's earlier ruling. The government's position is that Trump's executive order and the OMB and OPM memo serve only to ""facilitate"" reductions in force (RIFs), or mass layoffs, within agency workforces and did not order them.

""Agencies have express statutory authority to conduct RIFs, and the President may tell agencies to use their own statutory authorities to accomplish policy goals,"" government attorneys wrote.

“We applaud BPA for its decision to approve this project and for its strategic vision in advancing our region’s future with additional reliable capacity that nuclear energy can provide,” said Bob Schuetz, Energy Northwest CEO. “Their leadership in supporting this initiative underscores a commitment to affordable electricity for the Northwest region, including our public power member utilities and their customers.”

Following 18 months of analysis, BPA’s approval allows the project to move into its next phase. Over the next six years, Energy Northwest and BPA will collaborate on planning and implementation. The project is expected to be completed in 2031.

“This is a great value for ratepayers in the Pacific Northwest,” said John Hairston, BPA administrator and CEO. “Upgrading an existing resource to provide additional reliable energy will help BPA keep pace with its customers’ growing electricity needs and keep rates low.”

Columbia Generating Station, a 1,207-MW nuclear energy facility near Richland, Washington, is owned and operated by Energy Northwest. The EPU will increase electrical output by upgrading and replacing equipment — including turbines, heat exchangers and the generator. The project will involve approximately 30 individual upgrades, primarily focused on increasing the size of pumps and motors.

Alongside the EPU, energy efficiency upgrades incorporated during the next three refueling outages in 2027, 2029 and 2031 are expected to add 24 MW of output capacity, bringing the total increase to 186 MW.

“In rural and urban areas alike, more charging access means cleaner air, economic growth and real savings for families.
States could reimburse contractors for money already spent, but no new funding could be obligated.
Some agencies delay their funding distribution while trying to comply with legal requirements for a program, the GAO wrote.
“The NEVI program offers a real chance to change that—with public investment in EV charging that finally includes rural Black and brown neighborhoods.","Sixteen states, the District of Columbia and more than a half dozen environmental groups have alleged in a lawsuit that the Trump administration has indefinitely and unlawfully frozen funds for a nationwide electric vehicle program.

The complaint was filed on Thursday in U.S. District Court in Seattle. Plaintiffs’ attorneys are asking the judge to require the Trump administration to unfreeze the funds and distribute them to the states according to a formula established by Congress.

During the Biden administration, Congress appropriated $5 billion for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, also known as NEVI, as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021. The money would have been disbursed each year to all 50 states, plus Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, to build a nationwide network of electric vehicle charging stations along designated Alternative Fuel Corridors.

“Transportation is the leading source of climate pollution in the U.S., and halting the NEVI program directly threatens our progress toward clean, reliable transportation options—especially in the Southeast, where EV infrastructure is still catching up,” said Megan Kimball, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. “In rural and urban areas alike, more charging access means cleaner air, economic growth and real savings for families. We’re defending that future.”

The legal challenge coincided with a Government Accountability Office report published Thursday that found the U.S. Department of Transportation is unauthorized to withhold the congressionally appropriated funds. The Transportation Department could petition Congress to pass a law to rescind the funds or change the NEVI program, the GAO wrote, but it can’t act unilaterally.

A department spokesperson said in a prepared statement that the GAO report “shows a complete misunderstanding of the law” and “conflicts with Congress’ intent.”

Less than three weeks after Trump was elected to a second term, the Transportation Department ordered states to stop distributing their funds for fiscal years 2022-2025, worth about $2.7 billion. States could reimburse contractors for money already spent, but no new funding could be obligated.

DOT justified the funding freeze by saying the Federal Highway Administration was “updating the NEVI Formula Program Guidance to align with current policy and priorities.”

The GAO report concluded that the Transportation Department erroneously froze funding when it determined that funding was available only for signed project agreements. Instead, the GAO wrote, the effective date for funding was much earlier: when the law made money for the program available for obligation.

Some agencies delay their funding distribution while trying to comply with legal requirements for a program, the GAO wrote. In the NEVI case, however, DOT imposed requirements that exceed what the law prescribes. For example, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act requires states to submit plans to DOT, but does not provide authority for the secretary of transportation to approve or disapprove such plans.

A DOT spokesperson said the GAO was “cherry-picking language in the program statute.”

The agency is updating NEVI program guidance, according to the spokesperson, “because the implementation of NEVI has failed miserably, and DOT will continue to work in good faith to update the program so it can be utilized more efficiently and effectively.”

Attorneys for the environmental groups—including CleanAIRE NC, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, West End Revitalization Project, Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council—wrote that in blocking the distribution of funds the Trump administration directly defied congressional directives.

The funding freeze nullified more than 150 state implementation plans, according to court documents, which harmed local communities. NEVI requires EV charging stations in the first phase to be installed every 50 miles along the federally approved Alternative Fuel Corridors, and that they be within one mile of those routes.

“By reducing access to reliable public charging,” the plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote, “DOT and the FHWA are restricting electric vehicle owners’ ability to travel and use their EVs, increase their fuel costs, delay EV purchases, worsen health impacts from vehicle pollution and deprive communities of promised public investment.”

In the Charlotte, North Carolina, metro area, for example, air quality—such as levels of ozone and particulate matter—has worsened, according to the 2025 American Lung Association State of the Air Report. The largest city in North Carolina, Charlotte is ringed and bisected by several highways clogged with cars.

“Tailpipe pollution is a public health crisis—fueling asthma, heart disease, and respiratory illness in communities already overburdened by environmental harm,” Jeff Robbins, executive director of CleanAIRE NC, said in a prepared statement. “NEVI is a vital step toward reducing that harm through zero-emission transportation. Freezing the program blocks progress and keeps our most vulnerable residents breathing dirty air. Clean air and climate justice cannot be put on hold.”

Interstate 85 and U.S. Highway. 70 run through many underserved communities in Alamance County, N.C., about 30 miles west of Durham.

“For decades, communities like ours in Alamance County have been denied access to basic infrastructure,” said Omega Wilson, co-director of the West End Revitalization Association. “The NEVI program offers a real chance to change that—with public investment in EV charging that finally includes rural Black and brown neighborhoods. Suspending the program delays critical investments, widens infrastructure disparities and sends the message that once again, the taxpayers who’ve been left behind the longest will be the last to benefit.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2187761741-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 15:10:11.492229

The Senate and House voted to nullify a waiver that allowed California to set stricter auto emissions standards than federal regulations.

This decision is seen as a victory for Republicans, energy firms, and carmakers, while Democrats and environmental groups view it as a setback for pollution and climate change efforts.

President Donald Trump is expected to sign the measure, potentially leading to a legal battle.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta said: “This federal government overreach is illogical, politically motivated and it comes at the expense of Californian’s lives and livelihoods.”

Trump’s opposition to California’s plan, due to its potential influence over the US car industry, has been clear.

Other states, including New York and Massachusetts, planned to adopt similar rules, representing over a third of the US car market.

Electric vehicles, including hybrids, accounted for about 10% of new US car sales, compared to 30% in the UK last year.

Critics argued that California’s standards, requiring 35% of new car sales to be electric by 2026, were unrealistic.

Carmakers expressed concerns over a credit scheme that could force them to buy credits from Tesla, hindering investment in their own electric car production.

“The concerns were about the mandate – not the technology,” said carmaker lobby group president John Bozzella of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation.

California has long received EPA waivers to set stricter standards due to air quality issues.

Trump’s first term saw attempts to strip these powers, leading to a legal battle that ended with President Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory. Congress has typically avoided involvement in this issue.

The Government Accountability Office and Senate parliamentarian indicated Congress did not follow proper procedures to repeal the rule. Senate Democrats accused Republicans of using a “nuclear option” to block the waiver, suggesting similar tactics could be used against other agency rules.

Legislation jeopardizes PA’s leadership in energy innovation

The U.S. House budget bill, which passed Thursday morning, will eliminate clean energy tax credits and stifle job creation and new energy production in Pennsylvania, said Energy Future PA Co-Chairs Conor Lamb and Kate Harper.

Lamb, a former Democratic U.S Congressman from Allegheny County, and Harper, former Republican State Representative from Montgomery County, said the bill will repeal critical energy tax credits passed under the Inflation Reduction act of 2022. Lamb and Harper responded to the bill by issuing the following statement:

“If we are serious about an America-first energy strategy, then we need serious investments in our energy future from both the private and the public sectors. This legislation signals a retreat from that America-first strategy, pulling back critical public sector energy investments at a time when our nation is facing an unprecedented rise in electricity demand. The real casualties of this legislation will be the Pennsylvania workers, businesses, and consumers who are ready to lead and benefit from a more reliable, more affordable, and cleaner energy system.

“Here in Pennsylvania, the impact of this legislation cannot be overstated. Billions of dollars in private sector investment in Pennsylvania’s two regional hydrogen hub projects are now at risk, along with the tens of thousands of good paying jobs the hubs are estimated to create, as a result of the repeal of the hydrogen tax credit. Efforts to reinvigorate nuclear power in the state – including restarting the former Three Mile Island Unit 2 – could be snuffed out, because of the proposed repeal of the nuclear production tax credit and the elimination of the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office.

Here are some questions we’re asking and addressing with our research chops this week:

The budget reconciliation package that currently is being advanced by congressional Republicans now includes a plan to repeal consumer tax credits for electric vehicle (EV) purchases at the end of 2025. These credits offer consumers a tax credit worth up to $7,500 on a purchase of a qualifying vehicle. Changes to the budget reconciliation package may get incorporated as the bill moves through Congress, but the EV subsidies seem to have long odds. With federal support waning, states may expand their own incentives for EV adoption. Resources for the Future (RFF) researchers Beia Spiller, Joshua Linn, and Nafisa Lohawala explore how states can advance EV adoption in an article from the latest issue of Resources magazine. “To meet ambitious goals that address climate change and EVs in the absence of federal support, state governments will have to revisit both the scope of their policies and the magnitude of their investments for transitioning to EVs,” say the researchers. Check out the online edition of Resources for more articles on the transportation sector and its evolving policy landscape.

The US Environmental Protection Agency has announced plans to weaken national limits on perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water. Exposure to these “forever chemicals” (known as such because the chemical bonds do not break down easily, so the substances remain in the environment for long periods) is linked to serious health risks. While limits on some PFAS will remain, the agency plans to extend deadlines for utilities to meet these limits, citing compliance challenges. The move is part of a broader federal rollback of environmental regulations. RFF Senior Fellow Alan Krupnick outlines how the effects of such regulatory repeals can be evaluated to more accurately weigh their costs and benefits in a new installment of the If/Then policy analysis series. “Amending or repealing regulations that do not provide a net benefit to the American people is a laudable goal,” Krupnick says, “but informing the decisionmaking process will require careful analysis that uses transparent methodology.” These methods differ somewhat from other methods that evaluate the costs and benefits of a new rule, Krupnick adds.

Earlier this spring, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on imported vehicles and most vehicle parts. The tariffs are game-changing for US auto manufacturers, which compete with foreign companies and use imported parts in their own assembly lines. What could the tariffs mean for these companies and US consumers? In this In Focus video, University of Maryland Professor and RFF Senior Fellow Joshua Linn discusses new RFF modeling that projects the effects of auto tariffs on consumer costs, vehicle demand, electric vehicles, and more.

Environmental Policy Changes in the Congressional Budget Reconciliation Package

With fits and starts, the Republicans’ budget reconciliation bill—a mechanism which enables certain legislation to evade the Senate filibuster—has passed the House of Representatives, but policy issues remain unresolved as the bill now moves to be considered by the upper chamber. Among those issues is the fate of the array of clean energy and investment tax credits introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022.

“An underrated aspect of the IRA is the degree to which it has spread the wealth, so to speak, of clean energy investments,” says Liam Burke, RFF’s government affairs manager. “Red states have benefited enormously from IRA tax credits, which has created a real constituency that is starting to make noise about preserving the credits to at least some degree. This House-passed bill rapidly phases out most of the IRA incentives. The primary tension as this bill moves forward will be between the representatives and senators who want to cut spending at all costs and those who want to keep the clean energy tax credit superstructure intact in the IRA.”

Talking About the Affordability of Electricity in the United States

Despite the falling costs of solar energy and a plentiful supply of natural gas in the United States, maintenance of infrastructure on the electric grid and increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather events have pushed up electricity prices for consumers. Tariffs, trade wars, and the potential repeal of clean energy tax credits could further increase prices. Join RFF and Canary Media on Tuesday, June 3, for a discussion of solutions that could help bring down the price of electricity, including a build-out of inexpensive clean energy and modernizing how utilities charge customers. Request a spot at the event.

The Cost of Delaying Upgrades to the Electric Grid and Additions of New Electricity Generation

As electricity demand increases, the United States is in a race to add more power lines and electricity generation to the country’s aging electric grid. However, these upgrades are taking much longer than they used to. In a pair of new reports, RFF researchers estimate that preventing delays to these upgrades could save consumers tens of billions of dollars per year, increase the reliability of the electric grid, and prevent premature deaths by reducing air pollution. The benefits of preventing these delays would be especially large for low-income, Black, and Hispanic households. “Despite widespread political support, numerous obstacles are stalling urgently needed upgrades to the US electric grid,” says RFF Senior Research Associate McKenna Peplinski, a coauthor of both reports, in the press release for the reports. “Slow permitting processes, unstable investment conditions, local pushback, and other factors have contributed to long development timelines that complicate the challenge of meeting demand growth.”

Examining Oklahoma’s Approach to Economic Resilience

The state economy of Oklahoma is heavily dependent on the oil and gas industry. Yet, as the global energy system shifts away from oil and gas, Oklahoma has made few efforts to diversify its economy and build economic resilience. In a new report, RFF researchers and coauthors at partner institutions examine the strategies employed by the state of Oklahoma and its capital, Oklahoma City, to build economic resilience, along with the views of local stakeholders on these strategies, obstacles to economic development, and potential improvements to existing policies. The report is part of the Resilient Energy Economies initiative and the third in a series about the opportunities and challenges in US oil- and gas-producing communities.

Projecting the Effects of the Foreign Pollution Fee Act of 2025

Carbon border adjustments are tariffs that charge importers based on the carbon dioxide emissions that are associated with the imported goods. This kind of tariff has emerged as a key policy in discussions about international trade and emissions reductions, and some governments already have put a version of the policy in place. In the United States, Senators Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) recently introduced the Foreign Pollution Fee Act of 2025, which would impose tariffs on an array of goods based on the emissions associated with the production of those goods in the country from which they were imported, relative to the emissions associated with production of the same goods in the United States. In a new issue brief, RFF researchers assess the potential effects of the bill on US manufacturing, global emissions, and more. “US emissions increase due to greater domestic manufacturing,” say the authors. “The net effect is that global emissions are relatively unchanged by the policy.”",https://media.rff.org/images/shutterstock_1454798387.width-600.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 13:14:43.537798

Among other things, the sweeping bill would eliminate clean vehicle credits by the end of 2025 in most cases.

If you’ve been pondering the purchase of a new or used electric vehicle (EV), you’ll want to buy sooner rather than later to take advantage of available tax credits. Here’s what you need to know.

The current credit

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) significantly expanded the Section 30D credit for qualifying clean vehicles placed in service after April 17, 2023. For eligible taxpayers, it extended the credit to any “clean vehicle,” including EVs, hydrogen fuel cell cars and plug-in hybrids, through 2032. It also created a new credit, Sec. 25E, for eligible taxpayers who buy used clean vehicles from dealers. That credit equals the lesser of $4,000 or 30% of the sale price.

The maximum credit for new vehicles is $7,500, based on meeting certain sourcing requirements for 1) critical minerals and 2) battery components. Clean vehicles that satisfy only one of the two requirements qualify for a $3,750 credit.

The Sec. 30D and Sec. 25E credits aren’t refundable, meaning you can’t receive a refund if you don’t have any tax liability. In addition, any excess credit can’t be carried forward if it’s claimed as an individual credit. A credit can be carried forward only if it’s claimed as a general business credit.

If you’re eligible for either credit (see below), you have two options for applying it. First, you can transfer the credit to the dealer to reduce the amount you pay for the vehicle (assuming you’re purchasing the vehicle for personal use). You’re limited to making two transfer elections in a tax year. Alternatively, you can claim the credit when you file your tax return for the year you take possession of the vehicle.

Buyer requirements

To qualify for the Sec. 30D credit, you must purchase the vehicle for your own use (not resale) and use it primarily in the United States. The credit is also subject to an income limitation. Your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) can’t exceed:

$300,000 for married couples filing jointly or a surviving spouse,

$225,000 for heads of household, or

$150,000 for all other filers.

If your MAGI was less in the preceding tax year than in the year you take delivery of the vehicle, you can apply that amount for purposes of the income limit.

Note: As initially drafted, the GOP proposal would retain the Sec. 30D credit through 2026 for vehicles from manufacturers that have sold fewer than 200,000 clean vehicles.

For used vehicles, you similarly must buy the vehicle for your own use, primarily in the United States. You also must not:

Be the vehicle’s original owner,

Be claimed as a dependent on another person’s tax return, and

Have claimed another used clean vehicle credit in the preceding three years.

A MAGI limit applies for the Sec. 25E credit, but with different amounts than those for the Sec. 30D credit:

$150,000 for married couples filing jointly or a surviving spouse,

$112,500 for heads of household, or

$75,000 for all other filers.

You can choose to apply your MAGI from the previous tax year if it’s lower.

Vehicle requirements

You can take advantage of the Sec. 30D credit only if the vehicle you purchase:

Has a battery capacity of at least seven kilowatt hours,

Has a gross vehicle weight rating of less than 14,000 pounds,

Was made by a qualified manufacturer,

Underwent final assembly in North America, and

Meets critical mineral and battery component requirements.

In addition, the manufacturer suggested retail price (MSRP) can’t exceed $80,000 for vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, or $55,000 for other vehicles. The MSRP for this purpose isn’t necessarily the price you paid. It includes manufacturer-installed options, accessories and trim but excludes destination fees.

To qualify for the used car credit, the vehicle must:

Have a sale price of $25,000 or less, including all dealer-imposed costs or fees not required by law (legally required costs and fees, such as taxes, title or registration fees, don’t count toward the sale price),

Be a model year at least two years before the year of purchase,

Not have already been transferred after August 16, 2022, to a qualified buyer,

Have a gross vehicle weight rating of less than 14,000 pounds, and

Have a battery capacity of at least seven kilowatt hours.

The sale price for a used vehicle is determined after the application of any incentives — but before the application of any trade-in value.

Don’t forget the paperwork

Form 8936, “Clean Vehicle Credits,” must be filed with your tax return for the year you take delivery. The form is required regardless of whether you transferred the credit or chose to claim it on your tax return.

When asked about this overlap, the administration continued to downplay any connection between the president and Project 2025.
“No one cared about Project 2025 when they elected President Trump in November 2024, and they don’t care now,” White House spokesman Taylor Rogers said in an email.
He also expressed concern about Trump’s Jan. 20 proposal to revise or rescind National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations that require federal agencies to consider the environmental impacts of their actions — a step recommended on page 60 of Project 2025.
Additionally, many goals outlined in Project 2025 are indirect or implied and therefore not included in the tracker, according to Adrienne Cobb, one of its creators.","Throughout his 2024 campaign for president, Donald Trump strongly and repeatedly denied any connection to Project 2025, the political platform document authored by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C.

“I have nothing to do with Project 2025,” Trump said during a debate with former Vice President Kamala Harris last September. He said he had not read the document, nor did he intend to.

Yet less than six months into his second stay in the White House, the president and his administration have initiated or completed 42% of Project 2025’s agenda, according to a tracking project that identified more than 300 specific action items in the 922-page document. The Project 2025 Tracker is run by two volunteers who “believe in the importance of transparent, detailed analysis,” according to its website.

Of all the action items, nearly a quarter are related to the environment through agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Forest Service, and the departments of the Interior, Commerce, and Energy. Further, it seems the environment is a high priority for the Trump administration, which has initiated or completed about 70% of Project 2025’s environmental agenda — or roughly two-thirds — according to a Times analysis of the tracked items.

That includes Project 2025 action items like rolling back air and water quality regulations; canceling funds for clean energy projects and environmental justice grants; laying off scientists and researchers in related fields; and withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord, an agreement among nearly 200 countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions driving global warming.

When asked about this overlap, the administration continued to downplay any connection between the president and Project 2025.

“No one cared about Project 2025 when they elected President Trump in November 2024, and they don’t care now,” White House spokesman Taylor Rogers said in an email. “President Trump is implementing the America First agenda he campaigned on to free up wasteful DEI spending for cutting-edge scientific research, roll back radical climate regulations, and restore America’s energy dominance while ensuring Americans have clean air and clean water.”

Project 2025 refers to climate change as an “alarm industry” used to support a radical left ideology and agenda.

“Mischaracterizing the state of our environment generally and the actual harms reasonably attributable to climate change specifically is a favored tool that the Left uses to scare the American public into accepting their ineffective, liberty-crushing regulations, diminished private property rights, and exorbitant costs,” it says in a chapter about the EPA.

The author of that chapter, Mandy Gunasekara, served as the EPA’s chief of staff during Trump’s first administration. In the document, she recommends that the president undertake a number of actions to reform the EPA, including downsizing the agency, eliminating its Office of Environmental Justice and Civil Rights, and instituting a pause and review of grants — all of which Trump has done.

That same chapter also recommends that the president undermine California’s ability to set strict vehicle emission standards, which Trump vowed to do shortly after taking office; the Senate this week voted to revoke California’s rights to enact policy on the issue.

Gunasekara did not respond to a request for comment.

Matthew Sanders, acting deputy director of the Environmental Law Clinic at Stanford, said these and other Project 2025-mandated moves could have far-reaching ramifications. He noted that 11 other states had chosen to follow California’s emission rules.

“What California does impacts what the rest of the nation does,” Sanders said. “In that sense ... decisions about how to effectuate the Clean Air Act mandates are technology-forcing for much of the nation, and isolating California and eliminating its ability to do that will have profound consequences.”

The EPA isn’t the only agency affected by environmental policy changes mirrored in Project 2025.

The Trump administration has also directed the Department of Energy to expand oil and gas leasing in Alaska, eliminate considerations for upstream and downstream greenhouse gas emissions, and expedite the approval of liquefied natural gas projects, all of which were recommendations outlined in the document.

The Interior Department, which oversees U.S. national parks and public lands, has seen rollbacks of at least a dozen of President Biden’s executive orders that prioritized addressing climate change, as well as the termination of a Biden-era policy to protect 30% of U.S. land and water by 2030, also known as the 30x30 plan.

In April, Trump issued an executive order opening up 112.5 million acres of national forestland to industrial logging, as outlined on page 308 of Project 2025. The president said the move — which will touch all 18 of California’s national forests — is intended to increase domestic timber supplies, reduce wildfire risk and create jobs.

Sanders said actions on public lands are particularly consequential, not only for the extraction of resources but also for protected species and their habitats. The president has already taken Project 2025-mandated steps to lessen protections for marine life and birds, and has called for narrowing protections afforded by the Endangered Species Act.

He also expressed concern about Trump’s Jan. 20 proposal to revise or rescind National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations that require federal agencies to consider the environmental impacts of their actions — a step recommended on page 60 of Project 2025.

While the president described NEPA and other rules as “burdensome and ideologically motivated regulations” that limit American jobs and stymie economic growth, Sanders said such framing is an oversimplification that can make the environment a scapegoat for other administrative goals.

“When we make these decisions in a thoughtful, careful, deliberate way, we actually can have jobs and economic development and environmental protection,” he said. “ I don’t think that those things are inherently opposed, but the administration, I think, gets some mileage out of suggesting that they are.”

Indeed, the Commerce Department, which houses the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Weather Service and other climate-related entities, has also seen changes that follow Project 2025’s playbook. The document describes the agency as “one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry and, as such, is harmful to future U.S. prosperity.”

In recent months, the president has made moves to “break up” NOAA — a directive also found on page 674 of the Project 2025 document — including laying off hundreds of staffers, closing several offices and proposing significant cuts to its research arm.

The administration has similarly taken Project 2025-recommended steps to shift disaster relief responsibilities away from the federal government and onto the states; loosen energy efficiency standards for appliances; and rescind USAID policies that address climate change and help countries transition away from fossil fuels, among others.

These are some of nearly 70 environmental action items identified in the Project 2025 Tracker, of which 47 are already completed or in progress less than 150 days into President Trump’s second term.

Tracking the administration’s progress is a somewhat subjective process, in part because many of the directives have come through executive orders or require multiple steps to complete. Additionally, many goals outlined in Project 2025 are indirect or implied and therefore not included in the tracker, according to Adrienne Cobb, one of its creators.

Cobb told The Times she read through the entire document and extracted only “explicit calls to action, or recommendations where the authors clearly state that something should be done.”

“My goal was for the tracker to reflect the authors’ intentions using their own words wherever possible,” she said. “By focusing on direct language and actionable items, I tried to create a list that’s accurate and accountable to the source material.”

Though the Trump administration continues to deny any connection to Project 2025, the creators of the massive tome were always clear about their presidential intentions.

“This volume — the Conservative Promise — is the opening salvo of the 2025 Presidential Transition Project,” Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts wrote in its forward. “Its 30 chapters lay out hundreds of clear and concrete policy recommendations for White House offices, Cabinet departments, Congress, and agencies, commissions, and boards.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ee67e96/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4800x2520+0+340/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc1%2F25%2F87a1d0ee47e29a289c3f658a193a%2F972289-me-colorado-river-project-cayonlands10-ls.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 14:14:21.052922

After months of stating the intention to remove clean-vehicle tax credits, Republican House members have passed a version of President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" that could potentially decimate electric vehicle sales in America. If passed into law, the bill would cut subsidies for battery manufacturing and remove incentives for purchasing electrified vehicles.

Specifically, the bill would phase out the Clean Vehicle Credit, first put in place under President Barack Obama and expanded in the Biden administration through the Inflation Reduction Act. Currently, buyers of hybrid and electric cars can get $7500 off qualified new vehicles with restrictions based on vehicle price and household income.

The new bill would officially end the clean-vehicle credit program on December 31, 2026. In practice, though, the credit would be effectively killed for nearly all established automakers at the end of this year. That's because the bill stipulates that for any automaker that has sold more than 200,000 qualifying vehicles, the program ends on December 31, 2025.

In addition to removing the clean-vehicle credits, the bill would add new registration fees for hybrid and electric vehicles as a stand-in for fuel taxes. Hybrid vehicles would become subject to a new $100 registration fee, while electric vehicles would add a $250 annual fee. Combined with the removal of clean-vehicle credits, the new registration fees would help to significantly raise the cost of electric vehicle ownership.

For nearly 60 years, California has enjoyed the ability to set its own standards governing air pollution from automobiles, as long as they’re more stringent than the federal government’s. This rule, written into the Clean Air Act, was meant to recognize the state’s long-standing leadership in regulating air emissions.

The US Senate undermined that authority on Thursday when it voted 51-44 to revoke a waiver the Environmental Protection Agency approved allowing the Golden State to implement and enforce a de facto ban on the sale of gasoline-powered cars by 2035. The Senate also rescinded waivers allowing California to set stricter emissions standards for new diesel trucks and mandating the adoption of zero-emission trucks.

Environmental groups quickly decried the votes, saying that California’s standards are essential to protecting public health and achieving nationwide emissions reduction targets. The rules are seen as a sort of national benchmark since automakers don’t create separate product lines: one for California and another for everyone else. A provision in the Clean Air Act also allows other states to adopt the Golden State’s standards; 16 states and the District of Columbia have adopted many of the rules established by the California Air Resources Board.

“These standards are vital in protecting people from the vehicle pollution which causes asthma attacks and other serious health problems,” Dan Lashof, a senior fellow at the nonprofit World Resources Institute, said in a statement.

On a wonkier level, however, legal and policy experts objected to the way senators rescinded California’s waiver: They used the 1996 Congressional Review Act, or CRA, a law enacted to allow Congress to overturn some federal actions with a simple majority rather than the usual 60 votes. Two government watchdogs said the act did not apply to the state’s waiver.

“Republicans twisted the Senate’s own rules,” Joanna Slaney, vice president for political and government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said in a statement. UCLA law professor Ann Carlson warned in a blog post ahead of the vote that Congress “may be opening up a Pandora’s box it can’t close” and that “there will be no limit on using the CRA to overturn all kinds of actions that the act doesn’t cover.”

At the heart of the controversy is whether the air pollution waiver that the EPA granted to California last year qualifies as a “rule” under the CRA. Both the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan oversight agency, and the Senate parliamentarian, a nonpartisan appointee tasked with interpreting congressional rules and procedures, issued advisory opinions earlier this year saying that it doesn’t. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) appeared to agree with this interpretation: A one-pager on a bill he proposed to repeal California’s waiver said that the exemptions “cannot be reviewed under the Congressional Review Act because the waiver granted by EPA is not a rule as that term is defined in the CRA.”

Party leaders don’t usually contravene the parliamentarian’s guidance. If they do, they run the risk of their opponents doing the same when they are in power. “Republicans should tread carefully today,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, told NPR on Thursday. Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) said in a statement that “radical Republicans” had “gone nuclear on the Senate rule book.”

“It won’t be long before Democrats are back in the driver’s seat again,” Padilla added. “When that happens, all bets will be off. Every agency action that Democrats don’t like — whether it’s a rule or not — will be fair game, from mining permits and fossil fuel projects to foreign affairs and tax policies.”

Dan Farber, a professor at UC Berkeley Law, told Grist that the Senate’s capricious interpretation of the CRA means it could be used to rescind waivers from the Department of Health and Human Services allowing states to modify Medicaid requirements or broadcasting licenses issued by the Federal Communications Commission. The act could also be used to revoke pollution permits that the EPA grants to states.

He clarified, however, that the Senate only nullified specific waivers in California affecting the sale of gasoline-powered cars. It did not repeal provisions in the Clean Air Act that allow the EPA to issue new waivers, as long as they’re not “substantially the same” as the rescinded ones. “I think that California still has the power to put forward, and EPA has the power to approve, different emissions regulations in the future,” Farber said. “Changing the deadlines by a few years could be enough.”

California’s current standards require 35 percent of new cars sold within the state to be zero-emissions by 2026, ratcheting up to 100 percent of new sales by 2035. President Donald Trump revoked California’s waiver allowing such regulations in 2019 during his first term, but that move was challenged in court and the waiver was restored by Joe Biden’s administration.

Although automakers have previously backed California’s air pollution standards, industry groups cheered the vote on Thursday. John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group, said in a statement that the Senate deserved “enormous credit.”

“The fact is these EV sales mandates were never achievable,” he said. “Automakers warned federal and state policymakers that reaching these EV sales targets would take a miracle, especially in the coming years when the mandates get exponentially tougher.”

California Attorney General Rob Bonta objected to the Senate vote and vowed to challenge it in court. “Reducing emissions is essential to the prosperity, health, and well-being of California and its families,” he said in a statement.

Gavin Newsom said undoing his state’s air pollution rules risked “ced[ing] American car-industry dominance to China.”",https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/EV-charging-only.webp?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C3.4613147178592%2C100%2C93.077370564282&w=1200,N,,2025-05-23 15:10:14.148699

The company is expected to create 60 direct new jobs with an average annual salary of $80,000, more than 80% higher than the parish average wage.

In addition to Green Fuels deploying its NZET technology at the shuttered Acadiana facility, which first opened in 1957, GFO plans to develop a 20,000 barrel-per-day refining unit dedicated to producing marine-grade diesel and bunker fuel. The existing facility located in the unincorporated community of Evangeline is outfitted with 15 storage tanks that have a total capacity exceeding 350,000 barrels, and will remain operational while the new GFO refining unit is developed.

“America’s energy independence requires more than just drilling — it demands that we refine our own oil here at home rather than shipping it overseas only to buy back finished fuels at premium prices,” GFO CEO Derek Williamson said. “Our revolutionary NZET refining technology solves the 150-year-old problem of refinery emissions, enabling us to build clean refineries in the communities where oil is produced, creating local jobs and energy security.”

“Under Louisiana’s ‘all of the above’ energy strategy, it is critical that we keep pace with the changing needs of the industry, including reopening and reenergizing legacy operations like Canal Companies with technology-driven strategies,” Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “GFO’s innovative NZET technology does just that, and their decision to modernize this historic facility shows that Louisiana is positioned to win, diversifying our thriving energy sector and keeping us a leader in U.S. energy production.”

The company plans to upgrade the facility to support the production of sustainable marine fuels and house a full-scale waste and brine water treatment system. It will also source local crude to support regional producers alongside feedstock delivered via pipeline and barge. GFO expects to start construction at its first Louisiana location in November and complete the project in May 2026.

The provision would have gutted protections for 500,000 acres of land near Zion National Park, along with critical habitat for threatened desert tortoises and other areas designated by Congress for conservation, according to New Mexico Wild, a conservation advocacy group. That could have meant the lands were turned into “golf courses, luxury resorts or strip malls,” the group said in a statement Thursday.

Environmental groups nationally have applauded the removal of the provision, which Reps. Celeste Maloy (R-Utah) and Mark Amodei (R-Nevada) sponsored.

The HFC was initially very concerned about the bill’s spending levels and how quickly — or not — some of the reduction measures would be implemented.

Ultimately, the HFC won out in terms of shifting Medicaid Work Requirements in the bill to take effect by 2027 rather than the originally proposed 2029 deadline.

MIKE JOHNSON, DONALD TRUMP GET ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL’ WIN AS BUDGET BILL PASSES HOUSE

On the other GOP flank, moderates and lawmakers from blue states had expressed concern over the State and Local Tax Deduction (SALT) — which helps Democrat-run state residents lessen their tax burden.

Originally, SALT was capped at $10,000, but the budget bill raised it to $30,000 for individuals earning up to $400,000.

Rep. Michael Lawler, R-N.Y., and other blue-state Republicans clashed with President Donald Trump on the matter — with the president retorting that he knew Lawler’s Rockland County district better than he did.

Lawler was seen as a winner in the budget bill’s passage, as his work — along with that of Long Island Republicans like Rep. Nick LaLota — secured the deduction for their constituents.

Another blue-state Republican, Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York, was one of two nonvoting members — the other being Rep. David Schweikert, R-Ariz., according to the official roll.

Residents of such high-tax states as New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Maryland and California won out in that respect, ensuring that they would be able to continue to utilize SALT.

Outright winners from the bill were Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who saw some version of their original effort come to pass.

Trump also saw his sweeping middle- and upper-class tax cuts preserved from expiration, which in turn rendered debt-and-deficit hawks proverbial losers.

Passage of the bill in the House comes as the national debt currently sits at $36,214,475,432,210.84, according to FOX Business' National Debt Tracker. The federal deficit will grow by about $2 trillion over 10 years, according to reports, while the tax cuts’ preservation will reduce gross federal revenue.

But Medicaid and SNAP work requirements funding cuts are expected to lessen that blow.

Other winners included illegal immigration hawks, with the bill allocating billions for the Pentagon and for homeland security, including at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Energy interests also won out in the bill’s passage.

The American Petroleum Institute applauded the House for taking another step to ""restore American energy dominance.""

""By preserving competitive tax policies, beginning to reverse the ‘methane fee,’ opening lease sales and advancing important progress on permitting, this historic legislation is a win for our nation’s energy future,"" the group said in a statement.

Losers included Democratic leadership, as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., saw his caucus vote as a bloc, but just shy of the partisan force necessary to block the bill.

One particularly upset ""loser"" in the bill’s passage was House Homeland Security Committee ranking member Bennie Thompson of Mississippi.

""You can’t shovel s--- and call it sugar,"" Thompson fumed in a Thursday statement.

""This horrific bill is one of the most shameful grifts I have ever seen played on the American public,"" he added.

Abortion providers also lost out via the bill, as it reportedly bans Medicaid disbursements to Planned Parenthood for one year, which could lead to decreased revenue for such organizations.

The House of Representatives narrowly passed a sweeping budget bill on Thursday, which includes plans to end clean energy tax credits earlier than expected, undermining a central plank of the signature programme launched under former president Joe Biden.

Former top Biden climate and clean energy adviser John Podesta, who oversaw the development of the 2022 green credits and incentives plan, told the Financial Times Climate and Impact Summit that the Trump administration had “thrown in the towel” on turning the US into a key hub for clean tech and manufacturing.

“At a time where we saw record investment in the sector, record investment in manufacturing, the combination of tariffs, the high debt structure that the Senate has enacted and then the reversal of the Inflation Reduction Act is taking a very, very strong hand and essentially throwing [it away],” he said.

Podesta argued that the IRA had helped drive investment into many Republican held states, citing examples of electric vehicle and battery manufacturing from Georgia to Michigan. He cited research showing $862bn in clean energy investments had been announced in the US since the IRA had passed.

But he warned this investment was now at risk, and compounded the uncertainty faced by businesses dealing with tariffs.

Shares of clean energy companies plummeted on Thursday, after the new spending bill passed with much bigger hits to clean energy incentives than an initial draft that was released on May 12.

The bill will head to the Senate next, where lawmakers could water down its more hardline provisions.

“I think a lot of the members that voted for this bill . . . will have to go back and . . . explain to their constituents that ‘I voted to kill your jobs. I voted to raise your prices’,” as a result of the removal of the support for clean energy, Podesta said. “You know, I think they’re going to have a lot of hard explaining to do.”

The Trump administration launch of tariffs and cuts to green subsidies meant the US had “handed a victory” to China, he said, which was “trying to dominate these industries”.

There was “bipartisan consensus” in the US and in Europe of the need to respond to Chinese dominance of green tech, he added.

“There is an economic security dimension to letting China be completely dominant in these industries. Right now, I think we’ve just thrown in the towel.”

Although China still continues to roll out coal power to meet its growing energy needs, it has also transformed its energy system over the past decade by rolling out renewables and electrifying vast swaths of its economy through cars, battery storage and railways.

It also wields vast power over the markets for the resources and materials that underpin technologies of the future.

The role of China in the global energy shift was also highlighted by Ana Toni, chief executive of the upcoming UN COP30 climate summit in Brazil.

Speaking at the FT Live conference, she said China was a “critical, critical player”, adding that many developing countries had already had “fruitful discussions and trade agreements” with Beijing.

“China has shown that they have a commitment to go faster and go forward despite the geopolitics,” she said. “China has been doing a lot in their own country, but also helping many other developing countries to transition.”",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fc48ea5f9-ef16-483d-ac13-56cbdc14d7be.jpg?source=next-article&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&width=700&dpr=1,N,,2025-05-23 15:09:40.003681

Parties whose funding was frozen sued on the grounds that the freezes violated statutes including the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) or their constitutional right to free speech. While cases remain pending in courts across the country, initial decisions show a pattern of courts rejecting the initial funding freezes and agencies agreeing to restore website content.

Below, we break down three recent decisions in The Sustainability Institute v. Trump, Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council v. US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York v. USDA.

Background

Shortly after his inauguration, President Trump signed several orders that froze or terminated congressionally appropriated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). The orders are Unleashing American Energy, Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing, and Implementing the President’s “Department of Government Efficiency” Cost Efficiency Initiative (previously discussed here, here, here, and here). In addition, agencies ordered their staff to take down climate-related webpages from their sites.

Below, we discuss three cases where courts ruled against agencies who terminated funding or took down websites on the grounds that the actions violated the APA and First Amendment.

The Sustainability Institute v. Trump

The Sustainability Institute v. Trump involves a challenge in South Carolina federal court by nonprofit groups and local governments to a freeze to federal climate funding by agencies including the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), USDA, and the US Departments of Energy (DOE) and Transportation (DOT). The funding was appropriated by US Congress and contractually awarded to municipalities and nonprofits before the Trump Administration sought to freeze it.

The challengers alleged:

That the freeze orders violate the APA by terminating funding with no process or notice.

That denying funding violates the separation of powers principle of the US Constitution and the executive’s duty under Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution to “faithfully execute[]” the laws of the United States by failing to distribute funds appropriated by Congress.

That EPA violated their First Amendment right to free speech by engaging in viewpoint discrimination by ordering nonprofits to remove disfavored language from grants and threatening to revoke federal funding for groups that draw attention to climate change or equity issues.

In response, the government argued, without evidence, that termination decisions were supported by reasoning made on an individualized grant by grant basis, rather than because they were funded by the IRA and IIJA, and therefore were justified.

In April, the court ordered the five agencies to produce all documents from January 20 to present, relating to the freeze, pause, and/or termination of any of the grants identified by the plaintiffs in their motion for expedited discovery. EPA and other agencies responded by releasing over 130,000 pages of documents containing internal EPA emails, spreadsheets, and other materials pertaining to the freezes. Even with these productions, the plaintiffs argued there was no evidence that EPA and other agencies made grant-specific determinations to terminate funding.

Following these productions, the government conceded that, at least for this case, it would “not contest[] the merits of a majority of plaintiffs’ APA claims” that grant decisions were not made on an individualized basis as required, but they maintain the admission is “for purposes of this case only.” On May 20, the court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on the APA claims, granted the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction, and denied staying injunctive relief requiring the funding to be reissued.

Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council v. USDA

In Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council v. USDA, a court reached a similar holding. This case involves a challenge by several nonprofit organizations to the freezing of funding appropriated under the IRA and IIJA. Last month, the court issued a nationwide preliminary injunction, ordering five federal agencies — DOE, US Department of Housing and Urban Development, USDA, US Department of the Interior, and EPA — to “take immediate steps to resume the processing, disbursement, and payment of already-awarded funding appropriated under” the IRA and IIJA, and prohibited those agencies from “freezing, halting, or pausing on a non-individualized basis the processing and payment” of such funding.

When EPA argued that it should be allowed to continue its freeze on nearly 800 IRA grants that had been terminated or had terminations p­­­­­­­­­ending, the court ordered that the grants be unfrozen before sending termination notices, and urged EPA to expedite the termination process for the grants it believes it can legally revoke. The case is now on appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.

Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York et al. v. USDA

Northeast Organic Farming Association of New Yorkalso reached a similar outcome. In that case, several nonprofits sued the USDA seeking to enjoin the government from erasing webpages focused on climate change. The plaintiffs’ complaint alleges that USDA violated the APA when it took down government websites containing climate content, including statutorily required climate-related policies, guides, datasets, and other resources, without advance notice or reasoned decision-making.

The USDA originally argued that the environmental groups had failed to show that relief was warranted and that the removals should stand because it was in the public’s interest to have government websites that reflect the current presidential Administration’s priorities. However, USDA recently reversed course and committed to restore climate change-focused webpages that were taken offline. Going forward, USDA stated that it would restore required websites and that it was committed “to complying with any applicable statutory requirements in connection with any future publication or posting decisions regarding the removed content, including, as applicable, the adequate-notice and equitable-access provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act and the reading room provisions of [the Freedom of Information Act].” The parties are expected to submit a joint status report in early June.",https://www.afslaw.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1300x1300/public/2025-02/ENVIRONMENTAL_1.jpg.webp?itok=KbW6imM5,N,,2025-05-23 16:08:13.787553

They were due to run until 2032 and would have been phased out more gradually than the proposed bill accounted for.

While some had been in place for many years prior, such as the solar ITC and wind PTC, others were introduced through Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, including the ITC for standalone energy storage facilities—before that, only storage coupled with and directly charged from solar was eligible.

The bill passed by the House of Representatives yesterday was even more aggressive in its treatment of tax credits than the first draft put out by the Ways & Means Committee earlier this month.

Projects hoping to qualify for the 45Y PTC and 48E ITC must be in construction within 60 days of the bill being signed into law. After going into construction, they have to be placed into service by 31 December 2028 to remain eligible.

The tax credit advisory platform Crux noted in a blog post about the bill that the 60-day provision was added at the behest of the Republican House Freedom Caucus.

This means the proposed 2029-2031 tax credit phasedown period is eliminated.

Also considered restrictive and problematic were new provisions for “prohibited foreign entities,” which left many in doubt about how industries still largely dependent on imported materials, components, and finished goods, as well as assistance, investment, licensing, and royalties from overseas partners, will be able to proceed with their projects.

‘American energy dominance across all technologies’

Now comes the crunch time as the bill heads to the Senate and, if agreed upon, goes to US President Donald Trump to sign into law.

Many figures in solar, energy storage and related industries, called for their members, advocates and the public to speak up and put pressure on their Senators, including the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), which has set up a dedicated campaign page to ‘Defend American Energy‘.

Crux said in its blog that it expects Senate could be a “moderating force” on the bill, noting that prominent Republican Senators have publicly expressed desires to see jobs and investment created by tax credits protected, emerging technologies given a longer runway of support before take-off, and tax credit transferability rules to remain in place.

The full bill, designed to enable tax cuts promised by Trump in his first term, is extensive and covers areas including healthcare, education, and energy. The administration claimed it would also end “US$500 billion in Biden-era tax breaks and special interest giveaways.”

However, groups including the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), stepped forward to criticise the so-called ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill’.

“The House has done its level best to engineer an energy crisis, deliberately sidelining the clean energy industry at the exact moment we need it most,” Gretchen Goldman, UCS president, said.

“This bill would undermine hundreds of billions of dollars of clean energy investments and tens of thousands of new jobs, spike monthly energy bills, and increase climate pollution and its attendant impacts.”

Ray Long, CEO of trade group American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), said the gutting of support for clean energy ran counter to the US government’s stated aim of achieving “American energy dominance”.

“As ACORE’s own survey of clean energy investors showed, recklessly disrupting tax incentives will undermine projects that are ready to come online, meet our nation’s growing energy needs, and create jobs,” Long said.

“ACORE is committed to working with Congress and President Trump to make any improvements to this legislation and help them deliver on his promise to slash energy costs for Americans by 50%. It’s time to achieve American energy dominance across all technologies.”",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/House-of-Representatives-and-East-Portico-Flickr-Ron-Cogswell.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 17:10:40.692272

The House voted almost entirely along party lines on Thursday to approve a big budget bill that would send many of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy provisions to an early grave. Now the Senate will take a shot at drafting its own version.

Two major losses in the House bill are the production and investment tax credits for clean power projects known as 45Y and 48E, which would be phased out much more quickly than under the IRA. Clean power projects would have to start construction within 60 days of the bill being signed into law to be eligible for the incentives, and start service by the end of 2028. Another provision means bad news for rooftop solar, as it eliminates incentives for installations that companies build on homeowners’ roofs for free or at a low price and then lease back to them.

Nuclear power, on the other hand, made out a little better. Advanced nuclear facilities would only have to start construction by the end of 2028 to access 45Y and 48E tax credits.

Several more clean energy incentives face straight-up termination, including tax credits homeowners can use to install electric appliances and make energy-efficient home improvements. The bill would also end tax credits for buyers of EVs, and then punish all EV owners with a $250 annual fee, based on the reasoning that they are getting an unfair deal because they don’t pay gas taxes — even though that math doesn’t add up.

Study after study has shown that repealing the IRA’s clean energy credits would raise energy bills, derail the clean manufacturing boom, and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. Just two months ago, 21 House Republicans signed a letter warning an IRA repeal would bring negative economic consequences. But all of them ultimately voted for the so-called big, beautiful bill.

More big energy stories

More federal clean energy funding is in jeopardy

Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced a push last week to roll back what he called ​“wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars,” and former DOE officials told Latitude Media that Loan Programs Office funding could be the first to go. The LPO allocated more than $107 billion to ambitious clean energy projects under former President Joe Biden, but many of those loans didn’t make it past conditional status, making them easier for Wright to revoke.

LPO uncertainty has already led some conditional recipients to back away from their loans. Battery-component manufacturer Aspen Aerogels ended negotiations in February to finalize its loan to build a Georgia factory, saying it would expand production in China and Mexico instead. That’s the exact kind of thing LPO funding was intended to discourage, said Jigar Shah, who headed the LPO under Biden.

“Based on the early actions of this administration, we can expect to see more and more American factories canceled or closed, leaving our communities with more broken promises,” Shah said in a statement. ​“We are on track to again cede our manufacturing industry to China.”

The ups and downs of Empire Wind

Empire Wind, an offshore project planned for the coastal waters of New York, is maybe, probably, most likely happening. The offshore wind industry has faced stormy seas since President Donald Trump took office in January and halted new leases, permits, and loans for wind farms, pausing at least seven offshore projects that were in the permitting phase. But Equinor’s Empire Wind already had its federal authorizations in hand and quietly began construction in early April. Two weeks later, the Trump administration issued a stop-work order and later cited a mysterious report that alleged the project’s approval was based on ​“flawed science.”

Things changed again Monday when the Trump administration lifted the stop-work order, letting Empire Wind construction restart. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum suggested that a compromise with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) to revive a canceled gas pipeline secured the wind project’s resumption, but Hochul’s staff said there was no such deal.

Overwhelmed by all the back and forth? Canary Media’s Clare Fieseler breaks down everything from Trump’s Day 1 order to Empire Wind’s reinstatement in a handy timeline.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the U.S. Climate Alliance announced the launch of the Affordable Clean Cars Coalition by 11 of its member governors to sustain America’s transition to cleaner and more affordable cars, support U.S. automotive manufacturers and workers, and preserve states’ clean air authority. Alongside the launch, the Alliance announced the availability of resources to help states tackle vehicle pollution and lower barriers for consumers to more affordably own, drive, charge, and maintain clean cars.

This new multi-state effort underscores governors’ commitment to both consumer choice and regulatory certainty and stability for the U.S. automotive sector, which has faced a series of destabilizing actions from Congress and the federal government. These actions have included attempts to terminate funding for electric vehicle infrastructure, impose tariffs and disrupt supply chains, eliminate consumer credits for purchasing an electric vehicle, raise consumer costs for owning an electric vehicle, and dismantle states’ clean vehicle programs — all of which undermine American competitiveness in the global automotive market and constrain innovation.

The initiative was launched by a group of governors whose states have chosen to use their authority under the Clean Air Act to adopt and implement clean vehicle programs. Participating states include: California, Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington.

Governors Gavin Newsom (CA), Jared Polis (CO), Matt Meyer (DE), Wes Moore (MD), Maura Healey (MA), Phil Murphy (NJ), Michelle Lujan Grisham (NM), Kathy Hochul (NY), Tina Kotek (OR), Dan McKee (RI), and Bob Ferguson (WA) issued the following statement on the initiative’s launch:

“The federal government and Congress are putting polluters over people and creating needless chaos for consumers and the market, but our commitment to safeguarding Americans’ fundamental right to clean air is resolute. We will continue collaborating as states and leveraging our longstanding authority under the Clean Air Act, including through state programs that keep communities safe from pollution, create good-paying jobs, increase consumer choice, and help Americans access cleaner and more affordable cars. As we consider next steps for our clean vehicle programs, our states will engage stakeholders and industry to provide the regulatory certainty needed while redoubling our efforts to build a cleaner and healthier future.”

States participating in the Affordable Clean Cars Coalition will collaborate to:

Develop solutions that make cleaner vehicles more affordable and accessible to all Americans who want them, including by reducing cost barriers, increasing availability of options, and expanding accessible charging and fueling infrastructure at home and in our communities.

Continue making progress toward the goals of states’ clean vehicle programs.

Defend longstanding authority under the Clean Air Act for states to adopt transportation solutions that best meet their needs and most effectively support their families and communities.

Explore opportunities to develop and adopt next-generation standards and programs to further reduce vehicle pollution, as permitted under the Clean Air Act or otherwise, such as solutions that increase consumer access to cleaner cars and low-carbon fuels.

Collaborate with one another, share evidence-based practices, engage experts, and develop solutions that can be shared across state lines and eventually scaled by the federal government.

Foster meaningful engagement with manufacturers, suppliers, dealers, labor unions, business associations, utilities, community-based organizations, charging and fueling infrastructure providers, and others in developing and successfully implementing state transportation solutions.

Prioritize efforts that bolster America’s ability to compete and innovate in a growing global market.

Today’s announcement comes amid record sales of clean cars globally and domestically. Clean car sales in the U.S. more than quadrupled between 2020 and 2024, and the global market for clean cars is surging to record levels worldwide. Manufacturers in the U.S. now offer more than 100 clean vehicle models for consumers to choose from, with more forthcoming, creating a dynamic market for cutting-edge vehicles that can improve our air quality, public health, and bottom lines. Public charging infrastructure is also more widely available than ever before, allowing Americans to confidently recharge and refuel on longer trips and at destinations closer to home. Importantly, clean cars are saving people money at the pump — with an estimated $1,200 in annual savings on fuel costs alone and an average of $10,000 in savings over a car’s lifespan.

States have been empowered under the Clean Air Act for nearly half a century to innovate and adopt their own clean vehicle programs, which have a demonstrated track record of supporting and creating good-paying jobs for Americans, promoting energy independence, and expanding consumer choice to more vehicle models, while simultaneously reducing vehicle pollution and helping tackle the climate crisis.

The U.S. Climate Alliance — a bipartisan coalition of 24 governors representing approximately 60 percent of the U.S. economy and 55 percent of the U.S. population — proudly hosts a number of multi-state partnerships that provide a platform for members to deepen collaboration, participate in peer-to-peer learning, engage experts and stakeholders, and develop scalable solutions. Earlier this year, the Alliance announced it will house and sustain two such initiatives launched in partnership with the Biden-Harris administration in recent years, the State Buy Clean Partnership and State Modern Grid Deployment Initiative.

The Affordable Clean Cars Coalition builds on past multistate efforts, including the Nation’s Clean Car Promise, the Multi-state Zero-Emission Vehicle Memorandum of Understanding, and the Multi-state Medium- and Heavy-duty Vehicle Zero-Emission Vehicle Memorandum of Understanding. States will customize efforts to address their own individual challenges and opportunities while working together to achieve the coalition’s collective goals.

Launched on June 1, 2017 by the governors of Washington, New York, and California to help fill the void left by President Trump’s initial decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, the Alliance has grown to include 24 governors from across the U.S. representing approximately 60% of the U.S. economy and 55% of the U.S. population. Governors in the Alliance have pledged to collectively reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 26-28% by 2025, 50-52% by 2030, and 61-66% by 2035, all below 2005 levels, and collectively achieve overall net-zero greenhouse gas emissions as soon as practicable, and no later than 2050.

The Alliance’s states and territories will continue to advance innovative and impactful climate solutions to grow the economy, create jobs, and protect public health, and have a long record of action and results. In fact, the Alliance reduced its collective net greenhouse gas emissions by 19% between 2005 and 2022, while increasing collective GDP by 30%, and is on track to meet its near-term climate goal by reducing collective GHG emissions 26% below 2005 levels by 2025. The coalition’s states and territories are employing more workers in the clean energy sector, achieving lower levels of dangerous air pollutants, and preparing more effectively for climate impacts and executing more pre-disaster planning than the rest of the country.",http://news.maryland.gov/wp-content/themes/MDTheme_eGov_mde/egov/dist/img/logo.png,N,,2025-05-23 12:23:13.159862

California’s climate leadership

Pollution is down and the economy is up. Greenhouse gas emissions in California are down 20% since 2000 – even as the state’s GDP increased 78% in that same time period.

The state continues to set clean energy records. Last year, California ran on 100% clean electricity for the equivalent of 51 days – with the grid running on 100% clean energy for some period two out of every three days. Since the beginning of the Newsom Administration, battery storage is up to over 15,000 megawatts – a 1,900%+ increase.",https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/6C94C750-0DF8-46C6-A8E3-00EA4F1B1ADD.jpeg,N,,2025-05-23 15:09:43.626672

A major spending boost for defense is also included in the bill, as well as plans to restart federal auctions of electromagnetic spectrum bands.

The House passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” early Thursday in a 215-214 vote after a 42-page manager’s amendment helped to win over several Republican holdouts. Under the reconciliation process, the bill will now proceed to the Senate where it may be passed with a simple majority vote, circumventing the need for Democratic support. Senate Republicans are expected to produce their own version of the legislation.

Any budget changes in the bill will be separate from the annual discretionary budget process.

Tax changes

The House’s bill would reintroduce tax rules allowing companies to fully deduct domestic research costs in the year they occurred, a move that has been endorsed by many companies and universities that partner with them. This provision would reverse a rule introduced in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that requires companies to spread the deduction of R&D costs over five years. (That rule took effect in 2022.)

The bill also would modify the current 1.4% endowment tax on some private colleges and universities’ net investment income to introduce a tiered system of rates, with a top rate of 21% for institutions with endowments exceeding $2 million per student. In addition, the bill would eliminate several tax breaks for non-profit organizations, including an exemption on taxes for non-publicly funded research income. Higher education advocacy groups such as the Association of American Universities have opposed these changes.

Increased military spending

The bill would provide a $150 billion boost to defense spending, of which $24.7 billion is for construction of the “Golden Dome” missile defense shield that President Trump proposed back in January. To support this endeavor, the bill contains $18.8 billion for “next-generation missile defense technologies,” including $7.2 billion for the development and procurement of military space-based sensors, $5.6 billion to develop space-based and phase intercept capabilities, and $250 million for development of directed energy capabilities.

Supporting innovation and enhancing commercial technology for military use are mentioned multiple times throughout the bill. Under a section on enhancing DOD resources for scaling low-cost weapons into production, the bill includes $2 billion for expanding the Defense Innovation Unit, a $1 billion boost for “programs to accelerate the procurement and fielding of innovative technologies,” $250 million for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Quantum Benchmarking Initiative, and $120 million for development of small modular nuclear reactors for military use.

The bill also includes $3.2 billion for the National Nuclear Security Administration, of which $1 billion is to accelerate construction of facilities, $540 million is for deferred maintenance, $200 million is for concept studies of new nuclear weapons, and $100 million is to accelerate domestic uranium enrichment.

Big cuts to clean energy

The bill would significantly restrict or eliminate many of the clean energy incentives introduced by President Joe Biden as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, including clean energy tax credits, advanced manufacturing tax credits, Environmental Justice Block Grants, and the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Multiple Department of Energy units would see unobligated IRA funding rescinded if the bill passes unaltered, including the Loan Programs Office and the Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment program, among others.

Authorizing spectrum auctions

The bill would restore the Federal Communications Commission’s spectrum auction authority, with the hope of raising $88 billion by 2034 through sales of 600 megahertz of spectrum. At present, the funds would be used to offset the costs of other provisions of the legislation. Democrats’ suggestions to spend the funds on specific federal programs were voted down during committee amendments. Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) has in the past proposed using auction funds to support science programs authorized by the CHIPS and Science Act, but this option no longer appears to be on the table.",https://aip.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2ad1bf8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4500x2531+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-aip.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F39%2Fd5%2Fb12674554d3dba9e8fa7ddf9f114%2F25140739455849.png,N,,2025-05-23 15:09:47.641044

Scott Davidson: What I can say is that almost every charging management service provider that’s out there, we have integrated into our platform.
Most of our fleet customers have tried it on their own and they recognize how hard it is.
Scott Davidson: Well, I would say there are two dominant themes emerging—or three in California.
Scott Davidson: I started in electrification back in 2019 after spending over a decade helping companies adopt solar energy.","Revolv’s fleet-as-a-service model allows companies to pursue electrification without risking any capital.

For fleet operators, electrification carries not only major costs, but also substantial financial risk—if EVs or infrastructure fail to perform, companies can lose big money. Choosing a fleet-as-a-service model can eliminate that risk, while converting capital expenditure to operating expense.

Revolv’s focus is on choosing the best hardware, software and services for a customer’s needs, and integrating them into a complete solution. The company works with multiple software providers, vehicle OEMs, EVSE providers and installers, and maintenance service providers.

Revolv also helps customers navigate the complex process of applying for federal, state, local and utility incentives, relieving fleet operators of the need to develop this specialized expertise in-house.

California requires that a certain amount of state investment goes to benefit disadvantaged communities. Revolv helps to identify facilities that qualify for greater incentives, delivering greater savings for customers and helping the state achieve its environmental justice goals.

Fleet owners know they need to electrify, but the up-front costs—for vehicles, charging hardware and more—are daunting. And it’s not just a question of finding the capital—investing such large sums in a developing technology that’s outside of a company’s core competency carries substantial risks. More than one fleet has rushed into electrification, laid down lots of cash, and taken a bath.

Some companies spent big to install charging infrastructure, only to be forced to spend more a few years later to rip and replace hardware that turned out not to meet their needs. A couple of well-known car rental agencies bought large numbers of EVs, then struggled to keep them charged up, and ended up selling them at a loss (and a major PR embarrassment) because they didn’t understand the EV resale market.

Fortunately, a growing number of companies—both established players and startups—offer a range of alternatives for fleets that need expert help getting electrified (which is to say, all fleets). Fleet operators can outsource as much or as little of the electrification stack as they choose. If reducing CapEx risk is a priority, the best option may be to choose a company like Revolv, which offers a fleet-as-a-service model, providing EVs, charging infrastructure, project planning, maintenance and more for a flat monthly fee. This not only cuts through the complexity of setting up an electric fleet, it also reduces the risk of unpleasant financial surprises.

Charged spoke with Revolv CEO Scott Davidson.

Charged: It almost sounds too good to be true. How can a fleet operator procure EVs, install charging infrastructure, and set up the software and service contracts to run it all, without risking any capital?

Scott Davidson: Let me start by describing what fleets are faced with today when they’re making those decisions, because they’re faced with a number of challenges that we believe we’re uniquely suited to solve.

The first is that there’s a lot of noise and complexity in the landscape, whether that’s incentives or the types of vehicles that are in the market, or the types of infrastructure. I think what happens a lot of times is providers say, “Hey, I’ve got the solution for you, and it just so happens to be my vehicle or my software solution.”

We see ourselves as operating in the space between all those solutions. We put our arms around everything—we help fleets pick the right vehicles, the right software, the right service provider, and we stitch that together and wrap it into a complete solution that customers buy from a single party. Then we sit on the same side of the table as the customer through operations. We don’t sell the vehicle and walk away. We deliver electric miles on a daily basis that is cost-competitive and performance-competitive with their existing fleet.

What we think the customer wants is economic performance, operational performance, and environmental performance, in that order. Our reason for being is to help fleets stay focused on their business while still achieving those three important things.

Charged: Does a customer usually come to you with an idea of what kind of vehicles they’re looking to buy, or do you consult with them and make recommendations?

Scott Davidson: I would say both. A lot of times, customers have established relationships with OEMs that they buy vehicles from. But if you look at the cargo van space, for example, all the manufacturers that are delivering a cargo van are offering different specifications for payload, range and size.

Our focal point is first to listen to a customer in terms of what they think is important for their day-to-day operations, then to apply the EV lens to it and say, “Given what your operational needs are, and what your preferences are, let’s look at the market and figure out which vehicle is best for you.” We’re technology-agnostic. We’re going to be held to performance for the customer, so we have a natural incentive to pick the right vehicle for them, because if we pick the wrong vehicle, we have to deal with it on an operational basis day to day.

Some of the major OEMs have a broad portfolio of ICE vehicle offerings, of different classes and different sizes, but their EV portfolios are more immature—they usually only serve a specific use case. So, if a fleet has been buying from a specific OEM but their EV product doesn’t fit their operational needs, they have this disconnect between what they need and what the OEM can deliver. Our job is to interpret how they use a vehicle and then find the right EV to serve their needs.

Charged: Once the customer has selected vehicles, then you buy the vehicles or lease them?

Scott Davidson: Correct. We warehouse all the technology risks on behalf of customers. We buy the vehicles, the charging infrastructure, the telematics. We take everything that a fleet would have to invest capital in, and we convert CapEx into OpEx. The first time a fleet pays for a vehicle delivered from Revolv is when it’s in operation and working.

Charged: It sounds like you’re taking on a lot of risk. What if you sign up a customer, you buy 50 trucks, and a couple of years later, they go out of business or say, “I can’t pay,” what happens then?

Scott Davidson: It’s a great question. Yes, we manage that technology risk and business continuity risk for customers, but we do it eyes wide open. There are some manufacturers that we will not buy from because we’re not willing to take that risk. Our job is to look at that risk profile and understand for customers where we’re willing to put our money where our mouth is on specific vehicles.

There are vehicles in our fleet that we are operating today that have different long-term owners—some of them from OEMs that are no longer in business—but those vehicles are still up and running. We have service providers that are maintaining those vehicles to make sure they continue to operate in customer fleets, and that’s the complexity that fleets don’t want to deal with.

Your reference to CapEx is really important. They don’t have CapEx, but there’s a big OpEx component associated with building a team who can do this effectively. There are unique capabilities and skill sets that large fleets like Amazon and FedEx and PepsiCo have at their disposal, but the lion’s share of fleets do not have those resources. That’s where we come in, to add expertise and specialization to help them achieve their objectives without having to build those internal capabilities.

Charged: I often hear companies talking about a stack of products and services. There’s the vehicles, there’s buying the chargers, installing the chargers, maintaining the chargers. How much of that do you do yourself and how much do you work with other companies?

Scott Davidson: Our expertise is in the space between all the solutions. Our job is not to build a vehicle, a software platform, or an on-the-ground service network. Our job is to find the best of all those things and to stitch them together into a complete solution and to make sure the integration of that solution works for customers. That’s typically where EVs struggle—it’s not the quality of the charger or the vehicle, it’s how they connect and the relationship between those and drivers on a day-to-day basis.

When we think about electrification, we think about it as a system, not components. And you really have to focus on the weakest link to make sure that the system is integrating, because one point of failure can bring the entire system down. That’s where we’re laser-focused: the connective tissue between all those solutions.

Charged: So, you work with third-party companies that provide different parts of the value chain?

Scott Davidson: Correct. Multiple software providers, hardware providers on both the vehicle and the charging sides, and service providers in terms of building sites, as well as maintaining them on the back end.

Charged: Can you name any of the software providers you work with?

Scott Davidson: What I can say is that almost every charging management service provider that’s out there, we have integrated into our platform. Some are from the traditional incumbent OEMs, whether it’s Volvo trucks that we have deployed in SoCal or other providers, like the Ford E-Transit cargo vans—all those OEMs typically have some charging management system that we integrate. And then there are also specialty providers in the marketplace. We look at the unique requirements of the fleet and decide what software we plug into our system.

Charged: So it’s a custom-made system for each customer.

Scott Davidson: The integration, yes. If you think about it from a customer’s perspective, they typically already have an existing telematics system. They don’t want to buy another one, and have to go into this portal for ICEs and that portal for EVs. They ask us to provide continuity between how they manage their ICE fleet and their EV fleet.

Charged: Are your customers mostly fleet operators?

Scott Davidson: Yeah. Most of our fleets are based in California because that’s where fleets can achieve economic and operational parity without compromise, but our fleets have a national footprint across the US. The smallest fleet we serve is close to 50 vehicles. The largest has close to 9,000 units.

Most of our fleet customers have tried it on their own and they recognize how hard it is. That’s when they tend to engage us—after they’ve tried it and they say, “Wait, this is way harder than we thought it was going to be.” We’re focused on fleets that recognize that electrification is inevitable and are making investments today to respond to the regulatory pressures, but also with an awareness that EVs are eventually going to be the better economic and operational solution in most applications.

Charged: Is it all truck fleets, or do you do buses and transit too?

Scott Davidson: We are focused on commercial trucks: Class 2, Class 2B (cargo vans), all the way up to Class 8 vehicles. We have the entire spectrum operating in our fleet at the moment. We’ve not yet been focused on government fleets, although we expect to very shortly.

Charged: Which vehicle classes are where the action is right now?

Scott Davidson: Well, I would say there are two dominant themes emerging—or three in California. One, you’re hearing a lot of conversations around drayage, Class 7 and Class 8 vehicles, specifically in ports, because of the regulations, both Advanced Clean Fleets and port regulations. A lot of those are being served by depot providers. They have big power needs in proximity to the ports. You see a lot of companies emerging to provide charging services.

The second segment that we see is large fleet providers who have a compliance obligation as it relates to Advanced Clean Fleets. [Editor’s note: The ACF regulation is partially in effect in 2025. While state and local government fleet requirements remain active, the provisions for Class 7-8 vehicles in high-priority fleets and drayage trucks are not being enforced due to the EPA waiver withdrawal and ongoing legal developments.] A lot of our customers are responding to that to make sure they’re prepared to electrify that class.

The third category is fleets that are adopting because EVs are currently at an economic and operational advantage in their fleet. That’s where we’re uniquely suited to help fleets understand where they can achieve cost parity. That last category, where it makes economic and operational sense, is a growing category in California, but also in other jurisdictions.

Charged: The complex business of sorting through the government incentives is a specialty of yours, especially in California.

Scott Davidson: Yeah. Most of our operations at this point are in California, although we are quickly expanding to serve customers in other markets. What policymakers have done very effectively in California is to establish a carrot and a stick. Advanced Clean Fleets, we think of that as the stick. That’s for the segment of the market that doesn’t want to move.

The carrot is incentives, and those incentives can be in a couple different forms. At the federal level, they can be tax credits. At the state level, they include vehicle purchase incentives, like HVIP in California, and incentives on the utility side of the meter, like the EV Ready [or Charge Ready] programs provided by the investor-owned utilities. There’s also the EnergIIZE program, which we recently were successful in arranging for a number of fleet customers—we secured funding that covers 70% of the total charging infrastructure costs for two California customers in the latest funding round. And there’s the Low Carbon Fuel Standard program, which helps provide credit revenue for electricity that goes to power EVs.

If you look at that incentive landscape—and that’s just a very short summary—you can see the complexity for a fleet. “How do I stitch them all together to reduce my costs to achieve economic parity?” That’s where we help: by stacking all those incentives together so that we can lower their monthly price, and they can achieve their objectives without having to build an internal function for accessing incentives.

Charged: The customer is paying you a monthly fee, but a lot of the incentives are in the form of a block grant or a tax credit. How does that work? Is it you that’s getting the incentive or is the customer getting the incentive?

Scott Davidson: It depends on the incentive. The simplest way to do it is to have the incentive flow through to us and for us to reduce the monthly payment for the customer. And there are well-defined mechanisms for that within the HVIP program in California, which provides a voucher grant for the vehicle. The program looks at us as an effective lessor of the vehicle, and holds us accountable to make sure that the full value of the incentive is passed through to the customer.

We help the regulators navigate these programs, as well as the customers. For the program providers, we’re an expert counterparty—we help them deploy money more efficiently because we know what the program rules are, we know how it works. We reduce friction both for a customer, having to learn the program, and for the program providers for having to teach them how to use it.

Charged: California requires that a certain amount of the state investment goes to benefit disadvantaged communities. Does that factor into your strategy for helping customers get the most out of the incentive programs?

Scott Davidson: Yeah. We look at a fleet’s existing operations and say, “You get more money in disadvantaged communities, so let’s find out where your operations are.” If we can help them prioritize a facility that’s in a disadvantaged community, which receives greater incentives, it’s a win-win for everybody. In the case of the EnergIIZE applications that we submitted, we looked at existing sites for each customer, identified which site was in a disadvantaged community, then built infrastructure at that site. As a result, we were able to access more incentives for those customers.

A fleet might have 20 or 40 different sites in California. Which one has the right revenue profile and can get the most incentives and achieve the best uptime? Which one has the right kind of utility interconnect and the right kind of routes? We sort through that mess for our customers.

You often hear people celebrating or criticizing cases where EVs aren’t working. But that begs the question: Is it the EVs’ fault, or is it how they were applied to the specific use case? It’s our view that it’s going to be important to have ICE vehicles and EVs operating together for some time, and you need to develop expertise to figure out where to allocate which in order to get the best outcome for your fleet.

Charged: Tell us about your background and how you started the company.

Scott Davidson: I started in electrification back in 2019 after spending over a decade helping companies adopt solar energy. What customers cared about was buying clean energy that was cost-competitive, and we did that in the solar sector by providing a similar contract structure to what we’re offering with Revolv.

The solar market has a lot of interesting parallels to today’s EV market. Rising regulations, increasing incentives, declining cost, improving performance—all the factors that were in play with the solar market back in the early 2000s are now in play for the EV space. Revolv was formed in 2020 to help commercial customers reduce cost, complexity and risk.

The market is soon going to be an economics-driven market. At that point, it won’t be about if you care about the environment, it will be about if you care about economic and operational performance. That is going to arrive way faster than people think.

Charged: Are we already at the point of cost parity in certain segments, or is that still a couple of years off?",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Electric-Truck-Vans-AdobeStock_615109407.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 12:23:24.852785

It's a move provoking pushback from Golden State leaders in Sacramento.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom and other Democrats have argued that it is an illegal use of the Congressional Review Act, whereas Republicans, including state legislators, say the move is a necessary step toward curbing regulation in the state.

""I'm thankful that the folks in Washington, D.C., had common sense with something the governor doesn't have here in California,"" State Sen.

At a news conference on Thursday morning, Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta said they plan on suing the Trump administration, which they’ve done more than 20 times, over the likely move.

Part of the legal argument being made by the Golden State is that the House Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian said that a waiver does not technically count as a rule, which created a debate over what can be done under the Congressional Review Act, according to The Hill.

35 DEMOCRATS VOTE WITH GOP TO BLOCK BIDEN RULE ALLOWING NEWSOM'S GAS CAR BAN

Newsom said that the electric vehicle manufacturing market has made significant gains in California and that the state is a leader in ""innovation"" in wanting to pivot to electric, specifically citing air quality.

In the short term, the state is also facing concerns about rising gas prices with the expected closures of two California refineries, an issue the governor said he’s been on top of to avoid issues.

When Fox News Digital asked Newsom whether he thinks rising prices would encourage consumers to switch to electric vehicles, he said that Californians are ultimately in the driver’s seat.

CONGRESS CAN STOP CALIFORNIA'S RADICAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANDATES THAT HURT THE ENTIRE NATION

""I think that's up to consumers, but the cost benefits of electric vehicles are well-established and continue to be well-reinforced as it relates to uncertainties around supply chains, wars of aggression by Russia, and by the vagaries of the kind of political machinations you see in the Middle East and self-dealing that we see.

Love or hate Tesla CEO Elon Musk, his company doesn’t just make cars, it also created the best EV charging network.

Maybe he joined for a ZR1 company car?","This week, the Wall Street Journal reported that General Motors is urging employees to help repeal California’s upcoming ban on the sale of gas-powered cars. The Golden State has mandated that only zero-emission cars be sold starting in 2035. Over a dozen other states have adopted the rules. In an email to employees, GM asked that they contact their senators.

The Senate will soon vote on a measure to repeal California’s ability to set its own emissions standards. The rest of the country falls under the EPA rules. This is a complicated issue. Demand for EVs is slowing and car companies naturally want to produce cars people want to buy, while also designing and engineering cars that meet a single set of regulations.

How much regulation is too much? That’s the question. Before the advent of tailpipe emissions standards a half-century ago, Los Angeles air was so toxic it made eyes water. The electronic engine controls required to reduce pollutants have evolved to such a state that the technology is one enabler for the upcoming 1064-horsepower Corvette ZR1. My colleague Aaron Robinson wrote a terrific history of emission laws in 2020, the 50th anniversary of the founding of the EPA. Those early regulations were a win for everyone.

Decades ago, the rules targeted carbon monoxide and oxides of sulfur and nitrogen. Later regulations focused on fuel economy, which is another way of regulating emissions of carbon dioxide, the same gas we exhale when breathing. That’s the focus of the EV rules, the holy grail being an EV that is charged by methods like solar, wind, or hydro power that do not produce CO2. Maybe a better question is what’s feasible and at what cost? Or perhaps, what is the future and how do we get there?

China has already decided. More than a quarter of new cars sold in 2024 were electric and another 25% were hybrids, which were both significant increases from the previous year. Ford CEO Jim Farley highlighted China’s EV strength as a potential threat. Then there’s Tesla, which sells only EVs and is the most valuable car company in the world—worth about $1 trillion—despite selling a fifth as many cars as Toyota. Love or hate Tesla CEO Elon Musk, his company doesn’t just make cars, it also created the best EV charging network.

As I’ve said repeatedly: We live in complicated times. In other news that will affect our cars, a trucking company called Aurora recently announced autonomous freight service in Texas. This move was billed as the first fully autonomous commercial driving on public roads. Less than three weeks after the launch, however, an observer was placed back in the driver’s seat and co-founder Sterling Anderson, a former Tesla executive, left for a new job at General Motors as chief product officer. It seems he will be responsible for all GM vehicles starting next month. Maybe he joined for a ZR1 company car?

On a more local scale, remember the pair of enthusiasts whom I highlighted a few weeks ago for building a custom V-10 engine in their Detroit-area garage? They’ve tested their creation on a chassis dyno. You’ll recall they taught themselves how to weld by making five-cylinder heads. Amazing. Watch their video to see if their motor can sing to 8000 rpm.

– Alex Beld is the communications director at RENEW Wisconsin, a nonprofit 501c3 advocating for clean energy solutions across the state.","The column below reflects the views of the author, and these opinions are neither endorsed nor supported by WisOpinion.com.

A recently published report by the Center for Energy & Environmental Analysis, “Drill More, Pay More – America’s New Energy Paradigm,” indicates the U.S. is facing a unique energy situation characterized by both rising domestic energy prices and increased energy production. Wholesale natural gas prices in the U.S. have increased 93 percent in the first quarter of 2025, compared to the same period last year, despite record-high natural gas production.

At the same time, we have reports on clean energy that show us (Achieving 100% Clean Energy in Wisconsin Report and the companion reportThe Economic Impacts of Decarbonization in Wisconsin), we don’t just know that Wisconsin can achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050 — we know how to do it. All while maintaining reliability and affordability for consumers. These reports emphasize that most of the projected energy demand through 2050 can be met with the development of more renewables, enhanced energy efficiency, and more flexible energy load management solutions.

We’re now past the point of advocating for clean energy solely because it’s better for the planet. As our energy needs grow, driven by electrification and data demand, it’s critical to invest in solutions that can be brought online quickly and affordably. Methane gas can no longer guarantee the consistent, low prices it once did. In contrast, renewable energy projects like solar and wind can typically be built in about two years, while gas plants often take twice as long to become operational. Supply chain issues and tariff uncertainties are increasing construction times and costs across all sectors, but renewable energy projects can still be constructed more quickly while avoiding the fuel price volatility associated with fossil fuels. With timelines and costs both working against gas, it’s simply not smart business to keep investing in slower, more expensive options when faster, more reliable solutions are within reach.

Utilities across the country continue to tell regulatory bodies and the general public that we can only meet the rising energy demands caused by new data centers with methane gas plants. However, national case studies from companies like Meta and Microsoft have demonstrated that clean energy solutions can meet data center needs when paired with smart load shifting and grid integration. Microsoft, for example, is piloting hydrogen fuel cells as an alternative to fossil fuel backup, while Meta has partnered with the Tennessee Valley Authority to run its Tennessee data center on 800 MW of solar power. These examples show us that there are multiple ways for us to power the digital economy, notably, without fossil fuels.

Even with clean energy opportunities before us, and financial and supply chain barriers to building new methane gas plants, we continue to see utilities propose new natural gas-powered electricity generation. An energy source, which according to analysis by the U.S. Department of Energy, is likely to have three cumulative impacts on consumers: higher natural gas bills, higher electricity bills, and even a higher cost of goods from U.S. manufacturers.

By supporting clean energy solutions, energy efficiency measures, and creative management of our grid, we can reliably support the around-the-clock energy needs of data centers and the needs of everyday Wisconsinites. To ignore these solutions is to ignore good business sense. It is time to recognize that clean energy isn’t an alternative but a practical solution to our growing energy demand.

With the GOP controlling both chambers of Congress and President Trump backing the measure, the bill seeks to reverse previous executive withdrawals that restricted leasing and impose new limits on presidential authority in future energy decisions.

Republican Push for Offshore Expansion

Introduced by Rep. Clay Higgins (R-LA), H.R. 513 nullifies multiple executive orders that previously withdrew offshore lands from leasing, including:

Arctic Region & Pacific Coast – Withdrawals affecting the Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, and Atlantic canyon areas.

North Aleutian Basin – 2014 leasing prohibitions.

Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Areas – Protected zones reinstated in 2021.

Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic, and Pacific Offshore Areas – 2025 executive orders restricting leasing.

The bill also imposes strict limits on future executive withdrawals, ensuring offshore leasing decisions adhere to congressional oversight:

Withdrawal Size Limits – No single withdrawal can exceed 150,000 acres.

Time Restrictions – Withdrawals cannot last longer than 20 years.

Cumulative Limitations – Presidents cannot withdraw more than 500,000 acres cumulatively without congressional approval.

Mandatory Economic & Mineral Assessments – Withdrawals must be supported by mineral resource surveys, national security analyses, and revenue impact studies.

Supporters argue that it restores stability to energy investment, preventing abrupt shifts in leasing policy due to administrative changes.

Democratic Opposition and Environmental Concerns

Despite Republican dominance in Congress, Democrats and environmental advocates remain staunchly opposed to the bill, arguing that it prioritizes fossil fuel development over climate and conservation efforts.

Critics warn that limiting executive authority on leasing withdrawals could prevent future administrations from responding to environmental crises, scientific findings, or public concerns over marine protection. Additionally, restrictions on offshore withdrawals could impact conservation programs that rely on leasing revenues, including federal allocations to coastal preservation.

Some Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns about the bill’s prohibition on judicial review, arguing that it removes legal challenges to controversial leasing decisions and weakens environmental protections.

A Republican-Controlled Congress Signals a Clear Path Forward

With Republican majorities in both chambers, H.R. 513 is likely to advance quickly through Congress, facing little resistance in the House and a strong likelihood of passage in the Senate. President Trump has signaled firm support, indicating that restricting presidential withdrawals will prevent future Democratic administrations from blocking offshore leasing.

The bill makes the 199A deduction permanent and expands it to 23%, helping millions of small businesses, including most wholesaler-distributors.
1 delivers a big, beautiful boost to U.S. entrepreneurship and small businesses.","President Donald J. Trump’s One, Big, Beautiful Bill — a once-in-a-generation opportunity to cement an America First agenda of prosperity, opportunity, and security into law — is one step closer to the finish line following its passage by the House of Representatives.

Here’s what they’re saying about the One, Big, Beautiful Bill:

American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall: “Farm Bureau applauds the House passage of H.R.1, which modernizes farm bill programs and extends and improves critical tax provisions that benefit America’s small farmers and ranchers. Updated reference prices will provide more certainty for farmers struggling through tough economic times. Making business tax deductions permanent and continuing current estate tax exemptions will ensure thousands of families will be able to pass their farms to the next generation. We urge the Senate to work together and swiftly pass legislation to deliver much-needed relief to America’s farm and ranch families.”

U.S. Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President Neil Bradley: “The House sent a clear message today—American workers and businesses want and need permanent tax relief. A competitive, pro-growth tax code doesn’t just grow the overall U.S. economy, it raises wages for workers and improves the lives of Americans. The legislation passed out of the House this morning contains critical measures that support main street businesses, enhance America’s global competitiveness, and bolster sustained economic growth. The Chamber commends Speaker Johnson for his leadership and commitment to ensuring the permanence of President Trump’s pro-growth tax reforms, and applauds the lawmakers involved in driving this effort forward. We encourage the Senate to continue to move the legislative process forward to deliver lasting benefits for American workers and businesses.”

Airlines for America: “A4A commends the House for passing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act which includes a critical investment of $12.5 billion for modernizing the Federal Aviation Administration’s air traffic facilities, systems and infrastructure. ATC staffing shortages and antiquated equipment, such as copper wires, floppy disks and paper strips, have been a serious concern for years—we are past time to make meaningful change and ensure that the United States has a world-class aviation system. This funding is a vital down payment on updating the system that guides 27,000 flights, 2.7 million passengers and 61,000 tons of cargo every day. The legislation also makes smart, strategic investments in Customs and Border Protection personnel and training for the aviation workforce of tomorrow while supporting American energy dominance in aviation fuel production. We encourage the Senate to move swiftly to pass this bill and send it to the President.”

National Cattlemen’s Beef Association President Buck Wehrbein: “Cattle farmers and ranchers need Congress to invest in cattle health, strengthen our resources against foreign animal disease, support producers recovering from disasters or depredation, and pass tax relief that protects family farms and ranches for future generations. Thankfully, this reconciliation bill includes all these key priorities. NCBA was proud to help pass this bill in the House and we will continue pushing for these key policies until the bill is signed into law.”

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi: “Big news from DC—the House just passed President Trump’s tax bill, bringing No Tax On Tips one step closer to the finish line. While it still needs to clear the Senate, this is a big win for hardworking @Uber drivers and couriers across the country 👏”

Job Creators Network CEO Alfredo Ortiz: “Congratulations to President Trump and Speaker Johnson for passing their reconciliation bill in the House. This bill offers historic tax cuts for small businesses and ordinary Americans. By making the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent and expanding key provisions, such as the small business tax deduction, which Job Creators Network was the loudest voice for, this bill offers significant tax relief for decades to come. It will allow small businesses, the backbone of the American economy, to expand, hire, raise wages, and reinvest in their communities, ushering in a new economic Golden Age. On behalf of all small businesses, JCN thanks President Trump and Speaker Johnson for their leadership in passing this bill, which the media said couldn’t be done on this aggressive timeline. Now it’s time for the Senate to follow suit and pass similar legislation, which includes the House’s key small business tax cuts, as soon as possible.”

National Association of Manufacturers President and CEO Jay Timmons: “Today’s House passage of this historic legislation marks a major victory for manufacturers across America. This pro-growth legislation preserves crucial tax policies that will enable manufacturers to create jobs, invest in their communities, grow here at home and compete globally. In short, this is a manufacturers’ bill … This is a pivotal moment. It’s time to double down on policies that encourage manufacturers to invest and create jobs in America and keep our industry strong and our nation competitive on the world stage—because when manufacturing wins, America wins.”

Business Roundtable President and COO Kristen Silverberg: “Under Speaker Johnson’s leadership, the House has achieved a major milestone toward extending and strengthening President Trump’s historic tax reform. Business Roundtable commends the House on taking a giant step forward to protect and boost the economic benefits that tax reform delivered for American businesses, workers and families. By maintaining a competitive corporate tax rate and enhancing essential domestic and international tax provisions, the House budget reconciliation bill will help fuel U.S. investment, innovation and economic growth. As the Senate prepares to act, we stand ready to continue working with Congress and the Administration to pass the most competitive, pro-growth tax package possible.”

American Petroleum Institute President and CEO Mike Sommers: “We applaud the House of Representatives for passing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to help restore American energy dominance. By preserving competitive tax policies, beginning to reverse the ‘methane fee,’ opening lease sales and advancing important progress on permitting, this historic legislation is a win for our nation’s energy future. We look forward to working with the Senate to strengthen pro-investment provisions and keep America at the forefront of energy innovation.”

National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors CEO Eric Hoplin: “We applaud the House of Representatives for passing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and extend our sincere thanks to Speaker Mike Johnson, Chairman Jason Smith, the Ways and Means Committee, and House leadership for championing this pro-business, pro-worker legislation. This is a win for the people who roll up their sleeves every day to power our economy, entrepreneurs who build businesses from the ground up, and the workers who keep them running. We urge the Senate to act swiftly and send this bill to the President’s desk so America’s job creators and workers can keep driving our economy forward. The bill makes the 199A deduction permanent and expands it to 23%, helping millions of small businesses, including most wholesaler-distributors. It raises the death tax exemption, protecting family-owned businesses, and restores vital incentives that encourage investment, innovation, and long-term economic growth.”

Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council President and CEO Karen Kerrigan: “H.R. 1 delivers a big, beautiful boost to U.S. entrepreneurship and small businesses. SBE Council applauds U.S. House passage of this critically important legislation. In addition to permanent tax relief and incentives that will help entrepreneurs and small business owners grow their firms, level up their businesses, and support their employees, various measures in the legislation correctly right-fit various federal programs and functions that have gone awry and consequently have undermined fiscal accountability and the private sector. Time is of the essence in getting the One Big Beautiful Bill to President Trump’s desk, and we urge the U.S. Senate to move post haste on the work that must be done to deliver the big benefits of the package to small business owners, all taxpayers, and the U.S. economy.”

National Business Aviation Association President and CEO Ed Bolen: “We commend the House for recognizing the importance of improving ATC infrastructure and strengthening the controller workforce to enhance safety and efficiency in the National Airspace System. Business aviation’s ability to serve citizens, companies and communities is only possible because the U.S. leads the world in aviation … As the House reconciliation bill moves to the Senate for consideration, we look forward to working with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to advance these forward-looking provisions that bolster an essential industry, support countless workers and promote American competitiveness.”

America’s Credit Unions President and CEO Jim Nussle: “Thank you to the U.S. House of Representatives for securing credit unions’ not-for-profit tax status as part of H.R. 1 and recognizing the industry’s importance to strong Main Streets across the country. More than 142 million Americans trust and rely on credit unions to achieve their American Dream, and this bill allows them to continue on their path of financial freedom. We will continue to advocate for policies that create more opportunities for credit unions to bolster our nation’s economic prosperity. We call on the U.S. Senate to continue to protect the credit union tax status as they consider this legislation.”

National Taxpayers Union Executive Vice President Brandon Arnold: “The bill passed by the House contains growth-focused tax relief and some important first steps toward long-needed spending restraint. The Senate now has a strong package that it can build upon and further improve.”

National Association of REALTORS Executive Vice President Shannon McGahn: “We appreciate House leaders for taking this important step with this tax reform bill, which supports hardworking families and strengthens the real estate economy. With lower tax rates, SALT relief, and new incentives for small businesses and community development, this proposal brings real benefits to everyday Americans.”

National Electrical Contractors Association CEO David Long: “These provisions recognize the real-world needs of the electrical construction industry. Whether it’s power generation, grid modernization, cutting-edge data center projects, or clean energy installations, electrical contractors are at the forefront of America’s infrastructure evolution. This legislation gives our contractors the certainty they need to plan, invest, and grow.”

American Hotel & Lodging Association President and CEO Rosanna Maietta: “This is a win for Main Street businesses. We commend lawmakers for including critical tax provisions in the budget reconciliation bill that will prevent a tax increase on American workers and the small businesses that are the backbone of America’s hotel and lodging industry. This is a critical step to stave off the expiration of important tax provisions that will provide our members, the majority of whom are small business owners, the level of certainty they need to effectively operate their businesses. We urge the U.S. Senate to swiftly pass this legislation and send it to President Trump’s desk.”

National Pork Producers Council President Duane Stateler: “America’s pork producers are one step closer to more certainty with the House’s reconciliation bill passage, which includes necessary legislation to keep farms afloat during uncertain times.”

Associated Equipment Distributors President and CEO Brian P. McGuire: “AED commends House Speaker Mike Johnson and his leadership team for securing House passage of the budget reconciliation bill. This legislation delivers pro-growth tax policies, streamlines energy project approvals and strengthens surface transportation infrastructure investments. We look forward to working with the Senate to ensure final passage of this comprehensive package.”

American Federation for Children CEO Tommy Schultz: “We are grateful for the efforts of Speaker Johnson and Congressional leaders in both chambers who have stood up so far to ensure that President Trump’s goal of school choice for every family in every state becomes a reality. American parents deserve nothing less, and we will continue working to get school choice across the finish line as the Senate can deliver on a historic national school choice tax credit. Bringing school choice to every state will be a legacy item for the lawmakers who stand boldly behind parents. We will continue to stand with them to achieve this goal.”

National Federation of Independent Business SVP for Advocacy Adam Temple: “The One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes the most important thing Congress can do to help small businesses and their workers – increasing and making the Small Business Deduction permanent. The bill also provides a tax cut for small business owners through lower individual rates, encourages new capital investments, and helps small business owners provide greater health care benefits to their employees. Members of Congress have a historic opportunity to provide over 33 million small business owners with permanent tax relief and NFIB strongly encourages them to do so.”

Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor: “We’re grateful to our champions on Capitol Hill who have worked hard to preserve and extend rural priorities, like the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit. This budget reconciliation package would give farmers and ethanol producers the freedom and flexibility to deliver for the American people. It ultimately delivers on the President’s agenda—it’s good for rural communities, good for innovation, good for investment, and good for American energy dominance.”

Americans for Prosperity Chief Government Affairs Officer Brent Gardner: “On behalf of our network of grassroots activists and small business owners nationwide, AFP congratulates Speaker Johnson, Majority Leader Scalise, Whip Emmer, and all the committee chairs for shepherding this legislation through the U.S. House of Representatives. Thanks to the efforts of policy champions across the House GOP conference, we are one step closer to giving Americans the pro-growth tax policy they voted for in November. Beyond cementing the foundation for a post-Biden economic recovery, we are poised to embrace an all-of-the-above approach to U.S. energy production, and finally secure our southern border.”

National Foreign Trade Council Vice President for International Tax Policy Anne Gordon: “We would like to once again thank Chairman Smith and the Ways & Means Committee and staff for their tireless work on this bill and Speaker Johnson and the leadership team for their efforts to bring critical U.S. tax legislation one step closer to becoming a reality. We congratulate the House on passing the One, Big, Beautiful Bill and urge the Senate to take up work on it as quickly as possible.”

American Land Title Association CEO Diane Tomb: “We commend the House for passing legislation that recognizes the needs of American small businesses, including the thousands of title and settlement companies ALTA represents. The expanded deduction under Section 199A is a welcome step that supports the long-term health of our small business members and the communities they serve. ALTA is especially pleased to see the preservation of Section 1031 like-kind exchanges, which play a vital role in fueling real estate investment, promoting property improvements and driving local economic growth. Provisions supporting homeownership, including those related to mortgage interest and capital gains exclusions, help provide certainty for buyers, sellers and lenders alike—strengthening the entire housing ecosystem. We urge the Senate to build on this momentum and protect the real estate and housing incentives that help Americans build wealth, promote generational stability and drive our economy forward.”

NRA Institute for Legislative Action Executive Director John Commerford: “This morning, the U.S. House of Representatives passed President Trump’s One, Big, Beautiful Bill, which includes the complete removal of suppressors from the National Firearms Act (NFA). This represents a monumental victory for Second Amendment rights, eliminating burdensome regulations on the purchase of critical hearing protection devices. The NRA thanks the House members who supported this bill and urges its swift passage in the U.S. Senate.”

RATE Coalition Executive Director Dan Combs: “Today’s vote is an historic step toward securing a tax code that rewards investment, supports job growth, and puts American workers first. This legislation builds on the success of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, preserving the policies that have helped drive wages up, unemployment down, and investment back into the U.S. economy. The House has done its part to move this forward. Now it’s time to keep that momentum going and get this across the finish line.”

Independent Women’s Center for Economic Opportunity Director Patrice Onwuka: “BOOM. Tax cuts, welfare reforms, green spending cuts, and border strengthening. Major credit is due to @SpeakerJohnson for getting @potus @realDonaldTrump #OneBigBeautifulBill through the House. He has proven to be a quiet force for conservatives. Now onto the Senate.”",https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WH47-Social-Share-Card.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 15:09:51.314350

The event showcased SPARK's achievements in fostering economic growth and innovation in Washtenaw County, while its keynote speaker discussed climate change's potential impact on the county's economy.

Kelly Sexton, SPARK's board chair and the University of Michigan's (U-M) associate vice president for research, innovation partnerships, and economic impact, reported on SPARK's impact in 2024.

""There's so much energy here,"" Sexton said. ""Congratulations to the SPARK team for pulling off this tremendous event that highlights the very best of SPARK's accomplishments, and also the energy and enthusiasm of our community, of our region, and of our state.""

Sexton presented key highlights for SPARK in 2024, underscoring the organization's central mission of helping early-stage tech companies succeed. In 2024 SPARK's entrepreneurial services team provided consulting and critical services to over 450 startups and supported more than 1,000 jobs. SPARK's entrepreneurial marketing team also engaged with and assisted 54 startups. Through SPARK Capital and the Michigan Angel Fund, over $59 million has been invested to date, helping Michigan startups raise more than $1.5 billion in follow-on funding.

""One of the most meaningful parts of our work is seeing how these efforts translate into real impact, helping our local businesses grow higher and contribute to a stronger regional economy,"" Sexton said.

Also spotlighted was the success of the SPARK East Innovation Center. The center's team supported 38 Ypsilanti-based startups through coaching, educational programming, and almost $200,000 in grant funding. They also assisted 480 youth through education and career initiatives. Sexton emphasized that SPARK wants to ensure that everyone can participate in entrepreneurship and innovation, with a focus on historically underserved individuals and communities.

The success of SPARK's Small Business Support Hub, launched in 2024, was also discussed. Created to assist a broader range of small businesses with resources tailored to their specific needs, the program was made possible by a $3.4 million, three-year grant from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation. A strong network of community organizations has also bolstered its success. So far, the program has helped 237 small businesses, more than 60% them women- and minority-owned. Sexton said the Small Business Support Hub helped launch 18 new businesses, supporting access to $185,000 in follow-on funding.

""We at SPARK are actively looking for a private-sector partner to continue success when the grant sunsets in 2026,"" Sexton said.

An awards presentation ceremony followed the economic update, honoring several outstanding community leaders and companies. Notably, the Project of the Year award was given to U-M and Los Alamos National Laboratory, which are collaborating to create a state-of-the-art facility in Ypsilanti Township by 2030. The project is expected to bring an estimated 200 new jobs with an average annual salary of $200,000.

Forum attendees also heard from keynote speaker Abrahm Lustgarten, an investigative journalist and author of ""On The Move."" His book explores how climate change and migration will transform the American landscape. Every event attendee received a copy of his book, and many stood in line to get them autographed following the forum.

""There's an enormous desire when I talk about this issue to give people some good news, and that's a little bit of a strain, because most of the news is bad news,"" Lustgarten says. ""The message I want to convey the most is that this is leading to economic transformation.""

He adds, ""I think people will appreciate climate change impacts on their lives when they start to be affected by it economically, and that is kind of inevitable.""

His book examines climate change-related threats – mainly wildfires, sea level rise, hurricanes, and extreme heat – and associated changes in agriculture and humidity. Lustgarten explores the resulting cost to the economy, communities, and lives.

""None of those threats are the main issues facing Michigan. You're relatively sheltered, although not totally, because no place on the planet will not be affected,"" he says. ""When people start moving and they look for a place to go that offers fewer threats, this is an attractive area. If you look at all the different ways of slicing the data, most of them suggest this is going to be a good place.""

As 2025 moves forward, SPARK will continue to encourage more people to join the A2 Green Business Challenge, which SPARK launched last May with the city of Ann Arbor's Office of Sustainability. Sexton reported to forum-goers that dozens of companies participated in the pilot year.

""The response has been incredibly positive,"" Sexton said. ""We're excited to grow this initiative as part of the broader push toward Ann Arbor's A2ZERO carbon neutrality goals, empowering more businesses to lead the way in building our greener future.""

In the months and weeks leading up the vote, dozens of House Republicans had joined letters and statements defending the credits.
That fact — and the number of clean energy projects poised for GOP districts — gave many in the clean energy industry confidence that Republicans would largely preserve clean energy credits.
But those House members ultimately supported the package on Thursday — increasing the stakes for Senate Republicans to make changes.
To some clean energy advocates, the House vote was a warning sign that support is not assured until the final vote.","The Senate, where Republicans can only afford to lose three votes, likely represents the final chance to pare back some of the changes, which industry groups have warned could undermine billions in investment and tens of thousands of jobs across the country.

The upper chamber is widely expected to moderate the House version. POLITICO spoke to five Senate Republicans who plan to consider changes to the House rollbacks, with one key Republican indicating Thursday the rollbacks go too far.

“We have a lot of work that we need to do on the timeline and scope of the production and investment tax credits,” said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), a member of the Finance Committee that has jurisdiction over the credits. “Undoubtedly, there’s going to be changes.”

Tillis is one of four GOP senators who urged party leadership in April against broadly gutting the credits, along with Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), John Curtis (R-Utah) and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.). All four signaled a willingness Thursday to take another look at the House bill — though they declined to outline specific changes they want to see.

“The House has spoken, and now the Senate will speak, and I’ve been pretty clear where I’m at,” Curtis said Thursday.

Murkowski said Senate Republicans are “obviously going to be looking at” the provisions added late Wednesday “as well as the final product, and kind of seeing where we start our conversation.”

Moran said he has “always been a supporter” of phasing out credits for wind and solar, but noted he needs to thoroughly evaluate the House bill “to see how acceptable [that is] or if that is too damaging.”

Republicans like Sens. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) had already balked at the deep cuts in an earlier draft of the legislation approved by the House Ways and Means Committee.

And Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, noted the technology-neutral clean electricity credits he helped write are “very popular with Republicans” in the upper chamber, especially because they support technologies like geothermal and nuclear.

“They got greedy, some of the sponsors [in the House], and now some of the Republican senators are saying, ‘We can’t go along with that,’” Wyden said.

In the months and weeks leading up the vote, dozens of House Republicans had joined letters and statements defending the credits. That fact — and the number of clean energy projects poised for GOP districts — gave many in the clean energy industry confidence that Republicans would largely preserve clean energy credits. But those House members ultimately supported the package on Thursday — increasing the stakes for Senate Republicans to make changes.

Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va.), one of the most outspoken defenders of the tax credits, said in a statement she voted for the bill because it delivers on other key GOP priorities, but she remains “deeply concerned” about rollbacks to the credits, especially the more aggressive cuts made just prior to the vote.

“As the bill moves to the Senate, I hope further changes will be made to protect the tax credits that are already creating jobs and providing energy for Virginia families,” Kiggans said.

Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.), who said late Wednesday he opposed the IRA changes made to appease conservatives, missed the vote but said he would have supported the package.

While the Senate is widely expected to moderate the IRA rollbacks, it will have to weigh them against other painful cuts and priorities for the megabill. To some clean energy advocates, the House vote was a warning sign that support is not assured until the final vote.

Chris Moyer, a former staffer for then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), said in a statement the vote was a “real wake up call for the clean energy industry that took too much solace in a few letters from House Republicans.”

“For many in the industry, it’s their first up-close experience with the strong tide for partisan politics that prevents party divisions on major votes like this one,” said Moyer, who is now president of Echo Communications Advisors. “This is a hard-learned lesson, and the only option left is to hope the Senate will show more backbone in fixing the House’s errors.”",https://static.politico.com/f3/bd/97c1012c4a26993b4a954a582279/u-s-congress-67490.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 12:22:56.597339

Renewable Energy Certificate now represent a $14 billion market, projected to hit $110 billion by 2032, helping reduce carbon emissions by billions of tons annually through verified clean energy usage”

— DataM Intelligence

AUSTIN, TX, UNITED STATES, May 23, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Renewable Energy Certificate Market reached US$ 14.12 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 112.70 billion by 2032, growing with a CAGR of 26.32% during the forecast period 2025-2032.

The surge in demand stems from multiple drivers, climate change concerns, stricter emission regulations, and a growing number of corporations striving for net-zero carbon emissions. RECs have become a fundamental tool in the sustainability playbook, allowing organizations to offset their carbon footprint and verify the use of clean electricity, even if they can't directly procure it.

As countries around the world work to scale up their renewable energy infrastructure, RECs offer a practical and scalable way to link consumer demand for green power with actual generation, regardless of location. This market mechanism supports the development of new renewable projects and offers transparency and accountability in renewable energy claims.

Latest News of USA

The U.S. REC market faces potential disruption due to recent legislative changes. A newly passed tax bill aims to accelerate the phase-out of renewable energy tax incentives. Key provisions include the elimination of residential rooftop solar tax credits by the end of the year and a gradual reduction in support for commercial projects through 2028.

This shift has rattled the solar industry, with several companies already seeing stock value declines. Industry leaders argue that the sudden rollback of support threatens thousands of clean energy jobs and weakens the country's progress toward its emissions targets.

However, others suggest that the change might push the market toward self-sufficiency and encourage alternative financing structures like corporate PPAs and REC-backed green energy programs. The bill’s impact is still unfolding and will depend on how the Senate modifies or enacts the legislation.

Latest News of Japan

Japan’s REC market is undergoing structural adjustments as well. In mid-2024, a number of trading members withdrew from the national REC exchange in response to changes in fee structures. While transaction-based fees were lowered, the fixed annual fees were significantly increased, making participation less attractive for smaller players.

In parallel, average REC prices in Japan remain low well below the cost needed to stimulate new clean energy development. As a result, project developers are shifting focus toward more predictable revenue models such as feed-in tariffs or premium programs.

Moreover, large corporations are starting to negotiate direct power purchase agreements and explore international RECs to meet sustainability commitments. This evolution signals a maturing market that is testing new mechanisms to support growth, despite price pressures and participation challenges.

Market Segmentation:

By Type: Compliance RECs, Voluntary RECs

By Energy Source: Solar RECs, Hydro RECs, Wind RECs, Others

By End-User: Industrial, Commercial, Residential, Governmental

By Region: South America, North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific

Regional Outlook

North America

In North America, the REC market is supported by a robust regulatory environment, progressive state-level programs, and growing voluntary corporate demand. The U.S. especially has seen a massive shift toward renewables, with many Fortune 500 companies adopting RECs to meet sustainability goals. Programs like Green-e and state Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) have played pivotal roles in shaping the market.

Europe

Europe continues to be a frontrunner in renewable energy adoption. With aggressive climate goals and a mature emissions trading infrastructure, the region's demand for RECs is deeply integrated into both compliance and voluntary markets. Nations like Germany, the UK, and Scandinavian countries are advancing renewable projects at a rapid pace, and RECs serve as a reliable metric for measuring renewable energy usage across borders.

Asia-Pacific

The Asia-Pacific region is rapidly establishing itself as a dominant force in the REC space. The region is undergoing a rapid energy transition, particularly in countries like China, Japan, India, and Australia. As governments introduce national-level REC schemes and large corporations sign renewable purchase agreements, the REC market in this region is expected to grow at the fastest rate globally. The demand is being propelled by both public sector commitments and private sector investments in renewable infrastructure.

Conclusion

The Renewable Energy Certificate market stands at the crossroads of sustainability and economic opportunity. As governments tighten emissions regulations and businesses step up their environmental commitments, RECs have become a key currency in the global energy transition.While policy shifts in the U.S. and structural changes in Japan highlight the complexities and regional variations within this market, the overall trajectory remains strongly positive. New technologies, expanding voluntary markets, and heightened climate awareness are all fueling the REC market’s rise.

Urban farms can be anchors of community resiliency, supporting food availability, economic opportunities, and educational activities, too. Now, the City of Detroit has embarked on a plan to add clean power to the list of benefits. The Solar Neighborhoods program incorporates agrivoltaics, enabling the city move forward with decarbonization goals for municipal operations. Partners in the project already anticipate that it will provide a model for similar programs in cities across the US.

Agrivoltaics, Community Solar, And Urban Farming

Agrivoltaics has been gaining traction as a rural movement that enables farmers to lease their land for solar arrays while continuing to use the land. Much of the practice currently involves livestock grazing, establishing pollinator habitats, and restoring native species.

Researchers have also compiled evidence that certain food crops can grow within appropriately designed solar arrays. New data-driven tools are enabling farmers to assess the balance between solar energy and crop revenues, too (see more solar-plus-farming background here).

The agrivoltaic movement has been expanding in parallel with the community solar trend, which enables local ratepayers to subscribe to solar arrays in or near their neighborhood. Ratepayers can save money on their electricity bills by subscribing to a community solar plan.

It was only a matter of time before community solar stakeholders began to embrace agrivoltaics as a means of providing additional benefits to local residents and businesses — for example, by providing free use of the land for “solar grazing.”

From there, the next step is to incorporate agrivoltaics into urban farms and gardens, and some cities have ample room for both. In Detroit, for example, resiliency and cost-saving goals support the idea of replacing blocks of vacant homes and other derelict properties with solar arrays.

The Detroit Agrivoltaics Plan

Detroit’s “Solar Neighborhood” agrivoltaics program is the result of considerable community input. The initiative aims to generate enough solar electricity on city property to power 127 municipal buildings.

On the crop-raising side, planners note that solar arrays can benefit farmers by reducing evaporatoin from the soil and conserving water. They also cite protection from frost as an additional agricultural benefit.

In 2023, three neighborhoods — Gratiot/Findlay, Van Dyke/Lynch, and State Fair — were selected to participate. Combined, the three neighborhoods will contribute 104 acres of solar arrays to the Solar Neighborhood program.

In addition to participating in site selection, neighborhood organizations held the right to approve the final design for their solar arrays. Each represents a different type of agrivoltaic solution, as described by the mayor’s office:

Gratiot/Findlay will use a combination of decorative fencing, evergreen and ornamental trees along with perennial plantings as a buffer. Residents chose to include agrivoltaics within the solar array.

Van Dyke/Lynch also will incorporate decorative fencing and a mix of evergreen and ornamental trees as a buffer, as well as perennial gardens and raised beds at key points. Within the solar array, residents chose to have a manicured meadow of wildflowers and other plants.

State Fair will incorporate numerous perennial planting areas, along with evergreen and ornamental trees outside a decorative fence as a buffer. Inside the solar array will be a perimeter of manicured meadows surrounding a core of agrivoltaics.

The solar developer Lightstar Renewables was awarded a contract for the Gratiot/Findlay and State Fair solar arrays, comprising a total of 61 acres. The Michigan utility DTE Electric Company will construct the 43-acre Van Dyke/Lynch array.

Community Engagement And Agrivoltaics

In a press release last year, LightStar described its vision for two Solar Neighborhood sites under its agrivoltaics umbrella. “Potential crops such as lettuce, kale, carrots, and a variety of berries are anticipated to thrive alongside solar panels,” the company enthused.

Lightstar also noted that the Solar Neighborhood program includes energy efficiency upgrades for eligible homeowners in each neighborhood. The company plans to revisit the owners regularly to solicit feedback for future progress.

The community engagement angle is becoming an especially important one for large-scale solar developers. The wave of opposition to rural solar projects has been linked to the circulation of misinformation on social media, but some developers report that laying a firm groundwork for community outreach can overcome that obstacle.

Projects that incorporate agrivoltaics can also attract more community support, but Lightstar indicates that developers are best served when they tailor their solar-plus-farming projects to the community. For the Solar Neighborhood program, Lightstar — which is headquartered in Boston — embarked on its community engagement efforts in partnership with the Detroit urban planning firm JIMA Studio. “With its trailblazing work in landscape architecture and urban planning, JIMA Studio offers a unique approach that centers on the needs and aspirations of Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities in Detroit,” Lightstar noted.

Just The Beginning For Farms In Cities

Cities held firm on global decarbonization and sustainable urban planning during President Trump’s first term in office, and the Solar Neighborhoods initiative demonstrates that cities can still lead the way during his next term, too. Earlier this week, Lightstar celebrated its participation in Phase 2 of the Solar Neighborhoods initiative.

“Building on the success of Phase 1, which brought solar fields to three neighborhoods, Phase 2 introduces 61 acres of solar infrastructure in the Houston-Whittier/Hayes and Greenfield Park neighborhoods,” Lightstar announced, noting that the two new projects bring the total Solar Neighborhoods acreage to 165.

All together, more than 106 local homeowners are now included in the energy efficiency upgrade part of the initiative, each qualifying for at least $15,000 worth of improvements. In this week’s announcement, Lightstar also noted that the Solar Neighborhoods initiative includes stipends and training to support local farmers.

“This achievement is only the beginning,” the company emphasized. “With Phase 2 Solar Neighborhoods underway, Detroit is proving that renewable energy can go hand-in-hand with neighborhood empowerment and economic growth.”

The Solar Neighborhoods initiative provides an interesting complement to the commercial urban farming trend, consisting of vertical farms and other infrastructure-dependent operations. Despite some potential hiccups involving energy use and other costs. some analysts expect the urban farming industry to grow rapidly in the coming years.

In a 2023 global market report, for example, the firm Contrive Datum Insights noted that urban farms are “likely to make more money because more people are learning about nutrition, health, education, and food security and using better ways to make things.” The firm also cited advanced agriculture strategies, among additional factors, along with the demand for fresh, high-quality foods in cities.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/agrivoltaics-dte-detroite-solar-neighborhoods.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 12:23:29.844111

Continuing to invest in American-made renewable energy production is the only way we can meet increasing energy demand and avoid skyrocketing energy bills for everybody.
Join us in asking Sen. Murkowski to work with Senate leadership to protect Alaska renewable energy projects and the jobs that come along with it.","As a 50-year member and leader of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 1547, a union representing over 4,000 workers in Alaska, I know firsthand that it takes diverse sources of energy including renewable to keep electricity and heating prices affordable and the electrical grid resilient. Certain federal tax credits make renewable energy projects more economical to build and right now we need Sen. Lisa Murkowski’s help restoring tax credits and other renewable energy provisions that were just eliminated by the U.S. House of Representatives.

Trained IBEW professionals help build Alaska’s major infrastructure projects like oil and gas lines, electrical generation plants, transmission line upgrades and electrical grid interties. In addition, we build and maintain wind turbines, solar arrays, hydroelectric dams, and other renewable energy sources that keep power more affordable for all while providing good-paying careers for Alaskans.

As of 2024, decades of federal investment have resulted in approximately 30% of Alaska’s total energy generation coming from renewable sources. This is slated to increase as our transmission lines are upgraded and more renewable energy projects completed. However, the recently passed House budget reconciliation bill basically repeals tax credits that support future renewable energy investments and puts important projects and these jobs at risk.

Sen. Murkowski has always supported Alaska’s energy development including renewable projects and we applaud her for that. Most recently, on April 9, Sen. Murkowski joined three other Republican senators in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Thune, in support of the renewable energy tax credits that have brought direct benefits to so many parts of the country.

“While we support fiscal responsibility and prudent efforts to streamline the tax code, we caution against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,” they wrote in their letter.

Sen. Murkowski is correct in her public statements that renewable energy tax credits are key for developers to invest in large-scale projects such as data centers, electrical grid modernization and others. Federal tax credits help defray the prohibitive cost on the front end of the projects when it matters most. Without that money, renewable projects that we have workers already trained for and ready to build will be delayed for years.

Continuing to invest in American-made renewable energy production is the only way we can meet increasing energy demand and avoid skyrocketing energy bills for everybody.

Unfortunately, the budget bill passed May 21 by the U.S. House of Representatives bill will implement unreasonable phase-outs, impossible red tape and restrictions and outright termination of tax credits for renewable energy that together make the tax credits completely unworkable. It also repealed home energy tax credits, which have helped Alaskans afford the upfront costs of things like energy efficient heat pumps that can provide huge utility bill savings.

At a time when Alaskans are worried about increased costs of energy, housing, and groceries, it is disappointing that the House of Representatives would take action that leads directly to higher energy costs and cuts good-paying jobs.

Now that legislation is headed to the U.S. Senate, however, there is an opportunity for Sen. Murkowski to help fix it for Alaska. Join us in asking Sen. Murkowski to work with Senate leadership to protect Alaska renewable energy projects and the jobs that come along with it. Our affordable energy future depends on it.

GOP senators are calling for a rewrite of the bill to address concerns ranging from Medicaid reforms and the phaseout of clean energy incentives to the sale of government-owned spectrum bands and the bill’s projected impact on the federal debt.

The deal Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) struck with Republicans from blue states to raise the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions from $10,000 to $40,000 is also a sticking point with Republican senators.

The biggest obstacle may be the threatened opposition from Senate conservatives who say the bill doesn’t do nearly enough to cut future deficits, which are projected to exceed $2 trillion annually for the next two years.

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul (R) immediately announced his opposition to the House-passed bill Thursday, vowing to vote against it unless Senate Republican leaders remove a provision to raise the federal debt limit by $4 trillion over the next two years.

“We’ve never, ever voted to raise the debt ceiling this much. It’ll be a historic increase. I think it’s not good for conservatives to be on the record supporting a $4 trillion or $5 trillion increase in the debt ceiling,” he said.

“The anticipated deficits per year now will be $2 trillion a year for the next two years,” he added. “It’s not conservative; I can’t support it.”

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), an outspoken fiscal hawk, said Thursday that there are four Senate Republican conservatives who will vote against the House bill as currently drafted, which would be enough to sink the bill if there is full attendance.

“There should be a goal of this Republican Senate budget resolution to reduce the deficit, not increase it. We’re increasing it. It’s a nonstarter from my standpoint,” he said.

Johnson said he’s “absolutely” a no on the House bill as “currently constructed.”

“I actually want to reduce the deficit,” he said.

The Congressional Budget Office projects the bill will add another $3.8 trillion to the debt, but Johnson thinks that number is likely to be closer to $4 trillion.

When asked how many Republican senators would refuse to advance the House bill without deeper spending cuts, Johnson said: “I think I’ve got at least four right now that this is not going anywhere.”

“Three in addition to myself. We’ve got the four we need,” he said.

Fiscal conservatives in the House also threatened to vote against Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” unless GOP leaders agreed to include bigger spending cuts in the package, but several of them folded after Trump met with them earlier this week and told them bluntly: “Don’t f‑‑‑ around with Medicaid.”

Just two House Republicans voted against the bill, Reps. Thomas Massie (Ky.) and Warren Davidson (Ohio), while House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris (R-Md.) voted “present.”

A group of Senate Republicans concerned about Medicaid reforms pose another major obstacle to the bill. This group includes Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.).

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) has begun meeting one-on-one and in small groups with some of these senators to listen to their concerns about the impact of the House reforms on constituents and rural hospitals.

These lawmakers are primarily concerned about reforms intended to crack down on states’ use of health care provider taxes to receive more federal Medicaid funding and a proposal to require more cost sharing for adults who earn between 100 percent and 138 percent of the federal poverty level.

Asked about the health care provider tax reforms and expanded cost sharing, Collins said: “We’re still trying to figure out what the provider tax reforms are but I’m very worried about our rural hospitals in Maine.”

Hawley flagged health care provider tax reform and cost-sharing reform as two problems earlier this month.

He said the “cost-sharing proposal” would make “beneficiaries pay more.”

“These are working people in particular who are going to have to pay more,” he said.

Hawley this week advised colleagues to listen to Trump’s reported instruction to GOP lawmakers to “leave Medicaid alone.”

Another point of friction are the proposals in the House bill to phase out clean energy incentives enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act, which could wipe out billions of dollars of investment in Republican states.

Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), John Curtis (R-Utah), Murkowski and Moran wrote a letter to Senate Thune last month to “emphasize the importance of maintaining a stable and predictable tax framework to promote domestic energy development.”

“We caution against the full-sale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,” they warned.

Tillis said Thursday that the House bill would need to be changed to avoid stranding billions of dollars of private-sector investment in clean energy projects.

“If millions or billions of dollars have been deployed, we’ve got to give those businesses some offramp,” he said.

He said suddenly cutting off renewable energy subsidies would “have the same sort of effect” as what the oil industry suffered when former President Biden “just arbitrarily canceled the [Keystone] XL pipeline” in 2021.

Some Senate Republicans are also balking at Speaker Johnson’s deal with Republicans from New York, New Jersey and other high-tax state to raise the SALT cap from $10,000 to $40,000.

The higher limit on those deductions would phase out at annual incomes above $500,000.

“The SALT thing is going to come up. It’s going to be an issue,” Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) said.

Thune acknowledged Thursday that the language to lift the SALT cap will be one of many provisions Senate GOP colleagues will seek to change.

“Our members want to be heard on it, and I assume we’ll have something to say,” Thune remarked on the SALT deal.

Thune says Senate Republicans will rewrite parts of the House bill, but he noted Speaker Johnson warned GOP senators in a meeting Tuesday that they risked scrambling the coalition he put together in the House Republican Conference to pass the bill.

Some Republican senators are digging in their heels to oppose lower-profile provisions in the House bill, such as a plan to auction off government-owned spectrum that is currently used by the Pentagon.

Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) says the House provision poses a major national security risk.

“It has to be taken out or modified,” Rounds said of that House language on spectrum. “That, to me, is of critical national importance.”

Rounds, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said House negotiators “extended the [spectrum] auction authority until 2034” but only protected the military portions of the spectrum in the first auction sale.

“If they’re going to have auction authority until 2034, the [Department of Defense] portions and the [intelligence community] portions have got to be protected during the time this auction authority exists,” he said.

“It outweighs everything else in the bill,” he said.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/thunejohn_052025gn05_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-05-23 14:14:48.149400

The U.S. Senate voted early Thursday to prevent California from enforcing regulations on tailpipe emission from new cars and trucks, upending state regulations for the nearly 40% of Americans whose states follow California standards.

The House has already passed an identical measure, meaning the Senate vote sends the resolution to President Donald Trump’s desk.

The 51-46 vote, with Michigan Democrat Elissa Slotkin joining all Republicans present to vote in favor, cleared a Congressional Review Act resolution repealing Environmental Protection Agency waivers that allow California to set regulations for emissions from cars and light-duty trucks.

The state policy includes a ramp-up to having no new gas-powered cars sold in the state by 2035.

Democrats blasted the near-party-line vote for contradicting the Senate parliamentarian, who’d ruled the waiver that the EPA had granted to California to set its own tailpipe standards was not a regulation that could be rolled back under the Congressional Review Act, or CRA.

The CRA allows for a simple majority in the Senate to vote to repeal recent executive branch rules, bypassing the chamber’s usual 60-vote threshold for legislation.

‘Chaos and uncertainty’ around the U.S.

The EPA under President Joe Biden issued waivers under a Clean Air Act provision that allows California, which had more stringent standards than what Congress enacted in the 1970 law, to set its own standards for air pollution.

No other state is allowed to set independent standards, but any state may adopt California’s.

For the light-duty vehicle emissions rule, 17 other states — Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington — and the District of Columbia adopted some portion of the standard.

The action by the Senate, particularly because of the mechanism for revoking the waiver, made the future of the standards in all those states uncertain, Justin Balik, vice president for states at the national environmental advocacy group Evergreen Action, said in a Thursday interview.

“What, fundamentally, they’re doing is sowing a huge amount of chaos and uncertainty in states around the country, not just in California,” he said of the senators.

Slotkin, who voted against procedural measures before her vote in favor of the resolution itself, said her vote was in defense of her state’s automotive industry. Slotkin campaigned on a promise not to allow an electric vehicle mandate.

“Today, I voted to prevent California and the states that follow its standard from effectively banning gas-powered cars by 2035,” she wrote in a statement. “I have a special responsibility to stand up for the more than one million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry.”

Debate over choice

Critics said the state regulation was effectively an electric vehicle mandate that robbed consumers of the option to purchase the vehicle of their choice.

Because of California’s market share — the state accounts for 11% of cars and trucks sold in the country, according to the California Air Resources Board — and adoption by other states, the Golden State standard had a virtually nationwide effect, they argued.

Republicans in the Senate focused on the 2035 deadline to end sales of new gas-powered vehicles, describing it as an electric vehicle mandate.

In a video posted to social media, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican, John Barrasso of Wyoming, stood next to Shelley Moore Capito, the West Virginia Republican chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and touted the vote as a victory for consumer choice.

“Republicans have defeated Democrats’ delusional dream of forcing every American to drive an electric vehicle,” Barrasso said. “They wanted to force-feed the entire country things that don’t necessarily work, not practical.”

But proponents of the California standards said the Senate was removing choice from state policymakers, despite Republicans’ longtime advocacy for state and local control.

Manish Bapna, the president of the advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council, blasted the move in a statement that said senators undermined state power.

“This vote is an unprecedented and reckless attack on states’ legal authority to address the pollution causing asthma, lung disease and heart conditions,” Bapna said. “After a multi-million dollar lobbying campaign from Big Oil, Republicans readily jettisoned their long-held view that states can best enact measures that reflect the values and interests of their residents.

“If other states don’t like California’s approach, they don’t need to follow it,” the statement continued. “But federal lawmakers shouldn’t be intervening to block states from providing cleaner air and a healthier environment.”

Procedural fight

Republicans’ use of the Congressional Review Act provoked a backlash from Democrats and environmental allies, who described it as “going nuclear” to tank the chamber’s filibuster rule.

The Senate parliamentarian and the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office said the waiver could not be repealed with a CRA resolution, but Senate Republicans opted to use the procedure anyway.

“Senate Republicans exposed themselves as fair weather institutionalists. By overriding the parliamentarian — which the chair explicitly noted that the parliamentarian has been overridden — and in order to do the bidding of the fossil fuel industry, Republicans have eroded away at the Senate foundation and undermined this institution they claim to care about,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said after a procedural vote late Wednesday.

Republicans defended the move, saying they were responding to an unprecedented case in the chamber. The question of how Senate rules applied to the waiver should be decided by senators themselves, Majority Leader John Thune said.

“I believe that when the Senate is facing a novel situation like this one, with disagreement among its members, it is appropriate for the Senate to speak as a body to the question – something the Senate does when questions over application of the rules arise,” he said in a floor speech.

Thune, of South Dakota, noted that the Senate resolved a rules question with a floor vote just last year after a Democrat raised a point of order against a Republican’s attempt to fast-track a measure.

“Nobody at the time cried nuclear, nobody said the Democrat member was blowing up the Senate – in fact, most members probably don’t even remember the situation, because it was just the Senate doing what the Senate is supposed to do, and that’s voting on how to apply the rules when faced with a new situation.”

Uncertainty abounds

Critics of the move attacked the process, the policy and the precedent, saying the Senate undid a half-century of a California-federal government relationship regarding the Clean Air Act that had served all parties well.

John Boesel, the president and CEO of clean transportation industry group CALSTART, called the Senate action radical.

“This vote upends decades of policy that has successfully resulted in cleaner air and the growth of a robust clean transportation industry,” he said in a statement. “It is a brazen, yet futile, attempt to bring the clean transportation industry to a sudden halt. CALSTART will continue to partner with the states working to fill this gaping void left by today’s federal action.”

And the unusual use of the Congressional Review Act will likely lead to lawsuits from California and at least some of the states that follow it to “protect their authority,” Balik, of Evergreen Action, said.

“But that’s going to take some time to play out,” he said. “In the meantime, the whole marketplace has been plunged into unnecessary chaos. Part of what the industry always says is, ‘We need certainty.’ And if anything, right now, we have the exact opposite thanks to what Congress is doing.”",https://oregoncapitalinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2025/05/52119227072_8e0b909a14_o-1536x864-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 12:23:17.275255

“President Trump and Secretary Wright have made it clear: expanding America's nuclear energy capacity will be essential for meeting growing demand for affordable, reliable and secure energy,"" said Department of Energy Acting Undersecretary for Infrastructure Michael Goff.","Energy Northwest and the Bonneville Power Administration said that BPA on May 20 approved implementation of an Extended Power Uprate project that increases the output of Columbia Generating Station, which is the Pacific Northwest’s third largest generating resource and only operating nuclear energy plant.

The EPU is an approximately $700 million project that will increase the station's electrical output by 162 megawatts by 2031.

Following 18 months of in-depth analysis, BPA's approval allows the project to move into its next phase.

Over the next six years, Energy Northwest and BPA will collaborate on planning and implementation. Once completed, the additional 162 megawatts of firm capacity could power approximately 125,000 homes, strengthening the Pacific Northwest's energy portfolio.

Columbia Generating Station, a 1,207-megawatt nuclear energy facility near Richland, Washington, is owned and operated by Energy Northwest.

The EPU will increase electrical output by upgrading and replacing equipment — including turbines, heat exchangers, and the generator — while maintaining high safety standards and improving reliability. Nuclear energy facilities have successfully implemented uprates since the 1970s to boost clean energy generation from existing plants.

The project will involve approximately 30 individual upgrades, primarily focused on increasing the size of pumps and motors. These enhancements coincide with biennial refueling outages, creating new job opportunities for skilled workers.

Additionally, 24 megawatts of energy-efficiency upgrades will be incorporated during the next three refueling outages in 2027, 2029 and 2031, bringing the total increase to 186 megawatts. This expanded capacity will be added to BPA's federal system power, serving consumer-owned utilities across six Northwest states.

The EPU project marks a significant milestone in the ongoing partnership between Energy Northwest and BPA, showcasing their shared commitment to advancing reliable energy solutions, they said.

By increasing the capacity of Columbia Generating Station, they are enhancing the reliability of the region's power supply and contributing to a sustainable future. The combined efforts of both organizations will ensure that the Pacific Northwest continues to benefit from affordable and secure electricity, supporting the needs of regional customers.

“We applaud BPA for its decision to approve this project and for its strategic vision in advancing our region's future with additional, reliable capacity that nuclear energy can provide,"" said Bob Schuetz, Energy Northwest, CEO. ""Their leadership in supporting this initiative underscores a commitment to affordable and carbon-free electricity for the Northwest region, including our public power member utilities and their customers.""

“This is a great value for ratepayers in the Pacific Northwest,"" said BPA Administrator and CEO John Hairston. “Upgrading an existing resource to provide additional reliable energy will help BPA keep pace with its customers growing electricity needs and keep rates low.""

“This bill assaults those seeking the ‘American dream’ by stealing tax benefits and services from working people who are paying taxes.","It’s more than 1,000 pages, and, as it stands now, the recently House-passed bill with massive tax breaks and spending cuts has significant implications for California voters.

The House of Representatives early Thursday morning — after last-minute dealmaking by leadership — very narrowly passed what’s been dubbed the “Big, Beautiful Bill” that advances President Donald Trump’s agenda.

No Democrats voted for the bill, and only two Republicans broke to vote no: Reps. Warren Davidson of Ohio and Thomas Massie of Kentucky. That means California lawmakers split along party lines in the 215-214 vote.

The massive package is a continuation of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions spearheaded during the first Trump administration. But it also makes vast changes to Medicaid — instituting a work requirement for recipients of the health insurance program for low-income people — and ups the cap on how much of a deduction taxpayers can claim to offset high state and local tax obligations.

“This bill represents an historic opportunity to deliver economic freedom for working families, farmers and small businesses,” said Rep. Jason Smith, a Missouri Republican who chairs the Ways and Means Committee, instrumental in putting together the budget bill.

Smith’s office said the average California taxpayer would see a 20% tax hike if those provisions from 2017 were not continued.

Yet, Democrats warn the package would be detrimental to working-class and lower-income families. Rep. Dave Min, D-Irvine, called it “the most immoral budget of our time” after the vote, and Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, D-Los Angeles, called it the “Big Backstabbing Bill.”

Still, everything in the House-passed package isn’t set in stone. It still needs to go through the U.S. Senate — where there have been rumblings of concerns among some GOP members about Medicaid cuts.

For now, here’s a look at what the spending package could mean for Californians, from changes to certain credits to health care implications and more.

SALT cap increases

Perhaps one of the most closely watched “will they, won’t they” provisions of the spending bill was the cap on how much taxpayers can deduct on their federal taxes to offset high local and state taxes, called SALT.

Republicans from high-tax states, including California, were at loggerheads with House leadership for much of the negotiations, outright promising to vote no on the bill unless the cap — levied in 2017 at $10,000 — was significantly increased.

But a late-in-the-game proposal got those Republicans, including Rep. Young Kim, R-Anaheim Hills, on board.

The bill ups the cap to $40,000 for people with incomes up to $500,000 and is adjusted 1% for inflation annually.

When the cap was placed on SALT in 2017, there was no one in Congress who could explain how it would adversely affect those who live in states with high costs of living — California, New Jersey and New York — said Kim. She said she made the case to House leadership and other colleagues that even though the cap may seem high for their districts, in hers, it would benefit middle-income families, like firefighters and teachers.

“To put it simply, I needed to keep my promise, and that’s why it was so important to me to not cave in and continue to fight for what will bring the most help and relief for my district,” Kim said after Thursday’s vote. “I’m really happy I was able to deliver for my constituents so they can keep more of their hard-earned money.”

Medicaid work requirements

Included in the bill is one of the strictest Medicaid work requirements proposed by Congress. Called “community engagement requirements,” the bill mandates that able-bodied adults without dependents work, complete community service or participate in a work program for at least 80 hours a month or be enrolled in an educational program.

Those who are under 19 years old, pregnant or receiving postpartum medical care are exempt from the work requirements.

The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan entity that provides analysis for Congress, estimated the work requirements would reduce federal spending by $280 billion over a decade. But it also found that the number of people with health care would be reduced by about 8.6 million.

Health policy research nonprofit KFF estimated, based on an early draft of the bill, that California could see between 1.2 million and 2 million in enrollment losses to Medi-Cal, California’s Medicaid program.

Democrats have strongly decried the Medicaid changes, including Rep. Mike Levin, D-San Juan Capistrano, who called the work requirements “harsh.”

“President Trump and Speaker Johnson are once again putting billionaire donors ahead of everyday Americans — at the direct expense of children, seniors, veterans and working families,” said Levin.

But Kim called those arguments “disingenuous,” saying the changes to Medicaid will ultimately strengthen the program for those who need it the most.

Aside from work requirements, she also pointed to the bill’s plan to end duplicative payments to patients who sign up for Medicaid in multiple states and attempt to limit the program only to citizens or those with legal status.

Gov. Gavin Newsom recently proposed rolling back access to Medi-Cal for low-income immigrants without legal status — a year after they were granted such. Newsom recently suggested no longer accepting new enrollees without legal status into the program as a way to alleviate the state’s budget woes.

The federal bill also blocks Medicaid funds for Planned Parenthood, which provides abortion services along with other health care needs. Federal money already cannot pay for abortion services, but state Medicaid funds in some states, including California, do.

Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties said the cuts would “be devastating to the hundreds of thousands of low-income Californians who rely on Planned Parenthood for life-saving cancer screening, birth control, STI testing and treatment, and other vital health care services.”

“If Planned Parenthood is ‘defunded,’ then cancers would go undetected, STIs go untreated, birth control would be harder to get and the public health infrastructure of communities will break down,” said Nichole Ramirez, senior vice president of communications and donor relations at PPOSBC.

According to the Associated Press, some 200 Planned Parenthood centers are at risk of closing should the cuts remain. But Ramirez said there are no plans at the moment to close any PPOSBC local health centers.

Estate tax exemption continues

The bill increases the estate tax exemption threshold to $15 million in 2026, adjusted for inflation thereafter.

Called the “death tax” by Republicans, this is the amount of an estate that would trigger a federal tax when the property is transferred upon a death. It generally impacts the wealthiest of estates, but Republicans have said it has also burdened family farms that are often struggling.

Savings accounts for new parents

Parents or guardians who open new so-called “Trump” savings accounts for their kids with birthdates between Jan. 1, 2024, and Dec. 31, 2028, will receive $1,000 from the federal government to put into the account. Families can deposit up to $5,000 a year into the tax-deferred account.

At age 18, the account holder may access up to half of the money in the account to pay for higher education, training or first-time home purchases. The account holder would then have access to the rest of the money when they reach age 30.

This bill was initially called the “MAGA” accounts — a play on Trump’s “Make America Great Again” motto that stood for “Money Account for Growth and Advancement” — but was changed in a Wednesday amendment to the “Trump” accounts.

States on the hook more for SNAP

Federal food aid through the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program would decrease by about $267 billion over a decade.

Currently, the federal government pays all the benefits, and states chip in half for administrative costs. But under the bill, states would be responsible for 5% of benefit costs, starting in fiscal year 2028, and 75% of administrative costs.

SNAP eligibility would also change, requiring able-bodied adults without dependents to log 80 hours of work or “community engagement” per month until age 64 — 10 years longer than under current rules.

In addition, parents who are now exempt from work requirements until their children are 18 may be affected: Proposed changes call for exempting only those caring for a dependent child under age 7.

According to the California Budget & Policy Center, changes to SNAP could force California to reduce the amount of food aid going to individual recipients or reduce the number of recipients.

“Regardless of the magnitude of the cost-sharing proposal, Californians who rely on CalFresh to afford basic food needs are at risk of facing reduced benefits or exclusion from the program entirely, which could lead to increased food insecurity and poverty at a time when so many Californians are already struggling with the high costs of living,” the center said in a report last month.

Energy tax credits phase out

Several clean energy tax credits are set to end earlier than expected under the current version of this bill. That includes the termination of credits related to energy-efficient homes, clean electricity production and electric vehicles and phasing out a credit for wind and solar storage.

Many of the energy tax credits had been around for decades and were expanded during the Biden administration, according to CNBC.

The bill “endangers our clean air and water, will devastate our growing economy and the jobs that are powering it, and open up our nation’s precious lands and waters to even more reckless oil and gas drilling,” said Kim Orbe, the acting director of the Sierra Club Angeles chapter, which covers Los Angeles and Orange counties.

Child tax credit increases and adds requirement

The child tax credit, which doubled from $1,000 to $2,000 during Trump’s first administration, would remain — and even increase temporarily to $2,500 through 2028 before dropping back down to $2,000, though it would then be adjusted to reflect inflation.

Smith, the chair of the Ways and Means Committee, said the bill locks in the child tax credit for more than 40 million families and will provide additional tax relief.

But some Democrats warned that rule changes would negatively impact the families of millions of children.

Under the House bill, a parent or both parents, if filing taxes jointly, would need to have a Social Security number to claim the credit — a new requirement targeting undocumented immigrants.

“This bill assaults those seeking the ‘American dream’ by stealing tax benefits and services from working people who are paying taxes. It would deny the child (tax) credit to 2 million children who live in the United States,” Rep. Linda Sánchez, D-Whittier, said on the House floor earlier this week.

That's the process of adding electric power, in some form, to personal transportation. It can mean fully-electric cars; it also means hybrids. Both are useful tools for reducing gas consumption and carbon emissions across the board, although the former is certainly the best at this. And even if some people feel like they aren't ready to go fully-electric yet, they're increasingly open to hybrid power.

I bring this up to say that the new, all-hybrid 2026 Toyota RAV4 is in a good position here. On this week's episode of the Plugged-In Podcast, my co-host Tim Levin and I discuss why this car matters and how it may get more people into electrified cars than just about any before it (save for perhaps the Tesla Model Y.)

If top-selling cars like the RAV4 go battery-powered (at least partially), it's proof that you can't really stop the electrified car revolution. But in the United States, the Trump administration and a supportive Congress are doing their best to slam the brakes on the entire EV market.

The thing we've been talking about for months has finally happened: the U.S. House of Representatives' version of Trump's omnibus spending bill does, in fact, get rid of EV tax credits and manufacturing incentives. It also makes EVs more expensive to own via new federal taxes. It's got a long way to go until signing, but we're not expecting the Senate or Trump himself to do much to save the pro-EV policies that were driving job growth and a market more competitive with China.

Sales - The New York Times,"Jack Ewing, www.nytimes.com, jack-ewing",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/business/electric-vehicles-house-tax-bill.html,"And it would impose a new annual fee on owners of electric cars and trucks.
The legislation also imposes a $250 annual fee on owners of electric vehicles to compensate for lost revenue from gasoline taxes.
Instead of 40 percent of new car sales in 2030, electric vehicles would account for 24 percent, he estimated.
Lower sales would mean fewer Americans employed in the production of electric vehicles, batteries and charging equipment.
The factory will produce batteries that are significantly less expensive than other batteries made in the United States.","A tax and policy bill passed by House Republicans on Thursday would deal a serious blow to electric vehicles by repealing many of the subsidies that have been critical to the growth of the technology.

If passed by the Senate and signed into law by President Trump, the bill would sharply slow the sales and production of battery-powered cars and trucks in the United States and set back the global effort to address climate change.

The measure would gut subsidies for battery manufacturing, incentives for purchases of electric vehicles by individuals and businesses, and money for charging stations that Congress passed during the Biden administration. And it would impose a new annual fee on owners of electric cars and trucks.

Republican leaders have said the subsidies they want to repeal were ill conceived and largely benefited affluent car buyers. They aim to use the money the government saves on the incentives to cut taxes, primarily for high-income households and businesses.

Electric vehicles will not disappear from dealerships if the bill becomes law, analysts said, but they are likely to become a lot more expensive than they would have otherwise been. Some automakers may decide to delay plans for new car and battery factories.

The rollback of sales incentives will leave the United States even further behind China and Europe, where electric vehicles make up a larger percentage of new car sales and are growing much faster. Most auto executives believe that electric vehicles will eventually displace cars with internal combustion engines.

“In the long term we’ll get there,” said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds.com. “It feels like the next decade is going to be bumpy.”

Elimination of the subsidies, especially a $7,500 tax credit for the purchase or lease of electric cars and trucks that would end at the end of the year for most models, would effectively raise prices for car buyers. Such cars already cost thousands more than gasoline models. The price increases would come on top of those caused by Mr. Trump’s 25 percent tariffs on imported cars and auto parts.

The legislation also imposes a $250 annual fee on owners of electric vehicles to compensate for lost revenue from gasoline taxes. But the fee is more than double the average yearly fuel taxes that owners of conventional vehicles pay.

The Republican legislation would also lead to higher emissions of greenhouse gases and dirtier urban air, environmentalists say.

“We will not realize the energy efficiency and health benefits as fast as we could and as fast as other countries are realizing them,” said Eleftheria Kontou, an assistant professor at the University of Illinois who studies electric vehicle demand.

Technology and Sales

Cutting off the funding could handicap the United States’ chances of competing in electric vehicle technology with its main geopolitical rival. One of the main goals of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the Democratic legislation that Republicans are trying to repeal, was to help finance factories in the United States that could compete with China, which dominates the supply chain for electric vehicles.

“It’s a big win for China and bad for American manufacturing,” said Mike Murphy, a veteran Republican political operative who is chief executive of the EV Politics Project, a group that seeks to end what it calls “the needless partisan divide over E.V.s.”

The divide is real. Senator John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican and leading opponent of electric vehicles, has called the subsidies “in essence a Biden giveaway to costal elitists who drive electric vehicles.”

If Republicans follow through on plans to repeal these incentives, automakers will sell eight million fewer electric vehicles in the United States by 2030 than they would have otherwise, according to research by Jesse Jenkins, an assistant professor at Princeton University. Instead of 40 percent of new car sales in 2030, electric vehicles would account for 24 percent, he estimated.

But analysts still expect electric vehicle sales to grow. Battery technology is improving rapidly while prices are falling, making electric vehicles more affordable and practical.

A study by the International Council on Clean Transportation, a nonprofit research organization in Washington, found that by the end of the decade, electric vehicles capable of traveling more than 300 miles on a charge would cost the same as or less than similar cars with combustion engines.

Batteries that can charge in minutes and let a vehicle travel 600 miles on a charge are edging closer to reality. BMW said this week that it had begun testing a prototype equipped with an advanced battery developed by Solid Power, a Colorado company. The technology, known as solid state, allows cars to be charged faster and travel farther. Mercedes-Benz has been testing a similar technology.

Still, the United States trails far behind other countries in electric vehicle sales. Chinese drivers bought 3.3 million from January through April, a 35 percent increase from a year earlier, according to Rho Motion, a research firm. Europeans bought 1.2 million, a 25 percent rise.

Lower sales would mean fewer Americans employed in the production of electric vehicles, batteries and charging equipment. The International Council on Clean Transportation estimates that if left in place, the Inflation Reduction Act would create 118,000 jobs through 2030. All those jobs, plus 12,000 more, will be lost if the legislation is repealed, according to the council’s research. Michigan, Texas and Tennessee would suffer the biggest job losses.

“The I.R.A. said ‘yes’ to American manufacturing and American jobs,” said Peter Slowik, one of the authors of the council’s study. “Now we’re taking that away.”

Of course, the bill could change significantly in the Senate, where some Republicans have expressed reservations about a wholesale repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act. Much of the money from that law is going to states where majorities voted for Mr. Trump.

But the politics of tax and clean energy policy are complicated. More than a dozen Republican representatives whose districts include factories that benefit from subsidies had said they would not support eliminating those subsidies. Yet just two Republicans voted against the House bill after Mr. Trump pressured representatives to advance his agenda.

“You’d really need to be sticking your neck out to kill this big bill,” said Alexander Gazmararian, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Michigan who has studied the politics of clean energy investment.

Also on Thursday, Senate Republicans used an unusual legislative tactic to block California’s plan to phase out fossil fuel cars by 2035. Eleven other states had intended to follow California; together, the dozen account for about 40 percent of the U.S. auto market. The Trump administration is also planning to roll back Biden-era fuel emissions and efficiency rules.

Raw Materials

The House tax bill’s changes would undercut new factories and mining projects by quickly phasing out incentives to manufacture batteries and mine and refine raw materials like lithium.

Credits would expire in two years for projects that used Chinese know-how. It is very difficult for battery makers and mineral refiners not to use some Chinese technology, industry representatives said.

“This bill as currently written would be devastating for critical mineral production and refining in the U.S.,” Albert Gore III, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, told reporters this month.

Low prices are the biggest problem for lithium producers right now, said Keith Phillips, the chief executive of Piedmont Lithium, which is developing a mine in North Carolina.

“Prices are going to have to rise before the project would become economic,” he said. But if the federal tax credits are eliminated, Mr. Phillips added, “they will have to rise that much more.”

The legislation would be a setback for a factory that Ford Motor is building in Marshall, Mich., with technical expertise from CATL, a Chinese company that is the world’s largest maker of electric vehicle batteries. The factory will produce batteries that are significantly less expensive than other batteries made in the United States.

“The production tax credit spurred American investments and jobs, which could now be at risk,” Ford said in a statement.

Cutting the United States off from Chinese technology could make it harder for U.S. automakers to compete, said James Bowe, a partner at the law firm King & Spalding who advises clients in the energy industry.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/00biz-ev-rollback-fhwb/00biz-ev-rollback-fhwb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 10:02:34.361032

Now, many facilities have shut down or scaled back, leaving residents uncertain and local leaders exploring a shift toward AI-powered data centers, according to a new report by WIRED.

At its peak, Kentucky accounted for about 20% of the United States’ computing power dedicated to Bitcoin mining. Facilities cropped up rapidly across the region, filling abandoned coal mines and promising jobs and renewal. But just as quickly, the industry’s growth has stalled.

Anna Whites, a lawyer who represented several crypto mining ventures, says many operations lacked sustainable business models. Companies often set up quickly, leased property, and then abruptly shut down, leaving behind unpaid bills and empty promises.

Mohawk Energy, co-founded by Kentucky State Senator Brandon Smith, was supposed to be different. In 2022, Mohawk purchased a sprawling 41,000-square-foot site in Jenkins, Ky., leasing much of the space to a Chinese crypto mining firm. The facility also aimed to train former coal miners and veterans to repair electronics and maintain Bitcoin mining rigs.

Initially, the venture seemed successful. Twenty-eight families found stable employment, with others securing nearby jobs. But within 18 months, the partnership soured. The Chinese partner sued Mohawk over alleged contract breaches; Mohawk countersued, and profits that were meant to fund local training never materialized.

Now, those who briefly enjoyed employment find themselves unemployed once again.

Colby Kirk, who heads the nonprofit One East Kentucky, said the region is cautiously shifting its hopes toward attracting artificial intelligence data centers. At a recent economic development conference, officials debated whether Kentucky’s existing infrastructure, such as electrical substations and skilled welders, could attract these centers.

But some locals remain skeptical, reflecting a deeper mistrust from years of environmental and economic setbacks. Nina McCoy, a former high school biology teacher in Inez, cited past environmental disasters from coal mining, expressing concern that new industries—whether cryptocurrency or AI—might exploit the region again.

“We bow down to them and let them tell us what they are going to do to our community because they are job creators,” McCoy said. “They’re not job creators, they’re profit makers.”

Meanwhile, some locals see AI as a promising alternative. Wes Hamilton, a local entrepreneur who lost money in previous crypto investments, said AI data centers could offer more stable, long-term benefits. Unlike Bitcoin mining, which primarily enriches facility owners, AI could attract broader investments, permanent employment, and skilled workers to eastern Kentucky.

Even as the Bitcoin mining industry faces turbulence, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear recently signed a “Bitcoin Rights” bill, solidifying the state’s stance as crypto-friendly. Despite this legislative support, the industry’s future remains uncertain.

Whites said Mohawk and its Chinese partner will attempt arbitration later this month. She’s hopeful they’ll find a resolution. “Mighty nice plant you have there,” she imagined them saying. “Let’s just go ahead and turn it on.”

Yet, for now, in Campton and across eastern Kentucky, many crypto mines sit quiet, waiting for whatever economic wave might come next.",https://lexingtonky.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8128-2048x1365-1.jpeg,N,,2025-05-23 10:03:02.354644

The American Clean Power Association (ACP) held its annual CleanPower event in Phoenix, Arizona May 19 to 22, 2025, convening over 8,000 industry members and 500 exhibitors in the utility-scale clean power industry.

Experts in solar, wind and energy storage met to strike deals, share product updates and get the latest scoop on regulatory changes. pv magazine USA attended the event, gaining insight on the challenges and solutions for decarbonized utility-scale power.

In a show floor panel discussion, ACP market intelligence senior director Kelsey Hallahan shared new data for Q1 2025 buildout, noting the industry continues to dominate new electricity generation capacity added to the grid.

ACP tracked 4.5 GW of new utility-scale solar, 1.6 GW of new grid-facing energy storage, and 1.3 GW of land-based wind additions in Q1 2025 alone. This brings the combined capacity of those technologies to 320 GW, or roughly enough to power nearly 80 million U.S. homes.

The U.S. now has 30.7 GW of grid-facing storage installed, marking 65% growth year-over-year, said ACP.

“Q1 was really good,” said Rob Keiser, head of asset management, Orsted. “A lot of us have lived through those [Production Tax Credit] cliffs in the past where you get this big run up in Q4, and then Q1 leads to a lot of disappointment when it comes to megawatts in the ground. Seeing more and more megawatts in Q1, that means the policy is working. There as certainty around making investment decisions.”

Despite this growth and a strong regulatory environment, things are soon set to change. The elephant in the room during the event is the ongoing budget reconciliation process and the ongoing uncertainty related to tax credit availability for solar, wind and energy storage.

On Thursday, the final day of the event, news arrived that the House narrowly passed the “big, beautiful bill.” The revised bill came in worse than expected for the clean energy industry, cutting the Investment Tax Credit and Production Tax Credit for any projects not placed in service by the end of 2028, rather than a slower phase-out through 2031.

The news left a chilling feel on the show floor as the industry grappled with the reality of a potential sudden cut off of regulatory support. The bill will next head to the Senate, where it could be revised to be more beneficial to clean power buildout, but as is, the bill was dubbed “unworkable legislation” by Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive officer, Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).

Despite the regulatory turmoil, there was also optimism on the show floor. Several discussions revolved around the expected increased electricity demand in the United States led by the AI and datacenter boom, as well as the electrification of transportation and buildings. After decades of relatively flat demand, electricity load growth is expected to take off, carving out a large role for clean power.

Another bright spot for the event is the boom in U.S. clean energy manufacturing. ACP released a report alongside the event tracking progress toward onshoring production.

ACP said clean energy manufacturing now accounts for $18 billion in GDP annually, growing to as much as $86 billion by 2030. The clean power manufacturing industry supports over 122,000 jobs, growing to as many as 575,000 jobs by 2030, it said.

“Surging clean energy deployment is creating new manufacturing facilities across the country. This success will create hundreds of thousands of jobs and revitalize American communities if policy leaders place economic progress over partisan division,” said Jason Grumet, CEO of ACP.

Jones, Shannon Heckt, Delaney Nolan",,,,,https://lailluminator.com/2025/05/23/community-air/,"Chet Wayland, former director of the EPA’s Air Quality Assessment Division, said most states’ air monitoring systems are designed to meet the minimum standards for ambient air.
Wayland said states can increase air quality oversight through community-based air monitors.
“I felt the (task force) report … missed the mark somewhat in terms of garnering the full value of community air monitoring,” Benforado said.
“Their definition of community air monitoring was how a state government runs community air monitoring.
There was less emphasis on engaging the community as equal participants in an air monitoring program.” YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.","Six grassroots environmental groups filed a federal lawsuit this week that takes aim at a 2024 Louisiana law that essentially crippled community-based air monitoring in the state.

The suit, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana, calls the law an “industry-friendly ban” that bars groups from using their own independent air monitoring systems to warn residents living in fenceline communities about potential health risks.

“Our legislature and officials should do everything in their power to stop industry from polluting our air in the first place,” said Joy Banner, co-founder of The Descendants Project, one of the six plaintiffs in the lawsuit. “To attack our First Amendment rights instead is arcane, illegal and dangerous.”

The coalition’s lawsuit argues that Louisiana’s air monitoring law suppresses evidence collected by more affordable air quality monitoring equipment that they use to help “fenceline” communities better understand the quality of the air they’re breathing.

The lawsuit alleges the law does this by preventing the use of this data to allege air quality violations, with penalties of up to $32,500 a day, plus $1 million for intentional violations. The plaintiffs argue this violates their right to free speech.

The lawsuit comes at a time when a new report from a special legislative task force is urging Louisiana lawmakers to invest millions more in monitoring and real-time notification of hazardous emissions in communities hardest hit by pollution.

The Bayou State is one of the most industrialized in the United States, with 476 major air pollution sources — including petroleum, chemical, plastics and sugar facilities — as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The task force was made up of state environmental officials, industry lobbyists and representatives from the nonprofit environmental group that was a target of the new law, which set standards for air monitoring so high that grassroots groups can’t meet them.

The report submitted last month to the House and Senate legislative environmental committees recommends that lawmakers spend at least $13 million to establish a more robust and localized air monitoring and notification system within the state’s Department of Environmental Quality.

LDEQ’s current system consists of 29 continuous monitoring sites that report annually to the EPA and track real-time data on emissions — including particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. It also operates seven non-continuous monitoring sites that help the agency track long-term trends in air quality. And it has four temporary monitoring sites that can be strategically placed in areas of concern, generally collecting a year of data in each location.

The report recommends that LDEQ place additional air monitors near the top polluting industrial facilities in the state based on the volume and toxicity of their emissions and their proximity to “fenceline” communities. The committee estimated these regulatory monitors would cost nearly $800,000 per site and between $150,000 to $200,000 in annual operating and maintenance expenses.

It suggested the state could locate them near 10% to 20% of Louisiana’s major air pollution sources — which would mean tens of millions of dollars just in capital costs.

In addition to more monitoring, the task force recommends a notification system capable of blasting out real-time text and phone call alerts about possible air quality dangers to nearby residents. Such a notification system has an estimated price tag of $5.2 million for initial set up and annual maintenance.

The recommendations would require LDEQ to hire 48 new people, to join the team of seven currently dedicated to overseeing the data collected by the existing network of monitoring sites, at an annual cost of about $8.2 million.

Louisiana leaders mum on more monitoring

But there’s no indication yet from state leaders or LDEQ that money will be allocated to implement the report’s recommendations. The Republican chairs of Louisiana’s Senate Environmental Quality Committee and House committee on Natural Resources and Environment did not respond to questions from Floodlight about the report. Inquiries to officials with LDEQ also went unanswered.

“I would hope that the Legislature would believe that having information that affects people’s health, affects workers’ health and affects communities would be an important priority for them,” said Marylee Orr, executive director of the Louisiana Environmental Action Network (LEAN).

LEAN had a seat on the 11-member task force that drafted the report. The organization received $500,000 in federal funding allocated for community-run air monitoring programs in former President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

LEAN used the money to deploy a fleet of mobile air-monitoring vehicles that collected samples along the Mississippi River area in southwest Louisiana known as “Cancer Alley.” The group also has partnered with a bulk storage facility for liquids — including ethanol, diesel and other petroleum products — in St. Rose to monitor air quality in nearby neighborhoods.

Localized, coordinated air monitoring efforts like LEAN’s have been a tool marginalized communities overburdened by polluting industries have tried to demonstrate air quality problems and push state leaders for tougher regulations and enforcement of the Clean Air Act.

Orr said LEAN favors this latest step urging the Legislature to act but, “I don’t know where the money’s going to be coming from.”

Current system seen as inadequate

Environmental advocates have long criticized Louisiana’s existing air monitoring system, calling it insufficient to accurately measure pollution since there aren’t enough monitors located where air quality is the most compromised.

The state ranks fourth highest among 56 states and territories for toxic emissions per square mile, according to EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory. Roughly 400 Louisiana facilities emitted 132 million pounds of toxic pollution in 2022.

Chet Wayland, former director of the EPA’s Air Quality Assessment Division, said most states’ air monitoring systems are designed to meet the minimum standards for ambient air. That means not necessarily putting them near industrial facilities, but rather in more densely populated places to measure air pollutants including particulate matter, ozone and sulfur dioxide, he said.

Wayland said states can increase air quality oversight through community-based air monitors. He said such localized air monitoring, as California and New York use, is the best way to track the emissions of the more dangerous air toxins like benzene, toluene, heavy metals and industrial solvents.

“We all would love to see more data available. Clearly we can’t monitor every single place that we should be monitoring. The resources aren’t there from the federal standpoint and — I get it — they’re not there from the state standpoint as well,” Wayland said.

He said a “smart strategy” would be to place monitors in places where people are more likely to be exposed to harmful air pollutants, adding, “It would be nice to have some indication of what the air quality is in those areas.”

The task force report also suggests supplementing new monitors with air quality sensors that are cheaper and could detect pollutants wafting through communities. The report acknowledges these air sensors are “prone to inaccuracies” and are most useful for offering general insight into air quality — not as a resource for enforcement.

Future of federal funding in question

Nationally, approximately $117 million was earmarked in the IRA for state, local governments, tribal nations and community groups to implement, upgrade and continue various air monitoring programs in fenceline communities.

But Romany Webb, deputy director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, noted that Congress is currently considering a budget proposal that seeks to repeal a lot of those funds and clawback any unobligated money across all IRA-funded initiatives.

“But, as I’m sure you know, the bill still has to pass the Senate and is likely to change (perhaps significantly) before that happens,” Webb said.

EPA spokesperson Shayla Powell said the agency is “reviewing all of its grant programs” to gauge whether they are an “appropriate use of taxpayer dollars” and “align with” the current administration’s policies.

She added, “Maybe the Biden-Harris administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

Jay Benforado, board chair for the Association for Advancing Participatory Sciences, said all signals from the current administration lead him to think that community air monitoring won’t survive.

As for the task force report, Benforado said its recommendations failed to factor in the valuable role that community members, volunteers and academics could play in monitoring air quality.

“I felt the (task force) report … missed the mark somewhat in terms of garnering the full value of community air monitoring,” Benforado said. “Their definition of community air monitoring was how a state government runs community air monitoring. There was less emphasis on engaging the community as equal participants in an air monitoring program.”

Associated Press

WASHINGTON (AP) — The multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed by House Republicans early Thursday would gut clean energy tax credits that Democrats approved three years ago while supporting increased mining, drilling and other traditional energy production.

A marathon session that began Wednesday resulted in 1,100-plus page legislation that curbs billions of dollars in spending across food assistance, student loans, Medicaid and action to address climate change.

The bill, which now heads to the Senate, repeals or phases out more quickly clean energy tax credits passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act during former President Joe Biden’s term. Biden’s climate law has been considered monumental for the clean energy transition, but the House bill effectively renders moot much of the law’s incentives for renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Clean energy advocates said the bill walks back the largest government investment in clean energy in history.

“In a bid to cut taxes for billionaires and provide a grab bag of goodies to Big Oil, the majority in the House took a sledgehammer to clean energy tax credits and to the protection of our public lands,” said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“These credits are delivering billions of dollars in new investments in homegrown American energy — creating jobs, lowering energy costs and addressing the climate crisis that is fueling floods, fires and heat waves,” Goldfuss said.

President Donald Trump celebrated the bill’s passage, calling it “arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country.” Trump appealed to the Senate to pass the measure as soon as possible and send it to his desk.

The Senate hopes to wrap up its version by early July. At least four Republican senators, led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have urged continuation of energy tax credits, including support for traditional and renewable energy sources. Republican-led states and Congressional districts have benefited from billions of dollars in clean energy manufacturing investments spurred by the Biden-era subsidies.

Full-scale repeal of current credits “could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,” the senators said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.

“A wholesale repeal, or the termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing … job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy,” the senators wrote in the April 9 letter. The letter was also signed by GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas.

In a win for House moderates and some Western lawmakers, the House bill strips language that would have allowed the sale of hundreds of thousands acres of public lands in Utah and Nevada. Opponents argued the sales would have opened the door for more oil and gas drilling.

What was gutted in the bill

The House bill takes an axe to tax credits for rooftop solar installments and eliminates electric vehicle tax credits after 2025, with a one-year exception for EVs manufactured by automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 cars that qualified for the credit.

Credits for solar and electric vehicles, which reduce harmful emissions, help to boost demand for the technologies and drive down their cost.

House Republicans also tightened tax credit restrictions for projects associated with foreign entities, including China — an added blow to domestic clean energy expansion since China dominates much of the supply chain.

The bill slashes a three-year phase-down schedule previously proposed, and instead cuts off projects that don’t start construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage. Those projects would also have to start operating before 2029.

“This bill threatens the clean energy industry at a time when it’s proving to be not only economically beneficial — lowering costs, creating jobs and fueling local economies — but also essential to America’s energy future,” said Andrew Reagan, president of Clean Energy for America, an industry group.

The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry, applauded the bill as a step to “restore American energy dominance.”

“By preserving competitive tax policies, opening lease sales” for oil and gas drilling and advancing permitting reforms, the legislation “is a win for our nation’s energy future,” API President Mike Sommers said in a statement.

No sale of public lands

At the behest of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke and some other Republicans, lawmakers stripped a provision that would have sold or transferred about 460,000 acres of federal land in Nevada and Utah to local governments or private entities.

The proposal exposed sharp divisions between Western Republicans who say the federal government controls too much of their states and others such as Zinke, a former Interior secretary in Trump’s first term whose state is protective of access to lands for hunting and recreation.

“At the heart of the matter is that public land that’s in the federal estate belongs to everybody,” Zinke told The Associated Press on Thursday. “To suggest that you’re going to sell land to pay off the debt, I think that’s misguided and, quite frankly, disingenuous.”

The land sales had been inserted in the bill following a late-night committee vote, despite earlier pledges from Republican leaders that the sales were off the table.

Supporters said they would generate revenue and ease growth pressures by creating room for more and cheaper housing in booming Western cities such as Las Vegas, Reno, Nevada, and St. George, Utah. Those communities are hemmed in by federal property, which makes up 80% of the land in Nevada and 63% in Utah.

A spokesperson for Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, who sponsored the bid to sell federal lands in his state, said his office was “exploring all options” to make the transfers happen.

Housing advocates had cautioned federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing, and some of the parcels to be sold were far from developed areas.

Tracy Stone-Manning, president of the Wilderness Society and a former director of the Bureau of Land Management under Biden, said she appreciated Zinke’s work to prevent the public lands sale.

But she said the bill was still a “big giveaway” to the private sector. “By opening hundreds of millions of acres to drilling, mining and logging to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, this bill harms the tens of millions of people who like to hike, recreate or find solace in the outdoors,” she said.

Trump targets Biden’s climate policy

At the same time the bill slashes support for clean energy, it paves the way for oil, gas and coal.

Through the bill, natural gas pipeline developers can pay a $10 million fee for expedited permitting, and applicants for a potential liquefied natural gas export site can pay a $1 million fee to be deemed in the “public interest,” circumventing what is usually a regulatory challenge.",https://dailyreporter.com/files/2025/05/drilling-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 09:06:28.438913

One large-scale AI model training run consumes as much electricity as 100 American homes use in an entire year.

With data centres already accounting for 1-2% of global electricity and artificial intelligence demand projected to triple this figure by 2030, we need solutions that power our digital future without undermining climate goals.

The answer may come from a seemingly counterintuitive source: natural gas turbines equipped with next-generation carbon capture technology. While renewables dominate climate conversations, AI data centres require constant, uninterrupted power that intermittent sources alone can’t provide.

But let’s zoom out a bit. Natural gas turbines play a vital role in our electricity mix, generating around 40% of power in the US alone and driving the shift away from coal across both America and Europe.

Time for gas turbines

But in a net zero world, even these relatively cleaner turbines must be decarbonized. The International Energy Agency estimates in the Net Zero by 2050 roadmap that we’ll need to capture approximately 800 million tonnes of CO₂ annually from natural gas power plants, precisely as renewables grow to 60-70% of new electricity generation capacity but require complementary baseload power to stabilize the grid.

Today’s electricity market operates on a ‘merit order’ system determining which plants run based on demand and cost. Gas turbines typically serve as dispatchable power suppliers, activated during peak periods due to their ability to switch on and off quickly.

They produce diluted CO₂ emissions – typically between 2-5% concentration – significantly lower than coal or biomass plants at 10-15%, but this low concentration creates unique challenges for most conventional carbon capture technologies.

Now, AI and the data centre industry represent a huge shift in power consumption. AI requires facilities running continuously 24/7, needing stable, abundant, decarbonized power at unprecedented scales -facilities like Meta’s could consume up to 2GW each, equivalent to powering over 1.5 million homes. Decarbonizing this using only intermittent renewables like solar and wind would require grid connection backup, battery storage and carbon offsets, adding considerable infrastructure and costs.

Unique carbon capture

This is where, I think, natural gas with carbon capture becomes valuable as a baseload solution addressing intermittency while maintaining a low carbon footprint.

Implementing carbon capture on gas turbines has unique requirements: the carbon capture solution must match the operational flexibility of the turbine itself, and that’s not easy. Traditional technologies rely on thermal energy – typically heat above 100 degrees Celsius – creating thermal inertia that prevents quick response to changing demands.

Any viable solution must be flexible, achieve 90-95% capture rates, handle flue gas impurities, and fit within existing space constraints.

From code to carbon: rewriting the rules for sustainable digital infrastructure

The good news is that the solution is more or less already here (full disclosure: I am working on it). Newer electrochemical carbon capture technologies directly address these challenges. These fully electric solutions operate at ambient temperatures without liquids or solvents, allowing them to respond in minutes rather than hours.

By using only solid materials and eliminating thermal regeneration processes, they maintain efficiency during fluctuating operations, precisely matching the flexibility requirements of gas turbines.

And so thanks to this progress, natural gas plants with carbon capture could transform from peaking power providers to reliable baseload generators: similar to nuclear plants but with greater flexibility and most certainly lower costs.

Powerful proposition for AI

This creates a very powerful proposition for data centres and AI companies looking for 24/7 decarbonized power, that provides stable, carbon-neutral electricity with a significantly smaller land footprint than equivalent renewable installations.

Natural gas with carbon capture builds on mature infrastructure with decades of operational experience, with established mitigation strategies for both downstream CO2 geological storage risks and upstream methane leakage.

By comparison, deep geothermal drilling near population centers carries induced seismicity risks, while nuclear power faces concerns about radioactive waste and political challenges. Though all energy solutions inevitably involve tradeoffs that vary by region, natural gas with advanced carbon capture deserves a prominent place in our solution portfolio, particularly for applications requiring stable, continuous power.

One key challenge that I also want to address is the fate of captured CO₂, particularly given the distributed nature of natural gas plants, many of which aren’t located near existing CO₂ transport infrastructure.

For data centres specifically, this challenge can actually become an opportunity for strategic planning. The most promising approach involves co-locating new data centres with gas-fired power plants near CO₂ storage sites, minimizing transport infrastructure needs while maximizing system efficiency.

Data centre development

This strategy is reminiscent of early data centre development patterns, when facilities were intentionally built near hydropower resources in cooler climates to access clean electricity while reducing cooling demands.

In the same way, proximity to carbon storage infrastructure will likely emerge as an important factor in siting decisions for the next generation of AI-focused data centres. By designing with the entire carbon lifecycle in mind, we can come up with integrated solutions that deliver both computational power and emissions reductions.

Natural gas with advanced carbon capture is appealing for a range of companies, too. For equipment manufacturers like Siemens Energy and GE Vernova, there’s a big opportunity to develop what I call ‘integrated decarbonized gas turbines’ as unified products.

Power plant operators can retrofit existing facilities, extending their operational lifespan while meeting increasingly stringent emissions requirements.

And for data centres and AI companies themselves, who are creating enormous new power demand with ever more pressure to do something about it, this approach offers stable, reliable, decarbonized power without the land use or intermittency challenges of purely renewable approaches.

I believe natural gas turbines with effective carbon capture represent both an immediate solution and a strategic long-term asset in our transition to a low-carbon economy while meeting the growing demands of AI and data centres.

Among a slew of other provisions, the bill moves the expiration date of EV tax credits from December 31, 2032, to December 31, 2025.

The bill also ends the clean vehicle tax credits for used EVs and for commercial vehicles.

You have until December 31 to buy an electric vehicle and claim the $7,500 tax credit if the One Big Beautiful Bill Act the House of Representatives passed by 214-213 vote early Thursday morning makes it through the Senate (likely) and on to the president’s resolute desk for his signature (for sure).

The budget bill does not require 60 votes in the Senate, so 51 of the chamber’s 53 Republicans must sign on for passage. Considering its close call in the House, where Republican hardliners balked over a Congressional Budget Office-projected $3.1 trillion increase in the federal debt over the next decade, the bill will not have an easy ride in the Senate without a considerable number of amendments, none of them likely related to clean vehicles.

Due date to avoid government shutdown for Trump’s signature is September 30.

Trump signed an executive order, “Unleashing American Energy,” January 20, which calls for ending EV tax credits, as well as ending federal funding for a national EV recharging network. The president’s EO stopped funding for the recharging network in February, but the EV tax credits remain.

Currently, the EV tax credits, which were implemented after President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, are set to expire December 31, 2032.

Subtitle C, “Make America Win Again,” of Title XI of the budget bill “accelerates the expiration date to December 31, 2025. This provision also implements a special rule for taxable year 2026 that only allows vehicles produced by manufacturers that have not sold 200,000 new clean vehicles as of December 31, 2025, to qualify for the credit.”

That 200,000 vehicle limit recalls EV credits available to US taxpayers for years before the Biden administration’s IRA. It’s not crystal clear what the 200,000-sales limit would mean for EV buyers. In many cases the $7,500 new EV credit has been available as the sale closes, so there may be an opportunity to claim the credit up to the April 15, 2026, Internal Revenue Service personal income tax filing deadline.

According to Cox Automotive’s EV sales data through February of this year, Tesla, General Motors, Ford, Hyundai Motor Group (including Kia), BMW, Volkswagen, and the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance have already breached the 200,000 mark for EV sales in the US. Rivian had sold 127,579 and Mercedes-Benz was at 114,211, so they both may be within the limit by the end of this year. The rest, including Toyota Motor (including Lexus), Honda/Acura, Subaru, Lucid, Jaguar Land Rover, Vinfast, and Mazda are comfortably below the limit.

The House GOP budget bill also ends the clean vehicle tax credits for used EVs and for commercial vehicles. It terminates the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit, which gives tax credit for up to 30% of “property” to store or dispense clean-burning fuel, or recharging EVs, that cost up to $100,000.

In each case, like the new-EV tax credit, the House budget bill calls for moving up expiration dates from December 31, 2032, the date set by the Biden IRA, to December 31, 2025.

US auto sales have been strong for all passenger vehicles so far this year, much of it attributed to consumers trying to beat Trump administration tariffs, but there is some evidence that anticipation of the end of the tax credits has helped EV sales. From January to April, new vehicle sales were up 5.5%, to 5.38 million. EV sales for the same period were up 5.7%, to 392,312 by April, according to Cox Automotive.

Further indicating that some consumers are rushing to buy an EV while they can still get a tax credit, the Cox Automotive Dealer Sentiment Index, a survey of the level of franchise and independent dealer optimism found that while the EV sales index fell to a score of 44, sentiment for the EV tax credit’s effect on sales reached a record high of 62.

The Energy & Commerce committee section of the Big Beautiful Bill Act also puts an end to Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for 2024-26, plus CAFE standards for passenger cars and light trucks for model year 2027 “and beyond,” as well as fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans for MY30 and beyond.

The Environmental Protection Agency under the Biden administration in March 2024 issued standards that would mandate EVs reach 30% to 56% of passenger vehicle and light-duty truck production and 20% to 32% of medium-duty truck production, by 2030-32.

The House budget bill mandates these standards “shall have no force or effect.”","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/house-judiciary-committee-chairman-rep-jim-jordan-speaks-news-photo-1747994583.pjpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.144xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-05-23 09:06:31.508440

The version of the bill passed yesterday goes further than the draft. The bill will eliminate the IRA’s 30% production tax credit and investment tax credit (PTC/ITC) for all clean energy projects which do not begin construction within 60 days of its enactment. Projects that meet that deadline will need to be operational by 31 December 2028 in order to retain the credit.

Provisions for residential renewable energy projects are also set to expire by the end of 2025.

The 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit has been preserved until 2029, after which it will decrease to 75% in 2030, 50% in 2031 and end in 2032.

The bill also introduces strict “Foreign Entities of Concern” (FEOC) restrictions, which apply to the ITC, PTC, 45X and other credits. These limit the ownership, control and certain financial involvement of US companies by designated “Specified Foreign Entities” or “Foreign-Influenced Entities”. For solar PV and energy storage, these essentially amount to limits on Chinese involvement in the US market. PV Tech Premium analysed the draft FEOC language earlier this week.

Tax credit transferability – the mechanism allowing credits to be sold for cash and broadening the scope of potential recipients – was limited for certain credits and ended early for others, but sustainable finance firm Crux said that the provision was treated “more favourably” in the bill than in last week’s draft.

‘Engineer an energy crisis’

Since the bill passed, a chorus of renewable energy professionals, companies and industry representatives have voiced condemnation and concern.

Abigal Ross Hopper, head of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), said that, in its current form, the legislation would: “Upend an economic boom in this country that has delivered an historic American manufacturing renaissance, lower electric bills, hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs and tens of billions of dollars of investments primarily to states that voted for president Trump.”

She continued: “Hundreds of factories will close. Hundreds of billions of dollars in local investments will vanish. Hundreds of thousands of people will lose their jobs. Families will lose the freedom to control their energy costs. And our electric grid will be destabilised.”

SEIA previously warned that the bill could see the closure of up to 300 US solar and energy storage manufacturing facilities and the loss of up to 300,000 jobs.

Scott Elias, VP of policy & market development at renewables investment firm CleanCapital said the bill “threatens US energy development and risks ceding the AI race and tech leadership to China.

“Put simply, Congress is now one chamber away from passing a law that would dramatically increase project risk, reduce investment certainty, cancel previously announced projects and investments and stall clean energy deployment.”

The cliff edge end to ITC and PTC credits should, perhaps, not be entirely surprising. Plans announced prior to Donald Trump’s election in the ultra-conservative Project 2025 document laid out the removal of Biden-era energy credits and ending the reliance on “unreliable renewables”. However, until recently, many in the renewable energy industry thought that the IRA would broadly survive, perhaps with some trimming around the edges.

Gretchen Goldman, president of US nonprofit the Union of Concerned Scientists, said: “The House has done its level best to engineer an energy crisis, deliberately sidelining the clean energy industry at the exact moment we need it most.”

Posting on LinkedIn with similar sentiments, senior policy analyst at Clean Energy Associates, Christian Roselund, wrote: “It appears there is no longer any need to debate semantics regarding whether or not the US House budget bill is a full repeal of IRA clean energy tax credits.

“Politics are not exact reflections of economic interests; ideology also plays a role. The latter should not be underestimated.”

Eyes now turn to the Senate, where lobbyists and industry voices hope to soften some of the most draconian parts of the bill.

Hopper said: “It’s not too late for Congress to get this right. The solar and storage industry is ready to get to work with the US Senate on a more thoughtful and measured approach to unleashing true American energy dominance to create a brighter future for all Americans.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Donald_Trump_credit-gage-skidmore-wikimedia-commons-768x512-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 09:05:46.063160

“The Trump administration is attempting to take every measure it can to prop up coal plants, against economics, against public health, against climate,” McNamara said.

Luminant Generation Company, which owns the facility, did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding Goree’s account and steps taken by it to reduce emissions.

Last year, the EPA said the surrounding counties, Rusk and Panola, had failed to meet air quality standards, blaming Martin Lake as the major source. Luminant disagreed, calling the EPA’s finding “unsupported.” The agency stood by its analysis, reaffirming that not enough steps were taken to clean up the surrounding areas.

But new federal actions could stall or even erase efforts to reduce air pollution. In April, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation that delays a key pollution rule, related to mercury and fine particles, for 68 power plants by two years, pushing the deadline to 2029. The Environmental Protection Agency has also proposed repealing those updated standards entirely, meaning plants may never have to meet them at all.

The rules, updated by the Joe Biden administration last year, would have required continuous monitoring and tighter pollution limits, especially for plants that burn lignite coal, a particularly dirty form of fuel. Operators decried the rule as too costly. Governors from several states sued.

A USA TODAY review of federal data found that many of the 60-plus power plants benefiting from the exemption are among the nation’s worst polluters, including six that rank within the nation’s top 10 largest greenhouse gas emitters from 2023, the latest available year. Many of these companies have also paid hundreds of millions in environmental fines and settlements in recent decades.

Several pollutants from coal plants have dropped in the past decade, which experts attribute largely to the EPA’s 2012 standards for these pollutants.

Even then, coal plants continue to emit large amounts of mercury, fine particulate matter, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides – all of which can be harmful to public health.

According to a USA TODAY analysis, these 68 power plants emitted 8% of total mercury emissions, a disproportionate figure considering these plants only formed less than a percent of the 14,000 facilities that reported emissions in 2020, the latest available year on EPA’s National Emissions Inventory.

Luminant Generation-owned Martin Lake in East Texas, where Goree lives, is one of the facilities on the exemption list.

The plant is among the nation’s top sulfur dioxide emitters and the sixth largest for nitrogen oxides, according to 2024’s EPA Clean Air Markets Program Data. It was also among the largest mercury emitters in 2020, according to the National Emissions Inventory data.

Each time she sees the plant’s three smokestacks in the distance, she finds herself thinking about the air her community is breathing, Goree said.

Goree remembers her town through images of crickets singing and fireflies lighting up the night sky. She has always loved being outside, tending to her garden, or spending time near Martin Lake, a 5,000-acre body of water known for its bass and catfish. These days, though, fewer people fish there, she said. Fewer still picnic or hike in the nearby park, she added.

“I just want to live out my retirement years in peace and quiet with clean air to breathe and fresh water to enjoy the outdoor life,” she said, emphasizing that public health should be central to climate policy.

“That's my biggest concern. It's something they can do to help the community, and they're just not doing it,” Goree said.

Farther south in Fort Bend County, longtime resident Haley Schulz spent years working in the oil and gas industry until motherhood and a deep dive into environmental research transformed her into an environmental rights advocate. She discovered she lives just 15 miles from W.A. Parish, the largest coal plant in Texas. Then things from her past started to make sense: her classmates always carrying inhalers, her own relentless cough that once sent her to the emergency room.

“It felt like my chest was on fire,” Schulz recalled. “It felt like I was having a heart attack every single time I had a tickle in my throat.”

Doctors diagnosed her with costochondritis from the nonstop cough, she said. While they could not say if pollution was to blame, Schulz said the irritation she feels after visiting parks near the plant speaks volumes.

“That’s not nature,” she said after visiting parks near the plant. “That’s the soot.”

USA TODAY reached out to NRG Energy, who operates the W.A. Parish plant and three others on the exemption list. The company spokesperson, Ann Duhon, didn’t directly comment on Schulz’s experience but said that the company does not see any short-term impacts due to the proclamation, which it said it is currently reviewing.

“In recent years, NRG has invested millions of dollars installing environmental technologies at our facilities, which will remain in place regardless of any EPA rollbacks,” the email statement said.

About half of the companies or parent companies that operate the exempted power plants have a history of environmental violations, according to a review of data compiled by the nonprofit Good Jobs First.

In 2006, the Alabama Power Company, a subsidiary of the Southern Company, agreed to settle for $200 million with the federal government over alleged violations of the Clean Air Act from its James H. Miller Jr. plant. The same year, East Kentucky Power Cooperative agreed to pay over $600 million for similar violations.

Virginia Electric Power Co., a subsidiary of Dominion Energy which has a power plant on the exemption list, has a Clean Air Act settlement totaling $1.2 billion in 2003. More recently, in 2023, Dynegy Midwest Generation reached a settlement for “disposal of coal ash that allegedly led to groundwater pollution.”

After all it could be inevitable

Coal operators spread across two dozen states, mostly in Republican-leaning counties, welcomed the move.

Scott Brooks, spokesman for Tennessee Valley Authority, which has four of the exempted power plants, told USA TODAY, in an email: “This exemption will allow TVA to keep running these assets in a cost-effective way and help ensure reliability for our 10 million customers,” adding that their facilities follow the previous and current standards.

East Kentucky Power Cooperative Spokesperson Nick Comer said that the updated rules targeting mercury and air toxins would have forced it to turn off a coal-fired unit if just one of the 8000-plus fabric bags get a dime-sized hole.

When resources are limited and market power is expensive, Comer said, “this could lead to tens of millions of dollars in costs for replacement power and market performance penalties.”

The Southern Company said in a statement to USA TODAY, “extending the current deadline will provide additional time needed both to address potential rule changes and further demonstrate compliance to the current requirements.”

Coal powered America’s industrial revolution, but its role in the country’s energy grid has declined significantly over the recent decades, down to just over 15% of electricity in 2024, from about half at the beginning of this century. The shift has been driven not only by policy, but also by economics as cheaper and easier-to-maintain energy sources have emerged. Notably among them is natural gas, while wind and solar have been gradually increasing their contributions.

The transition to renewable energy is “inevitable over the long term”, said Julie McNamara, an associate policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“The Trump administration is attempting to take every measure it can to prop up coal plants, against economics, against public health, against climate,” McNamara said.

“This will provide potentially a little more money in the pockets of the coal plant owners, but it will not provide for the communities that house these coal plants,” she said.

According to the latest Energy Information Administration data, hundreds of coal-fired plants have closed over the past decades, leaving only a couple hundred operational, many of which are scheduled for retirement within the next decade.

Deregulation: The bigger picture

The EPA is proposing broader changes to pollution control standards, including revisiting the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for fine particulate matter. This is how the agency defines what levels are considered unhealthy.

The agency also wants to reconsider the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program which requires the nation’s largest facilities to tally up those emissions every year.

Whether or not people breathe clean air isn’t entirely up to the EPA. States and local governments play a key role, as they are responsible for writing and enforcing permits. But, experts say, the signals from the top might impact decision-making downstream.

“If the message they're getting from the EPA is all this deregulation or these rollbacks still meet the definition of Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, then what you're telling that audience is, don't do anything,” said Joseph Goffman, a former assistant administrator at the EPA office overseeing air pollution rules.

The Trump administration also recently proposed a 55% cut to the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget that would bring the staffing back to 1980s levels.

“Even if there were no budget cuts, and the rules remained in place, the administration seems committed to maintain a deregulatory environment, including by not doing enforcement,” Goffman said.

When USA TODAY reached out to the EPA for a response, the agency's press office shared an unsigned emailed statement saying that the president may exempt any stationary source on grounds of national security interests or based on the determination that the technology is not available.

“This is an authority that solely rests with the President, not EPA,” the statement said.

However, the regulatory agency did not respond directly to the questions sent by USA TODAY and referred to the White House.

In an emailed statement, White House Assistant Press Secretary Taylor Rogers said: “President Trump’s commonsense agenda unleashes American energy to protect our national security, lower the cost of living, and provide necessary electrical demands for emerging technologies such as AI. While the media refuses to acknowledge that American energy is much cleaner than foreign energy, hardworking Americans voted for President Trump to roll back harmful and radical regulations.”

In total, the EPA has announced at least half a dozen plans to scrap or scale down rules and programs that have contributed to the progress of cleaning up the air and curbing the impacts of climate change.

Ananya Roy, an epidemiologist at the Environmental Defense Fund, said the arguments for deregulation are to reduce costs and regulatory burden.

“EPA's mission is supposed to be to protect public health, and in this instance, they won't be,” Roy said.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/08/USAT/82991724007-xxx-xx-xcoal-mining-515.JPG?crop=499,281,x0,y26&width=499&height=281&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-23 09:05:49.119301

There is no telling just how dire the situation will be if the EPA and FEMA cannot fulfill their missions.","The Federal Emergency Management Agency, a political piñata for anti-government crusaders, has been targeted by Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Not only that, but Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in March that she’d work to “eliminate the agency,” and this month, President Donald Trump’s administration fired Cameron Hamilton, the acting head of FEMA, after he said the agency should not be done away with.

Trump’s administration fired Cameron Hamilton, the acting head of FEMA, after he said the agency should not be done away with.

Though Noem backpedaled a bit this month and said “we are reorienting the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s responsibilities,” the administration’s disregard for the agency and its mission remain clear. When Hurricane Preparedness Week began May 5, it was clear that the federal government was on track to run out of cash for disaster relief this summer, but the White House had still not yet requested funding from Congress.

But Americans haven’t had to wait till next month’s start of hurricane season to feel the impacts of the Trump administration’s lack of interest in disaster response. This year, we’ve seen officials in Arkansas, Mississippi and Missouri complain that they haven’t gotten help after destructive storms.

St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer told MSNBC on Monday that federal assistance is desperately needed after tornadoes killed five people in that city and two more people in Missouri May 16. But as Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said this week, the federal government hasn’t sufficiently responded to deadly storms that hit Missouri in March.

“I’m not happy about the fact we’re still waiting from all of that damage two months ago. We lost 12 people in those storms. We’ve lost seven here,” he said. “The scope of the damage is immense.”

The Trump administration initially denied Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ request for FEMA aid after severe weather hit that state March 14 and 15 and eventually reversed course nearly two months later, on May 13.

Communities like mine in southeast Louisiana are among those that will bear the brunt of FEMA’s dismantling. From Florida to North Carolina, cities and towns across the country, particularly in the South, have still not yet been able to begin rebuilding after last hurricane season as this year’s season is about to begin.

At the same time that the Trump administration is delaying or denying Americans help from FEMA, the Environmental Protection Agency is being led by an administrator hostile to its mission, and its employees are being targeted for dismissal or early retirement. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has said he is aiming to reduce the size of the agency’s workforce to the lowest it has been in nearly 40 years. Perhaps even worse, the agency is shifting its experts — the scientists working to protect Americans from toxic pollutants — and putting them under political appointees. By the end of last month, the EPA was already down 1,000 employees.

The EPA has been a political lightning rod for years. Even before this MAGA version of the Republican Party, Reagan Republicans slammed the agency as a “job killer” and a roadblock to American ingenuity.

The reality is just the opposite. Republican President Richard Nixon signed the law creating the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970. Since then, America has continued to be the leading world economy, growing our GDP many times over. Thanks to the EPA, we accomplished all this and more while cleaning up our rivers, beaches, drinking water and neighborhoods.

Zeldin’s reduction of the EPA workforce is a giveaway to industry giants that will allow them to evade accountability for their pollution and the harm it causes. Communities like mine, as always, will suffer the consequences.

Communities like mine, as always, will suffer the consequences.

In response to the EPA’s announced “reorganization” on May 2, the Union of Concerned Scientists issued a public statement. Chitra Kumar, the managing director of the organization’s Climate and Clean Energy Program, stated, “EPA’s Research and Development Office produces independent science that’s used to keep people safe from pollution and chemical exposure.”

That’s true, and unfortunately it’s something that too many Americans have come to take for granted. The statement continued by saying that moving Office of Research and Development scientists “into policy offices could subject those experts to political influence, particularly in this administration.”

The timing of these cuts and reassignments could not be worse. New data released earlier this year shows that nearly half of all people in the United States have drinking water contaminated by toxic “forever chemicals,” or PFAS. Who compiled that data and provided it to the public? The EPA.

Even more recently, it was reported that nearly half of all people in this country are also breathing polluted air. People with pre-existing respiratory conditions like asthma are of course the most affected. But air pollution is widely known to shorten everyone’s lifespan and cause chronic illness even in people who had never experienced respiratory distress before.

There is no telling just how dire the situation will be if the EPA and FEMA cannot fulfill their missions. In Louisiana, oil refineries, gas export terminals and petrochemical plants sit on low-lying land and coastal wetlands in the direct path of Atlantic hurricanes. Already, people in some of the most industrialized areas of the state are dealing with contaminated drinking water and polluted air. They experience rates of cancer, asthma and other serious illnesses at many times the national average. Along the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, the rates are so severe that the area is known nationally as “Cancer Alley.”

We can only imagine the rates of cancer, respiratory, cardiovascular and other diseases if industry is allowed to pollute without regard for EPA oversight. As for a major hurricane hitting this area? I can promise you we can’t prepare for such an event or recover from it without a coordinated federal effort.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250517-st-louis-tornado-damage-wm-1131a-21c700.jpg",N,,2025-05-23 10:02:58.847813

The measure overturning the rule now goes to the White House, where Trump is expected to sign it, along with two other resolutions that would block California rules curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks. All three measures were approved by the Senate on Thursday and by the House earlier this month.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, and state air regulators say that what Congress is doing is illegal and they will sue to keep the rules in place.

“This is not about electric vehicles,” Newsom said at a news conference while the Senate was still voting on the measures. “This is about polluters being able to pollute more.”

California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state plans to sue over the way that Republicans passed the measures blocking the emissions rules. Senate Republicans established a narrow exception to the filibuster Wednesday to clear the way for the votes.

The GOP effort could have a profound impact on California’s longtime efforts to curb air pollution. California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends — especially because about a dozen states have already followed California’s lead. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.

Senate Democrats charged that Republicans are acting at the behest of the oil and gas industry and they say California should be able to set its own standards after obtaining waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency.

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the votes should “send a chill down the spine of legislators in every state.”

“What we have at stake is a state’s ability, it’s right to make its own laws and to protect its own citizens, without having this body overturn that right,” Schiff said.

Republicans say the phaseout of gas-powered cars, along with other waivers that California has obtained from the EPA, is costly for consumers and manufacturers, puts pressure on the nation’s energy grid and has become a de facto nationwide electric vehicle mandate.

“America cannot meet these impossible standards –- not next year, and not in 10 years,” said Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the second-ranking Republican.

Newsom announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles within 15 years as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.

The Biden administration approved the state’s waiver to implement the standards in December, a month before Trump returned to office. The California rules are stricter than a Biden-era rule that tightens emissions standards but does not require sales of electric vehicles.

Biden’s EPA said in announcing the decision that opponents of the California waivers did not meet their legal burden to show how either the EV rule or a separate measure on heavy-duty vehicles was inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.

Republicans have long criticized California’s waivers and have worked to find a way to overturn them. The Government Accountability Office said earlier this year that California’s policies are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows Congress to reject federal regulations under certain circumstances with a simple majority vote not subject to the filibuster. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that ruling, but Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., cleared the way for the votes anyway with a workaround that established a new Senate precedent.

Democrats fought those changes, which were the latest attempt to chip away at the Senate filibuster after both parties have used their majorities in the past two decades to lower the threshold for nominations. Democrats tried in 2022 to roll back the filibuster for legislation, as well, but were thwarted by members of their own caucus who disagreed with the effort.

Republicans have insisted that they would not try a similar move after regaining the majority this year. But Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the move to block California’s laws were a “point of no return” and called the Republicans “fair weather institutionalists.”

Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan was the only Democrat to support the measure to block the phaseout of gas-powered vehicles. She said in a statement after the vote that she has a “special responsibility to stand up for the more than one million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry.”

John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an auto industry association and lobby group, said there is a gap between the vehicles that car buyers are purchasing and the rules that would force a transition to electric vehicles.

“The fact is these EV sales mandates were never achievable,” Bozzella said.

By making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, she said the bill prevents a tax hike for 106,800 Iowa families and small businesses.
According to KFF, two-thirds of adults on Iowa Medicaid are already working.
More Iowa families will experience food insecurity and turn to food pantries already stretched thin and asked to do more with less.","Doctors, nurses, food bank directors and other social safety net providers across Iowa warn major cuts to public health insurance and food assistance programs could lead to crowded emergency rooms, more rural hospital closures, drained family budgets, overworked providers and reduce care for veterans, seniors and children.

House Republicans on Thursday, following a marathon all-night debate, narrowly passed a massive tax and spending bill as part of President Donald Trump's budget priorities.

All of Iowa's U.S. House members voted to pass President Donald Trump's ""one big, beautiful"" sweeping reconciliation bill.

The bill includes roughly $4.5 trillion in tax breaks passed during Trump's first term in 2017 that are set to expire this year, while temporarily adding new ones he campaigned on during his 2024 campaign, including no taxes on tips, overtime pay, car loan interest and others.

To make up for some of the lost tax revenue, the bill would cut an estimated $625 billion to Medicaid — the joint federal and state program that helps cover medical costs for low-income individuals, including the elderly and those with disabilities — and $300 billion to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps, over the next 10 years.

The cuts would largely be done by imposing work requirements on many of those receiving benefits. Able-bodied adults age 19-64 without dependents would need to work, volunteer or go to school for 80 hours a month in order to maintain them.

""They're going to keep scrutinizing and rescrutinizing who qualifies,"" said Patrick Kearns, of Iowa City, who has two adult children with disabilities who depend on Medicaid assistance to live independently. ""People are going to get excluded.""

The bill also would roll back green energy tax breaks from the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act and add $350 billion in new spending on border security, mass deportations and defense.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates 8.6 million fewer Americans would receive health care coverage and 3 million fewer people a month would receive food assistance under the proposed changes.

The CBO said the tax provisions would increase federal deficits by $3.8 trillion over the next decade, while the changes to Medicaid, food stamps and other services would lead to $1 trillion in reduced spending. The lowest income households in the U.S. would see their resources drop, while the highest ones would see a boost, it said.

A study done by Penn Wharton Budget Model found that people earning between $17,000 and $51,000 would see on average a $700 reduction in their income after taxes. People reporting less than $17,000 in income would see a reduction closer to $1,000 on average. People earning more, however, would see gains.

The predicted losses are primarily due to the cuts being made across federal agencies, and the benefits many lower-income Americans will see disappear because of them. Penn Wharton's analysis found increased cost of medical bills and food by losing access to programs will be far higher than the amount of money they'll receive through tax cuts.

By contrast, the top 0.1 percent of income earners, including those with incomes over $4.3 million, would gain on average more than $389,000 in after-tax income in 2026, mostly from a boost to corporate profits from extending the 2017 tax cuts, which may improve the value of their investments.

The bill now heads to the U.S. Senate, which is expected to make changes.

Iowa's Miller-Meeks, Hinson praise bill's passage

Iowa U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a Republican from Ottumwa and Davenport, voted for the cuts and sits on the Energy and Commerce committee, which played a crucial role in advancing the sweeping legislation to identify hundreds of billion in cuts over the next decade to programs it oversees, including Medicaid.

In a statement and social media post Thursday, Miller-Meeks praised the legislation as ""delivering tax relief for Iowa families and small businesses, preserving Medicaid for those for whom it was meant for, and real action to secure the border.""

She said it's now time ""for the Senate to step up and get this done!""

""As a former small business owner and Army veteran, I know what's at stake,"" Miller-Meeks said in a statement. ""This bill protects Iowa families, seniors, and small businesses while strengthening Medicaid for the vulnerable — not for those who can work and choose not to.""

By making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, she said the bill prevents a tax hike for 106,800 Iowa families and small businesses.

Kearns, the Iowa City parent, said Miller-Meeks' office had repeatedly reassured him and his family that there would be no cuts to Medicaid.

""She had a chance to stop it,"" Kearns said. ""She's voting against families like mine and a lot of other families in her district.""

He fears his 35-year-old daughter, who has autism but lives independently in an apartment, might be forced to return to Kearns' house, and that his 21-year-old son, who suffered a severe brain injury, might not be able to move into his own apartment as planned.

Kearns also is a 30-year nurse for the Iowa City VA Medical Center, which has suffered staffing cuts since Trump took office. The proposed Medicaid reductions would further affect veterans that require long-term care, he said, and might imperil struggling rural hospitals.

The bill also includes $46.5 billion to revive construction of Trump's wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and more money to expand detention capacity, hire more immigration enforcement agents and speed up deportations.

Also included are provisions pushed by Miller-Meeks she argues cracks down on ""waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid,"" and ""recommits"" those dollars to children, pregnant women, seniors, veterans and people with disabilities.

""Today's vote is a win for Iowa and for every American who believes in work, responsibility and a government that serves its people, not the other way around,"" Miller-Meeks said.

Iowa U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, a Republican from Marion, wrote in a post on X that the bill ""will fast-track our country back to prosperity and will be a huge part of President Trump's legacy.""

""Iowans overwhelmingly voted for President Trump's America First agenda — ending illegal immigration and preventing dangerous criminals and drugs from entering our communities, cutting wasteful spending and unleashing American energy,"" Hinson wrote. ""Throughout this process, I was proud to champion provisions to help working families keep more of their hard-earned dollars, including expanding the child tax credit, making small business tax cuts permanent, and eliminating taxes on tips.""

Democrats contend the legislation will drive up grocery and health care prices for regular Iowans to fund tax breaks for the well-off and well-connected.

Health care workers: Cuts may mean longer wait times, drives for care

Iowa health care officials warn the Medicaid cuts could lead to longer wait times in emergency rooms, longer drives to see health care providers and fewer options for mental health care and OBGYN services in rural areas that are already lacking.

Abby Butler, is a registered nurse at UnityPoint Health — Finley Hospital in Dubuque, and was on Capitol Hill last week to oppose cuts to Medicaid.

Butler, speaking to reporters Wednesday, said the proposed changes to Medicaid could lead to rural hospitals eliminating services or even closing completely.

""Many rural hospitals in Iowa are already currently functioning in a deficit and receive anywhere from 8 to 25 percent of their revenue from Medicaid,"" she said. ""With a decrease in this Medicaid funding, these hospitals may have to cut certain specialty services, such as (obstetrics) services, to be able to operate, which would have serious impacts on pregnant women in rural Iowa.""

Proposed cuts to Medicaid also could severely impact Iowa nursing homes, especially those relying on Medicaid reimbursement for a significant portion of their funding, Butler said.

Cuts also could affect seniors with Medicare who rely on Medicaid for long-term care. Medicare generally only covers a limited period of skilled nursing facility care, while Medicaid is a primary payer for ongoing long-term care services, including nursing home stays.

Medicaid covers nearly 40 percent of all births in Iowa, and 50 percent of people who live in nursing homes are enrolled in Medicaid. Iowa also has the highest percentage of nonelderly recipients who need Medicaid to pay for mental health care.

""This could affect people from receiving proper care even with private insurance,"" Butler said. ""We need to remember that patients on Medicaid are not just numbers on the paper. They are people who deserve the right access to health coverage. These cuts will affect everyone in the community, no matter your political stance, income or background. We will all feel, see and hear the effects of these cuts.""

States take on more costs for SNAP, Medicaid under federal bill

The proposed changes to SNAP and Medicaid will shift much of the costs to states that will grapple with the additional financial burden of administering the safety net programs, said Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, former administrator of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) under Democratic former President Joe Biden.

According to the nonprofit health care advocacy and reporting organization KFF, Iowa would lose $518 million in federal Medicaid funding, representing a 25 percent cut to state spending per resident.

That will force states to make tough choices: maintain current spending on Medicaid by raising taxes or reducing spending on other programs; or cut Medicaid spending by covering fewer people, offering fewer benefits or paying providers less, Brooks-LaSure said.

KFF estimates between 64,000 and 107,000 Iowans would lose Medicaid coverage.

Anne Discher, executive director of Common Good Iowa, notes state lawmakers this moth approved a budget that calls for using the state's various surpluses and reserve funds to cover an estimated $917 million budget shortfall. The governor's office anticipates needing to tap surpluses to balance the budget in the foreseeable future due to declining revenues from state income tax cuts, ""and that is without taking into account any big Medicaid changes.""

Brooks-LaSure, speaking to reporters Thursday, also warned the legislation will destabilize the health insurance marketplace created under the Affordable Care Act and lead to significant increases in premiums and out-of-pocket costs for millions of Americans.

""Both Medicaid and marketplaces are fundamental and foundational in helping millions of Americans live a healthy life, and they are also vital to our economy by keeping our hospitals — especially rural ones — open, and bolstering our health care workforce,"" she said.

Additionally, requiring states to implement work requirements for low-income adults under Iowa's Medicaid expansion group, will increase barriers to enrolling in and renewing Medicaid coverage, leading to higher rates of Iowans without health insurance coverage, Brooks-LaSure said.

Another KFF analysis estimated around 56,000 people in Iowa would become uninsured under the House bill. The higher uninsured rates among Iowa patients will place increased strain on community health centers and rural health care systems, which are already caring for a higher percentage of uninsured or underinsured patients, Brooks-LaSure said.

She and Butler said past evidence in Georgia and Arkansas shows work requirements are ineffective, costly and disproportionately harm vulnerable populations. They contend the requirements ignore real-world barriers to employment, and ultimately lead to coverage loss for eligible individuals through increased red tape and paperwork required for Medicaid enrollment.

According to KFF, two-thirds of adults on Iowa Medicaid are already working. Among those not working are caregivers, full-time students and Iowans with a chronic health condition or disability that prevents them from working but who do not meet the strict requirements for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits.

About 8 percent of Medicaid adults reported that they are retired, unable to find work, or were not working for another reason.

Additionally, the proposed changes would shift a chunk of SNAP funding from the federal government to states, starting in 2028. The bill also would expand the program's preexisting work requirements to include parents of school-age children and some older adults.

Each state's share of the cost would be calculated according to how often it overpays or underpays program participants. All states would have to shoulder at least 5 percent of the cost, while the most error-prone states would pay 25 percent. The proposal also cuts federal funding states receive to administer the program.

An estimate from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that Iowa would be responsible for at least $26 million of program costs by fiscal year 2028 under changes made in the bill. At the highest share, Iowa would pay an additional $131 million, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Such changes would significantly impact Iowa's budget, and likely lead to dramatic cuts in assistance at a time when food insecurity across the state is on the rise and food banks are seeing record demand, said Luke Elzinga, board chair of the Iowa Hunger Coalition and policy and advocacy manager at the DMARC Food Pantry Network.

The federally funded program provides money to more than 40 million people in eligible low-income households — mostly older adults, people with disabilities and families with children — to help buy groceries. About one in 12, or more than 259,000, Iowans were enrolled in SNAP at the end of last year. Of those, 64 percent of SNAP participants are families with children, 35 percent are families with members who are older adults or are disabled, and 50 percent are in working families.

""This will only make food insecurity in the state of Iowa worse,"" Elzinga said. ""There is incredible strain already on food banks and food pantries across the state, and resilience is wearing thin. More Iowa families will experience food insecurity and turn to food pantries already stretched thin and asked to do more with less.

""… This bill is essentially taking from the poor to give to the rich.""",https://insurancenewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/inn-social-default.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 12:23:48.267966

Jones/Floodlight,,,,,https://floodlightnews.org/environmental-groups-sue-over-louisianas-ban-on-community-air-monitoring/,"The law they passed prohibits data collected from community-run air monitoring programs from being used in enforcement, lawsuits or regulatory actions.
Chet Wayland, former director of the EPA’s Air Quality Assessment Division, said most states’ air monitoring systems are designed to meet the minimum standards for ambient air.
“I felt the (task force) report…missed the mark somewhat in terms of garnering the full value of community air monitoring,” Benforado said.
“Their definition of community air monitoring was how a state government runs community air monitoring.
There was less emphasis on engaging the community as equal participants in an air monitoring program.”","Six grassroots environmental groups filed a federal lawsuit this week that takes aim at a 2024 Louisiana law that essentially crippled community-based air monitoring in the state.

The suit, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana, calls the law an “industry-friendly ban” that bars groups from using their own independent air monitoring systems to warn residents living in fenceline communities about potential health risks.

“Our legislature and officials should do everything in their power to stop industry from polluting our air in the first place,” said Joy Banner, co-founder of The Descendants Project, one of the six plaintiffs in the lawsuit. “To attack our First Amendment rights instead is arcane, illegal and dangerous.”

The coalition’s lawsuit argues that Louisiana’s air monitoring law suppresses evidence collected by more affordable air quality monitoring equipment that they use to help “fenceline” communities better understand the quality of the air they’re breathing.

The lawsuit alleges the law does this by preventing the use of this data to allege air quality violations, with penalties of up to $32,500 a day, plus $1 million for intentional violations. The plaintiffs argue this violates their right to free speech.

The lawsuit comes at a time when a new report from a special legislative task force is urging Louisiana lawmakers to invest millions more in monitoring and real-time notification of hazardous emissions in communities hardest hit by pollution.

The Bayou State is one of the most industrialized in the United States, with 476 major air pollution sources — including petroleum, chemical, plastics and sugar facilities — as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The recommendations from a special legislative task force come nearly a year after lawmakers crippled Louisiana grassroot organizations’ efforts to do their own analysis of air quality. The law they passed prohibits data collected from community-run air monitoring programs from being used in enforcement, lawsuits or regulatory actions.

The task force was made up of state environmental officials, industry lobbyists and representatives from the nonprofit environmental group that was a target of the new law, which set standards for air monitoring so high that grassroots groups can’t meet them.

The report submitted last month to the House and Senate legislative environmental committees recommends that lawmakers spend at least $13 million to establish a more robust and localized air monitoring and notification system within the state’s Department of Environmental Quality.

LDEQ’s current system consists of 29 continuous monitoring sites that report annually to the EPA and track real-time data on emissions — including particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. It also operates seven non-continuous monitoring sites that help the agency track long-term trends in air quality. And it has four temporary monitoring sites that can be strategically placed in areas of concern, generally collecting a year of data in each location.

The report recommends that LDEQ place additional air monitors near the top polluting industrial facilities in the state based on the volume and toxicity of their emissions and their proximity to “fenceline” communities. The committee estimated these regulatory monitors would cost nearly $800,000 per site and between $150,000 to $200,000 in annual operating and maintenance expenses.

It suggested the state could locate them near 10% to 20% of Louisiana’s major air pollution sources — which would mean tens of millions of dollars just in capital costs.

In addition to more monitoring, the task force recommends a notification system capable of blasting out real-time text and phone call alerts about possible air quality dangers to nearby residents. Such a notification system has an estimated price tag of $5.2 million for initial set up and annual maintenance.

The recommendations would require LDEQ to hire 48 new people, to join the team of seven currently dedicated to overseeing the data collected by the existing network of monitoring sites, at an annual cost of about $8.2 million.

Louisiana leaders mum on more monitoring

But there’s no indication yet from state leaders or LDEQ that money will be allocated to implement the report’s recommendations. The Republican chairs of Louisiana’s Senate Environmental Quality Committee and House committee on Natural Resources and Environment did not respond to questions from Floodlight about the report. Inquiries to officials with LDEQ also went unanswered.

“I would hope that the Legislature would believe that having information that affects people's health, affects workers’ health and affects communities would be an important priority for them,” said Marylee Orr, executive director of the Louisiana Environmental Action Network (LEAN).

LEAN had a seat on the 11-member task force that drafted the report. The organization received $500,000 in federal funding allocated for community-run air monitoring programs in former President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

LEAN used the money to deploy a fleet of mobile air-monitoring vehicles that collected samples along the Mississippi River area in southwest Louisiana known as “Cancer Alley.” The group also has partnered with a bulk storage facility for liquids — including ethanol, diesel and other petroleum products — in St. Rose, Louisiana, to monitor air quality in nearby neighborhoods.

Localized, coordinated air monitoring efforts like LEAN’s have been a tool marginalized communities overburdened by polluting industries have tried to demonstrate air quality problems and push state leaders for tougher regulations and enforcement of the Clean Air Act.

Orr said LEAN favors this latest step urging the Legislature to act but, “I don't know where the money's going to be coming from.”

Current system seen as inadequate

Environmental advocates have long criticized Louisiana’s existing air monitoring system, calling it insufficient to accurately measure pollution since there aren’t enough monitors located where air quality is the most compromised.

The state ranks fourth highest among 56 states and territories for toxic emissions per square mile, according to EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory. Roughly 400 Louisiana facilities emitted 132 million pounds of toxic pollution in 2022.

Chet Wayland, former director of the EPA’s Air Quality Assessment Division, said most states’ air monitoring systems are designed to meet the minimum standards for ambient air. That means not necessarily putting them near industrial facilities, but rather in more densely populated places to measure air pollutants including particulate matter, ozone and sulfur dioxide, he said.

Wayland said states can increase air quality oversight through community-based air monitors. He said such localized air monitoring, as California and New York use, is the best way to track the emissions of the more dangerous air toxins like benzene, toluene, heavy metals and industrial solvents.

“We all would love to see more data available. Clearly we can't monitor every single place that we should be monitoring. The resources aren't there from the federal standpoint and — I get it — they're not there from the state standpoint as well,” Wayland said.

He said a “smart strategy” would be to place monitors in places where people are more likely to be exposed to harmful air pollutants, adding, “It would be nice to have some indication of what the air quality is in those areas.”

The task force report also suggests supplementing new monitors with air quality sensors that are cheaper and could detect pollutants wafting through communities. The report acknowledges these air sensors are “prone to inaccuracies” and are most useful for offering general insight into air quality — not as a resource for enforcement.

Future of federal funding in question

Nationally, approximately $117 million was earmarked in the IRA for state, local governments, tribal nations and community groups to implement, upgrade and continue various air monitoring programs in fenceline communities.

But Romany Webb, deputy director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, noted that Congress is currently considering a budget proposal that seeks to repeal a lot of those funds and clawback any unobligated money across all IRA-funded initiatives.

“But, as I'm sure you know, the bill still has to pass the Senate and is likely to change (perhaps significantly) before that happens,” Webb said.

EPA spokesperson Shayla Powell said the agency is “reviewing all of its grant programs” to gauge whether they are an “appropriate use of taxpayer dollars” and “align with” the current administration’s policies.

She added, “Maybe the Biden-Harris administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

Jay Benforado, board chair for the Association for Advancing Participatory Sciences, said all signals from the current administration lead him to think that community air monitoring won’t survive.

As for the task force report, Benforado said its recommendations failed to factor in the valuable role that community members, volunteers and academics could play in monitoring air quality.

“I felt the (task force) report…missed the mark somewhat in terms of garnering the full value of community air monitoring,” Benforado said. “Their definition of community air monitoring was how a state government runs community air monitoring. There was less emphasis on engaging the community as equal participants in an air monitoring program.”",https://floodlightnews.org/content/images/size/w1200/2025/05/Flaring_neighborhood.png,N,,2025-05-23 11:09:41.373845

Now the House Republicans’ reconciliation bill is poised to also have a drastic impact on the economy and clean energy landscape, but by gutting the IRA’s gains. Instead of fostering jobs and clean energy development, the bill—which passed the House this week and has now moved to the Senate—could erase those monumental investments and lead to fewer jobs, reduced clean energy capacity, and a drop in the national GDP.

The GOP’s “big, beautiful bill” will increase some things, experts say, like Americans’ household expenses; it will also give tax benefits to billionaires. “House Republicans just voted to jack up prices, kill jobs, and rip away basic lifelines from working families by taking a sledgehammer to programs and investments that make life more affordable,” Lena Moffitt, executive director of the nonprofit Evergreen Action, said in a statement. “If passed into law, Americans will wake up to find the GOP quietly reached into their wallets and handed their hard-earned cash to corporate polluters and billionaires like Elon Musk and Donald Trump.”

Here’s a look at the impact of the Republican reconciliation bill by the numbers, specifically around jobs, clean energy, and household costs.

The GOP’s reconciliation bill could cost the U.S. more than 830,000 jobs in 2030, according to an analysis from Energy Innovation. (That includes both direct job cuts from less EV production and clean energy manufacturing, as well as indirect losses from higher fuel costs and other economic impacts.)

It would also lead to less new electricity generation, especially at a time when electricity demand is growing. Over the next four years, the bill would decrease additions to new electricity capacity by 302 gigawatts. That’s the same power capacity that the entire U.S. coal fleet had a decade ago. For context, 1 gigawatt can power 100 million LED light bulbs.

With less new electricity being generated, wholesale power prices will increase about 50% by 2035, particularly because solar and wind are cheaper energy sources than fossil fuels. Across all American households, consumer energy costs will increase by more than $16 billion in 2030, and by more than $33 billion by 2035. “This increase happens even if oil and gas production rise and help reduce fossil fuel prices, as envisioned by the bill,” Energy Innovation notes. Between 2026 and 2034, the bill would cumulatively reduce the national GDP by nearly $1.1 trillion.

For individual households, that could mean a $110 increase to electricity costs per year, beginning in 2026, which could then rise to $290 more in annual energy costs per household by 2035.

The GOP bill will drive up household costs for Americans in other ways, too. The price of gasoline will increase between 25 and 37 cents per gallon, which, on the higher end, would mean more than $200 per year for the average gas vehicle. Without the IRA’s EV tax credits, Americans will also essentially see the cost of electric vehicles go up by at least $7,500 (and for used EVs, $4,000).

The Republican bill also eliminates a tax credit for energy-efficient home improvements like heat pumps and water heaters. That credit has so far allowed households to save up to $990 each year on their utility bills, but Americans will now miss out on those savings.

The bill has broader impacts on emissions and how climate change will worsen. Without tax credits to spur investments in clean energy and efficient appliances, the bill could increase greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 130 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent in 2030—like adding 30 million gas-powered cars to the road for one year. By 2035, that could grow to nearly 260 million metric tons, equivalent to the annual energy use of nearly 35 million homes—or the entire annual CO2 emissions from Spain.

With more emissions and air pollution come more deaths. According to Energy Innovation, that could mean nearly 350 additional premature deaths annually by 2030, and nearly 670 more every year by 2035.

Many of these impacts will be concentrated in Republican states. The IRA was a huge boon to Republican districts: In just two years, it added nearly 200,000 clean energy jobs and more than $286 billion in clean energy investments to congressional districts represented by Republican House members. Now those districts will likely see job losses and less economic investment because of their Republican representatives’ votes. “In their crusade to rig the system for their fossil fuel backers,” Moffitt said prior to the House bill passing, “it’s people living in Trump states—their own voters—who will pay the steepest price: lost jobs, higher energy costs, and missed economic opportunities.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/05/p-1-91339724-gop-bill-by-the-numbers.jpg",N,,2025-05-23 07:07:07.355280

Community monitors can be particularly important during accidents at nearby industrial plants and other sources, he said.","Since 2022, residents of St. James Parish, along the heavily industrialized banks of the Mississippi River known as “Cancer Alley,” have used low-cost monitors to measure air pollution.

But a new law in Louisiana makes it illegal to use that data to push for stricter pollution controls or enforcement.

The law requires people to instead buy expensive air-pollution monitors that meet strict Environmental Protection Agency standards, if they’re going to use the data to allege violations of clean air laws. People who don’t comply face penalties of thousands of dollars a day.

Now, community groups are fighting the law, saying in a federal lawsuit filed Thursday against Louisiana that it violates their constitutional right to free speech. The law enables polluting industries “to silence the science,” said Caitlion Hunter, director of research and policy at RISE St. James, which leads the air-monitoring efforts.

The Louisiana law was the first of its kind in the country when it went into effect last year. But Kentucky passed a similar law this year and West Virginia’s legislature debated a version in February, though it did not pass.

The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality declined to comment. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill did not respond to requests for comment.

Community air monitoring proliferated across the country under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which made $81 million in grants available for monitoring projects. That came as part of efforts by Congress to help protect communities of color and lower-income neighborhoods, like St. James Parish, which bear a disproportionate burden of industrial air pollution.

In St. James Parish, RISE has used a brand of sensor called PurpleAir, which cost less than $300, to monitor for particulate matter, which are emitted from power plants, construction sites and industrial facilities and can trigger heart attacks and respiratory problems like asthma. The sensors were placed at the homes of people living near chemical facilities, Ms. Hunter said. The region also has some of the highest rates of cancer in the country.

Under the new Louisiana law, the group is no longer allowed to publicly discuss data or file complaints using information from PurpleAir sensors. The group says it would instead have to use government-approved particulate monitors that cost almost $60,000 each, beyond their financial reach.

RISE has been tracking spikes in fine particulate matter pollution. This kind of pollution also known as PM 2.5, is made up of solid particles less than 2.5 micrometers in size, which are small enough to enter the bloodstream when inhaled. PM 2.5 is the deadliest form of air pollution, leading to millions of premature deaths each year.

The group had intended to use the data to oppose a plastics plant proposed by Formosa Plastics Group, a Taiwanese plastics manufacturer, Ms. Hunter said. The data showed elevated levels of PM 2.5 in St. James Parish, where several petrochemicals plants already operate.

Industry groups that backed the law, known as the Community Air Monitoring Reliability Act, say it ensures data integrity.

The Louisiana Chemical Association said the standards didn’t stop anyone from tracking pollution levels, as long as the data didn’t trigger enforcement or penalties, or form the basis of a lawsuit.

“Air monitoring is a precise science, and decisions based on that data carry serious consequences,” said David Cresson, president and chief executive of the association, which represents Louisiana’s petrochemical industries. “The goal of this law is not to silence community voices, but to ensure that regulatory action is based on high-quality, validated science.”

PurpleAir didn’t respond to questions about the law and the accuracy of its product.

The law has sent “a chilling effect” through community groups, said Joy Banner, co-founder of The Descendants Project, an environmental group that supports people descended from slaves in Louisiana. The group recently paused plans to publicize more data from its air monitors, she said.

“We simply cannot afford $30,000-plus fines,” she said. “The law has been unfortunately very effective. It’s scaring us away from being able to share the data with our community members who need it the most.”

Peter DeCarlo, an air pollution scientist at Johns Hopkins University, said low-cost sensors like PurpleAir played a critical role in helping communities track air pollutants like PM 2.5, as well as other chemical emissions that aren’t tracked by regulators.

Even his own pollution data from cutting-edge mobile labs and sensors might be prohibited from public disclosure under the new law, he said.

Community monitors can be particularly important during accidents at nearby industrial plants and other sources, he said. “While they are not as accurate as regulatory monitors, they are able to provide real-time information to communities in the places they live and breathe,” he said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/22/multimedia/22cli-pollution-speech-01-hmpt/22cli-pollution-speech-01-hmpt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 10:03:05.456192

The finding marks a potential increase from geothermal’s current contribution of less than 1% to the national power supply.

The recent assessment by the USGS, which updates the organisation’s 2008 findings, suggests that with the commercial-scale deployment and the continued success of evolving technologies, geothermal energy could see a substantial rise in its share of the US power generation.

These technologies have been refined over the past decades within both the geothermal sector and the oil and gas industries.

Currently, most geothermal power is produced from hydrothermal systems, where groundwater naturally flows through heated rocks.

The Great Basin of Nevada and adjacent parts of the states of California, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming and Utah, contain vast areas with heat trapped in impermeable rock.

To harness this energy, engineers are developing enhanced geothermal systems that involve creating fractures in the impermeable rock to allow water to circulate and bring the heat to the surface. There, it can be used to generate electricity.

The significance of the Great Basin’s geothermal potential is rooted in its history. It was one of the last regions in the lower 48 states to be mapped in the 1800s, and the geological surveys of its public lands eventually led to the establishment of the USGS in 1879.

USGS acting director Sarah Ryker stated: “USGS assessments of energy resources are about the future.

“We focus on undiscovered resources that have yet to be fully explored, let alone developed. We launched this work in the Great Basin because of the area’s history of geothermal activity – and we found even more potential for baseload power than had previously been known. Leveraging this work along with artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques will help us assess the entire nation’s potential for geothermal energy with greater speed and accuracy.”

The Energy Act of 2020 has since directed the USGS to evaluate the nation’s geothermal energy potential comprehensively.

To carry out this directive, the USGS and its partners have developed new heat flow maps, underground temperature maps and methods to estimate the efficiency of energy extraction and conversion from heat to electricity.

A marathon session that began Wednesday resulted in 1,100-plus page legislation that curbs billions of dollars in spending across food assistance, student loans, Medicaid and action to address climate change.

The bill, which now heads to the Senate, repeals or phases out more quickly clean energy tax credits passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act during former President Joe Biden’s term. Biden’s climate law has been considered monumental for the clean energy transition, but the House bill effectively renders moot much of the law’s incentives for renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Clean energy advocates said the bill walks back the largest government investment in clean energy in history.

“In a bid to cut taxes for billionaires and provide a grab bag of goodies to Big Oil, the majority in the House took a sledgehammer to clean energy tax credits and to the protection of our public lands,” said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“These credits are delivering billions of dollars in new investments in homegrown American energy -- creating jobs, lowering energy costs and addressing the climate crisis that is fueling floods, fires and heat waves,’' Goldfuss said.

President Donald Trump celebrated the bill’s passage, calling it “arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country.” Trump appealed to the Senate to pass the measure as soon as possible and send it to his desk.

The Senate hopes to wrap up its version by early July. At least four Republican senators, led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have urged continuation of energy tax credits, including support for traditional and renewable energy sources. Republican-led states and Congressional districts have benefited from billions of dollars in clean energy manufacturing investments spurred by the Biden-era subsidies.

Full-scale repeal of current credits “could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,’' the senators said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.

“A wholesale repeal, or the termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing ... job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy,” the senators wrote in the April 9 letter. The letter was also signed by GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas.

In a win for House moderates and some Western lawmakers, the House bill strips language that would have allowed the sale of hundreds of thousands acres of public lands in Utah and Nevada. Opponents argued the sales would have opened the door for more oil and gas drilling.

What was gutted in the bill

The House bill takes an axe to tax credits for rooftop solar installments and eliminates electric vehicle tax credits after 2025, with a one-year exception for EVs manufactured by automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 cars that qualified for the credit.

Credits for solar and electric vehicles, which reduce harmful emissions, help to boost demand for the technologies and drive down their cost.

House Republicans also tightened tax credit restrictions for projects associated with foreign entities, including China — an added blow to domestic clean energy expansion since China dominates much of the supply chain.

The bill slashes a three-year phase-down schedule previously proposed, and instead cuts off projects that don’t start construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage. Those projects would also have to start operating before 2029.

“This bill threatens the clean energy industry at a time when it’s proving to be not only economically beneficial — lowering costs, creating jobs and fueling local economies — but also essential to America’s energy future,” said Andrew Reagan, president of Clean Energy for America, an industry group.

The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry, applauded the bill as a step to “restore American energy dominance.”

“By preserving competitive tax policies, opening lease sales” for oil and gas drilling and advancing permitting reforms, the legislation “is a win for our nation’s energy future,” API President Mike Sommers said in a statement.

No sale of public lands

At the behest of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke and some other Republicans, lawmakers stripped a provision that would have sold or transferred about 460,000 acres (186,155 hectares) of federal land in Nevada and Utah to local governments or private entities.

The proposal exposed sharp divisions between Western Republicans who say the federal government controls too much of their states and others such as Zinke, a former Interior secretary in Trump’s first term whose state is protective of access to lands for hunting and recreation.

“At the heart of the matter is that public land that’s in the federal estate belongs to everybody,” Zinke told The Associated Press Thursday. “To suggest that you’re going to sell land to pay off the debt, I think that’s misguided and, quite frankly, disingenuous.”

The land sales had been inserted in the bill following a late-night committee vote, despite earlier pledges from Republican leaders that the sales were off the table.

Supporters said they would generate revenue and ease growth pressures by creating room for more and cheaper housing in booming Western cities such as Las Vegas, Reno, Nevada, and St. George, Utah. Those communities are hemmed in by federal property, which makes up 80% of the land in Nevada and 63% in Utah.

A spokesperson for Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, who sponsored the bid to sell federal lands in his state, said his office was “exploring all options” to make the transfers happen.

Housing advocates had cautioned federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing, and some of the parcels to be sold were far from developed areas.

Tracy Stone-Manning, president of the Wilderness Society and a former director of the Bureau of Land Management under Biden, said she appreciated Zinke’s work to prevent the public lands sale.

But she said the bill was still a “big giveaway” to the private sector. “By opening hundreds of millions of acres to drilling, mining and logging to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, this bill harms the tens of millions of people who like to hike, recreate or find solace in the outdoors,” she said.

Trump targets Biden’s climate policy

At the same time the bill slashes support for clean energy, it paves the way for oil, gas and coal.

Through the bill, natural gas pipeline developers can pay a $10 million fee for expedited permitting, and applicants for a potential liquefied natural gas export site can pay a $1 million fee to be deemed in the “public interest,” circumventing what is usually a regulatory challenge.

DNR officials said they will work on a framework with community and state lawmaker input for future consideration of siting solar power projects.

The Michigan Department of Natural Resources will continue its halt on any new utility-scale solar projects on state-managed forestlands as it works on a framework for how to consider such projects.

The policy change was made quietly earlier this month, without a public announcement. DNR spokesman Ed Golder said the agency made the policy change known via a May 9 email from DNR Director Scott Bowen to ""a number of interested groups and to legislators who have contacted us"" about a controversial proposal to lease 420 acres of state-managed forest land near Gaylord for a solar development in Otsego County's Hayes Township.

That project, which raised some public ire over the removal of acres of trees to make way for a private company's solar panels, was scuttled when the company involved, RWE Clean Energy out of San Diego, decided not to pursue additional development on the state land in Hayes Township. But the DNR in January proceeded to pursue a request for proposals to lease the land and evaluate its viability for solar, possibly with another company.

In his May 9 email, Bowen announced that the DNR ""will not move forward"" with utility-scale solar development on the 420 acres in Hayes Township.

""The DNR made this decision following a four-month public comment period, and consultation with legislators and interested groups,"" Bowen stated. ""We heard a significant amount of concern from the public, stakeholders and some lawmakers regarding the prospect of siting solar panels on 420 acres of partially forested land.""

Bowen added that DNR ""will maintain a pause on any new utility-scale solar projects on state forestlands"" until the agency develops ""a specific framework for decision making if leasing lands for additional solar development were to be considered in the future.""

""As part of this framework, the DNR will solicit input from local communities and lawmakers early in the process if solar development is being considered,"" he stated.

'We’re not talking pristine forestlands here'

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's MI Healthy Climate Plan, an effort to combat human-driven climate change enacted in 2020, calls for 100% carbon neutrality by 2050 and 60% renewable energy in Michigan by 2030. How reachable those goals will be without state land involvement to build large solar farms is uncertain.

""I think there are potential avenues to meet those goals, but it certainly becomes a lot harder if you take these publicly managed lands off the table,"" said Ashley Rudzinski, climate and environment program director with the Groundwork Center for Resilient Communities, a Traverse City-based nonprofit organization with goals to ""protect the environment, strengthen the economy, and build thriving communities.""

The center on its website is urging Michigan residents to ask the state to continue support solar leasing on public lands.

""There’s a fairly strong precedent for using lands that are already disturbed or marginal lands,"" Rudzinski said. ""We’re not talking pristine forestlands here; we are talking areas that are adjacent to highways or industrial sites.

""We have to recognize that for us to combat the challenges that are very real that we are facing with the climate crisis, we need to be able to make some of these challenging decisions ... including using some of these already disturbed lands for these types of practices.""

State Rep. Ken Borton, R-Gaylord, was among the first to sound public alarms over the proposed Hayes Township state forestland being used for utility-scale solar, prompting an outcry. He said DNR forestry officials contacted him in the days leading up to Bowen's May 9 email, and Borton said he was told the DNR was stopping solar project siting on state forest lands altogether.

""The memo (DNR Director Bowen) made is nothing like what we talked about,"" Borton said. ""I am extremely unhappy at this point, and I made it very clear to the department: There will be no more solar going up on publicly owned lands.""

The many uses of state forestland

The DNR manages 4.6 million acres of public land for uses including forestry, public recreation, hunting, fishing and wildlife habitat management. The agency historically has leased portions of public lands for a variety of perceived public goods, including industrial development.

""Lands managed by the DNR host hydrocarbon processing facilities, pipelines and flowlines, mines, sand and gravel pits, an asphalt plant and cell phone towers,"" Bowen stated in his May 9 memo.

The state has pledged to use no more than 4,000 acres of state-managed public land for solar development, and Bowen noted that some 350,000 acres of state-managed land is currently leased for gas an oil wells. Since 1928, more than 10,000 drilling permits have been issued on state-managed forestland.

""With the state shifting toward more renewable energy options the DNR is seeking to be part of the state's transition to cleaner energy,"" Bowen stated.

But oil and gas development and utility-scale solar farms are not analogous, Borton said.

""I live in northern Michigan, there are gas sites all over, including next to the property I own,"" he said. ""Those gas sites take up almost no property whatsoever. They are not fenced in; they are not blocked off. They do not stop wildlife from passing through.""

Borton said degraded state sites like brownfields or small solar projects at state fish hatcheries to provide energy to the facilities may still make sense. But ""any industrial projects where they are coming in and clearing forest, I'm going to be opposed to it,"" he said.

Two utility-scale solar projects already in the works on state-managed property will continue, Bowen stated: the Groveland mine tailings site, a 264-acre site in the Upper Peninsula's Dickinson County; and the Roscommon Conservation Airport site, on 1,050 acres of DNR-managed public land in Roscommon County's Higgins Township near Interstate 75 and the DNR Conservation Airport. The maximum buildable area for solar panels on that project would be 570 acres, DNR officials earlier said.

The collapse of the coal industry, the opioid crisis and the recurring natural disasters have left scars that are slow to heal. Families and individual households trying to make ends meet rely on an array of federal assistance.

Recently, there have been cuts or threats to these assistance programs, including a proposed total elimination of a vital energy assistance program that supports 6 million low-income households each year across the country.

The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is zeroed out in the proposed federal budget for the fiscal year that begins in September 2025. LIHEAP provides life-saving aid to millions of Americans by helping them afford their heating and cooling bills. For many, it is the difference between choosing food or heat, medicine or air conditioning.

In 2024 alone, the program was utilized more than 219,000 times by Kentucky households. These are small disbursements — a max of $250 per season — that function as safety nets for working families, elderly residents and people with disabilities who are trying to survive on limited incomes in one of the most energy-burdened regions in the country.

Despite this need, the Trump administration’s 2026 budget proposes defunding LIHEAP entirely. Their reasoning is that lower energy prices are on the horizon thanks to a move toward American energy dominance and the America First platform. But here in Kentucky, the future hasn’t arrived yet. Energy bills are still going up, not down.

In some Eastern Kentucky counties, low-income families pay up to 14.5% of their income on utility bills — more than double the 6% threshold that experts define as a “high” energy burden. Rural residents, especially those living in older, less energy-efficient homes, feel this pain the most. Rural areas often pay disproportionately high electricity costs due to utilities charging higher rates, in part due to infrastructure costs utilities incur covering more miles of transmission lines, etc., and in part due to utilities being owned by investors who are guaranteed a certain rate of return on their investment.

And while some cities have access to local programs that might soften the blow of high bills, rural communities often don’t. That’s where LIHEAP comes in. It funds weatherization improvements that make homes more efficient — reducing future energy costs and minimizing the need for repeated emergency assistance. In fiscal year 2023, the program weatherized more than 60,000 homes nationwide and helped prevent countless power disconnections.

The federal government allocated approximately $54 million in LIHEAP funds to Kentucky in fiscal year 2025. To access these funds, individuals must meet certain requirements and provide documentation showing their need for assistance. These requirements are designed to support Kentucky’s most vulnerable residents and some examples include households where someone has a health condition or disability (verified by a doctor’s note), someone is 65 or older, or a child under the age of 6 is present.

This money is especially important during the extreme summer and winter temperatures Kentucky experiences. Kentucky is one of just 10 states where utility shutoffs due to nonpayment are allowed even during dangerous weather events. Sometimes families are cut off because they owe as little as $6.

Cutting LIHEAP cannot just be a budget decision — this is an issue that needs to consider the survival of our most vulnerable neighbors. Because it’s so critical, the program is housed under the Department of Health and Human Services and has received bipartisan support for nearly 45 years.

The Trump administration recently acknowledged that Appalachia is at a disadvantage due to loss of coal jobs and the opioid crisis, and because of that, it was leaving funding for another program in the budget that benefits this area. We argue that many low-income communities across the country face similar systemic challenges that have them needing a little extra help to stay and revitalize these areas of the United States.

Earlier Wednesday evening, Garbarino raised concerns about the energy provisions and the country’s ability to meet its growing energy demand.
“We can’t meet that demand if we’re pulling energy projects off the table here.","Despite insisting for months they wanted green energy tax credits to be handled with a scalpel in their sweeping reconciliation measure, moderate Republicans ultimately accepted a sledgehammer against the subsidies.

Most of the 13 members who warned the original text of President Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” could “provoke an energy crisis or cause higher energy bills for working families,” ultimately voted to support it after it got even stricter as part of a deal to win over conservative hard-liners.

The legislation cleared the House 215-214 early Friday morning and now heads to the Senate.

“Those are pragmatic individuals that know that they have to get something done,” said Andrew Mills, managing director at American Conservation Coalition Action, a right-of-center environmental group.

“Just given the political realities of this bill and the situation, I don’t think it’s too surprising,” Mills said. He added, however, that he expects to see changes on the Senate side, saying, “There’s a group of senators that care about these tax credits.”

For months, the House has been in a tug-of-war as to whether to take a “scalpel” approach and make fine changes to energy tax credits passed in Democrats’ massive 2022 climate, tax and health care bill, or whether to use a “sledgehammer” and largely eliminate all the credits.

Where they ultimately landed makes significant cuts: saying that tax credits for many low-carbon energy sources including wind and solar will only apply to projects that start construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage and only to those that begin producing electricity by 2029.

Lawmakers, however, added a carve-out for nuclear energy, which will only need to begin construction rather than begin producing electricity by the end of 2028 to receive the tax credit.

The bill also includes strict provisions excluding projects that use any Chinese components, minerals or subcomponents for projects that start construction after the end of this year. This is a massive obstacle, as China is a major minerals processing hub.

Despite these provisions, which were largely a win for the party’s right flank, their moderate counterparts still lined up to support the bill.

Some GOP lawmakers said the hard-fought increase on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction was likely a higher priority.

Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.), who was also among the lawmakers who raised concerns on the tax credit provisions, posted on the social platform X that SALT was his “number one focus in Washington.”

Rep. Young Kim (R-Calif.) similarly cited the SALT changes in a statement outlining her support for the legislation.

Others simply expressed support for the bill overall, which extends tax cuts passed under Trump’s first term in 2017 and increases funding for the border and deportations.

Rep Don Bacon (R-Neb.) called the package “not perfect” but touted his support for other provisions such as the tax cuts.

Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va.) whose district is home to a major wind project in progress, released a statement saying she supported the bill overall, though she had harsh words for its approach to the energy tax credits.

“This bill isn’t perfect — but it’s a serious, solutions-focused package that delivers for our health care system, our military, and the American taxpayer,” Kiggans said.

However, she added that “rather than responsibly phasing out clean electricity incentives, the bill abruptly ends support after 2028 and eliminates tax credits for leased systems often used by schools, local governments, and homeowners. These changes jeopardize local jobs, limit community access to affordable energy, and undercut innovation — especially in regions like ours, where energy resilience and national defense go hand in hand.”

Ultimately, Kiggans said she hoped changes would be made to the bill on the Senate side.

Four Republican senators — enough to block the bill if they’re willing to go to the mat on the issue — have called for “a targeted, pragmatic approach” on the credits.

It’s not entirely clear, however, what specific policies these lawmakers would like to see or how hard they or other like-minded senators would be willing to fight for the issue.

Back on the House side, another leading voice pushing for a more lenient approach, Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.) ultimately did not vote. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said Garbarino fell asleep during the late-night session.

Earlier Wednesday evening, Garbarino raised concerns about the energy provisions and the country’s ability to meet its growing energy demand.

“We can’t meet that demand if we’re pulling energy projects off the table here. And I think these, I think these things I’m hearing could end up killing a lot of projects,” he told reporters.

About Environment America

Environment America is a policy and action group working to tackle the most profound problem of our time: a way of living that is depleting and destabilizing the natural world.

We’re advocates for energy conservation and renewable power, so we can keep oil in the ground and stop burning fossil fuels. We’re champions of plastic reduction, so nothing we use for a few minutes is allowed to pollute our oceans for centuries. And we’re defenders of wildlife and wild places, both for their own sake as well as the awe and wonder they bring to our lives.

Environment America and our national network of 30 state environmental groups work to improve our quality of life by reducing the pollution and other harms of how we produce, consume and dispose of more and more stuff. And we do it one step at a time, by winning results for clean air, clean water, clean energy, wildlife, open spaces, and a livable climate that make a tangible difference in people’s lives and our environment.

If you want to work hard, challenge yourself, and make a real impact on the critical environmental issues of our time, consider a career with Environment America.",https://cdn.uconnectlabs.com/wp-content/themes/uConnect_Washington/images/default-og-image.png?v=4.744.1.085,N,,2025-05-23 11:09:11.799649

As part of federal budget restructuring efforts under former President Donald Trump’s economic framework, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson has proposed eliminating a $7,500 federal tax credit for new electric vehicle purchases and a $4,000 credit for used EVs.
John Higham, a board member of the Electric Vehicle Association, expressed concern over the impact this may have on consumer behavior.
“It’s not going to kill the electric vehicle,” Higham said.
Without those tax credits, he predicts the growth rate could dip to around 8% or 9%.","(Missouri News Service) – More than 13,000 all-electric vehicles are currently registered in Missouri, according to recent data from the U.S. Department of Energy. However, proposed federal budget cuts could eliminate key tax credits that supporters say have helped fuel electric vehicle adoption.

As part of federal budget restructuring efforts under former President Donald Trump’s economic framework, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson has proposed eliminating a $7,500 federal tax credit for new electric vehicle purchases and a $4,000 credit for used EVs. The rollback could take effect by the end of the year.

John Higham, a board member of the Electric Vehicle Association, expressed concern over the impact this may have on consumer behavior. “It’s not going to kill the electric vehicle,” Higham said. “It might slow the acceleration of the adoption of the electric vehicle, but it’s certainly not going to reverse the trend.”

Higham anticipates annual growth in EV sales could range between 10% and 12% with current incentives in place. Without those tax credits, he predicts the growth rate could dip to around 8% or 9%.

The proposal to eliminate the credits is expected to be considered between late May and the end of July. Meanwhile, a separate U.S. House bill seeks to extend the existing tax credits through the end of 2025.

Industry analysts suggest that Tesla, the country’s leading EV manufacturer, could be significantly affected if the incentives are repealed.

Higham also noted that repealing the credits may have political consequences. “That economic engine that is in those ‘red’ districts — where there’s new battery manufacturing put in, new automotive manufacturing put in — those are the voters that are going to feel it the most,” he said. “It is harder to repeal than I think most people realize.”

In 2024, the federal government is estimated to have spent approximately $2 billion on advance point-of-sale EV tax credit payments. Industry observers say discussions about ending the program could motivate some buyers to purchase EVs sooner.

Grill manufacturers embrace electric Mention electric grills and many people think of small models that look more like a waffle iron.
Penner says electric grills are popular with younger consumers and people who live in apartments that may not allow gas grills.
The highest rated gas grills at Consumer Reports, which doesn't rate electric grills, range from $275 to $2,750.
""I think that electric grills are ridiculously convenient,"" in part because they're easy to use and often easier to clean.","PHILADELPHIA – Summer grilling usually starts with filling a propane tank or buying a bag of charcoal briquettes. But some people are ditching these fuels for a more climate-friendly electric grill.

Just before dinner recently, Stoio Kachev wheeled his electric grill across his family's backyard patio to an electrical outlet, plugged it in and hit the power button.

""You can choose what temperature you want,"" Kachev says, setting it to 500 degrees Fahrenheit on the digital display. ""So you see it's at 152 now and it'll take about 15 minutes to get to 500.""

On the menu are two family favorites. ""We are making some Bulgarian short ribs, and we're going to make some Vietnamese pork belly,"" says Doanh Nghiem. She and Kachev say convenience is the main reason they switched to an electric grill.

""We used to have a gas grill, and we used to go buy propane. Not only is it getting more expensive, but it's just a pain to lug [tanks] around,"" Nghiem says. ""I was sold when I learned that we could just plug it in and grill whenever we wanted to and not have to buy anything extra.""

Whether running an electric or propane grill is cheaper depends on utility rates and local propane prices, though if you don't have an outdoor outlet that might involve hiring an electrician.

Climate change is another reason Nghiem and Kachev switched. Before the grill, the couple replaced several fossil fuel items with electric ones — first their car, then lawn mower and trimmer, a water heater and last year the grill.

Switching from a fossil fuel-burning device to an electric one — called electrification — is a key climate solution, especially as they are powered by electricity generated from an increasingly cleaner grid that uses renewable energy instead of fossil fuels.

Grill manufacturers embrace electric

Mention electric grills and many people think of small models that look more like a waffle iron. But now some manufacturers are focused on making full-size, stand-alone grills that can reach temperatures of 700 degrees Fahrenheit.

""People are skeptical because of those previous experiences where they've used small [electric] grills,"" says Tom Penner, CEO of Current Backyard. The parent company, W.C. Bradley, also makes Charbroil grills.

Penner says electric grills are popular with younger consumers and people who live in apartments that may not allow gas grills.

""You have a lot of empty nesters that also find it more convenient to simply plug into their outlet,"" Penner says, ""and 15 minutes later have a grill that's hot enough to cook on.""

Cooking vegetables also is easier with electric grills, he says. ""You're able to control the different parts of the grill and really control the temperature — vegetables and other products can be a little more sensitive sometimes.""

Because electric grills don't have flames, they also can be an option in places where forest fires are a risk, assuming there's an outdoor outlet available.

""Electric grills, like Kenyon's lineup, eliminate the risks associated with open flames, making them a wildfire-safe choice for outdoor cooking,"" says Mike Williams, vice president of sales and marketing for Connecticut-based Kenyon.

Both Kenyon and Current Backyard say their grills can withstand some exposure to water, such as a light rain.

Gas grills generally cost more to purchase. The highest rated gas grills at Consumer Reports, which doesn't rate electric grills, range from $275 to $2,750. Freestanding electric grill retail prices range from about $200 to $1,600. For operating a grill, whether propane or electric is more expensive depends on your local utility rates and propane prices. Either way, the cost is nominal per meal — usually under $2.

Kenyon says its electric grill sales have increased more than 40% in the past three years. Current Backyard doesn't disclose sales, but the company is expanding its line with an electric griddle and pizza oven.

While the industry is optimistic about electric grills, some cooking experts are more skeptical about grilling without gas or charcoal.

Chefs say electric grills have their place

At Zachary's BBQ & Soul in Collegeville, Pa., the summer grilling season is underway. The business expected to cater a few dozen graduations, parties and other events as the Memorial Day weekend approached.

""Let's take off my chef hat and put on my dad hat and think about grilling,"" owner Keith Taylor says. ""I think that electric grills are ridiculously convenient,"" in part because they're easy to use and often easier to clean.

""I think that there's a place for them,"" Taylor says, ""If you're just throwing [on the grill] burgers, dogs, very thin chicken cutlets — or things that cook quickly — I think electric is a dynamite, dynamite choice.""

But, putting his chef hat back on, Taylor offers a caveat: ""If you're not a purist like me, who must have wood or must have charcoal, or want those kind of flavors imparted in food.""

Taylor opens the refrigerator-size door to his Southern Pride Smoker, which cooks 400 pounds of meat at a time. ""If you bring your head closer, you can actually get a scent — a whiff — of what it is that we're doing with this barbecue,"" Taylor says.

""I put hickory and cherry in here,"" he says, pointing to the smoker's firebox. ""It automatically transfers over into the smoke chamber and stays there, constantly bathing our meats or barbecue or turkeys or ribs and all those items with that beautiful hickory and cherry smoke.""

You won't get that with an electric grill, Taylor contends, though some electric grills do offer a way to introduce wood smoke — usually with a tin of wood chips that burn as the food cooks. Professional chefs say there are a few other tricks for introducing traditional grilling and smoke flavors with an electric grill.

""I find that electric grills are all about the seasoning, not the seasoning on the item you are grilling, but the seasoning on the grill itself,"" says Rich Landau, chef and co-owner of Vedge, a vegan restaurant in Philadelphia. In an email responding to NPR's questions, Landau wrote, ""Clean it, but not too much. This helps create that deep layer of flavor on a grill.""

He suggests using lava rocks in the bottom of the grill because they ""are porous and absorb all of your grill drippings, they become seasoned as well, and each time you grill will give you more and more flavor.""

One thing electric grills can do better than most others is make picture-perfect grill marks.

Taylor says that's because an electric grill provides a more constant heat, ""where a fire will die down lower or you have to adjust the gas, the electric grill consistently is giving heat that makes it so that you can get those pretty grill marks.""

Back in Nghiem and Kachev's backyard, she's impressed with the grill marks on his short ribs. While an electric grill might not be up to a barbecue chef's high standards, for this couple, it's perfect for an evening meal in the backyard.

African governments and institutions advanced sustainability policy and regulation across climate finance, conservation and sustainability disclosure.

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development formally expanded into west Africa in May, launching new green investment pipelines. Zimbabwe hosted a regional summit on transboundary conservation governance, and the Seychelles opened the continent’s first coral aquaculture facility.

Meanwhile, the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative held a regulatory roundtable in Marrakech, Morocco, and Kenya hosted the first east African green hydrogen symposium.

Finally, Indigenous communities from four continents announced a landmark forest governance summit in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo.

Congo to host first global forest congress of Indigenous communities

On May 26, Indigenous peoples and local communities from the world’s major tropical forest basins will gather in Brazzaville for the inaugural four-day Global Congress of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities from the Forest Basins. The event is convened by the Global Alliance of Territorial Communities and co-hosted with the Rights and Resources Initiative.

Participants from the Amazon, Congo Basin, Borneo-Mekong and Mesoamerica will align global climate and biodiversity protection strategies rooted in Indigenous rights and land governance.

The congress will call for direct climate finance, stronger legal protections and land rights recognition. It will culminate in a declaration and action plan to be presented at COP30. The event will also highlight the leadership of Indigenous women and youth in forest stewardship.

EBRD expands mandate to west Africa

On May 15, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development formally approved Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Benin as new countries of operation, marking the bank’s first expansion into sub-Saharan Africa.

Initial project pipelines will focus on renewable energy, climate-resilient transport and small and medium-sized enterprise credit frameworks. The bank will also work with local regulators on de-risking tools, carbon pricing schemes and green bond market development.

The EBRD plans to open a regional office in Lagos, Nigeria, to co-ordinate its west African operations. Investment volumes for 2025 to 2026 are projected to exceed €1bn across the three countries.

Zimbabwe hosts southern Africa conservation summit

From May 19 to 23, Zimbabwe is hosting the Southern African Development Community Transfrontier Conservation Areas conference in Harare. The event marks 25 years of co-operation on cross-border conservation, and convenes ministers from all 16 member states, technical experts, donors and civil society.

Key themes include harmonising conservation laws, scaling up biodiversity financing, and integrating ecological corridors across borders. The summit also reviews countries’ compliance with Global Biodiversity Framework targets.

A joint declaration is expected ahead of COP16, calling for more predictable funding for transboundary ecosystems and enhanced monitoring mechanisms. Delegates will also discuss community-based natural resource management and ecotourism as vehicles for sustainable livelihoods.

Seychelles opens continent’s first coral aquaculture centre

On May 9, the Seychelles inaugurated the Assisted Recovery of Corals facility on Praslin Island as Africa’s first land-based coral aquaculture centre.

The ARC facility is funded by the Seychelles Conservation and Climate Adaptation Trust, the UN Development Programme and the Adaptation Fund, all of which support marine conservation, sustainable development and climate resilience in developing countries. It uses assisted evolution techniques to cultivate heat-tolerant coral strains for reef restoration.

The facility supports national adaptation goals and contributes to the Seychelles’ Blue Economy Roadmap. It will produce up to 50,000 coral fragments annually for deployment across the western Indian Ocean. The facility also offers training for regional marine scientists and contributes to biodiversity indicator tracking. Pilot restoration work has already begun at the Cousin Island and Baie Chevalier sites.

UN roundtable urges clearer sustainability standards and stronger carbon markets

Between May 6 and 7, UNEP FI hosted its Africa and Middle East regional roundtable in Marrakech. More than 300 stakeholders, including regulators, central banks and investors from 24 countries, attended.

The event launched a working group to strengthen voluntary carbon market standards and align disclosures with recommendations from the International Sustainability Standards Board and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.

Delegates urged greater coherence between domestic taxonomies and international sustainability benchmarks. Morocco’s central bank presented its climate stress-testing model, while Egypt and Kenya shared updates on their green finance frameworks and supervisory reforms. Guidance notes will be issued before COP16.

Eastern Africa launches green hydrogen symposium

Between May 14 and 15, Kenya’s Ministry of Energy and Petroleum co-hosted the first Eastern Africa Regional Green Hydrogen Symposium in Nairobi, with Germany’s development agency GIZ and the East African Centre of Excellence for Renewable Energy and Efficiency.

Heavy rare earths, a subset of overall REE, have higher atomic weights, are generally less abundant and often more valuable.
It hopes to refine a second heavy rare earth -- terbium -- at the same facility next month.
""Even with Lynas' production, China will still be in a position of dominance,"" added Gavin Wendt, founding director and senior resource analyst at MineLife.
US firm MP Materials has also completed pilot testing for heavy rare earth separation and plans to boost production this year.","An Australian firm's production of a heavy rare earth, a first outside of China, is a ""major milestone"" in diversifying a critical supply chain dominated by Beijing, experts say.

But the announcement by Lynas Rare Earths also illustrates how much more needs to be done to broaden the supply of elements critical for electric vehicles and renewable technology.

What are rare earths?

Rare earth elements (REE) are 17 metals that are used in a wide variety of everyday and high-tech products, from light bulbs to guided missiles.

Among the most sought-after are neodymium and dysprosium, used to make super-strong magnets that power electric car batteries and ocean wind turbines.

Despite their name, rare earths are relatively abundant in the Earth's crust. Their moniker is a nod to how unusual it is to find them in a pure form.

Heavy rare earths, a subset of overall REE, have higher atomic weights, are generally less abundant and often more valuable.

China dominates all elements of the rare earths supply chain, accounting for more than 60 percent of mining production and 92 percent of global refined output, according to the International Energy Agency.

What did Lynas achieve?

Lynas said it produced dysprosium oxide at its Malaysia facility, making it the only commercial producer of separated heavy rare earths outside of China.

It hopes to refine a second heavy rare earth -- terbium -- at the same facility next month. It too can be used in permanent magnets, as well as some light bulbs.

It ""is a major milestone,"" said Neha Mukherjee, senior analyst on raw materials at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.

The announcement comes with China's REE supply caught up in its trade war with Washington.

It is unclear whether a 90-day truce means Chinese export controls on some rare earths will be lifted, and experts say a backlog in permit approvals will snarl trade regardless.

""Given this context, the Lynas development marks a real and timely shift, though it doesn't eliminate the need for broader, global diversification efforts,"" said Mukherjee.

How significant is it?

Lynas did not say how much dysprosium it refined, and rare earths expert Jon Hykawy warned the firm faces constraints.

""The ore mined by Lynas contains relatively little of the heavy rare earths, so their produced tonnages can't be that large,"" said Hykawy, president of Stormcrow Capital.

""Lynas can make terbium and dysprosium, but not enough, and more is needed.""

The mines most suited for extracting dysprosium are in south China, but deposits are known in Africa, South America and elsewhere.

""Even with Lynas' production, China will still be in a position of dominance,"" added Gavin Wendt, founding director and senior resource analyst at MineLife.

""However, it is a start, and it is crucial that other possible projects in the USA, Canada, Brazil, Europe and Asia, also prove technically viable and can be approved, so that the supply balance can really begin to shift.""

What are the challenges to diversifying?

China's domination of the sector is partly the result of long-standing industrial policy. Just a handful of facilities refining light rare earths operate elsewhere, including in Estonia.

It also reflects a tolerance for ""in-situ mining"", an extraction technique that is cheap but polluting, and difficult to replicate in countries with higher environmental standards.

For them, ""production is more expensive, so they need prices to increase to make any seriously interesting profits,"" said Hykawy.

That is a major obstacle for now.

""Prices have not supported new project development for over a year,"" said Mukherjee.

""Most non-Chinese projects would struggle to break even at current price levels.""

There are also technical challenges, as processing rare earths requires highly specialised and efficient techniques, and can produce difficult-to-manage waste.

What more capacity is near?

Lynas has commissioned more processing capacity at its Malaysia plant, designed to produce up to 1,500 tonnes of heavy rare earths.

If that focused on dysprosium and terbium, it could capture a third of global production, said Mukherjee.

The firm is building a processing facility in Texas, though cost increases have cast doubt on the project, and Lynas wants the US government to pitch in more funds.

US firm MP Materials has also completed pilot testing for heavy rare earth separation and plans to boost production this year.

Canada's Aclara Resources is also developing a rare earths separation plant in the United States.

And Chinese export uncertainty could mean prices start to rise, boosting balance sheets and the capacity of small players to expand.

""The Lynas announcement shows progress is possible,"" said Mukherjee.

""It sends a strong signal that with the right mix of technical readiness, strategic demand, and geopolitical urgency, breakthroughs can happen.""

The bill, aligned with President Donald Trump’s reduced tax and increased spending plans, may curtail the clean energy production boom fuelled by subsidies enacted in 2022.

The legislation would advance the expiry date for clean electricity tax credits for wind, solar and battery storage projects to 2028, three years ahead of the previous plan, and impose a 60-day construction commencement deadline following passage of the bill.

The move has led to a sharp decline in clean energy company shares, with industry stakeholders warning of factory closures, job losses and increased electricity costs for US households.

President Trump is set to sign executive orders as early as Friday 23 May 2025 to revitalise the nuclear energy sector. These orders will simplify the regulatory approval process for new reactors and bolster fuel supply chains, as reported by Reuters.

The move comes as the US experiences its first increase in power demand in 20 years, driven by the surge in AI, prompting Trump to declare an energy emergency on his first day in office.

The US Energy Information Administration forecasts that solar, wind and battery storage will comprise 93% of the new electric capacity in the US in 2025.

The bill has been praised by the American Petroleum Institute for maintaining competitive tax policies and promoting oil lease sales.

However, clean energy groups have expressed disappointment, especially given that more two dozen Republican representatives whose districts have benefited from clean energy investments supported the bill.

Solar Energy Manufacturers for America Coalition executive director Michael Carr criticised the decision: “Despite many reassurances that members support domestic manufacturing, a vote for this bill was a vote to close US factories and concede manufacturing jobs of the most important energy resource of the 21st century to China.”

The bill also targets the clean energy supply chain by strengthening restrictions on tax credits for projects involving Chinese companies or materials. Due to China’s dominance in the industry, this move could disqualify most projects from claiming the credits.

Advanced Energy United president Heather O’Neill lamented the bill’s approach: “This isn’t a scalpel, it’s a meat cleaver, and it will hurt us all.”

Solar Energy Industries Association president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper stated: “If Congress does not change course, this legislation will upend an economic boom in this country that has delivered an historic American manufacturing renaissance, lower electric bills, hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs, and tens of billions of dollars of investments primarily to states that voted for President Trump.

“This unworkable legislation is willfully ignorant of the fact that deploying solar and storage is the only way the US power grid can meet the demand of American consumers, businesses and innovation. If this bill becomes law, America will effectively surrender the AI race to China and communities nationwide will face blackouts.”",https://www.power-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/05/House-Budget-Bill-shutterstock_1388241392.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 09:06:00.474327

EV adoption in emerging markets will continue to grow on the strength of increasingly affordable Chinese models.
But even if the worst case for EV adoption unfolds in the U.S., it’s just one country.","Europe is the next-biggest region for electric vehicle adoption, but it stagnated a bit last year. Roughly the same number of EVs and PHEVs were sold across the continent as in 2023. Growth has tapered off in large part because large European countries like France and Germany have phased out EV subsidies in recent years. Still, sales grew last year in over half of the European Union’s 27 member states — and they climbed significantly in the United Kingdom, the second-largest auto market in Europe.

The U.S. electric vehicle market saw modest growth in 2024. About 10% more EVs and PHEVs took to the road in the U.S. than in the year before, a marked slowdown from 2023’s growth rate but not a bad outcome given some of the apocalyptic forecasts from analysts. It’s notable that the sector saw growth despite Tesla, the dominant player in the U.S. EV landscape, recording a decline in sales.

EV sales in 2024 were also bolstered by emerging markets, where over 60% more EVs and PHEVs were sold than in 2023. India and Thailand are among the largest markets in this category, though they were far from the fastest growing — meanwhile, Brazil, Vietnam, and Indonesia all saw a rapid rise in EV sales.

The outlook for this year is solid. The IEA expects more than 20 million EVs and PHEVs to be sold worldwide as China keeps expanding its massive EV fleet. Sales in Europe could rebound a bit as new policies incentivizing EVs go into effect. EV adoption in emerging markets will continue to grow on the strength of increasingly affordable Chinese models.

The biggest question mark is the U.S., where tariffs, policy rollbacks, and the likely repeal of the consumer EV tax credit — and possibly manufacturing incentives, too — could seriously dampen adoption of electrified models. But even if the worst case for EV adoption unfolds in the U.S., it’s just one country. The rest of the world, meanwhile, will keep on moving toward EVs.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/USE-THIS-ONE.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=3878cb63c294e1df08331ebc6d2b2a26,N,,2025-05-23 10:02:42.046781

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The House budget bill that narrowly passed in an early morning vote on Thursday would effectively put the brakes on a clean energy production boom in the United States spurred by subsidies enacted in 2022.

Republican lawmakers' ""one big beautiful bill"" to carry out President Donald Trump's plan to cut taxes and boost spending on the military and border enforcement would end Biden-era tax credits for clean energy projects years sooner than planned in an earlier draft, rendering them unusable for most companies.

""We and many others had expected the first bill to be the worst version: This was wrong,"" Roth Capital clean energy analyst Philip Shen wrote in a note to clients.

Shares of clean energy companies tanked following the vote. Project developers and manufacturers that benefit from the subsidies said the rollback would shutter factories, kill jobs and increase electricity costs for U.S. households.

""If Congress does not change course, this legislation will upend an economic boom in this country that has delivered an historic American manufacturing renaissance, lower electric bills, hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs, and tens of billions of dollars of investments primarily to states that voted for President Trump,"" Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a statement.

Energy analysts at the Rhodium Group said their preliminary review of the bill found the changes could raise household energy costs by 7%.

Solar, wind and battery storage are expected to account for 93% of new U.S. electric capacity this year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The American Petroleum Institute praised the bill for ""preserving competitive tax policies,"" as well as opening up more oil lease sales and eliminating Biden administration policies such as its fee on methane emissions for the oil and gas industry.

REPUBLICAN DISTRICTS BENEFIT

Clean energy groups voiced dismay that the budget proposal passed with the support of over two dozen Republican representatives who had urged House leaders to preserve key Inflation Reduction Act provisions because their districts have benefited from clean energy and manufacturing investments.

As of August 2024, more than half of all IRA-backed projects were in Republican House districts, according to an analysis last year by E2, a firm that advocates for pro-environment economic policies.

""Despite many reassurances that Members support domestic manufacturing, a vote for this bill was a vote to close U.S. factories and concede manufacturing jobs of the most important energy resource of the 21st century to China,"" said Michael Carr, executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers For America Coalition.

The changes to a committee proposal from last week would advance by three years an end-date for the use of clean electricity tax credits for wind, solar and battery storage projects to 2028 and require projects to begin construction within 60 days of the bill's passage, according to a summary.

It would also have a chilling effect on residential solar by preventing companies that lease solar panels from claiming a key tax credit. A tax credit for homeowners that own their own panels will also be eliminated.

Shares of Sunrun, the top U.S. solar leasing company, were down 38% in afternoon trade.

The House bill also eliminates the ""transferability"" of tax credits that enabled developers to sell their tax credits and use the funds to finance project construction, a feature that made it easier to get them running. Some nuclear energy projects are exempted.

It also strengthened restrictions on the use of tax credits for any project backed by Chinese companies or using materials produced in China under a provision targeting “foreign entities of concern."" China dominates all aspects of the clean energy supply chain and the restrictions effectively eliminate the ability of most projects to claim the credits.

House leadership had initially promised to carefully reform the credits, not end them.

""This isn’t a scalpel, it’s a meat cleaver, and it will hurt us all,"" said Heather O'Neill, president of clean energy lobby group Advanced Energy United.

Building on the success of Phase 1, which brought solar fields to three neighborhoods, Phase 2 introduces 61 acres of solar infrastructure in the Houston-Whittier/Hayes and Greenfield Park neighborhoods. Together, these efforts contribute to a total of 165 acres of solar fields across Detroit, generating 31 megawatts of renewable energy—enough to power 127 municipal buildings, including police stations, recreation centers, and transit hubs.

""The Solar Neighborhoods initiative has been very much a community driven process that is taking blighted vacant land and turning it into a productive and attractive new use while providing direct benefit to homeowners,"" said Mayor Mike Duggan. ""Residents of these neighborhoods designed the landscaping for their new solar arrays and homeowner occupants are receiving energy efficiency upgrades to their homes to increase their value and lower their utility costs.""

Direct Benefits for Detroit Communities

The Solar Neighborhoods initiative is more than an energy project; it's a testament to the power of partnerships and community-centered development.

Energy Efficiency Upgrades: Over 106 local homeowners will receive a minimum of $15,000 worth of energy efficiency improvements, reducing energy costs and enhancing the quality of life.

Community-Driven Design: Residents played an instrumental role in shaping the landscaping design of solar sites, ensuring these projects reflect their vision. Ornamental trees, perennial gardens, and flowering meadows will bring new life to previously neglected open spaces.

Support for Urban Agriculture: Through innovative agrivoltaic solutions, designated solar sites will also support local farmers, enabling them to grow crops sustainably with less water use and frost protection.

""This initiative goes far beyond renewable energy,"" said Owen Deitcher of Lightstar Renewables. ""It's a holistic vision for sustainable urban development that combines energy innovation, community empowerment, and environmental stewardship. At Lightstar, we couldn't be more honored to partner with the City of Detroit and our incredibly engaged neighborhood partners to make this vision a reality.""

A National Model for Innovation and Collaboration

The bold roadmap set by Mayor Duggan's administration showcases what's possible when municipalities and private sector leaders join forces. The commitment from the Mayor's Office, the Department of Public Works, Planning and Development, and the Office of Sustainability underscores how collaboration drives lasting impact.

Victoria Hicks, a Greenfield Park resident, shared her excitement about this transformation, saying, ""The Solar Neighborhoods program has turned blighted land into something truly beautiful and beneficial, while also improving the lives of residents. This is the progress we've been waiting for.""

The initiative also highlights Lightstar's leadership in solar development, merging cutting-edge technology with community-focused solutions. From agrivoltaic designs to providing stipends and training for local farmers, Detroit's Solar Neighborhoods serve as a national model for integrating renewable energy into urban revitalization.

“From a commercial perspective, it's not a unilateral decision most of the time on whether you can begin construction,” he said.
Abraham said that he was “personally surprised” by the changes to the 45Y production credit and 48E investment credit as well – the 60-day deadline especially.
A project that breaks ground during that period will then have to be placed in service by the end of 2028 to qualify for the 45Y or 48E credits, per the House’s proposed new phaseout deadline.
The preservation of tax credit transferability through 2032 for 45Y and 48E is “somewhat of a small victory,” Abraham said.","Dive Brief:

House Republicans passed a budget bill Thursday morning with an amendment that amplifies the impacts of the legislation’s already-steep cuts to Inflation Reduction Act funding by requiring that projects break ground within 60 days of the bill’s signing to qualify for clean electricity production and investment tax credits.

If that aspect of the legislation passes through the Senate and becomes law, “it's going to strain the renewable energy development community and the supply chain,” said Ryan Abraham, a principal with Ernst & Young’s Washington Council advisory practice. “It's going to trigger a scramble to undertake as much as possible in that 60-day window.”

Greg Matlock, EY Americas Tax Leader for Oil & Gas and Chemicals and Metals & Mining, said he didn’t think this degree of changes to the 45Y and 48E tax credits – in particular the 60-day deadline – was anticipated. “From a commercial perspective, it's not a unilateral decision most of the time on whether you can begin construction,” he said.

Dive Insight:

Matlock said there was always an expectation that this administration and Congress would seek to make material changes to the clean energy provisions of the IRA, but his sense from talking to clients Thursday morning was that the 60-day clock took them by surprise.

Abraham said that he was “personally surprised” by the changes to the 45Y production credit and 48E investment credit as well – the 60-day deadline especially.

“I think there was a general expectation in the sector that the House bill was kind of the bookend of negotiations, and I think that amendment has clearly taken that and moved that goal post a bit,” Abraham said. “That 60 days start-of-construction requirement, if that were to stay, is going to have a significant impact on projects that go forward … That’s a very tight timeline for any developer to try to move the needle and qualify.”

If this bill is passed by the Senate, the deadline will go into effect 60 days after President Donald Trump signs it into law. A project that breaks ground during that period will then have to be placed in service by the end of 2028 to qualify for the 45Y or 48E credits, per the House’s proposed new phaseout deadline.

The legislation carves out many of the IRA’s nuclear provisions, and carbon capture is “largely unmodified,” Matlock said.

The preservation of tax credit transferability through 2032 for 45Y and 48E is “somewhat of a small victory,” Abraham said. “But I put it in the small victory column because that 60-day clock combined with having to have projects in service by the end of 2028 – those are fairly significant limitations on how many projects are ultimately going to qualify for the credit.”

Matlock said that if these changes to the IRA remain, he expects capital to be redirected, and a “slightly different growth curve for different technologies that are treated differently under this revised framework. It’s also going to change the mix of who can invest in these projects.”

The House voted to phase out transferability for the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit and the 45X advanced manufacturing PTC after 2027, and if those projects “can't sell credits after 2027, that changes the investor mix,” Matlock said.

Broadcast version by Nadia Ramlagan for West Virginia News Service reporting for the Sentient-Public News Service Collaboration

When it comes to tackling climate change and industrial animal agriculture, a long-standing debate continues to divide advocates - is it better to focus on individual dietary shifts, or demand systemic change? Over the last decade or so, environmental and animal welfare organizations have grappled with how to combine individual behavior change with a broader push for collective action. Is it more effective to urge consumers to eat less meat, or to target meat and dairy companies to transition toward plant-based alternatives? Are individual shopping choices more impactful, or should we prioritize boycotts and pressure campaigns through grassroots activism?

A new report from the World Resource Institute reveals that both strategies can - and in fact must - work together. To combat climate change, the report finds, collective change and individual action require a joint effort.

""This research shows that people really can't do it alone,"" Mindy Hernandez, one of the authors of the WRI report, tells Sentient. ""They need help in order to realize the very significant emissions reductions that are possible."" Rather than getting caught up in the idea that ""'corporations need to do something, or nothing matters,' systems-level players, specifically policy and industry actors, have a massive role to play."" At the same time, Hernandez adds, ""that does not give individuals a free pass.""

The Surprising Origins of the 'Personal Carbon Footprint'

The idea of a ""personal carbon footprint"" didn't come from climate scientists or environmental advocates - it actually came from Big Oil, as a means of placing the onus on us. In 2004, British Petroleum (BP) introduced the carbon calculator, reframing the climate crisis as a matter of personal responsibility. The message was simple: Don't look at us. Look at yourself.

We're still grappling with the legacy of that messaging. A little more than 20 years later, global emissions continue to rise yet conversations around food and climate tend to be framed in terms of individual choices - both the effective ones like eating less meat and the not-so-effective ones for climate emissions, like buying local, ""climate-friendly,"" ""regenerative"" or organic.

Meanwhile, the beef industry continues to pump out emissions, with little political will to tackle these emissions in a meaningful way.

Impact of Diet on the Planet

Around a third of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food, and most of those food-related emissions are driven by meat, especially beef. Americans and other Global North countries must eat less meat and shift to more plant-forward diets, the research suggests. ""Plant-based foods - such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans, peas, nuts, and lentils - generally use less energy, land, and water, and have lower greenhouse gas intensities than animal-based foods,"" according to the United Nations.

WRI's research also finds that ""pro-climate behavior changes"" are enough, potentially, to ""theoretically cancel out all the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions an average person produces each year - specifically among high-income, high-emitting populations."" One of those climate-crucial behaviors, the research reveals, is cutting back on meat and dairy - especially beef and lamb.

Organic or regenerative food have various merits, but these do not include a reduction in climate emissions for beef, because organic and regenerative cattle ranching requires more land, and land has a climate emissions cost. Ultimately, none of these personal actions come close to the environmental impact of shifting away from meat and other animal-sourced products. ""Full veganism can save nearly 1 ton of CO2 annually, about a sixth of the average global citizen's total emissions. But even reducing meat intake captures 40% of that impact,"" the report states.

Why Individual Change Is Not Enough

The WRI research also makes a larger point: focusing solely on individual behavior is not sufficient on its own. Without systemic change, we unlock just a fraction - about 10 percent - of our true climate action potential.

The other 90 percent, according to WRI, ""stays locked away, dependent on governments, businesses and our own collective action to make sustainable choices more accessible for everyone. (Case in point: It's much easier to go carless if your city has good public transit.)""

Consider a student working to decrease their individual climate impact by eating less meat, WRI's Hernandez suggests. A systemic action the student could take would be to advocate for the school to adopt Meat Free Mondays or WRI's Cool Food Pledge, a program that helps organizations reduce the climate impact of their food offerings by shifting to plant-rich menus.

""Suddenly it's really easy for that student to keep their commitment to eating less meat,"" says Hernandez, and the collective emissions of the larger student body also then decreases.

The key is to have climate action, at both individual and systemic levels, working in unison. ""Systemic pressure creates enabling conditions, but individuals need to complete the loop with our daily choices. It's a two-way street,"" the WRI researchers write. ""Bike lanes need cyclists, plant-based options need people to consume them."" And when more of us adopt these behaviors, ""we send critical market signals that businesses and governments respond to with more investment.""

Taking Action During Difficult Times

As the current administration continues to roll back environmental protections, it's a crucial time for both individual and collective action, Lauren Ornelas, founder of the nonprofit Food Empowerment Project, tells Sentient. ""We can't say 'I can rely on the government to pass regulations that are good for the environment or that are good for the welfare of animals,' or 'I can rely on my policymakers to do those things.' It's kind of up to us,"" she says, ""and this is the best time to acknowledge that in every aspect [where] we actually have power.""

For those who care about food system impacts, that power can be found in what we choose to eat. ""Food choices are always empowering,"" says Ornelas. So is taking part in a broader collective action, she adds, ""to make sure that we are joining our voices with others to demand change.""

And what could this look like? ""Focus on the one thing that you think you can do in your household,"" Hernandez says."" And then, think about what is the one systems-level thing you can do,"" like joining a local environmental or food justice group. Shifting diets away from meat and dairy may not solve the climate crisis alone, but eating less meat can be one empowering individual choice that can be made that much stronger by collective action.

Additional tariffs will be imposed on solar imports from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam after the U.S. International Trade Commission voted that the domestic solar industry is materially injured by them, the ITC announced Tuesday.

“The ITC vote now clears the way for updating those rates and an order that will be issued shortly to address unfair trade more fully,” said Tim Brightbill, attorney for the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee, the alliance of seven U.S. solar manufacturers that petitioned the ITC and Commerce. “We're very pleased with that … We got some great results today.”

Dive Insight:

Brightbill, a partner at law firm Wiley Rein, said during a Tuesday press call that the alliance doesn’t yet know if the ITC’s finding will result in additional, retroactive duties under the “critical circumstances” provision, which applies to countries that rush in imports to try to beat duties before they’re applied.

In its own final determination, the Commerce Department did make critical circumstances findings for some exporters in Thailand and Vietnam.

“We'll see shortly if that might occur,” Brightbill said. “But regardless, it's a very strong win for the domestic industry. Our clients are pleased with the results. It's taken a year, but we're happy to be here.”

Following the ITC’s finding, the Commerce Department is expected to issue new anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders on June 9, and update the tariff rates for the four countries.

These tariffs will impact crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells, whether or not assembled into modules, imported from the four countries – on top of President Donald Trump’s new 10% base tariff rate for all countries.

Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association — which opposed the bringing of the trade case, along with several other trade associations — said in a Tuesday release that the ITC’s finding was “concerning for American solar manufacturers and the broader U.S. solar industry.”

The final affirmative injury determination “adds an additional layer of tariffs that will raise costs for the solar products American companies need to build projects and grow domestic manufacturing,” Hopper said, making it “more important than ever for Congress to support American solar manufacturing” by preserving the Inflation Reduction Act’s endangered tax credits.

Every single Democratic member of the House voted against the bill.

This legislation introduces provisions that would effectively kill the job-creating investments in the Inflation Reduction Act by rendering the law’s tax credits for clean energy and advanced manufacturing unusable and sunsetting them early. Recently released modeling from Energy Innovation found that the Republican bill would cost Americans more than 830,000 jobs for just the year of 2030, and 720,000 jobs for just the year 2035. These numbers do not account for the likely cancellations of planned clean energy manufacturing facilities.

“These clean energy tax credits have been a game changer for communities across the nation, including in the districts of the Republican representatives,” said BlueGreen Alliance Executive Director Jason Walsh. “The GOP caved to the MAGA extremists in their party so they could screw over America’s workers to stuff the pockets of billionaires.”

Additional research suggests killing the credits will increase costs for American families. Other harmful provisions include:

Repealing the Clean Vehicle Tax Credits;

Repealing the Clean Hydrogen Tax Credit;

Clawing back unspent funds for air quality monitoring in schools, clean manufacturing, state and community energy programs, and electric grid upgrades;

Defunding and delaying the Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP), which reduces pollution and protects the health of workers and communities;

Clawing back all unspent Inflation Reduction Act funds, including many provisions that would have lowered energy bills, created jobs, and reduced pollution; and

Attacks on additional Inflation Reduction Act programs and initiatives.

“Every single Republican that said they were going to stand up for jobs in their districts either voted for this atrocity or didn’t vote,” said Walsh. “These folks just voted to kill good-paying jobs and huge private investment in their hometowns.”

In March, a group of Republican Representatives, led by Rep. Andrew Garbarino (NY-2), penned a letter calling for the protection of the tax credits. Those Representatives are: Reps. Juan Ciscomani (AZ-6), David Valadao (CA-22), Young Kim (CA-40), Earl “Buddy” Carter (GA-1), Mariannette Miller-Meeks (IA-1), Erin Houchin (IN-9), Don Bacon (NE-2), Thomas Kean, Jr. (NJ-7), Mark Amodei (NV-2), Nick LaLota (NY-1), Michael Lawler (NY-17), David Joyce (OH-14), Jennifer Kiggans (VA-2), Vince Fong (CA-20), Jeff Hurd (CO-3), Gabe Evans (CO-8), John James (MI-10), Ryan Mackenzie (PA-7), Rob Bresnahan (PA-8), Dan Newhouse (WA-4). While Garbarino himself did not show up for last night’s vote, all the other signers voted for the bill.

“Now the fight moves to the Senate. We urge all Americans to call their Senators and remind them who they work for. We will not stand by as they kill family-sustaining, union jobs, increase energy prices, and surrender our manufacturing future to China while trashing our clean air and water,” Walsh said.

As demand for renewable energy continues to climb, solar installers who embrace technology will have more opportunities, not fewer.
With proper training, evolving roles and the right tools, solar workers will remain essential builders of a cleaner, more sustainable future.","Solving the Labor Shortage Crisis

In 2024, the United States solar industry surged by installing close to 50 gigawatts direct current of capacity, a 21% rise compared to 2023, setting a new record for the second year running. But despite this growth, the workforce isn’t keeping up.

One major challenge is that there are not enough trained installers to meet the rising demand. This gap creates delays, increases labor costs and threatens project timelines. That’s where robotics comes in. Robots can assist human teams by performing repetitive and strenuous tasks. This allows fewer skilled workers to complete larger projects, freeing them to focus on technical and decision-making work. Below are a few standout examples.

CrewMate

Moog Construction’s semi-autonomous vehicle, CrewMate, underwent a successful field trial, showcasing its ability to assist solar workers with panel installation on challenging terrain. The vehicle efficiently transported heavy pallets loaded with large solar panels and helped workers lift and position the panels onto the racks. CrewMate’s design eased the physical strain on installers and improved safety and productivity, especially in tough outdoor conditions.

Maximo

On a larger scale, AES Corporation developed Maximo, a robotic system that fully automates solar panels' movement, placement and securing on utility-scale projects. With just two people overseeing the machine, Maximo has already contributed to over 10 megawatts of installed capacity and aims to scale up to 100 megawatts by the end of 2025. This automation addresses significant labor shortages in the solar industry, particularly in remote locations where skilled workers are scarce.

Improving Safety and Efficiency on Jobsites

Installing solar panels — especially on rooftops or large solar farms — is physically demanding and sometimes dangerous. Falls, repetitive strain injuries and heat exposure are common occupational hazards.

Robots are stepping in to make installations safer without removing the human element. Some tools help with precision and lifting — others minimize repetitive bending and walking across wide areas. These benefits protect workers and allow them to complete jobs faster and with less fatigue. Here are some examples of this human-machine synergy in action.

Rosendin

Rosendin developed a robotic system to make large-scale solar panel installation safer and more efficient. The robot lifts and places heavy panels using a suction-equipped arm, reducing physical strain on workers and minimizing injuries. It works with autonomous carriers and navigates tough terrain using tracks.

While fewer crew members are needed for panel placement, workers are reassigned to more complex tasks, not replaced. The system has boosted productivity, cut waste and improved safety. Rosendin is now seeking a manufacturing partner to commercialize the technology for broader use in the solar industry.

Cosmic-1A

Cosmic Robotics’ robotic installer, the Cosmic‑1A, places solar panels with high precision, reducing the workload on human crews who only need to verify alignment and secure the panels. It matches top human speed — installing a panel every 30 to 40 seconds — but operates consistently without fatigue. This efficiency reduces humans' time in hot or hazardous conditions and allows teams to be split, effectively doubling output.

Global Innovations Leading the Way

Automation in solar energy installation is not just a U.S. phenomenon — it’s a global movement transforming how solar projects are built and deployed. By 2028, experts expect solar and wind to supply 96% of renewable electricity, highlighting the pressing demand to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies.

Robotics, artificial intelligence (AI) and modular assembly techniques are streamlining installations across continents, driving down costs in a competitive industry where every cent per watt counts. The following international examples showcase how innovation can be scaled globally.

Terabase

With $130 million in funding, Terabase is pioneering a fully integrated solar construction solution that combines robotics, software and AI. Their innovative mobile robotic field factory assembles and installs solar panels directly on-site, significantly speeding up project timelines and improving precision. This approach helps address labor shortages and reduces installation costs, especially for utility-scale solar farms.

Enphase

Enphase Energy has launched its advanced IQ8P Microinverters in Thailand and the Philippines to support higher-powered solar panels with a peak output of 480 watts. These devices improve energy harvesting, offer detailed system monitoring and include safety features like rapid shutdown.

Backed by a 15-year limited warranty, the IQ8P is designed to meet the rising demand for residential solar in Southeast Asia, providing efficient, easy-to-install solutions that deliver strong value to users. Enphase is growing its global reach by collaborating with local partners to drive the adoption of clean and reliable energy technologies.

Robotics as a Tool, Not a Threat in Solar Workplaces

Rather than replacing workers, most robots in solar installation serve as valuable partners, taking on repetitive or heavy-lifting tasks and allowing crews to focus on skilled jobs like wiring and quality inspections. These innovative machines, coupled with conventional electric equipment, such as boom and scissor lifts, boost efficiency and help projects move faster without exhausting the team.

Robotics also opens new doors for workers by creating opportunities to develop skills in equipment operation and automation technology, often leading to higher pay and long-term career advancement. By handling physically demanding and hazardous tasks, robots improve jobsite safety and enable smaller teams to achieve more during labor shortages. Their precision in placing solar panels contributes to better energy output and longer system lifespan.

New Skills, New Opportunities

The growing role of automation in solar energy is reshaping jobs instead of eliminating them. There’s a rising demand for workers skilled in both renewable energy and robotics operation and maintenance.

To ease this transition, employers should support workforce development by embedding AI and automation training into educational pathways. This will prepare installers to handle robotics calibration, equip supervisors to manage hardware and software aspects of automated tools, and encourage schools to offer certifications in solar robotics. Ultimately, the workforce remains essential, just increasingly tech-savvy.

A Brighter Future Through Collaboration

The robot revolution isn’t a threat, but a partnership. In the solar industry, robotics and automation aren’t here to displace hardworking installers. They’re here to support them, improve working conditions and fill gaps in a growing and labor-strained market.

WAIVING GOODBYE: Congress has an unintentional message for Elon Musk as he starts pulling back from politics: Don’t let the car door hit you on the way out.

Tesla is arguably one of the biggest losers of Senate Republicans’ vote Thursday to revoke California’s nation-leading clean vehicle requirements.

Tesla made a lot of money in the early years of California’s rules, which require automakers to sell increasing percentages of zero-emission cars or else buy credits from others who are selling more of them (i.e., mostly Tesla, in the early days of EVs).

While Tesla’s never disclosed exactly how much it’s made from California’s Advanced Clean Cars rule, which the Senate voted along party lines (with the notable addition of Michigan’s Elissa Slotkin) to revoke federal permission to enforce, the program is widely credited with having kept the company out of bankruptcy in its early years.

“Tesla simply would not have existed as a company had not these rules been applied,” Gov. Gavin Newsom pointed out Thursday after the vote, in announcing plans to sue once President Donald Trump signs the resolution.

That’s on top of the megabill that House Republicans passed simultaneously Thursday, which would remove pretty much all federal tax credits for electric vehicles, including the $7,500 credit for new EVs.

California’s rules are even more important because 11 other states follow them, representing roughly a third of the country’s auto market. Government incentives still made up some 43 percent of Tesla’s net income as of the first 9 months of last year, as Corbin Hiar reported earlier this year for POLITICO’s E&E News.

It’s a fitting denouement for an awkward partnership that never made sense for Musk’s automotive interests (his space interests, of course, are another story). Trump’s stumping for Tesla on the White House lawn didn’t reverse the company’s flagging sales.

There’s no evidence that Tesla ever lobbied Congress to keep the waiver or the tax credits, although it did lobby California regulators last year to keep another trading program for low-carbon transportation fuels that generates even more-lucrative credits.

Tesla’s not a member, though, of the auto industry’s main trade group, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which put out a fairly nuanced statement praising the repeal.

“The problem really isn’t California,” said John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO. “It’s the 11 states that adopted California’s rules without the same level of readiness for EV sales requirements of this magnitude.”

And California’s rules were only set to become more lucrative for EV makers as they ratchet down on the way to 2035, when all new-car sales are supposed to be zero emissions. But the key to understanding any Musk method may be in the rise of other automakers.

“All the car companies are building a lot of capacity to start selling more EVs and buying less credits from Tesla,” said Gil Tal, director of the University of California, Davis’ EV Research Center. “The credit machine was kind of winding down for Tesla because all the OEMs are trying to meet these goals.”

“I think Tesla expected this,” said Dan Ives, a research analyst at Wedbush Securities specializing in tech and electric vehicles. “It’s the end of an era. They’re in a position of strength where their future is less about selling cars and more around autonomous and robotics.” — DK

ABOUT THOSE TAX CREDITS: House Republicans’ proposed two-stage repeal of the electric vehicle tax credit would benefit some smaller automakers and those late to release electric models, POLITICO’s James Bikales reports.

The proposal would repeal the $7,500 credit at the end of the year — except for manufacturers that have sold fewer than 200,000 EVs since 2009. Those companies would be allowed to continue claiming the credit through the end of 2026.

Tesla, General Motors, Stellantis, Ford, Toyota, BMW, Nissan and Hyundai all have passed the 200,000 threshold, while Kia likely will in the coming months, according to Loren McDonald, chief analyst at EV analytics firm Paren. But others, such as Rivian, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Honda, Volvo and smaller manufacturers, would be able to claim the credit for another year.

HAPPY SUSPENSE: Friday is Suspense Day, the Sacramento custom celebrated with coffee and frantic spreadsheet cross-referencing during which lawmakers rapid-fire advance, kill or significantly amend hundreds of bills before the day’s end deadline to approve measures with significant price tags.

Some bills we’re watching, like Assemblymember Lisa Calderon’s AB 942 to reduce subsidies for longtime rooftop solar customers, have already made it through. But most are coming down to the wire.

The $12 billion budget deficit projected by Newsom last week, along with his past track record of citing budget limitations to veto bills, will add pressure to the already high-stakes negotiations between lawmakers. Here’s what we’re watching (and as always, tip us off to what you are, too.)

The energy biggie: Sen. Josh Becker’s big energy affordability proposal, SB 254, will eventually need support from two thirds of his colleagues in a full floor vote because of its urgency clause — and he’ll need them to be OK with a price tag the Newsom administration estimated in the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars.

Agency overload: State regulators have increasingly said they already have too much on their plate, an argument that’s found traction to kill bills before. And the trend is popping up again. The California Air Resources Board, which is already staffing up to enforce the greenhouse gas disclosures required by 2023’s SB 253, is facing the prospect of “significant additional workload” with another climate disclosure bill: AB 405 by Assemblymember Dawn Addis, which is targeted at fashion sellers.

Another example: the California Energy Commission suggested that a bill by Sen. Aisha Wahab, SB 332, to restructure executive compensation at investor-owned-utilities to promote safety would take at least twice as long to implement as the bill’s current timeline and cost at least $18 million.

How many firefighters: State lawmakers have so far enthusiastically supported proposals to expand the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection’s peak staffing year-round, though Newsom made no such sign in his budget proposal last week. SB 581, a proposal by Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire would reclassify seasonal firefighters as permanent for $175 million annually. A similar proposal, AB 252, by Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains could cost more than twice as much because it reclassifies seasonal firefighters at a higher level. — CvK

In a 215 to 214 vote, all but two House Republicans supported the massive budget package — the centerpiece legislation of Mr. Trump’s second-term agenda — in a vote that came hours after unveiling an updated version of the legislation that GOP leaders hoped would satisfy enough holdouts. GOP Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio opposed the bill. House Freedom Caucus chairman Andy Harris of Maryland voted present.

The measure cleared a critical procedural hurdle in the wee hours of the morning, teeing up the vote on final passage after days of consternation among the House Republican conference.

The bill will now go to the Senate, where some Republicans have already voiced some opposition.

“We look forward to the Senate’s timely consideration of this once-in-a-generation legislation,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said after the vote Thursday, pledging to get the package to the president’s desk in the coming weeks. “We’re going to get it there by Independence Day on July 4, and we are going to celebrate a new golden age in America.”

White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt posted on social media that the bill’s passage “would not have happened without President Trump’s leadership.”

The legislation, dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, addresses the president’s tax, defense and energy priorities, and has overcome several setbacks since the beginning of the year after GOP leadership made repeated assurances to holdouts that their concerns would be addressed later if they kept the legislation moving forward.

But as Johnson’s self-imposed deadline to get the measure across the finish line in the House by Memorial Day quickly approached, the Louisiana Republican was facing increasing opposition from several factions of his party to parts of the bill involving Medicaid, the state and local tax deduction and other provisions.

A 42-page manager’s amendment released by House GOP leaders late Wednesday included changes to win over both the budget hardliners in the House Freedom Caucus and blue-state Republicans pressing to ease the tax burden on their constituents. The new version would, among other things, move up the implementation of Medicaid work requirements from the beginning of 2029 to the end of 2026, a change sought by hardliners.

Another change to the bill would more quickly end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants, requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028. The measure makes an exception for nuclear plants, which must be under construction by the end of 2028.

Johnson could only afford three defections on the bill, with all members present and voting, given his slim majority. Massie was the sole Republican to oppose the key procedural vote on the measure earlier Thursday.

“If something is beautiful, you don’t do it after midnight,” Massie said on the House floor.

Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, delivered his final pitch to House Republicans ahead of the vote, urging that the bill will deliver on GOP promises.

“If you vote no, you’re voting against American energy, you’re voting against securing America’s border, you’re voting against helping those middle class families,” Scalise said.

Johnson touted the legislation on the House floor, saying it “gets Americans back to winning again.”

“This one big beautiful bill is the most consequential legislation that any, any party has passed, certainly under a majority this thin,” the speaker said.

All Democrats opposed the package. And after House Democrats threw up procedural roadblocks overnight to delay a vote on the measure, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries railed against the bill in a speech from the House floor early Thursday, calling it a “reckless, regressive and reprehensible GOP tax scam.”

“This is one big, ugly bill that House Republicans are trying to jam down the throats of the American people under the cover of darkness,” Jeffries said.

The New York Democrat, alluding to the midterm elections next year, warned that “this day might very well turn out to be the day that House Republicans lost control of the United States House of Representatives.”

The vote came after right-wing holdouts met Wednesday afternoon with Mr. Trump and Johnson at the White House. After the meeting, Johnson huddled with other members of the Republican conference to brief them on the changes while House Freedom Caucus members met separately.

Before the White House meeting Wednesday, Harris, who chairs the House Freedom Caucus, said he wasn’t optimistic the bill could pass this week, though he was “pretty confident” it could be passed within 10 days.

But other budget hardliners said after the meeting that negotiations were headed in the right direction.

During a visit to the Capitol Tuesday, Mr. Trump pressured Republicans to fall in line behind the legislation and suggested that those who don’t could face primary challenges.

In a statement of administrative policy issued Wednesday, the White House Office of Management and Budget urged House Republicans to pass the measure, saying it “reflects the shared priorities of both Congress and the Administration,” adding, “failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal.”

The details of the updated version of the legislation came together in the final hours before the vote.

Johnson also negotiated with Republicans from blue states over a provision on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT. The moderates advocated for an increase to the SALT cap, currently set at $10,000, but argued that the $30,000 cap outlined in the package remained too low. An agreement was reached to increase the deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000, according to the managers amendment.

The vote marks a key victory for Johnson, after days of shepherding his conference through difficult disagreement over the legislation. But even with the victory, the legislation is expected to face resistance in the Senate — where numerous Republicans have said they’ll seek changes to the bill.

Johnson met with Senate Republicans to discuss the budget process Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters Wednesday that the speaker would “like to see as little change to the product as possible, because they cobble together a very delicate balance over there.” But Thune said “the Senate will have its imprint on it.”",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/2025/05/22/15c387e7-ad5f-4313-bb0b-ae25b64eae83/cbsn-fusion-house-republicans-narrowly-pass-budget-bill-after-all-night-session-thumbnail.jpg?v=48f078ae8a74a1412614b0db6f935e48,N,,2025-05-23 14:15:01.718321

The Silverado EV Trail Boss will arrive as a 2026 model in the U.S. market, taking over for the performance-oriented RST version, which has been available since the Silverado EV's 2024 launch. It's priced from $72,095 with a 410-mile Extended battery, and from $88,695 with a 478-mile Max battery. The range figures are based on EPA estimates.

The WT (Work Truck) version, aimed at fleet customers, and mid-range LT carry over from last year, with their 2026 pricing starting at $54,895 and $62,995, respectively. Those prices are slightly lower than last year. All price figures include a $2,095 destination charge.

Ready To Hit The Trails

As its name suggests, the Trail Boss is designed with off-roading in mind, coming standard with a 2.0-inch lift kit, 35-inch all-terrain tires (on 18-inch wheels), and a high-angle approach front fascia. The coil suspension has also been tuned to handle rough terrain, and with all the upgrades, the ground clearance is about 24 percent higher compared to the base Silverado EV.

The Trail Boss also comes with an exclusive Terrain mode designed for slow crawling on rough terrain. According to Chevy, this mode gives the driver better control over torque and traction at low speeds. Other modes include a dedicated Off-Road mode as well as the Sidewinder mode, first introduced on the RST. This is essentially Chevy's version of GMC's CrabWalk, where all four wheels turn in the same direction, enabling the vehicle to move in a diagonal motion at low speeds - handy for navigating demanding trails or tricky parking situations.

Chevy also fits the vehicle with auxiliary switches, which make installing accessories like additional driving lights or a winch easier. A front tow hook, finished in red, is standard, and like all Silverado EVs, a 10.2-kW power takeoff is also standard, which can come in handy at a campsite.

Power To Tow And Carry

The sole powertrain is a dual-motor all-wheel-drive setup delivering up to 725 hp and 775 lb-ft of torque - enough for 12,500 pounds of towing and 2,111 pounds of payload. To help with large objects, the Trail Boss can be fitted with the Silverado EV's available Multi-Flex Midgate.

The maximum power requires the available Max battery and is unlocked using the WOW mode. Chevy didn’t say how much power and torque are available with the Extended battery.

Other changes to the Silverado EV lineup for 2026 include new 22-inch wheels available on the WT and LT models. The WT also gains as standard the 11-inch digital gauge cluster and 17.7-inch infotainment screen already included on other models, as well as the new Trail Boss.

Improvements To Super Cruise

The Super Cruise automated driver-assist feature for highways has also been enhanced, now with the ability to automatically engage on suitable highways. It also offers automatic lane centering when the system isn’t engaged. Other enhancements include Google Maps integration, which enables the vehicle to move to the correct lane for the chosen route when using Super Cruise.

Adaptive Cruise Control has also been upgraded so the driver can choose to automatically adjust speed to match posted speed limits. For the LT and Trail Boss, Super Cruise can also be used while towing.

The GOP effort to kill the rules could have a profound impact on California’s longtime efforts to curb air pollution.
The push comes after Senate Republicans established a new exception to the filibuster on Wednesday to allow them to weigh in on the issue.

Democrats fought the changes, which were the latest attempt to chip away at the Senate filibuster after both parties have used their majorities in the past two decades to lower the threshold for nominations.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate voted on Thursday to block California’s first-in-the nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, acting to kill the nation’s most aggressive effort to transition toward electric vehicles as President Donald Trump’s administration has doubled down on fossil fuels.

The resolution approved by the Senate goes to the White House, where Trump is expected to sign it, along with two other measures blocking California’s rules that the Senate is poised to pass. The House approved the three resolutions earlier this month.

The GOP effort to kill the rules could have a profound impact on California’s longtime efforts to curb air pollution. The push comes after Senate Republicans established a new exception to the filibuster on Wednesday to allow them to weigh in on the issue.

California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom and state air regulators say that what Congress is doing is illegal and they will likely sue to keep the rules in place.

The two other resolutions would block rules to cut tailpipe emissions from medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and curb smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks. Democrats charge that Republicans are acting at the behest of the oil and gas industry and they say California should be able to set its own standards after obtaining waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency.

Republicans say the phaseout of gas-powered cars, along with other waivers that California has obtained from the EPA, is costly for consumers and manufacturers, puts pressure on the nation’s energy grid and has become a de facto nationwide electric vehicle mandate.

“The waivers in question allow California to implement a stringent electric vehicle mandate, which – given California’s size and the fact that a number of other states have signed on to California’s mandate – would end up not just affecting the state of California, but the whole country,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., before the vote.

Newsom, a Democrat, announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles within 15 years as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.

The Biden administration approved the state’s waiver to implement the standards in December, a month before Trump returned to office. The California rules are stricter than a Biden-era rule that tightens emissions standards but does not require sales of electric vehicles.

Biden’s EPA said in announcing the decision that opponents of the California waivers did not meet their legal burden to show how either the EV rule or a separate measure on heavy-duty vehicles was inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.

Through a series of votes on Wednesday, Republicans set a new precedent for the Senate to reject the state EPA waivers with a simple majority vote, as opposed to the 60 vote threshold on legislation that is subject to a filibuster. The votes were a workaround that enabled them to hold the votes after the Senate parliamentarian agreed with the Government Accountability Office that California’s policies are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows Congress to reject federal regulations under certain circumstances.

Democrats fought the changes, which were the latest attempt to chip away at the Senate filibuster after both parties have used their majorities in the past two decades to lower the threshold for nominations. Democrats tried in 2022 to roll back the filibuster for legislation, as well, but were thwarted by members of their own caucus who disagreed with the effort.

Here, a court should not ask whether the agency action can fit within a reasonable interpretation of its delegating statute.","Overview of the MQD in West Virginia and Beyond

Chief Justice Roberts wrote West Virginia for a 6–3 majority. The Court held that the Clean Power Plan (CPP) exceeded the EPA’s statutory authority under section 111(d) of the CAA. It emphasized that “extraordinary cases” require a distinct approach to statutory interpretation, especially when “the history and the breadth of the authority” asserted, alongside its “economic and political significance,” signal a need to “hesitate before concluding that Congress meant to confer such authority.” Id. at 721 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In such cases, the Court requires the agency to “point to clear congressional authorization for the power it claims.” Id. at 723 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Court found that the EPA lacked sufficient authority to implement the CPP, reasoning that decisions “of such magnitude and consequence” fall to Congress or an agency acting pursuant to a clear delegation. Id. at 735.

The West Virginia Court’s framework for the MQD uses a two-part test. First, the reviewing court should ask whether the agency’s assertion of authority is extraordinary. Here, a court will likely weigh three factors: (1) the political nature of the issue implicated, (2) the economic impact of the action, (3) and the historical framework of the agency and its authority. If these factors weigh in favor of extraordinariness, the second step directs the decision-maker to skeptically search for clear congressional authorization for the action. Where no such authority is found, the agency action violates the MQD.

Under the “extraordinariness” prong, the first factor considers the political significance of the agency’s action. When an agency tackles “the subject of an earnest and profound debate,” it generally tilts the scales in favor of finding the action extraordinary. Id. at 732 (quoting Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 267–68 (2006)). This phrase originates from cases involving physician-assisted suicide. In Gonzales, the Court found that Congress had not granted the attorney general authority to punish physicians for using federally controlled drugs in state-legalized physician-assisted suicide. The political debate was “about the morality, legality, and practicality of physician-assisted suicide.” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 735 (1997). According to the Gonzales Court, Congress could not have intended the attorney general to have “the power to effect a radical shift of authority from the States to the Federal Government” by resolving the debate on physician-assisted suicide. Gonzales, 546 U.S. at 275. By this logic, if the political factor restricts the attorney general from resolving a debate one way, it should equally prevent the attorney general from resolving it in the opposite direction.

Understanding the political significance factor in this way (that it is triggered when a federal agency seeks to weigh in on a profound political debate) could work in favor of challenges to anti-environmental rulemakings and polluting activities, particularly when an action implicates climate change. The West Virginia Court established that climate change is a profound debate, emphasizing that “long after the dangers posed by greenhouse gas emissions had become well known, Congress considered and rejected [action] multiple times.” West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 731 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The Court pointed to the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (H. R. 2454, 111th Cong., 1st Sess.), the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act (S. 1733, 111th Cong., 1st Sess. (2009)), the Climate Protection Act of 2013 (S. 332, 113th Cong., 1st Sess.), and the Save Our Climate Act of 2011 (H.R. 3242, 112th Cong., 1st Sess.). West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 731–32. These carbon tax and cap-and-trade schemes never became law, which indicated to the West Virginia Court that the EPA’s attempt to regulate a similar program was suspect. Thus, until Congress acts on climate change, it remains an undecided debate.

The second factor weighs the economic impact of the agency’s action. In West Virginia, the Court characterized the price tag associated with the CPP as some “billions” of dollars ($200 billion according to Justice Gorsuch), despite evidence that market forces alone had pushed industry towards meeting the CPP’s emissions targets. Id. at 714; id. at 746 (Gorsuch, J., concurring); id. at 755 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). Other MQD cases have signaled that $50 billion (Alabama Association of Realtors v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Serv., 594 U.S. 758, 764 (2020)) and certainly $500 billion (Biden v. Nebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2373 (2023)) similarly called the agency’s regulatory authority into doubt.

The economic impacts of climate change were not discussed in the majority opinion of West Virginia. Instead, the Court focused solely on the reach of the agency’s action and possible costs to industry. This is a mark of the political nature of the MQD, where its application in practice has focused on one side of the economic assessment and refused to acknowledge the other. However, a court could proceed with its economic assessment through a more holistic analysis. The costs associated with a regulation should not be confined to only those borne by industry and consumers: Regulatory changes can impact insurance costs, health care costs, environmental cleanup costs, and climate disaster costs, just to name a few—all externalized by industry and paid by society as a whole. Although calculating the cost of environmental harms is imprecise, so too was the estimated cost of the CPP. Notably, the Court’s feared utility apocalypse never occurred, but not because the CPP was stayed. Instead, its goals and standards were achieved by market forces alone. Id. at 755 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). Ultimately, all large-scale economic impacts are imprecise, but there are ever-emerging and more reliable ways to calculate costs associated with environmental harm.

The Court has not defined the historical practice factor as well as the first two. This consideration assesses whether the agency’s action aligns with established historical applications of the relevant statutory authority. In West Virginia, the Court characterized the EPA’s action as “novel” and assessed its application of the CAA section 111(d) as “unprecedented.” 597 U.S. at 728 (majority op.). The Court’s scrutiny of an agency’s historical adherence to or deviation from statutory authority is intended to gauge whether the action falls within the bounds of Congress’s original intent.

The historical practice factor may ultimately be subordinated to considerations of the economic and political significance of the agency’s action. The West Virginia Court assessed this factor narrowly, declining to consider an earlier section 111(d) rulemaking in part because it was “controversial” and “never addressed by a court,” and because the rule had based emissions reductions on a technological standard rather than a generation-shifting standard. Id. at 724–27. While recognizing that the EPA’s reliance on section 111(d) was an unusual way for the agency to regulate emissions from stationary sources, it was nevertheless a peculiar choice for the Court to restrict its historical analysis based on found controversy and distinctions between technology and generation shifting. Similarly, in Biden v. Nebraska, the Court also assessed the historical factor narrowly. 143 S. Ct. 2355. There, the Court found that the Biden administration’s student loan forgiveness program violated the MQD and refused to consider prior waivers and modifications under the historical factor (including loan payment and interest suspensions amounting to over $100 billion). Id. at 2399 (Kagan, J., dissenting). Under both West Virginia and Biden v. Nebraska, the Court has thus pointed towards a flexible review under the third factor, where prior agency actions may be distinguishable.

When these three factors point towards extraordinariness, a court should then search with “skepticism” for “clear congressional authorization” for the agency’s action. West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 732 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The search for clear congressional authorization under the MQD may prove to be a fraught journey for many regulatory bodies seeking to assert authority, especially when a statute grants broad, general authority, as any extraordinary action taken under it is likely to fail. For example, CAA section 111(d) authorizes the EPA to establish regulations controlling the standards of performance for air pollutants for existing sources. Although this is precisely what the CPP set out to do, the Court found that this delegation did not pass muster as a clear congressional authorization to shift how the nation generates electricity.

Despite the obvious deregulatory nature of the MQD, there is a balanced and common-sense application of this doctrine that could serve climate action. This reimagining of the MQD is simple: If agencies are prohibited from putting forward far-reaching regulatory schemes that would serve to reduce greenhouse gases and lessen the impacts of climate change, then the MQD also should prohibit agencies from advancing novel and significant actions that would make climate change worse. There are at least two applications of the MQD that could serve this purpose: when an agency puts forward anti-environmental regulations and when an agency permits a highly polluting activity. As discussed below, each of the extraordinariness factors can support the conclusion that an anti-environmental regulation or a highly polluting permit runs afoul of the MQD.

Anti-Environmental Regulations

One way that litigants can affirmatively use the MQD for the climate is to target anti-environmental agency rulemakings. An anti-environmental regulation could take many forms, including a rule that rolls back previously established environmental protections or a directive to not consider environmental impacts. For example, one anti-environmental regulation that could have triggered the MQD was the Council on Environmental Quality’s (CEQ’s) 2020 rulemaking modifying the National Environmental Policy Act’s (NEPA’s) regulations (2020 Rule). Update to the Regulations Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (Final Rule), 85 Fed. Reg. 43,304 (July 16, 2020). The 2020 Rule was an abrupt shift from regulations that had been largely untouched since first promulgated in 1978. Specifically, the 2020 Rule eliminated environmental review for entire classes of projects by removing the definitions of “cumulative impacts” and “direct impacts” and discarding the requirement for agencies to discuss all reasonable alternatives, among other changes. Wild Virginia v. CEQ, 544 F. Supp. 3d 620, 627 (W.D. Va. 2021). The 2020 Rule also carried all the trappings of an extraordinary agency action: It sought to diminish the federal government’s ability to consider climate impacts despite a highly politicized national debate on this issue, would have resulted in billions of dollars in associated costs, and would have allowed federal agencies to disregard environmental impacts that they had been required to assess for over 40 years. (Although the D.C. Circuit recently found that no statute provides the CEQ with rulemaking authority, the 2020 Rule remains valuable as an example. Marin Audubon Soc’y v. FAA, 121 F.4th 902 (D.C. Cir. 2024).)

The political nature of the 2020 Rule was remarkable. The New York Times described it as a “landmark measure that touches nearly every highway, pipeline and other major federal construction in the country.” Lisa Friedman, Trump’s Move Against Landmark Environmental Law Caps a Relentless Agenda, N.Y. Times (Jan. 9, 2020). The 2020 Rule was also profound and controversial in ways similar to both Gonzales and West Virginia because it altered the status quo on a matter of great political importance and a topic of national debate: climate change. Moreover, the 2020 Rule amounted to a decision by an agency to reduce long-existing climate assessment mechanisms when Congress had failed to address this issue. See West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 731–32. Thus, the 2020 Rule, with its far-reaching impacts, controversial nature, and climate implications, likely would have satisfied the political factor under the MQD’s extraordinariness prong.

A court also may have deemed the economic impacts of the 2020 Rule as significant. Climate change is bringing with it “increases in heat-related deaths, coastal inundation and erosion, more frequent and intense hurricanes, floods, and other extreme weather events, drought, destruction of ecosystem, and potentially significant disruptions of food production.” West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 753 (Kagan, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). These impacts will cost the American economy somewhere in the realm of $14.6 trillion over the next 50 years, in addition to the loss of nearly 900,000 jobs per year. Deloitte, The Turning Point: A New Economic Climate in the United States 6, 17 (Jan. 2022).

Of course, the 2020 Rule is not the cause of all greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, attribution science is constantly improving, and the Rule could be charged with the costs attributable to the greenhouse gas emissions that federal actions and those activities licensed and permitted by federal agencies create: Even 0.5% of $14.6 trillion is $73 billion, a figure well within the Supreme Court’s range of “significant” economic impact for the MQD. The challenge here will be to ensure that courts do not selectively blind themselves to societal costs while focusing exclusively on those inflicted on regulated entities.

The final factor considers an agency’s historical practice. Over four decades passed between NEPA’s 1978 implementing regulations and the agency’s 2020 wholesale revisions. A petitioner could have shown that the 2020 Rule substantially departed from CEQ’s prior practice, especially given the parameters that Congress established in section 101 of NEPA:

[T]o use all practicable means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated to foster and promote the general welfare, to create and maintain conditions under which [people] and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans.

42 U.S.C. § 4331(a). Had the D.C. Circuit not recently held that CEQ lacks rulemaking authority, future revisions by the agency likely would have been subject to significant scrutiny under a historical analysis.

In prospective challenges, petitioners should advocate for a narrow historical assessment that highlights the novelty of the regulation. Novelty, of course, is context sensitive and is strongest for the MQD’s application when a federal agency does something completely new pursuant to a longstanding statutory regime. The Court’s vague treatment of the history factor allows room for creative arguments, enabling petitioners to frame anti-environmental regulations as unprecedented departures from established practice.

Highly Polluting Agency Permits

Another way that litigators could leverage the MQD to prevent actions that worsen climate change would be to target highly polluting agency permits. Federal agencies are responsible for approving or rejecting a wide array of climate-worsening projects. In one example of a potentially extraordinary agency action, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is overseeing the approval of the Converse County Oil and Gas Project, which seeks to add 5,000 new wells over a 10-year period in Wyoming. Bureau of Land Mgmt., Environmental Impact Statement for Converse County Oil and Gas Project (2020). This project would result in an estimated 69.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent annually, or 2.2% of total direct annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas. Id. at 5-24. BLM’s approval of this project is currently being litigated. See Powder River Basin v. U.S. Dep’t of the Interior, No. 22-cv-2696-TSC (D.D.C. Sept. 13, 2024), appeal pending.

The political factor may be more difficult to satisfy under a challenge to a climate-worsening permit than for a rulemaking because permits are typically issued to single actors and generally have less widespread impacts than rules. Nevertheless, an agency’s approval of projects like the Converse County Project could be deemed extraordinary under this factor because there is a highly politicized debate currently taking place in our nation regarding whether oil and gas development should be expanded. In situations similar to the Converse County Project, it may be sufficient to show how much controversy surrounds the project. Petitioners could also focus on its massive scale, pointing to the fact that a 5,000-well approval over a 10-year period is a colossal undertaking that would have a marked impact on the climate and environment. As such, BLM is using its statutory authority to try to effectively resolve the climate change debate—albeit in the opposite direction from what was at issue in West Virginia. Absent Congress’s clear authorization to head steadfast towards climate catastrophe, agencies should not be permitted to step in and decide to do so.

Moreover, the Converse County Project arguably satisfies the economic factor of extraordinariness because the project may result in billions of dollars in costs. Distinct from industry-shifting regulations like the CPP or the 2020 Rule, a permit to approve a project is typically associated with increased revenue for an actor or industry, but the same reasoning discussed above should apply here too. Climate-worsening agency permit approvals will result in externalized costs that society bears because of climate change and ecological impacts. Moreover, unlike the relative uncertainty associated with calculating the costs that a regulation imposes, a permitted project results in more direct costs that can be measured using the social cost of carbon. The EPA’s social cost of carbon estimates the cost attributable to incremental increases in greenhouse gas emissions and encompasses such impacts as climate change–related health costs, property damage, agricultural losses, and ecosystem disruptions. U.S. EPA, Report on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases: Estimates Incorporating Recent Scientific Advances (Nov. 2023). The current estimated social cost of carbon is $190 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent, meaning that if the Converse County Project results in 69.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent annually, it will cost approximately $13.2 billion per year, or $132 billion over its 10-year lifetime. Under MQD precedent, this figure is significant.

The final factor assesses the agency’s historical practice. Novelty may be more challenging to show in a permitting context, especially where agencies have long issued permits for a certain type of activity. For example, the Converse County Project is hardly novel because the BLM has authorized several similar projects in the past. Nevertheless, a narrow historical assessment, like the Court applied in West Virginia and Biden v. Nebraska, may allow a petitioner to define the boundaries of the record most relevant to the circumstances of the case. The scale and reach of the Converse County Project, paired with BLM’s novel approach to assessing environmental harms (e.g., not assessing cumulative impacts), may be valid considerations under this factor. Alternatively, perhaps permitting a polluting activity in today’s world is an entirely different question than it was 10 years ago. Today, we live in a world where Californians are inured to wildfire evacuations and smoke, where Floridians must weather back-to-back hurricanes, and where Texans face unrelenting high temperature streaks above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. In this way, an agency action that invites climate devastation is novel: Never before have federal agencies issued permits amid a status quo of being in a nearly constant state of national climate emergency.

Clear Congressional Authorization

Considering each of these factors, it seems likely that an unbiased court could find that an agency’s promulgation of anti-environmental regulations or the issuance of a highly polluting permit satisfies the extraordinariness test under the MQD. When this is the case, the final step under the MQD is to search skeptically for clear congressional authorization. Here, a court should not ask whether the agency action can fit within a reasonable interpretation of its delegating statute. Instead, a court must determine whether the action fits squarely within an agency authorization granted by a clear statutory provision. If the first prong of the MQD determines that the matter in question is extraordinary, broad or vaguely worded delegations will not be sufficient to satisfy the clear delegation requirement.

Of course, most agency actions will undeniably occur under a statutory delegation of some sort, but here an agency must point to a clear authorization—one that ostensibly had the controversy, breadth, and scale of the agency’s action in mind. As the Supreme Court’s own decisions have shown, this final prong of the MQD lends itself to overturning, not upholding, agency actions. Most skeptical reviews of a delegation will unearth some ambiguity that will call into question an agency’s power to act. Nonbiased judges should be poised to apply this doctrine holistically. In the end, where our precedent tells us that extraordinary actions to solve the climate crisis lack clear congressional authorization, so too must actions that worsen the crisis.

Ultimately, under both scenarios discussed here—anti-environmental regulations and highly polluting permit approvals—the MQD can serve as a possible avenue for a petitioner to challenge a government action. Undeniably, there is a rift between how the MQD has been applied by the Court (as a deregulatory tool leveraged against progressive policies) and how this article proposes that it be applied. Nevertheless, assuming that the MQD should serve as a balanced canon for nonpoliticized review of agency action, it is time that courts reckon with its application to antiregulatory and allegedly pro-business agency decisions—especially as an administration poised to attack environmental protections re-enters the stage.",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/16x9/16x9-drought-1980962632.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 01:02:06.424532

The move, unveiled May 14, 2025, by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, represents a major shift from the agency’s landmark 2024 rule, which had set enforceable limits for six PFAS chemicals in drinking water for the first time in decades. The EPA now intends to keep the standards for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), but will push the deadline for water systems to comply from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, EPA will rescind and reconsider the Biden-era drinking water regulations for PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA (known as GenX), and a hazard index that includes PFBS.

“The work to protect Americans from PFAS in drinking water started under the first Trump Administration and will continue under my leadership,” Administrator Zeldin said in the agency’s announcement. “We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance. This will support water systems across the country, including small systems in rural communities, as they work to address these contaminants. EPA will also continue to use its regulatory and enforcement tools to hold polluters accountable

The EPA’s plan includes launching a new PFAS OUTreach Initiative (PFAS OUT), designed to engage every public water utility that needs capital improvements to address PFAS contamination. The program will provide technical assistance, resources, and funding to affected communities, with special emphasis on small and rural water systems. EPA says PFAS OUT will ensure “no community is left behind as we work to protect public health and bring utilities into compliance with federal drinking water standards.”

Zeldin also emphasized the agency’s intention to hold polluters — not water utilities and ratepayers — financially responsible for contamination, stating, “The need for a polluter pays model has guided a lot of the work to be done at EPA in the future.”

Industry and State Groups Welcome the Delay

Industry groups and water utility associations praised the EPA’s decision to delay compliance deadlines. Matthew Holmes, CEO of the National Rural Water Association, said the delay “provides the additional time that water system managers need to identify affordable treatment technologies and make sure they are on a sustainable path to compliance.” Alan Roberson, executive director of the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators, said the extension and increased technical assistance “will address the number of systems that would be out of compliance in 2029 due to not being able [to] complete all of these tasks on time.”

A Partial Rollback: What Changes and What Remains

The EPA’s 2024 rule, finalized under President Biden, established Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) and Maximum Contaminant Level Goals (MCLGs) for six PFAS chemicals, including PFOA and PFOS, and required water systems to adjust treatment infrastructure accordingly. Now, the agency plans to extend the compliance deadline to 2031 and rescind the standards for GenX, PFHxS, PFNA, and the Hazard Index for mixtures of these chemicals plus PFBS. The agency will issue a proposed rule this fall and finalize it in early 2026.

Legal experts Taylor Pullins and Laura Mulry of White & Case summarized the significance: “On May 14, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that it plans to retain the current drinking water standards for two per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), i.e., perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), but delay related compliance deadlines from 2029 to 2031. Notably, EPA now intends to rescind regulations for four other PFAS covered in the Biden-era PFAS drinking water rule. EPA plans to issue a proposed rule this fall and finalize the rule in early 2026.""

Pullins and Mulry noted that environmental groups have criticized the announcement, warning that it could violate the Safe Drinking Water Act’s “anti-backsliding provision,” which prohibits the agency from weakening existing drinking water standards. At the same time, industry and state groups argue that the delay is necessary to allow time for pilot testing, planning, and construction of new treatment systems.

Health Risks and Public Health Concerns

PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of thousands of synthetic chemicals used in consumer and industrial products for their ability to resist heat, water, and stains. Known as “forever chemicals” because they do not break down in the environment, PFAS have been linked to kidney and testicular cancer, liver damage, and developmental harms in children.

Environmental health advocates say that about half of Americans are exposed to PFAS-contaminated water, and that the EPA’s previous regulations were a long-overdue step to address a public health crisis. The agency’s plans to rescind protections for four PFAS chemicals have been met with strong opposition from groups like NRDC and Earthjustice, who argue that delaying or weakening standards will leave millions of people at risk.

Legal and Political Backdrop

The Biden-era rule is currently being challenged in court by industry groups and utilities, with the EPA announcing it will support the Department of Justice in defending the rule for PFOA and PFOS. The debate over PFAS regulation has intensified in recent years, with lawmakers, regulators, and advocacy groups calling for stricter standards and greater accountability for polluters.

Administrator Zeldin’s announcement builds on previous EPA efforts, including the 2019 PFAS Action Plan and ongoing outreach and technical assistance programs. The agency says it will continue to offer services to water systems nationwide and encourage states to seek additional time for compliance as needed.

What’s Next

EPA’s plan calls for a new proposed rule this fall, with a final rule expected in the spring of 2026. In the meantime, the agency says it will work to provide support to affected communities, communicate with stakeholders, and continue efforts to hold polluters accountable.",https://www.remediation-technology.com/ext/resources/2023/01/My-project-1---2023-01-30T170634.500.jpg?height=635&t=1678051748&width=1200,N,,2025-05-23 06:03:42.636868

It was inspiring to see so many people dedicated to creating positive environmental outcomes with economic benefits, and to see the value that ESA brings to this market through our mitigation, restoration, and technology services expertise.

In addition to the incredible keynote from the former Washington Governor, Jay Inslee, and seeing ESA team members’ impactful presentations and panel discussions, here are a few key things that really stood out to me from my time at the conference:

A Bipartisan Bedrock

I was surprised to learn that environmental markets, particularly mitigation banking, have grown from a truly bipartisan foundation. It’s a unique space where ideals often seen as opposing – like support for reduced regulatory hurdles for development and desires to conserve and enhance our environment – come together. The shared goal? To responsibly offset the environmental impacts of projects across the country while enhancing our ecosystems.

Missing Voices, Critical Roles

The absence of many of our partners from federal agencies due to budget cuts and travel restrictions—including members of the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), US Fish and Wildlife, and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)—was palpable. Their engagement and partnership in this process is critical and was acknowledged, which also led to a thematic call for increased collaboration and new approaches to assist federal agencies as they manage the workload with reduced headcount. For example, the USACE’s RIBITS (Regulatory In-lieu Fee and Bank Information Tracking System – a national system is essential for tracking third-party mitigation efforts) requires regular and consistent upkeep, which folks suggested could be handled by a third-party to keep this vital data current.

Growing Momentum

There’s a clear and increasing interest in expanding these markets beyond just wetland and species conservation. This includes various carbon markets and biodiversity credits. We are also seeing increased interest from tribal governments in this market, as exemplified by ESA’s work with many tribes across the west, including working with a tribe in California to develop a species and wetland mitigation bank.",https://esassoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Volunteer-Park-Seattle-JBayer.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 03:02:00.517191

House Republicans’ proposed wind-down of clean energy tax credits and key Department of Energy programs would reverse the nuclear industry’s recent momentum and threaten the Trump administration’s “energy dominance” goals, Nuclear Energy Institute CEO Maria Korsnick said on Tuesday.

In an address at NEI’s annual Nuclear Energy Policy Forum in Washington, D.C., Korsnick emphasized the need for further reforms at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, federal support for an expanded U.S. nuclear supply chain and public-private workforce investments if the industry is to meet expected future power demand.

“We’re facing some headwinds, and the actions we take today will define what the future looks like,” Korsnick said. “We will be out there pounding the pavement every step of the way.”

Dive Insight:

During her 25-minute address and a brief question-and-answer session afterward, Korsnick reiterated concerns raised by nuclear industry stakeholders in an April 30 letter to House and Senate leaders.

NEI organized the campaign and collected more than 120 signatures from utilities, independent power producers, reactor developers, nuclear services firms and others. The letter urged Congress to preserve four Inflation Reduction Act tax credits that benefit the nuclear industry, including technology-neutral clean energy investment and production credits and a separate production tax credit for existing nuclear reactors.

But today, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a sweeping budget package that terminated the technology-neutral credits for new and expanded nuclear reactor projects that begin construction after 2028, four years earlier than current law requires. The bill also imposed new domestic sourcing and ownership requirements that some experts say are broadly unworkable, though it’s unclear whether those will affect existing or planned nuclear power plants.

The changes surprised some nuclear advocates, given the Trump administration’s stated support for nuclear energy and the president’s influence with the GOP House caucus.

“We aren’t taking anything for granted,” Korsnick said. “Our industry is hyper-focused on protecting federal policies and programs that preserve and expand nuclear generation.”

In her address, Korsnick name-checked Energy Secretary Chris Wright, an avowed supporter of nuclear power and former board member of advanced reactor developer Oklo, who joined the forum later in the day.

Korsnick also called out DOE’s Loan Programs Office and Advanced Reactor Demonstration program, two pro-nuclear DOE initiatives that face an uncertain future as Congress and the Trump administration look to cut federal spending.

Among the tens of billions of dollars in loan guarantees the LPO awarded under former President Joe Biden was a $1.5 billion commitment to Holtec International’s Palisades reactor restart project, which could power up the 800-MW Michigan plant later this year. With more than $100 million disbursed in March and April, LPO’s support for Palisades appears secure, but the office’s future role in supporting cutting-edge energy projects is unclear amid a staff exodus and the cancellation of at least seven conditional loan commitments this month.

The Ways and Means budget’s proposed clawback of unobligated LPO funding would arguably do more damage to the U.S. nuclear industry than repealing the clean energy tax credits, according to a May 15 analysis from Center for Strategic and International Studies Deputy Director Leslie Abrahams.

By DOE’s own count, nuclear-specific LPO applications totaled more than $64 billion in fiscal-year 2024, Abrahams said.

Meanwhile, the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program has nearly $2.5 billion in Congressional appropriations to support commercialization of reactor designs developed by X-energy and TerraPower. Both companies have asked the NRC for permission to build the reactors for their first commercial demonstration projects, which they hope to bring online in the early 2030s. TerraPower is about a year into non-nuclear construction at its southwestern Wyoming site.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/fRi82UUGjZNhL9z-Gyr8boBMXOn_P2mMfxTVTso-Hik/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9XQ0tfNDE2M19uQXh0TkNwLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-05-23 09:06:14.807903

California, however, has vowed to fight. Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the state will file a lawsuit, saying the waiver revocations are a move that will “Make America Smoggy Again.”

On May 22, the U.S. Senate followed the House of Representatives in passing a Congressional Review Act measure to block California from implementing the Advanced Clean Cars II regulation, Advanced Clean Trucks regulation, and the Heavy-Duty Low-NOx Omnibus rule, with an unprecedented use of the Congressional Review Act.

The Senate voted 51-45 to revoke California’s ban on new diesel trucks and 49-46 to revoke its expensive heavy-duty Omnibus Low Nox regulations. The House of Representatives had previously passed its companion proposals.

Advanced Clean Trucks, which has been adopted by 11 states, requires medium- and heavy-duty truck manufacturers to sell increasing percentages of zero-emission vehicles from 2024-2035.

The Low NOx Omnibus rule, which has been adopted by 10 states, imposes stringent emissions standards on new truck sales.

The California Resources Board withdrew its waiver application for another program, the Advanced Clean Fleets rules, early this year.

How Did Congress Revoke CARB's EPA Waivers?

California was given the authority to set its own vehicle pollution standards as part of the Clean Air Act more than 50 years ago, subject to a waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency.

The EPA granted the waiver for the low-NOx rule late in 2024. Advanced Clean Trucks was approved in 2023.

Since 1970 when then-Governor Ronald Reagan requested the waiver authority, air quality has improved significantly even as the state’s population doubled and the number of vehicles on California’s roads tripled, said Calstart in a statement. President Nixon signed the law granting California this authority.

The Congressional Review Act passed in 1996 requires agencies to report the issuance of ""rules"" to Congress and gives Congress procedures to overturn those rules.

But EPA waivers had never previously been considered a “rule” subject to the CRA.

The Trump administration decided differently and earlier this year submitted the waivers as “rules” to Congress for review – even though one of them had already been in effect since 2023.

The Senate Parliamentarian and the Government Accountability Office had both held that these waivers could not be revoked by a fast-tracked CRA vote.

Nevertheless, the House of Representatives passed the resolutions a few weeks ago and sent them on to the Senate.

Democratic leaders in a letter to Senate leadership said the Senate’s action means “the CRA could be weaponized to retroactively invalidate decades of agency actions — including adjudications, permits, and licensing decisions that were never previously considered ‘rules’ — and effectively hijack the Senate floor.”

ATA: ‘Monumental Victory’

The American Trucking Associations cheered the move, calling it a “monumental victory for the trucking industry, common sense, and consumers everywhere.”

“Both mandates are untethered from reality and would have been extraordinarily costly to fully implement,” ATA said. “Even states that adopted the standards are acknowledging reality by scaling back and delaying implementation.”

Trucks today produce 99% fewer nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate matter emissions than those on the road decades ago, and new trucks cut carbon emissions by over 40 percent compared to a truck manufactured in 2010. As a result, 60 of today’s trucks emit what just one truck did in 1988.

More Reactions

The Truckload Carriers Association issued a statement praising the repeal of the waivers.

“As a major issue during TCA’s 2024 Call-on-Washington, we emphasized the very notion that these rules would have been crippling to our nation’s supply chain and an obstacle to an industry that thrives on delivering a nation,” said David Heller, senior VP of Safety and Government Affairs.

Trucking 2024: The Emissions War Heats Up

American Truck Dealers President Jacqueline Gelb said in a statement:

“California’s onerous regulations have upended the trucking industry in CARB states through rationing of diesel trucks and forcing adoption of zero-emission technologies that don’t meet the performance and durability requirements for the industry.

“The industry has made great strides toward cleaner emissions, and without these mandates, it will continue to develop new technologies that reduce emissions and support the movement of our nation’s freight.”

CARB: 'Unconstitutional, Illegal, and Foolish'

Environmental and clean-transportation groups criticized the action.

The California Air Resources Board, of course, hit back with a critical statement.

“California profoundly disagrees with today's unconstitutional, illegal and foolish vote attempting to undermine critical clean air protections,” said CARB Chair Liane Randolph in a statement. “It’s an assault on states’ rights the federal administration claims to support that puts national air quality standards out of reach and will have devastating effects for the 150 million Americans who breathe unhealthy air every day.

“This short-sighted political move is another strike against the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. auto industry in a global market that is rapidly advancing toward cleaner combustion technology as well as zero-emission vehicles. These actions throw uncertainty into the middle of an ongoing vehicle certification process.

“Despite the market disruption brought on by the federal government, California remains steadfast in our commitment to work with manufacturers to keep moving toward a cleaner transportation system, and we will have more guidance in the coming days.""

Does Killing CARB Waivers Reduce U.S. Competitiveness in Clean Transportation?

“In a massive handout to special interests, the Senate today took a radical action that creates enormous policy uncertainty for the entire transportation industry,” said John Boesel, president and CEO of Calstart, an industry organization focused on transportation decarbonization, in a statement.

“This move concedes the industries of the future to global competitors, will increase air pollution, accelerate global warming and result in significant job loss,” he said.

“This vote upends decades of policy that has successfully resulted in cleaner air and the growth of a robust clean transportation industry. It is a brazen, yet futile, attempt to bring the clean transportation industry to a sudden halt. Calstart will continue to partner with the states working to fill this gaping void left by today's federal action.”

Environmental Defense Fund General Counsel Vickie Patton accused EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin of abusing his authority in ""summarily reclassifying California’s preemption waivers.

""It was done without public notice or opportunity for public input. It was part of an end run around full Congressional debate and consideration. It is flatly inconsistent with dozens of decisions by EPA administrators across Republican and Democratic administrations alike.""

What About the States Piggybacking on CARB Rules?

The Clean Air Act also allows other states to choose to adopt California’s standards. A number of states had passed legislation adopting these regulations.

Except for California, every state scheduled to adopt California’s rules in 2025-26 has delayed them to 2027, modified them, or is actively considering similar actions, according to the Safe Roads Coalition, a group of towing and recovery truck businesses that has been against the clean-truck mandates. The remaining ACT states have an adoption date of 2027.

One of those piggyback states is New York. The Trucking Association of New York (TANY) issues a statement applauding the Senate’s action, saying it “eliminates the authority for New York’s continued implementation of mandates that are both economically and

“We hope that New York will use this as an opportunity to engage with stakeholders to develop a truly balanced approach to reducing transportation related emissions that are achievable and won’t create undue burdens on the trucking industry,” it said in that statement.

“The trucking industry is making great strides in reducing our carbon footprint, and we are committed to doing much more as technology continues to improve.”",https://fleetimages.bobitstudios.com/upload/trucking-info/content/news/2025-05/legislative-report-carb-__-1200x630-s.png,N,,2025-05-23 01:02:11.982856

New Zealand’s 2024 ‘energy crisis’ grants solar PV an opportunity

Much of the New Zealand grid is dominated by hydroelectric power plants, most of which are situated on the country’s southern island. This reliance on hydroelectricity, however, caused an energy crisis last year, with a dry year significantly reducing the output of these plants.

As a result, wholesale electricity prices increased as the country became reliant on oil and gas.

Sarah Gillies, chief executive of the Electricity Authority, spoke to our sister site PV Tech about the energy crisis last year, highlighting that more investment is needed to support and stabilise New Zealand’s electricity system, with the next 12-24 months set to “continue to be challenging”.

“We need more investment in generation and to harness opportunities from new technologies and demand response to keep the lights on at an affordable price. Looking ahead, we continue to need a combination of fuels and the supply,” Gillies said.

Under the Clean Air Act of 1970, California can set its own climate emission standards that are more stringent than federal guidelines but must get federal approval to adopt individual rules.
The Environmental Protection Agency granted the waiver allowing the gas cars phaseout in December, in the waning days of the Biden administration.
“But it’s not funny.” Republicans saw the Senate vote as a victory against what they framed as Newsom’s overzealous climate policies.
“Newsom’s gas car ban was never about the planet.","The Senate’s unprecedented move to revoke California’s ban on gasoline-powered cars by 2035 threatens to upend the U.S.’s status as both an economic powerhouse and a world leader on climate change mitigation, Gov. Gavin Newsom told reporters Thursday.

He and Attorney General Rob Bonta announced plans to sue to block Congress from revoking the ban Thursday morning at the California Environmental Protection Agency office in downtown Sacramento.

In 2020, Newsom issued an executive order directing the state to phase out all sales of gas cars to encourage consumers to purchase electric vehicles and cut down on greenhouse gas emissions. Under the Clean Air Act of 1970, California can set its own climate emission standards that are more stringent than federal guidelines but must get federal approval to adopt individual rules.

Vehicle manufacturers often tailor their cars to meet California’s standards, and other states often follow suit. The Environmental Protection Agency granted the waiver allowing the gas cars phaseout in December, in the waning days of the Biden administration.

The Senate’s 51-44 vote Thursday morning using, for the first time, the Congressional Review Act to revoke that waiver now threatens to set a political precedent of impeding upon states while “selling out” future generations who will have to live in an increasingly hotter and inhospitable world, Newsom said.

“What the Senate did has been referred to correctly as a nuclear option. They decided to change the rules that have been established in the United States Senate, protocols that have been well established for centuries, in order to attack California, in order to pollute more,” he told reporters. “This isn’t complicated. This is about the act of theft, because pollution is a subsidy. It’s an act of theft against our kids and grandkids.”

He and Bonta said they would fight the revocation in court, which they called “illegal” after Senate Republicans circumvented findings from its own parliamentarian and the Government Accountability Office, which found that using the CRA to fast-track the waiver revocation vote was improper.

The governor, who is the co-chair of the U.S. Climate Alliance, also framed the vote as a hypocritical repudiation of the Republican Party of the past. He cited Richard Nixon’s championing of the Clean Air Act and then-Gov. Ronald Reagan’s establishing the California Air Resources Board in 1967.

“I was in the Oval Office a few weeks back, and in anticipation of this moment, I looked up just right above President Trump. Above the resolute desk, interestingly, is a portrait of Ronald Reagan,” Newsom said Thursday. He said he told Trump that the “moment you sign this bill authorizing the degradation of his legacy, he’ll be looking down in shame when you sign this bill.”

Trump laughed in response.

“He laughed,” Newsom said. “But it’s not funny.”

Republicans saw the Senate vote as a victory against what they framed as Newsom’s overzealous climate policies.

“Newsom’s gas car ban was never about the planet. It was about control,” California Assembly Minority Leader James Gallagher, R-Yuba City, said in a statement. “You like your car? Too bad. Can’t afford a new one? Sucks for you. Grid overloaded? Not his problem. This wasn’t climate policy. It was punishment for not living like an activist. The rest of the country finally said no thanks.”

Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Roseville, led the House vote to overturn Newsom’s electrical vehicle mandate.

“Californians can be grateful that we have checks and balances,” he said. “Gov. Newsom’s attempt to unilaterally ban most of the cars in our state could not survive a Democratic vote by representatives of the people ... Californians should be able to drive the car of their choice, not one chosen for them by the government.”

Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, the lone Democrat to side with Senate Republicans, said she cast her vote to stand up for her constituents whose livelihoods depend on automakers like Detroit’s General Motors

Newsom said electric vehicle technology was rapidly changing fast enough for middle-class people to afford them, citing a Chinese-made BYD car that costs $9,700.

“I just think that’s a vision to celebrate, not the vision of the 1950s and 60s in Los Angeles, where business leaders were moving out en mass because they couldn’t breathe,” he said.

""What that will mean for Americans is more hazardous air pollution across the country,"" says John Walke, an environmental health expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group.
In a December open letter to president-elect Trump, the group had called for a review of EPA's rules regarding hazardous air pollutants, calling them ""technically unachievable and economically infeasible.""
The policy intended to keep toxic air pollution levels not just lower, but as low as possible.
""It's so important to keep a focus on the total amount of toxic air pollution that the people who live there are breathing, and not just on the individual sources level of pollution,"" he says.","Congress has voted to undo a Clean Air Act regulation that strictly controls the amount of toxic air pollutants emitted by many industrial facilities like oil refineries, chemical plants, and steel mills.

The decision represents the first time since the creation of the landmark environmental law that Congress has rolled back its environmental protections.

Environmental groups and public health advocates condemned the vote, saying the rollback could cause higher pollution and harm human health.

""What that will mean for Americans is more hazardous air pollution across the country,"" says John Walke, an environmental health expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group.

""These are pollutants that cause cancer and birth defects and brain damage,"" Walke says.

The vote targets a rule finalized late in the Biden administration, which re-imposed tight regulations on facilities that emit seven so-called ""super pollutants"" like mercury, a dangerous form of lead, and dioxins. The rules regulating those seven pollutants, along with more than 180 others, were first imposed in the 1990s, but were rolled back during the first Trump administration.

The House approved the resolution early Thursday morning, following a Senate vote in favor of changing the rule earlier this month. Under the Congressional Review Act, lawmakers can review EPA regulations within a short window after their implementation and reverse them with a simple majority vote. President Trump has signaled he is likely to sign the bill when it arrives on his desk.

The move is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to roll back environmental and public health regulations. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced in March that he intends to re-evaluate other regulations like the one Congress just voted to change, which is related to a section of the Clean Air Act that deals with Hazardous Air Pollutants.

The agency, Zeldin says, is embarking on the ""biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history,"" which he says is meant to lower the cost of operating businesses in the U.S. while fulfilling the agency's core mission of protecting the environment. Zeldin also aims to target other parts of the Clean Air Act, like the rules regulating mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants and the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

Industry groups like the National Association of Manufacturers welcomed Congress's decision. In a December open letter to president-elect Trump, the group had called for a review of EPA's rules regarding hazardous air pollutants, calling them ""technically unachievable and economically infeasible.""

""By eliminating the misguided ""Once-in, Always-in"" rule, we can reduce compliance costs for manufacturers while incentivizing better environmental outcomes,"" says Chris Phalen, vice president of domestic policy at NAM.

But environmental and public health experts warn the change could result in higher pollution levels in communities that neighbor industrial facilities like ""oil refineries, chemical plants, coke ovens, aluminum plants, lead smelters, things of that nature. We call it the worst of the worst list,"" says Walke. The facilities are largely concentrated in parts of the country with high industrial activity, like the Gulf Coast and parts of Appalachia.

""Once in, always in""

The rule concerns the regulation of seven particularly hazardous air pollutants like dioxins and mercury. Such pollutants move through the air but also accumulate in soil, dust, and people's bodies; several are known to cause cancer, neurological issues, and birth defects even at very low exposure levels.

Rules regulating those seven air toxic pollutants, along with more than 180 others, have been in place since 1990 when Congress passed a major amendment to the Clean Air Act that greatly increased its specific regulatory powers. It tasked EPA with tightly regulating what it called ""major sources"" of dangerous air pollutants—facilities that emitted more than 25 tons (50,000 pounds) of the hazardous pollutants a year, or 10 tons of any single one. Facilities that emitted less pollution, called ""area sources,"" would be much more lightly controlled.

The regulation Congress targeted concerns which facilities count as ""major sources.""

Since the 1990s, EPA's policy has stipulated that any ""major source"" would remain categorized as such, even if it cut pollution levels to below the certain thresholds—a policy known as ""Once in, always in."" The policy intended to keep toxic air pollution levels not just lower, but as low as possible.

But under the first Trump administration, the EPA allowed major sources to re-categorize if they had reduced their dangerous emissions. Last year, the EPA under Biden undid part of that change, once again expanding the number of facilities covered.

Since the rule change is relatively recent, Republicans in Congress could now challenge it using the Congressional Review Act. The result would be a more durable change to the law. Under the rules of the CRA, ""EPA can no longer do a similar rule or a rule that is substantially similar,"" says Carrie Jenks, an environmental law expert at Harvard University. To revisit the HAP rule once again, EPA would have to come up with a new, different argument for why to keep major sources classified as major.

The advocacy group EarthJustice estimated that the change would allow roughly 1,800 industrial facilities, like steel mills or chemical factories, to apply to be taken off the ""major sources"" list.

Pollution risks

Exposure to even small levels of the seven super-toxins is so dangerous, say environmental and public health experts, that releasing major sources from the strict regulations and controls under the ""major sources"" framework could lead to higher levels of pollution exposure in nearby communities.

""Picture some of the communities in the industrial Midwest, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio or along the Gulf in Texas and Louisiana,"" where there are many emitters of toxic air pollutants concentrated in one area, says former Biden-era assistant EPA administrator Joseph Goffman.

Even if each of them were below their individual emissions limit, the total amount of pollution in the air nearby would be high, he explains. The more stringent regulations, he says, help to keep that total amount of pollution low — and safer for people nearby.

Ultimately, what matters to human health is not how much each facility emits but how much is released altogether in a specific region, Goffman says — and the EPA's more strict regulations intended to keep that overall level low.

""It's so important to keep a focus on the total amount of toxic air pollution that the people who live there are breathing, and not just on the individual sources level of pollution,"" he says.

The credit would be terminated for ""clean vehicles"" whose manufacturers sell more than 200,000 units in the U.S. per year.

While it's the federal incentive that may be going away, it could also dampen the state's electric vehicle adoption rates.

""It's probably going to decrease the rate at which we're selling electric vehicles,"" Groves said, explaining that price remains the primary factor in consumer decisions between electric and combustion vehicles.

The warning comes as Colorado has already experienced a measurable decline in EV sales following reduced state incentives. Electric and hybrid vehicle sales dropped from 31.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024 to 26.5% in the first quarter of 2025, according to CADA.

""Our high point was in Q4 of 2024,"" Groves said. ""Almost one in every three cars.""

The decline coincided with Colorado's state EV tax credit dropping from $5,000 to $3,500 on Jan. 1, 2025. The state credit will continue decreasing annually, compounding the potential impact of losing federal incentives.

""The tax credits were designed to pull those prices into parity so that you could make a decision, sort of all things equal. An apples to Apple's decision,"" Groves said. ""Getting rid of those vehicle purchase incentives is going to sort of disaggregate the prices and make electric more expensive again.""

""We did have a huge rush in March,"" Groves said, referencing consumer behavior ahead of anticipated policy changes.

The Colorado Energy Office defended the state's commitment to electric vehicle adoption, telling 9NEWS in a statement that ""Colorado drivers are clear: electric vehicles are here to stay, and demand will continue to grow.""

The office warned that removing federal credits ""would increase costs for families and individuals who want cleaner, more affordable and quieter transportation options.""

Projects must begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment — likely later this year — to be eligible for the credits.
The foreign involvement restrictions apply to “foreign entities of concern” like China, which controls much of the upstream supply chain for batteries, electric motors and other clean energy equipment.
Related: Green Hydrogen Faces Reality Check in Europe The bill also eliminates the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credit transferability framework for most clean energy projects.
It also extends a separate production credit for existing nuclear power plants through 2031 and preserves transferability for nuclear projects.","The text that passed the House on a 215-214, party-line vote early Thursday is even less favorable to clean energy interests than a previous draft that industry groups widely panned, UtilityDive reported.

The bill terminates the 48E investment and 45Y production tax credits for non-nuclear clean energy projects placed in service after 2028, with no phaseout period. Projects must begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment — likely later this year — to be eligible for the credits.

The version the House Ways and Means Committee released on May 12 stepped down the value of the 48E and 45Y credits over three years and did not include the imminent construction-start requirement, giving developers and asset owners more leeway to wait out lengthy waits for grid interconnection.

Combined with even tighter restrictions on foreign involvement in U.S. clean energy projects, the truncated eligibility window leaves a “near impossible” pathway for non-nuclear developers to qualify for the 48E and 45Y credits, Jeffries said. The foreign involvement restrictions apply to “foreign entities of concern” like China, which controls much of the upstream supply chain for batteries, electric motors and other clean energy equipment.

Related: Green Hydrogen Faces Reality Check in Europe

The bill also eliminates the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credit transferability framework for most clean energy projects. Experts say transferability, which previously enjoyed bipartisan support, expands project financing options for small and midsize energy developers.

Following an outcry from industry groups like the Nuclear Energy Institute, the House bill extends production and investment tax credit eligibility for advanced nuclear projects and power uprates of existing reactors that begin construction by 2028. It also extends a separate production credit for existing nuclear power plants through 2031 and preserves transferability for nuclear projects.

The practical effect of the nuclear carveout is unclear. Projects like the planned reactor restarts at Constellation Energy’s 835-MW Crane Clean Energy Center and Holtec International’s 800-MW Palisades plant would likely qualify, but many greenfield projects are not expected to begin reactor construction until later this decade. For example, the Tennessee Valley Authority earlier this week began a more than two-year federal permitting process for a small modular reactor that it expects to begin building in late 2028.

The biggest surprise in the latest version of the bill is what Jeffries called the “intentional targeting” of the residential solar sector. The previous version of the bill quickly terminated the 25D tax credit for customer-owned residential solar installations while preserving it for installations leased by companies like Sunrun, the country’s biggest third-party solar and energy storage leasing enterprise.

“This short-lived advantage to [residential solar leases] was seemingly corrected, with new text now ‘leveling the playing field’ by targeting all future residential solar originations, whether leased or owned,” Jeffries said.

Shares of Sunrun fell about 40% in early Thursday trading; stocks of other solar companies also tumbled.

Clean energy advocates and trade groups said the bill would devastate an industry driving the United States’ manufacturing boom while increasing customers’ utility bills and threatening the stability of the electric grid.

“This unworkable legislation is willfully ignorant of the fact that deploying solar and storage is the only way the U.S. power grid can meet the demand of American consumers, businesses and innovation,” the Solar Energy Industries Association said in a statement.

The head of Advanced Energy United, another clean energy trade group, called the legislation a “meat cleaver” in a statement noting that solar, wind, storage and other “advanced energy” added 50 GW to the U.S. grid in 2024 and produced about $400 billion in domestic revenues.

The House bill “abruptly dismantles bipartisan, long-standing tax policy that has catalyzed billions in private investment for affordable, reliable energy while sparking a rebirth of manufacturing across America,” AEU President and CEO Heather O’Neill said. “If enacted as written, this bill will weaken our power system and send shockwaves throughout the U.S. economy by raising electricity prices, killing tens of thousands of jobs and ceding energy dominance to China.”

In a report released before the House bill passed, the American Clean Energy Association identified more than 800 manufacturing facilities involved in the U.S. clean energy supply chain. Seventy-three percent of those are located in “Republican states,” it said.

Preserve green energy tax credits for climate progress

To: Sen. Tillis, Rep. Harris, Sen. Budd

From: A verified voter in Waxhaw , NC

May 23

The proposed Republican tax bill represents a severe threat to the nation's progress on clean energy and climate action. By eliminating crucial tax credits for renewable energy projects like wind, solar, and even nuclear power, as well as incentives for electric vehicles and energy-efficient home upgrades, this legislation will drive up energy costs for American households and unleash millions of additional tons of greenhouse gas emissions that exacerbate the climate crisis. Experts warn that the bill could result in over 830,000 job losses by 2030, dealing a devastating blow to the burgeoning clean energy industry and undermining the very economic opportunities and pathways to the middle class that the Inflation Reduction Act promised. Furthermore, the removal of these tax credits risks jeopardizing over $500 billion in planned investments across the country, particularly in Republican-held districts that have benefited significantly from the unprecedented surge in renewable energy development. It is imperative that the residential tax credits for green energy and energy-efficient home improvements be preserved. These incentives not only empower individuals to reduce their carbon footprints and energy costs but also serve as a crucial driver for the wider adoption of clean technologies and the growth of a sustainable energy economy. Abandoning these credits would be a step backward in our efforts to combat climate change and secure a prosperous, resilient future for all Americans.

The cuts have left the remaining staff ""devastated,"" Cantello said, as they watch their work being walked back.
The House passed its version of the budget Thursday morning, proposing cuts to environmental and climate justice block grants, and funding for climate solutions in disadvantaged communities.
The U.S. EPA remains confident in its ability to protect human health and the environment amid pending staff and budget cuts, EPA Associate Administrator for Public Affairs Molly Vaseliou, said in an emailed statement Thursday to Ideastream Public Media.
Disbanding the division halts environmental work slated for disenfranchised communities, Cantello said.","Ohio is expected to feel the effects of cuts to regional Environmental Protection Agency staff, according to experts.

There are about a thousand employees in EPA Region 5, which covers Ohio Michigan, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin, according to Nicole Cantello, President of American Federation of Government Employees Local 704, the union for regional EPA employees. The workforce in the region decreased by as much as 20 percent, with more cuts expected by the end of July, according to the union.

""We're cut to the bone and we don't have enough staff to begin with at the beginning of this administration,"" Cantello said.

So far, U.S. EPA has issued two rounds of deferred resignation offers to its employees, in addition to laying off as many as 100 probationary employees in February. Many of the probationary employees have been rehired but put on paid administrative leave, Cantello said.

The cuts have left the remaining staff ""devastated,"" Cantello said, as they watch their work being walked back.

""Environmental protection will not happen without having people here to do inspections, people to monitor the lakes, and people to monitor the air all around our six states.""

Five water inspectors were placed on leave, Cantello said, meaning their inspections of sources of pollution along the Great Lakes are on hold.

""The Great Lakes are really important to people in Ohio. Those five inspectors, they would do about 10 to 20 inspections a year,"" she said. "" Say they do 15 inspections that's 75 inspections across the region that would not be done by those employees in the water area.""

Reducing wasteful spending

The cuts are motivated by a desire to remove sources of ""waste, fraud and abuse"" in the agency, U.S. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a a message sent to employees in February.

Region 5 staffers have yet to be presented with evidence of such financial waste, Cantello said.

""We're really concerned that message has taken hold,"" Cantello said. ""That somehow we're all over here wasting the administration's money, or the American peoples' money, and not doing anything about it. That's not happening.""

It's the paid administrative leave that's wasteful, according to Debra Shore, the Region 5 Administrator during the Biden administration.

""The American taxpayers, our government, are paying employees not to work. So the work isn't getting done. What are the savings for the taxpayers?"" Shore said. ""It appears that this administration wants to drive out staff before Congress can exercise its authority.""

The federal Reduction in Force Plan calling for a 50% to 75% reduction in the EPA’s workforce will greatly reduce the agency’s ability to protect the environment, Cantello said, crippling environmental work in the region when coupled with EPA budget reductions proposed by the Trump Administration.

The president's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 recommends reducing the EPA's operating budget by half, with cuts to environmental justice, emissions reduction efforts, programs to control algal blooms in fresh water and spending on lead water line replacement.

The House passed its version of the budget Thursday morning, proposing cuts to environmental and climate justice block grants, and funding for climate solutions in disadvantaged communities. The Senate will now work on its own version of the budget.

The U.S. EPA remains confident in its ability to protect human health and the environment amid pending staff and budget cuts, EPA Associate Administrator for Public Affairs Molly Vaseliou, said in an emailed statement Thursday to Ideastream Public Media.

""We are confident EPA will have the resources needed to accomplish the agency’s core mission, fulfill all statutory obligations, and support President Trump’s agenda."" Vaseliou said in the statement. ""With the President’s budget, we can ensure taxpayer dollars are spent on protecting human health and the environment, as well as unleashing energy dominance, implementing permitting reform, making America the AI capital of the world, and bringing back the American auto industry.

Environmental justice cuts threaten Ohio's funding

Ohio was set to receive more than 24 million dollars in federal funds through the U.S. EPA in 2025 issued through the EPA’s environmental justice division. However, the Trump Administration eliminated the division in March, putting staff on paid leave and halting access to the funds.

Ohio was awarded grant funding last year to support projects like a gas stove replacement program lead by MetroHealth and greenspace conservation through the Trust for Public Land.

Disbanding the division halts environmental work slated for disenfranchised communities, Cantello said.

""An area like East Palestine, Ohio was considered to be [an environmental justice community] because it was low income, and that kind of community really does need help from EPA in order to protect it from pollution,"" she said.

It’s up to the courts to decide whether Ohio and other states should have access to the money, Cantello said, but regardless of the courts decision, the agency will still lack necessary staff.

""There's no one in the environmental justice division anymore to authorize the money being spent,"" she said. ""It's just really, really, really a blow to those communities around our six states, including those in Ohio, that bear disproportionate burden of pollution.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/da0f86f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5800x3045+0+411/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6c%2F85%2F11593a2d4225a7005fef5f32697e%2Fshutterstock-2187169479.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 21:02:30.551145

“The score on whether the California clean air rule is treated by EPA as a waiver or a rule?
Republicans argued that California’s rules amount to de facto national standards, given the state’s size and the fact that other states have signed on.
Other states, including Rhode Island, follow California’s emissions standards because it’s good for public health to have clean air, Whitehouse said.
California has no valid basis under the Clean Air Act to claim an extraordinary or unique air quality impact from carbon dioxide emissions, a chapter on transportation asserts.","In a move Democrats warned would have disastrous consequences for the economy, the environment and public health, the Republican-led Senate Thursday voted to block California’s electric-vehicle mandates, revoking the state’s right to implement the nation’s toughest emissions standards.

Republicans used the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, to overturn California’s long-standing authority under the Clean Air Act to request waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency to pass emissions standards stricter than federal rules and protect residents from dangerous air pollution. The move affects 17 other states, and Washington, D.C., which have voluntarily adopted one or more of California’s stricter standards.

The CRA allows Congress to quickly rescind a rule within a limited time after it’s issued by a federal agency, allowing a simple majority vote rather than the 60 votes needed to advance legislation under the filibuster rule.

But both the Senate parliamentarian, the chamber’s official nonpartisan advisor, and the Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan congressional referee, said the waivers are not rules and so are not subject to the Congressional Review Act.

In defying the Senate parliamentarian, Democrats charged, the vote endangers not just the health of children and the climate but also decades of legal precedent and the integrity of the Senate itself.

“Today, the Senate has done something unprecedented,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island late Wednesday night, after he and his Democratic colleagues spent the past several days urging Republicans to respect not just California’s authority under the law but also Senate rules.

“Our actions and the ones that will follow from the procedural steps taken here today over the next day or so, will change the Clean Air Act, will change the Congressional Review Act, will change the rules of the Senate and will do so by overruling the parliamentarian and breaking the filibuster—in effect, going nuclear,” Whitehouse said, referring to attempts to subvert the filibuster.

“This isn’t just about California’s climate policies, and this isn’t just about the scope of the Congressional Review Act, and this isn’t just about eliminating the legislative filibuster,” said California Sen. Alex Padilla on the Senate floor Tuesday. The Trump administration’s EPA submitted California’s waivers for review by Congress “with full knowledge that they are not actually rules” subject to the CRA, Padilla said, opening the door for any agency to ask Congress to revoke regulations a new administration doesn’t like.

By mid-afternoon Thursday, Republicans moved to overturn California’s waivers through a procedural maneuver—giving the Senate the authority to determine what constitutes a rule for fast-track voting. They overturned waivers behind California’s rules to reduce tailpipe emissions from passenger vehicles and trucks, those regulating medium- and heavy-duty trucks and the rule for heavy-duty smog-producing diesel and gas trucks.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) mocked Democrats’ objections to using the CRA, saying they were “throwing a tantrum over a supposed procedural problem.”

Thune insisted that having a waiver submitted to Congress “is all that Congress has ever needed to decide to consider something under the Congressional Review Act.”

He called the GAO’s ruling that the waiver is not a rule “an extraordinary deviation from precedent,” saying it was the first time the office “has decided to insert itself into the process and affirmatively declare that an agency rule submitted to Congress as a rule is not a rule.”

Despite Thune’s claim, since the CRA was passed in 1996 the GAO has offered 26 legal opinions about whether an agency action was a rule in response to inquiries from members of Congress.

And EPA never submitted California Clean Air Act waivers to Congress before the Trump administration, Padilla and his Democratic colleagues say. They contend that Republicans chose this route because they don’t have the votes to withdraw the waivers through legislation.

“The CRA has never been used to go after emission waivers like the ones in question today,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said on the floor Tuesday. “The waiver is so important to the health of our country, and particularly to our children, to go nuclear on something as significant as this and to do the bidding of the fossil fuel industry is outrageous.”

The first waiver was granted to California on July 11, 1968, Whitehouse told his colleagues in a last-ditch effort to change their minds late Wednesday night. Waivers have either been granted or amended or modified repeatedly since then, he said. “The score on whether the California clean air rule is treated by EPA as a waiver or a rule? It’s 131 to zero.”

The use of the Congressional Review Act resolution is inconsistent with past precedent and violates the plain language of the act itself, said John Swanton, a spokesperson for California’s Air Resources Board, which regulates emissions.

“The vote does not change CARB’s authority,” Swanton said, adding that the agency will continue its mission to protect the public health of Californians impacted by harmful air pollution.

Ten million Californians live in areas that are under distinct, elevated threats from air pollution, said Adam Schiff, California’s junior senator. That has led to higher rates of respiratory issues like asthma and chronic lung disease, and increased the risk of heart disease, cancer, chronic headaches and immune system issues, he said.

“And that is multiplied by us living now on the front lines of the climate crisis. We have devastating and year-round fire dangers that put millions of other pollutants into our air,” Schiff said. “We need, deserve and reserve the right as Californians to do something about our air.”

Yet earlier this month, House Republicans, joined by 35 Democrats, including two from California, voted to rescind the waivers, sending the issue to the Senate.

A “Compelling and Extraordinary” Need

California’s legal authority to implement stricter air quality standards than federal rules comes from having already implemented its own tailpipe-emission regulations before Congress passed national standards in 1967. California officials developed the regulations to deal with the “compelling and extraordinary” air-pollution problems caused by the Golden State’s unique geography, climate and abundance of people and vehicles.

Recognizing these unique conditions, Congress gave California the authority to ask the Environmental Protection Agency for a waiver from rules barring states from passing air and climate pollution rules that are more protective than federal rules.

Only one waiver was denied, an action that was quickly reversed, according to CARB. And though the Trump administration in 2019 withdrew a waiver, a move that legal scholars say has no basis in the law, the Biden administration restored the state’s authority to set its own vehicle-emission standards within a few years.

Republicans argued that California’s rules amount to de facto national standards, given the state’s size and the fact that other states have signed on.

But California can’t force its emission standards on other states, Padilla said. “Yes, over a dozen other states have voluntarily followed in California’s footsteps, not because they were forced to, but because they chose to, in order to protect their constituents, their residents and protect our planet.”

California’s standards also represent ambitious but achievable steps to cut carbon emissions and fight the climate crisis, Padilla said. “Transportation is the single largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and California has been proud to set the example for other states who may choose to follow suit.”

Padilla, who grew up in California’s chronically polluted San Fernando Valley, recalled being sent home from grade school “on a pretty regular basis” when throat-burning smog settled over the valley.

“It appears that Republicans want to overturn half a century of precedent in order to undermine California’s ability to protect the health of our residents,” Padilla said. “Republicans seem to be putting the wealth of the big oil industry over the health of our constituents.”

“For Their Fossil Fuel Donors”

Rhode Island’s Whitehouse, who has long schooled his colleagues on the perils of carbon pollution, took to the floor Tuesday to school them on the Congressional Review Act.

Under the American legal system, administrative agencies can make rules through “a very robust process” that follows the Administrative Procedure Act, Whitehouse said. A rule could be contested in court, but years ago Congress decided there also could be a period of review when congressional members could reject the rule.

And for all the decades since the CRA was passed, he said, it’s been used to address rules under the APA within the specified 60 days.

Other states, including Rhode Island, follow California’s emissions standards because it’s good for public health to have clean air, Whitehouse said. “Efficient cars may mean lower cost for consumers, but those lower costs for consumers are lower sales for the fossil fuel industry.”

Whitehouse told his colleagues they had legitimate pathways to change laws they didn’t like. They could pass a joint resolution or a simple Senate resolution. But those approaches would require 60 votes to end debate.

“They don’t want to do that,” he said. “They want to ram this thing through for their fossil fuel donors.”

Republicans, by contrast, argued they had the authority to protect consumers from what they call California’s “electric vehicle mandate,” which they say would endanger consumers, the economy and the nation’s energy supply.

“And our already shaky electric grid would quickly face huge new burdens from the surge in new electric vehicles,” argued Thune.

Congress had approved $5 billion to build electric vehicle charging infrastructure across the country, but the Trump administration withheld that funding, triggering a lawsuit from a coalition of attorneys to reverse what they said was a clearly illegal action.

Republicans’ attacks on electric vehicles could disrupt a burgeoning industry built around the transition to renewable energy.

“The repeal of these waivers will dramatically destabilize the regulatory landscape at a time when industry needs certainty to invest in the future and compete on a global scale,” said Jamie Hall, policy director for EV Realty, which develops EV-charging hubs.

“The fossil fuel industry essentially runs the Republican Party right now.”

— Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.)

Thune also argued that California’s waiver rules are an improper expansion of a limited Clean Air Act authority, echoing an argument in Project 2025, a policy blueprint for the second Trump Administration produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation, which has long battled efforts to combat climate change.

California has no valid basis under the Clean Air Act to claim an extraordinary or unique air quality impact from carbon dioxide emissions, a chapter on transportation asserts. Its recommendation? “Revoke the special waiver granted to California by the Biden administration.”

On Wednesday, a clearly frustrated Whitehouse argued that Republicans were helping the fossil fuel industry create a shortcut for itself so it can sell more gasoline and ignore all the states that joined California to demand cleaner air for their constituents. “The fossil fuel industry essentially runs the Republican Party right now,” he said.

Last year, the oil and gas industry spent more than $153 million on lobbying, led by the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, which spent $27.6 million to influence Congress on bills including those designed to repeal vehicle-emission standards. The trade group also donated $178,750 to congressional candidates, 96 percent of which went to Republicans.

The American Petroleum Institute, the largest U.S. oil and gas industry trade association, spent $6.25 million on lobbying last year to influence some of the same bills. Of nearly $400,000 donated to congressional candidates last year, 78 percent went to Republicans.

Ninety-five percent of the $21,000 the Heritage Foundation donated to congressional candidates last year went to Republicans.

“We Believe That You Can Do It”

The week before Donald Trump returned to office, the American Petroleum Institute held its biggest annual meeting in Washington, D.C. API promoted the event as an opportunity to urge the incoming Trump administration and Congress to “seize the American energy opportunity” by advancing commonsense energy policies.

Thune joined API Chief Executive Mike Sommers on stage, where they reminisced about starting their careers in adjacent offices in the same congressional office building 30 years ago.

“It is a huge opportunity, having an administration that actually is pro-energy development working with the Congress,” Thune told his old friend. “We want to be supportive in any way that we can in ensuring that the president and his team have success in making America energy dominant.”

Sommers suggested that one of the “big, powerful tools” Congress can use when one party controls both chambers is the Congressional Review Act, which he said offers fast-track authority to reverse “midnight regulations” passed by the Biden administration.

Thune said he wouldn’t be able to use the CRA for one of California’s tailpipe emissions standards because it doesn’t fit within the required time window. But he was arguing with the parliamentarian and others, he said, “about the whole California waiver issue and how to reverse that because that was such a radical regulatory overreach.”

Both California’s Clean Cars and Clean Trucks rules require an increasing percentage of vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emissions by 2035, with the cars rule, the so-called “EV mandate,” requiring that 100 percent of passenger cars and trucks be zero emissions by that date.

“What California did was completely radical,” Sommers said at the meeting. “The fact that 17 other states who’ve waived into this are going to be subject to it could completely change the vehicle market.”

“So we would highly encourage you to look at that as an option for the CRA,” Sommers told Thune. “And we believe that you can do it.”

Thune assured Sommers that his committee chairs and team were looking at ways to fit repeal of California’s waivers “within the parameters of a CRA action” to fix what they saw as a shared problem.

The oil and gas industry appreciated the efforts of Thune; John Barrasso of Wyoming, the Senate Majority Whip; and West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, who pledged to overturn California’s clean cars rule and introduced the measure to do so last month.

“Today, the United States Senate delivered a victory for American consumers, manufacturers and U.S. energy security by voting to overturn the prior administration’s EPA rule authorizing California’s gas car ban and preventing its spread across our country,” said the American Petroleum Institute and the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers in a joint statement. “We cannot thank Senators John Barrasso, Shelley Moore Capito and Leader John Thune enough for their leadership on this important issue.”

Back on the Senate floor, Democrats warned their Republican colleagues that they may live to regret their decision to override the parliamentarian and flout legislative rules.

“It won’t be long before Democrats are once again in the driver’s seat here, in the majority once again,” Padilla said. When that happens, he warned, every agency action that Democrats don’t like, whether it’s a rule or not and no matter how much time has passed, would be fair game with this new precedent.

“I suggest that we all think long and hard and be very careful about this,” he implored, in vain. “I would urge my colleagues, all my colleagues, to join me, not just in defending California’s rights to protect the health of our residents, not just in combating the existential threat of climate change, but in maintaining order in this chamber.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2198985834-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 22:03:42.814136

“What plants do PFAS get into? Is it going to be in the leaves, the tubers, the roots?” Martin said.

But now, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has terminated a $1.6 million grant that supported his work, preventing Martin from sending any of his contaminated crop samples for testing.

“The longer we wait before we determine if any crops take up PFAS, the more exposure people are going to have,” Martin warned.

The funding cut also affects Upland Grassroots, a nonprofit working with the Mi’kmaq Nation on similar PFAS studies. Researcher Chelli Stanley said they were just about to begin gathering samples when they had to pause everything.

“We had just been ready to go out and collect all this data and start analyzing it—but now it’s been stalled,” she said.

Stanley added this decision is something that not only impacts data collection for the organization's current project but also puts future research at risk.

“It’s going to push back our ability to protect ourselves from PFAS and our environment from PFAS going far into the future.”

Director Gail Carlson of the Buck Lab for Climate and Environment at Colby College says research like this is critical to informing us how to prevent crops from being contaminated as well as how we can use certain plants to remediate sites that are already contaminated.

""We have to conduct research first before we can develop any kind of technologies to remediate PFAS contamination in soil and identify how that affects farming practices,"" Carlson explained.

In a statement, the Environmental Protection Agency said it is reevaluating all awarded grants to make sure they align with Trump administration priorities. The agency placed blame on the previous administration, accusing it of using EPA funds to advance a political agenda.

“Maybe the Biden-Harris Administration shouldn't have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and 'environmental justice' preferencing on the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment...” the EPA said in part.

Despite the setback, Martin and Stanley say they plan to keep the research going. Their teams are freezing contaminated crop samples until they can secure new funding for testing.

“We have to stay on top of it,” Martin said. “Make sure our soil stays clean, stays productive, and that we can produce healthy food.”

Legislators like Democratic Representative Chellie Pingree are also fighting for the reinstatement of these funds, describing the EPA's decision as ""blatantly illegal and unconstitutional.""

Specifically, Senate Republicans voted to review California's emissions waiver through the Congressional Review Act, wherein the initial waiver can be overturned by a simple majority vote.

The history of California's emissions independence goes back nearly 60 years, with the Golden State receiving waivers from Democratic and Republican administrations alike.","Two seemingly opposing things can be true at once. California being both a haven for car culture and emissions regulations is one of these paradoxical facts, but Republicans in the U.S. Senate are now trying to end the Golden State's long-held power of making its own emissions regulations, with the state's plans to prevent sales of new gas-powered cars directly in the crosshairs.

California has been unique in its ability to set its own emissions regulations for decades, creating a specific market of state-compliant vehicles and coaxing 17 other states into adopting the more-stringent emissions rules. The day-to-day reality of these rules includes things like annual emissions testing and strict rules surrounding modifying your car — and it is these rules that Senate Republicans are hell-bent on removing. (Plus, the plan to repeal California's emissions waivers serves as a political attack on Governor Gavin Newsom and the states that follow California's lead.)

Under Lee Zeldin's rule, the Environmental Protection Agency has already rolled back stricter federal emissions rules implemented during the Biden administration. However, a Wednesday, May 21 vote by Senate Republications is furthering that mission of forcing California to cede automotive power back to the federal government. Specifically, Senate Republicans voted to review California's emissions waiver through the Congressional Review Act, wherein the initial waiver can be overturned by a simple majority vote. That means that Senate Democrats would not be able to block the vote by way of filibuster.

Then on Thursday, the Senate voted 51-44 in favor of revoking three of California's vehicle emissions waivers, in the process removing the state's ability to mandate all new car sales be electric vehicles by 2035. Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan was the only Democrat to vote in favor of the bill. This move comes after legislators in the House of Representatives already voted to reverse said waiver, which means the bill will now be passed to President Donald Trump for his signature.

The history of California's emissions independence goes back nearly 60 years, with the Golden State receiving waivers from Democratic and Republican administrations alike. Democratic lawmakers say that these EPA waivers aren't subject to the review law, claiming that the use of such a mechanism is actually illegal; officials at the Government Accountability Office and the U.S. Senate parliamentarian agree. Historically speaking, automakers have largely chosen to follow California's emissions standards, as CARB-compliant states account for 40% of new light-duty vehicle registrations across the entire U.S.

""These waivers are not new or novel,"" Kathy Harris, director of clean vehicles at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in an interview with The Guardian. ""Stymieing California’s ability is a direct attack on our ability to limit pollution and health-harming pollutants in the air.""

It's not immediately clear what the fallout would be for the 17 states that currently follow CARB emissions regulations if California's emissions-setting independence is repealed. States are constitutionally granted the ability to offer further legal protections than their federal counterparts, but the reality of this change could amount to a complete reworking of each state's emissions rules. Either way, Senate Democrats and Governor Newsom aren't giving up without a fight.

""This move will harm public health and deteriorate air quality for millions of children and people across the country,"" said Senators Alex Padilla, Sheldon Whitehouse, and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer in a statement.

""The United States Senate has a choice: cede American car-industry dominance to China and clog the lungs of our children, or follow decades of precedent and uphold the clean-air policies that Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon fought so hard for,"" Newsom said in a statement. ""Will you side with China or America?""

California Governor Gavin Newsom.

California's clean modern air is the direct result of decades of emissions regulations, and the risk associated with rolling back the modernization of vehicle standards in the U.S. is a lack of development domestically. Regardless, this recent Senate action is yet another example of the way President Trump, who has previously spoken out against electric vehicles in general but more recently has praised Elon Musk's Teslas, is mobilizing the Republican party to follow through on his promises.

""California has imposed the most ridiculous car regulations anywhere in the world, with mandates to move to all-electric cars,"" Trump said during his campaign. ""I will terminate that.""","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/low-angle-view-of-sign-for-a-california-emissions-news-photo-1747938910.pjpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.756xh;0,0.178xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-05-22 22:03:32.679175

A marathon session that began Wednesday resulted in 1,100-plus page legislation that curbs billions of dollars in spending across food assistance, student loans, Medicaid and action to address climate change.

The bill, which now heads to the Senate, repeals or phases out more quickly clean energy tax credits passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act during former President Joe Biden’s term. Biden’s climate law has been considered monumental for the clean energy transition, but the House bill effectively renders moot much of the law’s incentives for renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Clean energy advocates said the bill walks back the largest government investment in clean energy in history.

“In a bid to cut taxes for billionaires and provide a grab bag of goodies to Big Oil, the majority in the House took a sledgehammer to clean energy tax credits and to the protection of our public lands,” said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“These credits are delivering billions of dollars in new investments in homegrown American energy — creating jobs, lowering energy costs and addressing the climate crisis that is fueling floods, fires and heat waves,” Goldfuss said.

President Donald Trump celebrated the bill’s passage, calling it “arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country.” Trump appealed to the Senate to pass the measure as soon as possible and send it to his desk.

The Senate hopes to wrap up its version by early July. At least four Republican senators, led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have urged continuation of energy tax credits, including support for traditional and renewable energy sources. Republican-led states and Congressional districts have benefited from billions of dollars in clean energy manufacturing investments spurred by the Biden-era subsidies.

Full-scale repeal of current credits “could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,” the senators said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.

“A wholesale repeal, or the termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing … job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy,” the senators wrote in the April 9 letter. The letter was also signed by GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas.

In a win for House moderates and some Western lawmakers, the House bill strips language that would have allowed the sale of hundreds of thousands acres of public lands in Utah and Nevada. Opponents argued the sales would have opened the door for more oil and gas drilling.

What was gutted in the bill

The House bill takes an axe to tax credits for rooftop solar installments and eliminates electric vehicle tax credits after 2025, with a one-year exception for EVs manufactured by automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 cars that qualified for the credit.

Credits for solar and electric vehicles, which reduce harmful emissions, help to boost demand for the technologies and drive down their cost.

House Republicans also tightened tax credit restrictions for projects associated with foreign entities, including China — an added blow to domestic clean energy expansion since China dominates much of the supply chain.

The bill slashes a three-year phase-down schedule previously proposed, and instead cuts off projects that don’t start construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage. Those projects would also have to start operating before 2029.

“This bill threatens the clean energy industry at a time when it’s proving to be not only economically beneficial — lowering costs, creating jobs and fueling local economies — but also essential to America’s energy future,” said Andrew Reagan, president of Clean Energy for America, an industry group.

The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry, applauded the bill as a step to “restore American energy dominance.”

“By preserving competitive tax policies, opening lease sales” for oil and gas drilling and advancing permitting reforms, the legislation “is a win for our nation’s energy future,” API President Mike Sommers said in a statement.

No sale of public lands

At the behest of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke and some other Republicans, lawmakers stripped a provision that would have sold or transferred about 460,000 acres (186,155 hectares) of federal land in Nevada and Utah to local governments or private entities.

The proposal exposed sharp divisions between Western Republicans who say the federal government controls too much of their states and others such as Zinke, a former Interior secretary in Trump’s first term whose state is protective of access to lands for hunting and recreation.

“At the heart of the matter is that public land that’s in the federal estate belongs to everybody,” Zinke told The Associated Press Thursday. “To suggest that you’re going to sell land to pay off the debt, I think that’s misguided and, quite frankly, disingenuous.”

The land sales had been inserted in the bill following a late-night committee vote, despite earlier pledges from Republican leaders that the sales were off the table.

Supporters said they would generate revenue and ease growth pressures by creating room for more and cheaper housing in booming Western cities such as Las Vegas, Reno, Nevada, and St. George, Utah. Those communities are hemmed in by federal property, which makes up 80% of the land in Nevada and 63% in Utah.

A spokesperson for Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, who sponsored the bid to sell federal lands in his state, said his office was “exploring all options” to make the transfers happen.

Housing advocates had cautioned federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing, and some of the parcels to be sold were far from developed areas.

Tracy Stone-Manning, president of the Wilderness Society and a former director of the Bureau of Land Management under Biden, said she appreciated Zinke’s work to prevent the public lands sale.

But she said the bill was still a “big giveaway” to the private sector. “By opening hundreds of millions of acres to drilling, mining and logging to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, this bill harms the tens of millions of people who like to hike, recreate or find solace in the outdoors,” she said.

Trump targets Biden’s climate policy

At the same time the bill slashes support for clean energy, it paves the way for oil, gas and coal.

Through the bill, natural gas pipeline developers can pay a $10 million fee for expedited permitting, and applicants for a potential liquefied natural gas export site can pay a $1 million fee to be deemed in the “public interest,” circumventing what is usually a regulatory challenge.

Has your local dealership offered you an EV loaner while your car was in service?","Few things are as pervasive and as mind-numbingly predictable as the hatred of cars we've never actually driven. It’s a behavior embedded deep in the psychology of the car enthusiast. This isn't new.

Gearheads have always argued over the unknown, muscle guys writing off rotaries, import fans sneering at Detroit iron, dismissing anything with heated seats and cupholders. But nowhere is this irrational antagonism more obvious than in the war over electric vehicles.

How a Simple Test Drive Converts 70-Year-Old Gas Car Owners

EVs have become the all-electric lightning rod for every cultural, political, and technological anxiety currently gripping the auto industry. And yet, in one small corner of rural Pennsylvania, a humble dealership stumbled onto something profound, all it takes to change a mind is a short drive and an open seat.

A Reddit user by the name of Buckles01 laid it out plainly in a post that’s been quietly making the rounds among EV circles:

“I live in a pretty rural area of western Pennsylvania, and after paying a bit of attention to the specific cars around me, I got a good idea of how many EVs were in my city. Outside of my own, I had only ever really seen a couple of Teslas, but they weren’t popular. Less than 10, probably closer to 5 throughout the city.

Over the past year, there were a couple more that popped up, including an EV9 and a Nissan Ariya. I’ve seen a couple of Chevys, both Blazers and Equinox, and even a Mustang. But the last couple of months, they’ve exploded. In my neighborhood, there are 4 prologues out of nowhere. They’re easy to identify since I work from home and my desk is by the window near the stop sign. I always hear them as they come to a stop (the prologues are actually pretty loud with their hums), and they’re three different colors, and the fourth has a bunch of decals. I’ve also seen some new blazers around.

I stopped in at a local shop and was talking to the owner like normal, and she mentioned getting a Blazer. Last person I would’ve thought, and a 70+ year old lady on the verge of retirement. I asked what made her switch, and she explained. She took her ICE in to get it serviced, and the dealer made a new policy. Any loaner vehicle that wasn’t kept overnight was required to be an EV. She said it was the safest and most comfortable she’s ever been in a car. She said she got her car back, and that’s really when she felt how much she missed the car. She went back 2 weeks later to buy what she had driven. And the family that owns the dealership she goes to also owns the Honda dealership.

That’s the biggest obstacle. Getting people to drive one, not necessarily buy them. Obviously the end goal is to buy and get more on the road, but instead of just talk, talk, talk, focus on just getting people to drive one. She wasn’t encouraged to buy it, just given it for a day. And that’s likely what happened with a lot of the prologues. GM and Honda are massive brands and have a lot of brand loyalty. There are people who won’t go to another brand with better vehicles just because they’re that loyal to these brands. This really is something dealers need to do more often. If they have loaner vehicles, they need to prioritize using EVs for them. It will sell cars.”

The dealer’s secret? Simplicity. If your gas-powered ride was in for service, but not overnight, they handed you the keys to an EV. No green lectures. No bullet-point flyers explaining carbon offsets. Just, “Here you go. See you later.” One of those sightings? A 70-something shop owner who took the EV Blazer as a loaner and wound up buying one two weeks later.

2024 U.S. EV Sales Jump 21% to 1.7 Million Units Amid Global 29% Surge

In 2024, EVs accounted for over 10% of new car sales in the U.S., with approximately 1.7 million units sold, a 21% increase from the previous year. Despite this growth, the pace lags behind global trends, as North America experienced only a 5% increase in EV sales during the first four months of 2025, compared to a 29% surge worldwide.

Recent federal actions, including the Senate's vote to revoke California's authority to set stricter emission standards and the House's move to eliminate key EV tax credits, have introduced uncertainty into the EV market. These policy changes have led some automakers, like General Motors, to reconsider their EV strategies, citing concerns over affordability and infrastructure readiness.

As of April 2025, the U.S. has over 204,900 public charging ports across more than 72,000 locations, supported by federal initiatives like the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. This expansion aims to alleviate range anxiety and support the growing number of EVs on the road.

There's something deeply transformative about the act of driving an EV, even for the most stubborn internal-combustion holdouts. You tap the accelerator, feel that immediate torque, and suddenly the noise complaints fade. Jellybeansean3648 offered another slice of real-life logic,

“I don’t have to pump gas in the winter.”

The brilliance of this dealer’s policy is how it avoids the traps that rental companies stumbled into. LEM1978 nailed it,

“Rental car companies foisting them on unsuspecting tourists was NOT a good idea... At least as a service loaner, the variables are minimized...”

Exactly. The dealership environment is controlled. It’s local. There’s no guesswork about where to charge, and no fear of running out of range in the middle of Death Valley in a Kia EV6.

One 30-Minute EV Loaner Drive: The Most Effective EV Marketing Strategy

You’re not some hapless traveler trying to decode a ChargePoint interface with a 9% battery and no Wi-Fi. You’re just getting your tires rotated and test-driving the future by accident.

What’s even more telling is how the experience reprograms expectations. Buckles01 confessed,

“I tell them it’s just a fun car to drive, and I didn’t think about the environment side... I got my Ioniq 6 because it really is fun to drive on top of being greener.”

Fun. It’s the great equalizer. Forget MPG, grams of CO₂, or social guilt.

The grin you get from an electric launch off the line beats any sales pitch. That’s something you can’t explain. You have to feel it.

Over 204,900 Public EV Charging Ports in the U.S., Infrastructure Strains Ahead

The U.S. has seen significant growth in its public EV charging network. As of January 2025, there were approximately 195,874 public charging ports across 69,679 stations nationwide. This marks a substantial increase from about 30,000 public chargers in 2016, reflecting efforts to support the rising number of EVs on the road.

Despite the expansion, the U.S. electric grid faces challenges in meeting the increasing demand for EV charging. A 2025 report indicates that 90% of charging network operators anticipate that grid capacity limitations could hinder their growth in the coming year. This underscores the need for infrastructure upgrades to support the electrification of transportation.

To enhance accessibility, businesses are incorporating EV charging stations into their operations. For instance, Waffle House plans to install fast-charging stations at select locations in partnership with BP Pulse. Each participating restaurant will feature six 400kW DC fast chargers, catering to both CCS and Tesla's NACS connectors, thereby providing convenient charging options for EV drivers.

And from a dealership's standpoint, this whole idea is just good business. As Herdnerfer put it:

“Makes total sense as a loaner vehicle, no gas to worry about, can be fully charged and ready to go when it’s needed, and maintenance is almost non-existent.”

No oil changes, no filters, no combustion complications. Just charge it, clean it, and hand over the fob.

Meanwhile, you’re exposing your customer base to a product they might’ve spent years badmouthing.

The trick is, they don’t even realize they’re being sold. And that might be the most elegant form of marketing ever devised, especially compared to the thousands of unsold EVs gathering dust on lots across the country because no one will offer a simple test drive. As thatboatguy observed,

“They had >20 on the lot unsold at the time.”

Unreal.

So here’s the quiet revolution happening in places like western Pennsylvania, EVs aren’t taking over because someone built a better battery. They’re taking over because someone built a better loaner policy. In a world of shouting matches, misinformation, and tribal loyalty to V8s, hybrids, or nothing at all, this dealership found the one thing that cuts through all the noise, experience. Because it turns out, the best way to win the EV war isn’t with facts, it’s with a key fob and a 30-minute drive through your own neighborhood.

Has your local dealership offered you an EV loaner while your car was in service?

According to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, this announcement represents the initial phase of a strategy aimed at tackling PFAS contamination throughout the Trump Administration. Despite the announcement’s emphasis on enforcement, significant questions remain regarding the EPA’s commitment to existing core PFAS regulation.

EPA Announcement in Context

During the Biden administration, EPA launched several significant initiatives to combat PFAS contamination, recognizing the chemicals’ persistence in the environment and harmful health effects. Key efforts included the 2021 “PFAS Roadmap,” which outlined a strategy for research, regulation, and cleanup, as well as the implementation of new reporting requirements under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) in 2024.[1] These rules mandated that companies disclose details about PFAS manufacturing, use, and disposal dating back to 2011. Additional actions under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) expanded annual PFAS reporting requirements to include lower concentration thresholds, while a separate rule designated two PFAS chemicals as hazardous under CERCLA, prioritizing them for cleanup and enforcement.[2]

Although the tone of EPA’s most recent announcement suggests the new administration will build upon these initiatives, it notably omits a commitment to maintaining or defending several of the core regulations previously adopted. Nevertheless, the announcement did outline a new set of actions that sheds light on EPA’s evolving strategy for addressing PFAS.

Key Actions

The EPA announcement outlined a multi-pronged strategy to strengthen scientific understanding, fulfill statutory obligations, and build partnerships to address PFAS contamination. Below are some of the key actions:

Strengthening the Science: To enhance scientific coordination, the agency will appoint a dedicated PFAS lead, implement a testing strategy under TSCA, expand data collection on air emissions, and begin annually updating its PFAS Destruction and Disposal Guidance. EPA also plans to accelerate method development to close key measurement and data gaps.

Fulfilling Statutory Obligations and Enhancing Communication: To meet statutory mandates and improve communication, the EPA will propose new effluent limitations for PFAS manufacturers and metal finishers, explore enhanced enforcement through RCRA, and continue implementing the Safe Drinking Water Act and TSCA to prevent further contamination. The agency also announced a commitment to updating the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) and addressing compliance issues, while working with Congress and industry to create a liability framework that protects passive receivers.

Building Partnerships: Finally, the EPA emphasized collaboration with states and tribes to support cleanup, risk assessment, and enforcement, and pledged to finalize its biosolids risk assessment based on public input.

Takeaways and Looking Forward

EPA’s announcement suggests that the Trump administration is advancing actions that align with the general goals established during the Biden administration, and will not be rolling back federal restrictions on PFAS entirely. In announcing this plan, EPA Administrator Zeldin stated that this would be “the first, not the last” Trump administration decision regarding PFAS.

Consistent with this statement, on May 13, 2025, EPA published an interim rule extending the deadline for PFAS reporting requirements under TSCA Section 8(a)(7) and announced that it would be reviewing the regulation in light of Executive Order 14219.[3] In addition, on May 14, 2025, EPA announced that it would rescind drinking water regulations that limit certain PFAS in drinking water, and will extend the compliance period for others. EPA has not announced any action with respect to PFAS listed as hazardous substances subject to federal remediation requirements, but has stepped back from its defense of those regulations against industry challenges.[4]

Entities likely to be affected by PFAS regulation, or that are currently subject to reporting requirements or use restrictions, should closely monitor federal as well as state actions and decisions related to PFAS.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed by House Republicans early Thursday would gut clean energy tax credits that Democrats approved three years ago while supporting increased mining, drilling and other traditional energy production.

A marathon session that began Wednesday resulted in 1,100-plus page legislation that curbs billions of dollars in spending across food assistance, student loans, Medicaid and action to address climate change.

The bill, which now heads to the Senate, repeals or phases out more quickly clean energy tax credits passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act during former President Joe Biden’s term. Biden’s climate law has been considered monumental for the clean energy transition, but the House bill effectively renders moot much of the law’s incentives for renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Clean energy advocates said the bill walks back the largest government investment in clean energy in history.

“In a bid to cut taxes for billionaires and provide a grab bag of goodies to Big Oil, the majority in the House took a sledgehammer to clean energy tax credits and to the protection of our public lands,” said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“These credits are delivering billions of dollars in new investments in homegrown American energy — creating jobs, lowering energy costs and addressing the climate crisis that is fueling floods, fires and heat waves,” Goldfuss said.

President Donald Trump celebrated the bill’s passage, calling it “arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country.” Trump appealed to the Senate to pass the measure as soon as possible and send it to his desk.

The Senate hopes to wrap up its version by early July. At least four Republican senators, led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have urged continuation of energy tax credits, including support for traditional and renewable energy sources. Republican-led states and Congressional districts have benefited from billions of dollars in clean energy manufacturing investments spurred by the Biden-era subsidies.

Full-scale repeal of current credits “could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,” the senators said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.

“A wholesale repeal, or the termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing … job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy,” the senators wrote in the April 9 letter. The letter was also signed by GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas.

In a win for House moderates and some Western lawmakers, the House bill strips language that would have allowed the sale of hundreds of thousands acres of public lands in Utah and Nevada. Opponents argued the sales would have opened the door for more oil and gas drilling.

What was gutted in the bill

The House bill takes an axe to tax credits for rooftop solar installments and eliminates electric vehicle tax credits after 2025, with a one-year exception for EVs manufactured by automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 cars that qualified for the credit.

Credits for solar and electric vehicles, which reduce harmful emissions, help to boost demand for the technologies and drive down their cost.

House Republicans also tightened tax credit restrictions for projects associated with foreign entities, including China — an added blow to domestic clean energy expansion since China dominates much of the supply chain.

The bill slashes a three-year phase-down schedule previously proposed, and instead cuts off projects that don’t start construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage. Those projects would also have to start operating before 2029.

“This bill threatens the clean energy industry at a time when it’s proving to be not only economically beneficial — lowering costs, creating jobs and fueling local economies — but also essential to America’s energy future,” said Andrew Reagan, president of Clean Energy for America, an industry group.

The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry, applauded the bill as a step to “restore American energy dominance.”

“By preserving competitive tax policies, opening lease sales” for oil and gas drilling and advancing permitting reforms, the legislation “is a win for our nation’s energy future,” API President Mike Sommers said in a statement.

No sale of public lands

At the behest of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke and some other Republicans, lawmakers stripped a provision that would have sold or transferred about 460,000 acres of federal land in Nevada and Utah to local governments or private entities.

The proposal exposed sharp divisions between Western Republicans who say the federal government controls too much of their states and others such as Zinke, a former Interior secretary in Trump’s first term whose state is protective of access to lands for hunting and recreation.

“At the heart of the matter is that public land that’s in the federal estate belongs to everybody,” Zinke told The Associated Press Thursday. “To suggest that you’re going to sell land to pay off the debt, I think that’s misguided and, quite frankly, disingenuous.”

The land sales had been inserted in the bill following a late-night committee vote, despite earlier pledges from Republican leaders that the sales were off the table.

Supporters said they would generate revenue and ease growth pressures by creating room for more and cheaper housing in booming Western cities such as Las Vegas, Reno, Nevada, and St. George, Utah. Those communities are hemmed in by federal property, which makes up 80% of the land in Nevada and 63% in Utah.

A spokesperson for Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, who sponsored the bid to sell federal lands in his state, said his office was “exploring all options” to make the transfers happen.

Housing advocates had cautioned federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing, and some of the parcels to be sold were far from developed areas.

Tracy Stone-Manning, president of the Wilderness Society and a former director of the Bureau of Land Management under Biden, said she appreciated Zinke’s work to prevent the public lands sale.

But she said the bill was still a “big giveaway” to the private sector. “By opening hundreds of millions of acres to drilling, mining and logging to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, this bill harms the tens of millions of people who like to hike, recreate or find solace in the outdoors,” she said.

Trump targets Biden’s climate policy

At the same time the bill slashes support for clean energy, it paves the way for oil, gas and coal.

Through the bill, natural gas pipeline developers can pay a $10 million fee for expedited permitting, and applicants for a potential liquefied natural gas export site can pay a $1 million fee to be deemed in the “public interest,” circumventing what is usually a regulatory challenge.

Construction is scheduled to begin in autumn 2026, with the facility expected to become operational by late 2028. The project will also bring 23 full-time jobs to the region.

Primarily fuelled by natural gas, the plant will also maintain ultra-low sulfur diesel as a backup energy source. To minimise impact on the surrounding community, EKPC plans to install sound-dampening enclosures and implement vegetation buffers for visual screening.

But as the state approaches big deadlines for heat pump installation and bolstering its clean energy workforce, uncertainties lie ahead.

The sputtered drone of a vacuum pump filled the former milking barn that now houses Kennebec Valley Community College’s heat pump lab. Instructor Dave Whittemore, who held the yellow vacuum in one hand and displayed an app tracking atmospheric pressure on his phone in the other, explained in a raised voice how to do an “evacuation,” ridding the heat pump of air and moisture to avoid malfunctions down the road.

“The longevity of the equipment is important,” said Whittemore, who teaches students how to install the increasingly popular electric heating and cooling units. “If it’s not done right, then it’s going to fail prematurely. And that’s the biggest reason that I personally try to keep up with industry best standards and I pass that on to my students.”

Six years ago, Gov. Janet Mills traveled to the college to sign a bill aimed at transforming Maine’s market for heat pumps, an environmentally friendly alternative to oil furnaces and gas boilers, and set a goal of installing 100,000 units by 2025.

The state, now a national leader for heat pump adoption, met that goal two years ahead of schedule, and Mills once again traveled to the rural Somerset County campus to announce a new target: another 175,000 heat pumps by 2027.

Maine needs skilled workers to reach this goal, demanding training initiatives from all corners of the state to build HVAC, refrigerant and electrical knowledge in the clean energy workforce. Without a strong pipeline, the state risks delays in reaching its heat pump target, putting its climate goals at risk.

So far, rural counties have seen some of the fastest rates of clean energy worker growth, according to state data. In Somerset County, where KVCC is located, the number of clean energy workers has grown by 44% since 2020.

As part of this push, the community college launched a high-tech heat pump training lab in 2021 and has trained over 300 students. The initiative is one of many clean energy programs the school offers as part of a broader, state-supported effort to meet Maine’s goal of reaching 30,000 clean energy jobs by 2030.

Efficiency Maine, a quasi-governmental agency that oversees the state’s energy efficiency programs, has invested more than $400,000 in installation and weatherization training programs at KVCC and supports 29 similar programs at other institutions each year.

Another key piece of state support comes through the Governor’s Energy Office’s Clean Energy Partnership, which has awarded nearly $5 million in grants for clean energy training and apprenticeship programs across the state since 2022 and has seen over 3,500 participants. Businesses have also developed their own on-the-job training programs to help meet demand.

But the state still faces a daunting challenge: It must employ more than 14,000 new workers to reach its goal of 30,000 clean energy jobs by the end of the decade. Between 2019 and 2023, the number of workers in the field grew by less than a thousand.

While the state says it remains dedicated to this goal, some in the industry worry federal funding cuts and tariffs could create challenges for the workforce development pipeline.

Efforts underway in many corners of Maine

Heat pumps have emerged as a pillar of Maine’s clean energy strategy: The units can reduce carbon dioxide emissions between 38% and 53% compared to a gas furnace, according to a 2022 study in the academic journal Energy Policy, and have been touted as a way to reduce energy costs.

Rural areas have historically spent more on energy bills and participated less in residential energy and efficiency financing and rebate programs to lower costs, according to a state report from 2023. To help rural Mainers overcome geographic barriers in accessing cost-lowering energy initiatives, the state must bolster its rural workforce, according to a 2018 study the Island Institute produced in partnership with the Governor’s Energy Office.

The demand for cleaner energy has grown not only in response to the state’s climate goals, but also as Maine’s electricity costs rise. A Maine Monitor analysis showed that electricity costs increased at the third-highest rate in the U.S. between 2014 and 2024.

A Maine Monitor analysis of 2023 U.S. Department of Energy and Bureau of Labor Statistics data prepared for E2 shows that two-thirds of the state’s clean energy jobs were in the energy efficiency sector, while about a fifth of jobs were in renewables.

Workforce development has become a priority for the state as the clean energy industry grows, said Tagwongo Obomsawin, the program manager for the state’s Clean Energy Partnership, noting that it can provide good paying jobs for Mainers and reduce energy costs.

“Employers are definitely a really important part of the picture, but we don’t want to leave out anyone,” Obomsawin said. “We recognize that training providers, academia, state government, organized labor and industry all have a role to play in making sure that we have a robust system that supports people in finding job opportunities, getting access to training and localizing the benefits of the energy transition.”

Heat pump training is just one of several clean energy programs offered through the Maine Community College System, which includes KVCC. The system works with industry and state leaders to grow the workforce. The network of schools also trains students in electric vehicle maintenance, fiber optics, aquaculture and more.

Dan Belyea, the system’s chief workforce development officer, said short-term training and scholarship funding are centered on needs that arise in the industry, which the schools gauge by looking at labor market data and talking to employers. Programs that are highest in demand tend to include electrical and heat pump training, Belyea said.

In 2022, KVCC hoped to use a nearly $250,000 grant from the Clean Energy Partnership to offer programs on electric vehicles and NABCEP solar photovoltaic installation. But trouble finding instructors and low interest among students made it difficult to launch.

Instead, KVCC doubled down on energy efficiency. It launched a building science program with the funding last fall, which had five students, two of whom were able to complete the certification.

Other clean energy workforce initiatives have popped up across the state. Some employers run their own heat pump or solar installation training labs, and several adult education programs and nonprofits also offer classes designed to help people move into the industry.

PassivHaus, a Freeport-based organization, received $180,000 in Clean Energy Partnership money in 2022 to host training programs on the state’s energy code. The company ran 29 trainings across the state, from Portland to Presque Isle.

Naomi Beal, executive director of PassivHaus, noted that getting enough students to attend the training was easier in areas like Portland, but trickier in more rural areas.

“I always feel like it’s very important to consider when going into Greenfield or Machiasport or wherever that there are just not that many people.… So if we get five people showing up, that’s probably statistically way more interest than (a larger number of attendees) down in Portland,” Beal said. “We just try to be patient and persistent with the smaller towns and the smaller attendance.”

A need for more collaboration

In Freeport, Scott Libby, the owner of Royal River Heat Pumps, walked through his training center as he explained that all his workers go through heat pump training that starts with the basics, regardless of experience, to ensure each worker is equipped to handle the job.

“A lot of these heat pumps have 12-year warranties,” Libby said. “That’s 4,380 days. The most important day is Day 1. It needs to be installed properly.”

Libby, who has worked with the U.S. Department of Energy on workforce development and sits on a new energy efficiency workforce subcommittee being developed by the Governor’s Energy Office, said he’s aware of a number of different workforce development initiatives but that it’s difficult to comprehend how they all work together.

He said some forms of programming aren’t sufficient for what’s actually needed in the field: Students who sit through a six-week or six-month program that teaches the basics of how heat pumps work may come out with little to no hands-on experience with a power tool or climbing a ladder.

Libby emphasized the need for more collaboration between different workforce development efforts and a more systematic approach, with quality checks in place. He suggested putting more thought into designing industrial arts and home economics programs in middle and high schools to introduce students to different career pathways early on.

He also said more stringent licensing requirements could help with the quality of workers moving into the field. As it stands, there is no specific licensing required to install heat pumps in Maine, though workers need an Environmental Protection Agency Section 608 license to deal with the refrigerant used inside the unit and an electrical license to complete the wiring.

He acknowledged that new regulation could “cripple” workforce development efforts but said the move is imperative to control the level of training workers receive and make sure everyone is qualified to install heat pumps. There are hundreds of contractors listed as qualified heat pump installers on Efficiency Maine’s website, a list he said in his opinion should be much shorter.

Uncertainties lie ahead

At KVCC’s heat pump lab, Whittemore gestured at eight heat pumps mounted on prop walls used for training, listing the types of new units he hopes to get soon – ideally through donations from companies who have given units in the past.

Regulatory changes to refrigerants that went into effect this year mean the school needs to replace the heat pumps it uses to train students.

“Most of the procedures with the new refrigerants are the same, it’s just that we can’t put this new refrigerant in these existing heat pumps,” he said. “So I’ve got to get eight new heat pumps.”

The broader challenge he sees for the industry is tariffs, which he fears could lead to higher equipment prices and lower demand. This, in turn, could mean a lower need for workers.

“I think that’s going to slow this down,” he said.

Maine has two years to reach its goal of installing 275,000 heat pumps and five years to reach its goal of 30,000 clean energy jobs. But uncertainties in building Maine’s workforce lie ahead.

The Clean Energy Partnership Project, which has funded many of the state’s clean energy workforce development programs, typically announces new grants in the summer, but the Governor’s Energy Office stopped short of committing to another round of funding this year.

“We can’t predict the future, but the existing programs that we have will continue on for at least another couple of years,” Obomsawin said.

She said a partnership the Energy Office has with the Department of Labor to provide career navigation services will continue into 2026, as will workforce development programs that received funding and are already operational. But she cautioned that it is still too early to know what impact policy changes at the federal level will have on the clean energy sector.

Efficiency Maine said that the state is still on track to achieve its heat pump goals – at least for now. Executive Director Michael Stoddard said that the heat pump rebate program has funding from the Electric Utility Conservation Program and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative for at least the next three years.

However, some smaller initiatives, such as a revolving loan to help Mainers buy new heat pump systems, face uncertainty as the federal grants funding the project are in flux.

Libby, of Royal River Heat Pumps, has 40 years of HVAC industry experience and said funding uncertainty will make it a challenge to reach the state’s heat pump goal.

“I think it’s definitely going to be harder,” Libby said. “I mean, I’m not ready to give up on it yet. I don’t think anybody is ready to give up on it.”

Commercial and small business customers in New York City will see summer power bills rise by about 10% and 8%, respectively, Consolidated Edison warned Wednesday. Residential customers will see smaller increases, the utility said.

The price increases are part of a national trend amid rising demand. “Retail electricity prices have increased faster than the rate of inflation since 2022, and we expect them to continue increasing through 2026,” the U.S. Energy Information Administration said May 14.

Utilities are making large investments to meet growing demand for electricity. ConEdison has spent about $2.35 billion on its distribution system since last summer, the utility said, including new substation equipment, underground cables and transformers.

Dive Insight:

U.S. energy prices rapidly increased from 2020 to 2022 as a result of the global pandemic and supply chain interruptions tied to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Fuel prices have declined in recent years, but electricity price increases have continued unabated, EIA said.

“We expect the nominal U.S. average electricity price to increase by 13% from 2022 to 2025,” EIA said. “Parts of the country with relatively high electricity prices may experience greater price increases than those with relatively low electricity prices.”

The Pacific Coast has seen retail electricity prices rise 26% since 2022, the federal government’s energy data arm said. New England and mid-Atlantic prices have risen 19%.

Retail bills include the cost of generation, transmission and distribution, along with taxes and fees. ConEd has been investing billions in its distribution system, and also raised delivery charges in January under a rate plan the New York State Public Service Commission approved in 2023, the utility said.

A typical residential customer in New York City can expect average monthly bills to be 2.7% higher from June to September, relative to last summer ConEd said. In Westchester County, a residential customer can expect a 1.1% decrease compared with last summer.

An average commercial customer using 10,800 kWh/month and with a peak demand of 30 kW can expect a 9.8% increase to summer bills compared with last year, the utility said. A small business customer using 583 kWh kilowatt will see their bills go up about 8.1%.

ConEd said it has made infrastructure upgrades that include the installation of new substation equipment, 46 underground and 79 overhead transformers, 342 spans of underground and overhead feeder cables, 259 spans of open wire, and 113 poles.

“Our ongoing investments help ensure safe and reliable service, even as the days get hotter for longer and the demand for air conditioning and high temperatures can stress our equipment,” ConEd President Matthew Ketschke said in a statement.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/_fdMW9oDgJXamAHnvefVPV9HmiOMA0r7Yzr23KrWqFE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9OWUNfc2t5bGluZV9BdWdfMjMuanBn.webp,N,,2025-05-22 21:02:25.388056

Why are they so hypocritical, and why are they so nasty to clean energy?
Kill clean energy so they're the only ones.","Washington, D.C. – Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) today spoke at a press conference regarding actions taken by Republicans to gut clean energy provisions and investments in their tax bill. Below are Senator Schumer’s remarks, which can also be viewed here:

Leader Schumer: Now, let me just say this, it's no wonder the Republicans passed their bill in the dark of night, because they don't want anyone to know what's in it. And there are so many bad things in this bill, but they made it overnight, it went from terrible to even more terrible. And let me just say, what the House just passed last night makes it significantly easier for us to take back the Senate. And one of the main reasons for that is clean energy. If you look at where the credits are, these great credits that employ so many people, that create green energy, that help us compete with China in the field—oh, we have the chart. This is the chart that was from the front page of the New York Times, and the red dots are Republican districts and similar Republican states, and the blue dots are Democratic.

According to this New York Times chart, it's like $680 billion in red states and $187 billion in blue states. And last night, what they did is kill the program, plain and simple. It's sort of like Social Security. They didn't want to say they want to kill Social Security, so they strangled it. Bad phone lines, bad emails, fewer offices, fewer people. Same thing here. They didn't want to say they killed it, but then they said, if you don't have a project with shovel in the ground 60 days after this bill passes, the credits disappear. That is killing the program. Make no mistake about it. And then, of course, any project that's not finished, that's already going by 2028, also loses its credits. So they're preventing any programs from starting, any new clean energy investments from starting, and they're killing the ones that are already going. It's just an outrage. And here, we have the cheapest form, the administration is so damn hypocritical. They say they want to produce more energy. And at the same time, they cut off the cleanest, quickest, easiest, and cheapest form of new energy we could produce, which is solar. Plain and simple.

So they're a bunch of hypocrites, total hypocrites. We need more energy. But why are they doing this? Why are they so hypocritical, and why are they so nasty to clean energy? Because they're controlled by a small group of oil and gas barons who became billionaires by striking it rich in the Permian Basin or the Anadarko Basin, and those guys know that clean energy is the future, that oil and gas has limited future, and so they want to kill it. Kill clean energy so they're the only ones. This is going to hurt not just us. I wonder about my children and grandchildren who are going to pay so much more for energy.

And China, the third point, we want to make sure China doesn't dominate. This bill makes sure that China will dominate the world on clean energy and affect your grandchildren, your cousins and nephews and nieces, and my grandchildren. So it's a goddamn outrage what they have done here. And we're going to fight it tooth and nail.

We believe there are a whole lot of Republicans who are in these nice red states, who know the damage, the thousands and thousands of jobs that are lost, the higher cost of energy their constituents will pay. So we want the whole, we want everyone in the country, call up your senator, particularly if it's a Republican senator, and say save this. And one more point. We know that climate, that global warming is increasing. We know the climate crisis is getting greater and greater and greater. We see it in all of the weather changes. We have seen, New York State had 40 tornadoes, 30 years ago we had none. That's New York State, not in the tornado belt. And insurance costs are going through the roof in many of the coastal areas. You can't buy a home because you can't get insurance, you can't sell a home because the buyer can't get insurance. It's affecting us all over.

Lawmakers also voted to override the state’s emissions standards for diesel trucks, including heavy-duty and commercial vehicles.

How we got here

California has a special carve-out in the Clean Air Act, which allows the state to ask the Environmental Protection Agency for permission to create regulations that are stricter than the federal government’s. If the EPA approves, it will grant California a waiver.

No other state can do that, but any state can adopt California’s stricter standards.

Carmakers often build vehicles to align with California’s standards, which means they either meet or exceed the rules in every other state.

At the end of the Biden administration, the EPA gave California permission to require all new cars in the state to be zero emissions by 2035 and to set new emissions rules for diesel and commercial vehicles.

Why Republicans opposed California’s rules

Republicans opposed the rules because they said the transition would be costly, the country doesn’t have the infrastructure to support it, and they argued it was, in essence, the government telling people what cars they’re allowed to drive.

“For carmakers, the consequences are severe. If you don’t sell enough electric vehicles, California is saying to them and to the other states that signed onto this, even when Americans don’t want to buy them, too bad!” Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said. “These people will pay a fine of $20,000 per vehicle.”

Why Democrats supported the rules

Democrats support the rules and believe they will help move the entire world toward greener energy faster.

“They proved if you create the right incentives, the technology will move in the right direction, and it has successfully,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said.

Democrats also opposed how Republicans overturned California’s waivers.

What’s the Congressional Review Act?

The Congressional Review Act, or CRA, allows Congress to overturn a federal agency rule with a simple majority vote. If both houses of Congress and the president sign on, the rule cannot take effect.

Republicans contend these EPA waivers meet all the requirements of the CRA. However, the Senate Parliamentarian, the nonpartisan official in charge of ensuring the chamber follows its own rules, said the California waivers do not fall within the CRA. That decision was based on a Government Accountability Office analysis.

So Republicans used what’s called the nuclear option to change Senate rules and vote on the waiver despite the parliamentarian.

“It is an improper use of the so-called nuclear option, which essentially avoids the cloture provisions of our rules,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said.

Cloture is the process of ending debate or overcoming the filibuster. So when Democrats say Republicans are avoiding cloture, they’re in essence saying they are going around the filibuster. That’s an accusation Republicans deny.

“I think at this point it should be abundantly clear that what we’re doing has nothing to do with the legislative filibuster,” Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said. “But while I’d love to think that reality would prevail, I fully expect Democrats to continue to misrepresent the situation.”

Thune is contradicting himself.

In January, Majority Leader Thune was asked during an interview with Punchbowl News whether he’d advise his party against overriding the parliamentarian. He answered, “That’s totally akin to killing the filibuster. We can’t go there.”

Republicans contend the Government Accountability Office was out of line by ruling the EPA waiver was not subject to Congress’ Congressional Review Act authority.

“If we don’t do that, that is a major shift in power to the administration that will be abused by Republican and Democrat administrations alike. That is a transition of power to the article one branch that we’re not going to allow to happen,” Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C.

Democrats warned Republicans that they are changing Senate precedent in a way that likely cannot be undone.

“What goes around comes around. If Republicans are willing to overrule the parliamentarian and hijack the CRA in a way that has never been used before, they will not like it the next time they are in the minority,” Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said.

Both chambers of Congress have voted to overturn California’s EPA waivers. The last step in the process is President Trump’s signature.

[Ray Bogan]

The Senate voted to override California’s 2035 electric vehicle mandate, in addition to other emissions standards, using their Congressional Review Act Authority. The resolution was already approved by the House of Representatives and now heads to President Trump for a final signature.

California has a special carve out in the Clean Air Act which allows the state to ask the Environmental Protection Agency for permission to create regulations that are stricter than the federal government’s.

No other state can do that, but any state can adopt California’s stricter standards.

Carmakers often build vehicles to align with California’s standards. This way they either meet or exceed the rules in every other state.

Republicans in Congress oppose California’s regulations that require all new cars to be zero emissions by 2035 and require commercial diesel trucks to reduce their emissions. They used their majority in congress to pass resolutions formally disapproving of the EPA’s decision to grant California a waiver.

Republicans said the transition would be costly, that the country doesn’t have the infrastructure to support it, and they argued it was in essence the government telling people what cars they’re allowed to drive.

The House has already passed an identical measure, meaning the Senate vote sends the resolution to President Donald Trump’s desk.
The CRA allows for a simple majority in the Senate to vote to repeal recent executive branch rules, bypassing the chamber’s usual 60-vote threshold for legislation.
The Senate parliamentarian and the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office said the waiver could not be repealed with a CRA resolution, but Senate Republicans opted to use the procedure anyway.
“Senate Republicans exposed themselves as fair weather institutionalists.","The U.S. Senate voted early Thursday to prevent California from enforcing regulations on tailpipe emission from new cars and trucks, upending state regulations for the nearly 40% of Americans whose states follow California standards.

The House has already passed an identical measure, meaning the Senate vote sends the resolution to President Donald Trump’s desk.

The 51-46 vote, with Michigan Democrat Elissa Slotkin joining all Republicans present to vote in favor, cleared a Congressional Review Act resolution repealing Environmental Protection Agency waivers that allow California to set regulations for emissions from cars and light-duty trucks.

The state policy includes a ramp-up to having no new gas-powered cars sold in the state by 2035.

Democrats blasted the near-party-line vote for contradicting the Senate parliamentarian, who’d ruled the waiver that the EPA had granted to California to set its own tailpipe standards was not a regulation that could be rolled back under the Congressional Review Act, or CRA.

The CRA allows for a simple majority in the Senate to vote to repeal recent executive branch rules, bypassing the chamber’s usual 60-vote threshold for legislation.

‘Chaos and uncertainty’ around the U.S.

The EPA under President Joe Biden issued waivers under a Clean Air Act provision that allows California, which had more stringent standards than what Congress enacted in the 1970 law, to set its own standards for air pollution.

No other state is allowed to set independent standards, but any state may adopt California’s.

For the light-duty vehicle emissions rule, 17 other states — Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington — and the District of Columbia adopted some portion of the standard.

The action by the Senate, particularly because of the mechanism for revoking the waiver, made the future of the standards in all those states uncertain, Justin Balik, vice president for states at the national environmental advocacy group Evergreen Action, said in a Thursday interview.

“What, fundamentally, they're doing is sowing a huge amount of chaos and uncertainty in states around the country, not just in California,” he said of the senators.

Slotkin, who voted against procedural measures before her vote in favor of the resolution itself, said her vote was in defense of her state’s automotive industry. Slotkin campaigned on a promise not to allow an electric vehicle mandate.

“Today, I voted to prevent California and the states that follow its standard from effectively banning gas-powered cars by 2035,” she wrote in a statement. “I have a special responsibility to stand up for the more than one million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry.”

Debate over choice

Critics said the state regulation was effectively an electric vehicle mandate that robbed consumers of the option to purchase the vehicle of their choice.

Because of California’s market share — the state accounts for 11% of cars and trucks sold in the country, according to the California Air Resources Board — and adoption by other states, the Golden State standard had a virtually nationwide effect, they argued.

Republicans in the Senate focused on the 2035 deadline to end sales of new gas-powered vehicles, describing it as an electric vehicle mandate.

In a video posted to social media, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican, John Barrasso of Wyoming, stood next to Shelley Moore Capito, the West Virginia Republican chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and touted the vote as a victory for consumer choice.

“Republicans have defeated Democrats’ delusional dream of forcing every American to drive an electric vehicle,” Barrasso said. “They wanted to force-feed the entire country things that don’t necessarily work, not practical.”

But proponents of the California standards said the Senate was removing choice from state policymakers, despite Republicans’ longtime advocacy for state and local control.

Manish Bapna, the president of the advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council, blasted the move in a statement that said senators undermined state power.

“This vote is an unprecedented and reckless attack on states’ legal authority to address the pollution causing asthma, lung disease and heart conditions,” Bapna said. “After a multi-million dollar lobbying campaign from Big Oil, Republicans readily jettisoned their long-held view that states can best enact measures that reflect the values and interests of their residents.

“If other states don’t like California’s approach, they don’t need to follow it,” the statement continued. “But federal lawmakers shouldn’t be intervening to block states from providing cleaner air and a healthier environment.”

Procedural fight

Republicans’ use of the Congressional Review Act provoked a backlash from Democrats and environmental allies, who described it as “going nuclear” to tank the chamber’s filibuster rule.

The Senate parliamentarian and the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office said the waiver could not be repealed with a CRA resolution, but Senate Republicans opted to use the procedure anyway.

“Senate Republicans exposed themselves as fair weather institutionalists. By overriding the parliamentarian — which the chair explicitly noted that the parliamentarian has been overridden — and in order to do the bidding of the fossil fuel industry, Republicans have eroded away at the Senate foundation and undermined this institution they claim to care about,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said after a procedural vote late Wednesday.

Republicans defended the move, saying they were responding to an unprecedented case in the chamber. The question of how Senate rules applied to the waiver should be decided by senators themselves, Majority Leader John Thune said.

“I believe that when the Senate is facing a novel situation like this one, with disagreement among its members, it is appropriate for the Senate to speak as a body to the question – something the Senate does when questions over application of the rules arise,” he said in a floor speech.

Thune, of South Dakota, noted that the Senate resolved a rules question with a floor vote just last year after a Democrat raised a point of order against a Republican’s attempt to fast-track a measure.

“Nobody at the time cried nuclear, nobody said the Democrat member was blowing up the Senate – in fact, most members probably don’t even remember the situation, because it was just the Senate doing what the Senate is supposed to do, and that’s voting on how to apply the rules when faced with a new situation.”

Uncertainty abounds

Critics of the move attacked the process, the policy and the precedent, saying the Senate undid a half-century of a California-federal government relationship regarding the Clean Air Act that had served all parties well.

John Boesel, the president and CEO of clean transportation industry group CALSTART, called the Senate action radical.

“This vote upends decades of policy that has successfully resulted in cleaner air and the growth of a robust clean transportation industry,” he said in a statement. “It is a brazen, yet futile, attempt to bring the clean transportation industry to a sudden halt. CALSTART will continue to partner with the states working to fill this gaping void left by today's federal action.”

And the unusual use of the Congressional Review Act will likely lead to lawsuits from California and at least some of the states that follow it to “protect their authority,” Balik, of Evergreen Action, said.

“But that's going to take some time to play out,” he said. “In the meantime, the whole marketplace has been plunged into unnecessary chaos. Part of what the industry always says is, ‘We need certainty.’ And if anything, right now, we have the exact opposite thanks to what Congress is doing.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/2025-05/californiahighway.jpg?h=eb567e48&itok=DAM2NY4e,N,,2025-05-22 19:11:50.782923

The Daytona is produced in the Stellantis Windsor Assembly Plant. The company told the Star that its decision will have no impact on jobs at the Windsor facility.

Stellantis added that other variants of the vehicle including the pricier, better-equipped Daytona Scat Pack and the internal combustion engine version are still on track.

“The Charger’s flexible, multi-energy STLA Large platform allows us to focus on the Charger Daytona Scat Pack’s performance as the world’s quickest and most powerful muscle car, add the new four-door model to the Charger mix for the 2026 model year and lean into the new Charger Sixpack models that will launch in the second half of the year,” said McAlear.

The announcement came shortly after Dodge removed the R/T trim from the 2026 model lineup over growing concerns about U.S. tariffs.

While McAlear suggested the trade war was a driving force behind putting the brakes on the Charger Daytona R/T, sales of the vehicle have also been slow.

“It’s part of the readjustment toward the transition to EVs,” Sam Fiorani with AutoForecast Solutions told the Star. “Initial products from the Charger were all electric, and the market is just not there to accept these models yet in that volume. So, they’re going to concentrate on the gas-powered vehicles and push the high-powered, very well-performing electric vehicle as the extreme top-of-the-line models.”

It has been reported that only 1,947 electric Charger R/T and Scat Packs combined were sold in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2025.

“I drove by a dealership in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and I was surprised at how many Chargers were sitting right out front,” said Fiorani.

“I must have seen eight or 10 of them across the front of the dealership. I’ve only seen one on the road, in Montreal a few months ago.”

He said “tariffs could be part of” the reasons for pulling the car from the lineup, but there’s likely more to it than that.

“A lot of manufacturers are going to use the tariff as a rationale for other changes they make to production and to line up changes,” said Fiorani. “This harks back to the semiconductor issues we had a few years ago. Whether or not it’s the core of the problem, they’re going to use that as an excuse to make what would be more dramatic shifts in their product lineup.”

He said that regardless of tariffs, these aren’t the kind of vehicles that would likely produce extremely large sales volumes.

“These vehicles are very high-performing and equate to the rarefied models that they sold with the Hemi years ago,” said Fiorani. “These aren’t going to be the high-volume vehicles for the brand, anyway. Shifting towards the mass-market gas-powered vehicles is the way that they have to go.”

Next-generation geothermal technologies need more lead time to commercialize, and the ITC provides much-needed financial runway for geothermal companies.
The ITC spurs innovation by reducing risk and unlocks private finance, which drives the development of next-generation geothermal technologies.
These projects will not only prove out next-generation geothermal technologies but will also support the gathering of critical subsurface data.","This blog is part of a series that explores the federal policies and actions needed to deploy next-generation geothermal, sources of nuclear energy (both fission and fusion), and carbon capture and storage – technologies the Trump administration indicated as priorities on Earth Day. The policy brief highlighting these technologies can be found here.

The U.S. is a leader in geothermal energy innovation and is well-positioned to lead the emerging next-generation geothermal market because of its vast domestic resources, top-tier energy companies, and globally recognized research and development expertise from U.S. universities and national labs.

But despite bipartisan support for next-generation geothermal – including support in the Trump administration’s statement on Earth Day – Congress has made the future of this innovative energy source uncertain. Recently passed legislation in the House would pull critical support for geothermal projects, functionally excluding any projects that aren’t already well underway given the years they take to plan and construct.

Next-generation geothermal can drive American energy abundance and support energy security, all while adding clean, firm power to the grid with adequate support across the value chain. Federal investment in research, development, demonstration, and deployment, along with sustained support for federal offices like the Department of Energy’s Geothermal Technologies Office (DOE GTO) and Loan Programs Office (DOE LPO) will help advance American leadership and innovation in next-generation geothermal technologies.

Next-generation geothermal energy can increase domestic energy production and provide 24/7, clean firm baseload power.

Next-generation geothermal is an emerging renewable energy source that builds on innovations from the oil and gas sector, and it holds immense potential for supporting domestic energy production at a time of growing energy demand. The IEA estimates that geothermal could rise from meeting less than 1% of global energy demand right now to meeting 8% of global energy demand by 2050. And CATF’s mapping finds that superhot rock geothermal, which is the hottest, highest-energy-density form of next-generation geothermal, could produce 4.3 terawatts of clean firm power in the U.S. alone – 8 times the United States’s 2021 electricity consumption. Research from CATF also indicates that, at high enough temperatures, next-generation geothermal can be cost-competitive in unsubsidized energy markets.

The U.S. is a cutting-edge innovator and leader in next-generation geothermal because of the overlap between American shale gas extraction techniques and those used to harvest deep geothermal heat, but to maintain its position as a global leader and achieve its potential for abundant domestic energy production, sustained federal investment is critical.

Technology-neutral tax credits and continued federal investment in research, development, demonstration, and deployment for next-generation geothermal are essential for U.S. leadership.

Congress must preserve the technology-neutral investment tax credit (ITC), including its timing and transferability provisions. Next-generation geothermal technologies need more lead time to commercialize, and the ITC provides much-needed financial runway for geothermal companies. The ITC currently runs through 2032 at the earliest, and it allows projects to receive the tax credit based on the date they commenced construction (rather than the date they were placed in service). These factors give developers certainty that their long-lead-time geothermal projects will be eligible for the tax credit. The transferability provision is also a critical component to the ITC, ensuring startups without significant tax liability can still benefit from the credit. Shortening the timeline and removing transferability would make the ITC essentially meaningless for geothermal, affecting only a few projects. The ITC spurs innovation by reducing risk and unlocks private finance, which drives the development of next-generation geothermal technologies. Without it, leading U.S. geothermal companies risk shutting down or never launching, undermining innovation, competitiveness, and the growth of the sector.

Congress must support research and development for superhot rock geothermal. The federal government plays an important role, particularly in the research and development stages of the value chain. Superhot rock geothermal has the potential to unlock lower-cost electricity and be deployed nearly anywhere on Earth, but it needs federal support to reach commercial scale. The 118th Congress introduced a bill that would promote targeted public and private research, break down silos, and leverage vast subsurface expertise that already exists in the U.S. to advance superhot rock geothermal energy.

Congress must support demonstrations to de-risk development of innovative projects. By providing financial support for geothermal demonstrations in different regions of the country, the U.S. can de-risk first-of-a-kind projects. These projects will not only prove out next-generation geothermal technologies but will also support the gathering of critical subsurface data. By ensuring that data is shared across the industry, Congress can accelerate the timeline for sector-wide geothermal deployment.

Congress must fund subsurface mapping. Lack of knowledge of subsurface characteristics is one of the biggest hurdles to geothermal project deployment in new areas. The U.S. should fund subsurface mapping around the country, ensuring that geothermal energy can be fully developed across the U.S.

The administration must adequately staff the offices and national labs undertaking this important work. Multiple government agencies and national labs serve critical functions for supporting next-generation geothermal. Appropriate staffing levels at these organizations are crucial to ensure that geothermal research and project deployment progress:

The Geothermal Technologies Office funds cutting-edge research and development programs and supports sector-wide coordination and information-sharing.

National laboratories have specialized scientific expertise and facilities to solve technical challenges in geothermal exploration, drilling, and energy production.

The Loan Programs Office could provide critical financing for first-of-a-kind geothermal projects that are too risky for traditional lenders but essential for industry advancement.

The United States Geological Survey conducts resource assessments and provides the foundational geoscience data that helps identify the most promising locations for geothermal projects.

Michigan's Still Falling Short. - Next City,Nina Ignaczak,,,,,https://nextcity.org/urbanist-news/new-landfill-reform-rules-cut-methane-michigans,"The South Kent Landfill — just outside Grand Rapids — is now about 95% full.
Sniffer Robotics, an Ann Arbor-based company, developed the only EPA-approved drone for landfill methane detection.
“Once enough landfill gas is generated, it will follow the path of least resistance to escape,” he says.
“We’re the sixth-largest producer of landfill methane emissions, even though we’re only the 10th or 11th most populous state,” says Mike Garfield, executive director of the Ecology Center.
The economics of food waste disposal Food waste is the largest single component of Michigan’s municipal waste stream by weight.","Darwin Baas surveys Kent County’s landfill from the cab of a county truck, watching the steady arrival of waste-hauling vehicles dumping drywall, sofas, home clean-outs, and bagged leftovers tumbling out by the ton. An average of 800 of these trucks arrive every day. The South Kent Landfill — just outside Grand Rapids — is now about 95% full.

“Everything up here is going to try to kill you,” he tells visitors, gesturing toward the trash compactors and bulldozers weaving between soft spots of shifting debris. But it’s not just the machinery that makes this place dangerous — it’s the system itself, designed to make waste disappear with maximum convenience and minimum cost.

Baas, director of Kent County’s Department of Public Works, has spent the last 11 years trying to bend that system in a new direction. Under his leadership, Kent County has voluntarily captured methane from its landfill, continued to operate Michigan’s only municipal waste-to-energy incinerator, and proposed an ambitious Sustainable Business Park to divert food and yard waste, recover recyclables, and incubate circular economy businesses.

But most of the county’s 600,000 tons of annual municipal solid waste still ends up here.

Kent County is among a minority of counties in Michigan managing waste through a publicly operated system. The vast majority of landfills statewide — 49 of 60 — are privately owned and profit-driven, further reinforcing the incentive to bury. Baas sees this as a structural barrier to meaningful change.

“We need public-private partnerships,” he says. “The investments that need to be made are long-term — that’s not something the private sector is going to do on its own.”

The challenge Baas faces isn’t just operational — it’s systemic. As Michigan works to meet its climate goals, one of the most potent sources of greenhouse gas emissions is hiding in plain sight: landfills.

When food, yard waste, and other organic materials are buried, they decompose without oxygen and produce methane — a greenhouse gas that traps more than 80 times as much heat as carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. Though less visible than smokestacks or tailpipes, landfills are among the state’s largest sources of methane emissions, trailing only the fossil fuel sector.

Michigan recently overhauled its solid waste law, in part to address methane leaks. But even with new rules on the books, economic incentives still favor the cheapest option: burying waste.

Baas sees this as a core flaw in how Michigan manages its garbage — and a missed opportunity. In Kent County, he’s built an integrated system that prioritizes material recovery, energy generation, and composting over landfilling.

However, those systems are more expensive upfront and require initial and ongoing investment, which means aligning public infrastructure, private capital and long-term planning in ways Michigan’s current system doesn’t support.

At the heart of the issue is a tension between innovation and inertia — between new solutions and a regulatory and economic system still structured around cheap disposal. Michigan has the opportunity to lead on waste recovery, Baas argues, but doing so will require more than technical upgrades. It will demand a fundamental rethinking of how the state handles waste — and who bears the burden.

A new regulatory push

Michigan overhauled its solid waste law in 2022, in part to address methane leaks. The updated Part 115 requires all landfills — regardless of age or size — to self-monitor methane emissions and fix leaks through patching or installing gas collection systems if they exceed thresholds. New technologies, including satellite mapping and drones, offer more precise ways to detect emissions than traditional walkover surveys — but adoption remains slow.

Sniffer Robotics, an Ann Arbor-based company, developed the only EPA-approved drone for landfill methane detection. Its technology, already in use at Arbor Hills Landfill, can locate leaks faster and more accurately than older methods. Yet despite promising results, cost barriers and procurement hurdles have limited uptake across the state.

Michigan’s new rules also impose faster compliance timelines: sites must correct surface emissions within 90 days or begin designing a full gas collection system. Currently, Michigan landfills use a mix of active and passive gas systems — active systems vacuum methane to flares or energy generators. In contrast, passive systems may vent it directly into the air. Sites without active collection may eventually be forced to upgrade.

Tim Unseld, a solid waste engineer with the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE), says two landfills without gas systems have already detected surface emissions and made repairs. But those fixes may not last. “Once enough landfill gas is generated, it will follow the path of least resistance to escape,” he says. Ongoing repairs can become costly — pushing operators toward installing full recovery systems, particularly if they can sell the captured methane as energy.

Environmental advocates argue the reforms don’t go far enough. “We’re the sixth-largest producer of landfill methane emissions, even though we’re only the 10th or 11th most populous state,” says Mike Garfield, executive director of the Ecology Center. “The basic reason is simple: We’ve made it too easy and too cheap to landfill waste.”

Garfield wants the state to adopt enforceable best practices across the board — including tighter flare controls, real-time monitoring, and mandatory adoption of tools like Sniffer’s — and points to the 2022 Arbor Hills consent judgment as a model.

Arbor Hills, owned by GFL Environmental, is the largest landfill in the state in terms of the amount of waste in place, according to EPA. It has faced years of complaints and violations tied to odor, gas migration, and leachate issues. So far, however, EGLE has not moved to apply those stricter terms statewide.

“The Part 115 amendments of 2023 include what EGLE considers best practices,” says agency spokesperson Josef Greenberg, adding that the state’s current focus is on implementation.

The economics of food waste disposal

Food waste is the largest single component of Michigan’s municipal waste stream by weight. Yet efforts to keep it out of landfills face a steep uphill climb — in large part because the system is built to reward the opposite.

Disposal fees are typically based on weight, creating a strong financial incentive for landfills owners to accept heavier materials like food waste. “This is really carbon-rich material — it generates methane, and they can use that methane to drive biogas-based processes,” says Desirée Plata, an environmental engineer at MIT.

It’s a perverse incentive, she notes, especially as Michigan aims to reduce methane emissions. Instead of rewarding diversion, the current system reinforces disposal. “We’re paying for disposal by the ton, not by environmental outcome,” she says. According to EPA data, 35 out of 60 landfills in Michigan — nearly 60% — have landfill gas-to-energy projects.

That tension sits at the heart of Baas’s frustration. He’s spent years trying to reorient the local waste system around recovery. “I’ve been told I’m an oddity in the waste industry,” Baas says. “Most people don’t see the system this way.”

Waste recovery adds expense and faces adoption challenges, says Debora Johnston, a Michigan-based environmental engineer with Waste Management and technical standards committee chair for the Michigan Waste & Recycling Coalition. Waste Management owns and operates dozens of landfills across Michigan.

“Capturing landfill gas generates revenue to help operators keep disposal costs down, helps protect our environment, and creates a renewable energy source for our local community,” she says. “But separating out organics like food waste is expensive.”

Indeed, the estimated cost for Kent County to meet the needs of a community of 640,000 to process 400,000 tons of mixed waste would exceed $400 million.

Plata says one of the most effective actions municipalities can take today is to fund composting. “Every municipality on the planet should be funding compost programs,” she says. “It’s one of the easiest things we can do to fight climate change — and it works.”

But Johnston points out the challenge of getting people to change their ways.

“Most communities are finding participation in recycling programs to have plateaued,” Johnston says. “And new organics collection and drop-off sites face many of the same challenges.”

That’s why Baas sees single-stream processing — separating out organics like food waste and recoverable items like recyclables and metals after pickup — as the path forward.

Despite setbacks, including the withdrawal of a private-sector partner, Kent County is moving forward with its Sustainable Business Park — a proposed 250-acre campus on county-owned farmland next to the nearly full South Kent Landfill.

The county has made a deliberate decision not to site a new landfill there and instead repurpose the land for recovery infrastructure that could process food and yard waste — which has been banned from landfills in Michigan since 1993.

“We’re past the point of building another landfill,” Baas says. “We’re trying to do something different.” Still, he acknowledges the economics won’t shift without public investment and new rules.

“We’ve determined that the highest, best use for these organics was mission critical,” he says. “But unless you change policy and infrastructure to make it go somewhere else, food waste will keep going to landfills — the lowest hanging fruit economically.”",https://nextcity.org/images/daily/_resized/nh_20250428_014.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 19:10:51.107702

The new bill effectively repeals federal clean energy tax credits and key incentives for electric vehicles, energy efficiency, and renewable energy projects across the nation. This legislation, part of President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill”, is poised to halt the U.S. clean energy boom spurred by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which was on target to create up to 700,000 jobs and lower energy costs for millions of Americans by 2030.

By investing in cheaper, cleaner, and more reliable energy, American consumers were poised to realize enormous benefits for years to come. But instead, independent analyses project the new Republican legislation could slash clean energy job growth and increase household energy costs by $32 billion over the next decade. This shift in policy means Congress is choosing to support more expensive and polluting fossil fuels over helping American families and businesses.

“The fossil fuel industry is smiling all the way to the bank with the passage of the so-called ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’; meanwhile, the American people will pay higher prices for dirtier and less reliable energy,” said Quentin Scott, Federal Policy Director for the Chesapeake Climate Action Network (CCAN) Action Fund. “The House reconciliation package is a betrayal of the American people. Last November, we were promised lower energy bills, more jobs, and healthier communities, but in one bill, they managed to undo progress in all three categories. We now call on the Republican-controlled Senate to reject the House bill and restore the economic opportunities the clean energy tax credits provided to the states and districts they represent.”

WASHINGTON – The U.S. House of Representatives voted 215-214 early Thursday morning to pass a budget reconciliation bill taking away tax credits for homeowners who install solar panels or energy-efficient heat pumps at the end of 2025. The bill also scraps incentives for new energy-efficient homes, home weatherization projects and the purchase of used electric vehicles this year. In 2023, 3.4 million Americans earned federal tax credits for clean energy or energy efficiency home improvements, saving more than $8 billion while contributing to cleaner air.

If this legislation passes the U.S. Senate, it will also make it harder for houses of worship, cities, school districts and businesses to “go solar,” electrify their workers’ fleets or cut energy waste in their buildings. Last month, Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), John Curtis (R-UT), Thom Tillis (R-NC), and Jerry Moran (R-KS) cautioned against repealing clean energy tax credits in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD), citing the importance of providing certainty for businesses that invested in clean energy production with the promise of existing incentives.

Wind and solar power reap significant environmental and health benefits for all Americans. The solar and wind power installed in the U.S. has cut health-threatening sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollution from power plants enough to prevent an estimated 1,400 premature deaths in 2022 and cut global warming pollution by an amount of pollution greater than the state of Texas emits in a year.

In response to the House vote, Lisa Frank, executive director of Environment America, said:

“This bill means less choice and dirtier air for Americans. Why make us pay for power generated at a pollution-spewing plant hundreds of miles away when solar panels on our roofs can keep our lights on more efficiently and without filling the air with toxic emissions?

“Not enough clean energy funding got out the door quickly enough,” he said.","After days of intense political infighting between ultra-conservative and moderate Republicans, the House of Representatives voted along party lines on Thursday morning to approve a sweeping tax bill that seeks to eviscerate the heart of landmark climate legislation passed by Democrats just three years ago.

The 2022 climate law on the chopping block, the Inflation Reduction Act (or IRA), was the first legislation in more than a decade to attempt to slash American greenhouse gas emissions and the centerpiece of former president Joe Biden’s legislative agenda. It provides hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits, loans, subsidies, and grants to utility companies, automakers, consumers, and others to become more energy efficient and switch to sources of carbon-free power.

Until recently, the conventional wisdom in Washington was that lawmakers in districts receiving this cash would be disincentivized to undo the legislation supplying it, even under an ultra-conservative president like Donald Trump. “Repeal is extremely unlikely,” Neil Chatterjee, a former Republican commissioner of the United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, wrote in an opinion piece for The Hill last August titled “The Solar Investment Tax Credit is safe from repeal even if Republicans win in 2024.” In March, 21 House Republicans signed an open letter calling for any changes to the IRA tax credits to “be conducted in a targeted and pragmatic fashion.”

Yet the House voted 215-214 on Thursday to wind down the IRA’s clean energy tax credits ahead of schedule, including the solar investment tax credit that Chatterjee was sure would be safe. Just two Republicans voted against the bill, one voted present, and two abstained — including only one of the March letter’s signatories.

Originally, the incentives were set to continue through at least 2032. Under the House bill, tax credits for all clean energies except for nuclear, which Republicans tend to view favorably, will apply only to projects that break ground within 60 days of the bill’s enactment and begin sending energy to the grid by the end of 2028, a timeline that could seriously undercut the country’s clean energy industry. Federal tax credits to help consumers adopt clean energy technologies like heat pumps, rooftop solar, battery storage, and electric vehicles would be phased out by the end of this year.

The House bill needs to be passed by the Senate and signed by President Trump in order to become law, and it is likely to change during negotiations in the upper chamber.

Renewable energy developers warn that the House’s timeline for getting projects in service is prohibitively tight and would effectively make some of the tax credits obsolete. “If Congress does not change course, this legislation will upend an economic boom in this country that has delivered an historic American manufacturing renaissance,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, in a statement.

The repeals would impact major utility-scale projects that are already underway, like wind projects, said Katrina McLaughlin, an associate on the World Resources Institute’s U.S. energy team, because it takes a long time to get most renewable projects up and running.

“Placed in service means everything has to go right. We have interconnection queue delays, we have permitting delays, there can be challenges with getting different materials and resources,” McLaughlin said. “So getting in service by 2028 is actually a pretty aggressive timeline.”

In the two years since the IRA was passed, analyses show that the federal funding has catalyzed more than $400 billion in investments in manufacturing, electric vehicles, hydrogen power, renewable energy, and other green initiatives, and spurred more than 400,000 new jobs. Analyses show that the vast majority of IRA clean energy tax credits and grants — 78 percent — have gone to red districts in rural and suburban areas.

As House Speaker Mike Johnson sought to unite his party behind Trump’s domestic agenda, two warring factions emerged: a far-right coalition focused on attaining deeper spending cuts by slashing the IRA and Medicare, and a moderate group agitating to retain clean energy funding in their districts and increase the cap on how much state and local tax can be deducted from one’s federal taxes — a change that would benefit high earners in blue states.

Unsurprisingly, the lawmaker leading the fight against the IRA comes from an area that hasn’t gotten much money from it. Representative Chip Roy, leading the ultra-conservative crusade, represents a district in Texas that has a little less than a dollar per person in announced IRA investments. Meanwhile, one of his colleagues on the other side of the fight, moderate Republican Representative Nancy Kiggan, comes from a district in Virginia that is slated to receive $85.50 worth of investments per capita.

Republicans represent 18 of the top 20 congressional districts benefiting the most from clean energy investments since the passage of the IRA, according to the research firm Atlas Public Policy. The top three districts on that list, in North Carolina, Georgia, and Nevada, had together received nearly $30 billion from the legislation as of March this year. But in the end, all of the Republican lawmakers representing those 18 districts voted in favor of effectively ending the investments. Democrats, whose caucus has shrunk due to the deaths of three members this year, were united in opposition.

In the end, the moderate Republican caucus was willing to trade IRA tax credits for other policy priorities. Moderates in high-tax states like New York were willing to use Biden’s tax credits as a bargaining chip for a higher limit on itemized state and local tax deductions — $40,000, up from the current cap of $10,000 — a political win that those lawmakers could reap the benefits of immediately and allowed them to sidestep having to defend legislation passed by a Democratic administration.

Republicans might also be banking on the fact that many of their constituents don’t know about the IRA. A University of Chicago and Associated Press survey last year found that, two years after the IRA passed, most Americans had a supremely flawed understanding of what the legislation is and does, if they knew about it at all. Only 21 percent of adults polled, for example, thought tax credits for individuals to buy electric vehicles were helpful. Nearly 40 percent didn’t know enough to weigh in on the EV tax credits and a shocking 15 percent of those polled thought the policy — which gives consumers up to $7,500 for a new plug-in EV — hurt people like them.

According to Josh Freed, senior vice president for climate and energy at the think tank Third Way, part of the problem is that the IRA’s clean energy incentives — like new union jobs, major infrastructure projects and new union jobs — take years to manifest. “Not enough clean energy funding got out the door quickly enough,” he said. “It’s having a big impact, don’t get me wrong, but it hasn’t become part of the fabric of communities yet in a way that would freak people out if it disappeared.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2216339439-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-05-22 18:12:23.136937

The House bill, which passed by a single vote, will raise household energy costs, derail over 21,000 clean energy jobs, and pull the plug on billions in local investment — all to give tax breaks to billionaires. While Nevada’s congressional Democrats rejected the destructive bill, Rep. Mark Amodei (NV-2) backed the measure, despite a majority of new clean energy jobs and investment benefiting his own district.

The bill outright repeals key tax credits that have already helped cut energy bills for families and expand manufacturing in our state. This includes tax credits for solar panels, electric vehicles, heat pumps, and energy-efficient appliances, which have enabled more than 41,000 Nevada families to save over $151 million on their power bills. These same credits made it possible for companies like Unimacts to expand their manufacturing and create new jobs, and for local solar businesses like Sol-Up and Freedom Forever to scale up their operations.

The bill also deepens attacks on working families and public health, slashing grants for cleaning up air pollution, financing and deploying clean energy projects, upgrading grid infrastructure, and improving fuel efficiency, including programs that directly benefit rural, Tribal, and disadvantaged communities.

“Trump’s ‘big, beautiful’ bill is a big, brutal betrayal of hardworking Nevadans,” said Kristee Watson, Executive Director for the Nevada Conservation League. “It would jack up our power bills, kill good-paying jobs, and hand our clean energy future to other countries instead of building up our competition on a global scale — all while giving billionaires more tax breaks. Rep. Amodei will have to explain to Nevada families why he voted to sabotage his own community in order to fund tax cuts for billionaires. Nevadans didn’t ask for this rollback – and we won’t stay silent about it.”

“By advancing this bill, Republicans are threatening jobs, raising energy costs, and sacrificing Nevada’s solar and battery industries,” said Tiffany Hsieh, Climate Power Western States Hub Director. “This bill betrays Nevadans and undermines Nevada’s energy independence – all so the wealthiest Americans can get another massive tax cut.”

“A budget serves as a value statement, and with this budget, Trump and Republicans are showing that they value corporations, billionaires, and polluters over Nevada’s working families. This bill would not only slash good-paying union jobs and increase our energy bills, but also roll back the climate progress that Nevadans have worked so hard for,” said Jarrett Clark with For Our Future Nevada. “Nevada has established itself as a clean energy leader, driving new economic growth, and creating job opportunities in every corner of the state. We applaud Representatives Titus, Lee, and Horsford for standing against this job-killing budget and are counting on Senators Cortez Masto and Rosen to reject it in the Senate.

Trump and Republicans ran on a promise to cut energy costs in half, but costs have only risen. If clean energy tax credits and key pollution regulations are gutted, Nevada households are expected to see an increase in total annual energy costs of $289 by 2030 — the second-highest increase in the country. Nevada is already among the top states with the highest electricity bills, and with triple-digit temperatures on the horizon, these cuts will make Nevadans less prepared and put families in danger of not accessing life-saving air conditioning.

“What Nevada families needed from Congress was to lower our bills, which many families cannot afford anymore, and support clean energy. Instead, the House just passed a bill that will force electricity bills even higher, allow more pollution in our communities, and cut clean energy jobs throughout our state,” said Juan Carlos Guardado with Chispa Nevada. “This is a gift to corporate polluters and billionaire donors. By cutting tax credits and rebates that help consumers reduce electricity bills and make our homes more energy efficient, Congress is making monopoly utilities richer at the expense of working people. Instead of investing in homegrown clean energy in one of the sunniest states in the nation, we will again be paying more money for imported methane gas. We need our Senators, Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen, to protect Nevada families from higher prices and dirtier air. Please vote no on this dangerous package.”

Tariffs have already made everyday goods like groceries and clothes more expensive. The Trump administration has targeted programs that assist low-income families in keeping the lights on, and is now set to dismantle Energy Star, a common-sense standard that has saved Americans more than $500 billion in energy costs. Instead of easing the burden on families, the House reconciliation plan doubles down on economic hardship for the lowest earners while giving tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans.

“As a mother of two boys, I’m fighting with everything I have to protect my children’s future. Repealing clean energy tax credits isn’t just bad policy — it’s a direct threat to our families,” said Mary Wagner with Moms Clean Air Force. “Here in Nevada, those investments could mean good-paying jobs, cleaner air, and lower energy bills. Without them, we’ll see more toxic air, worse heat waves, and skyrocketing health and electricity costs. Our kids deserve a future where they can breathe clean air and live without fear of the next wildfire or climate disaster. We must defend clean energy progress, and we must defend Nevada’s future.”

Since federal clean energy investments were passed in 2022, Nevada has attracted $15.5 billion in new investment, created over 21,700 jobs from Sparks to Sloan, in solar, battery manufacturing, EVs, and grid modernization. However, the Trump Administration’s attacks on clean energy investments threatened $2 billion in investments and 5,000 Nevada-based jobs after a battery factory project announced it was canceled.

“House Republicans have spoken: Taking money and jobs out of Nevada is a small price to pay when lining billionaires’ pockets,” said Taylor Patterson, Executive Director of Native Voters Alliance Nevada. “Nevada’s own Representative Mark Amodei voted away thousands of jobs from his constituents while they slept. From Sparks to Sloan, the economy has grown due to the very investments being repealed. And make no mistake–urban, rural, and Tribal communities across the Silver State will suffer as a result. Stifling the momentum we’ve built will be detrimental to our economy and the health of our communities.”

“Repealing the Inflation Reduction Act is a direct blow to working families, small businesses, and underserved communities,” said Eric Jeng of One APIA Nevada. “It would eliminate clean energy jobs, raise utility costs, and pull the plug on opportunities that Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Nevadans have only just begun to access. Nevada has led the way on clean energy and economic innovation—any member of Congress who votes to undo that progress will have to answer to their constituents about why they chose higher bills and fewer jobs, and why they undermined American workers by allowing these opportunities to be outsourced overseas instead of investing in them here at home.”

Clean energy manufacturing is booming across the country as a result of federal investments, and Republican-held districts are seeing the most significant gains. Nevada, which has the greatest solar power potential in the country, is proving how transformative these investments can be. Nevada’s second congressional district, represented by Rep. Amodei, is home to over 15,000 of the state’s more than 21,000 new clean energy jobs, and with $11.1 billion of investment. Rep. Amodei’s district leads the nation in clean energy job creation in Republican-held districts, and he has recognized the economic value of clean energy tax credits. Yet, the Congressman voted to turn his back on the very progress his own district benefited from.

With this vote, Members of Congress put on record whether or not they will support legislation that strikes down clean energy incentives that have driven a clean energy and manufacturing boom over the last three years.

The Senate will begin crafting its version of the bill, and Nevadans will be counting on Senators Cortez Masto and Rosen to protect jobs, lower energy costs, and defend the clean energy future that’s already delivering for communities across the state.

Encouragingly, a growing number of Republican members of Congress are vocalizing their support for the clean energy tax credits.
The numbers are clear: clean energy tax credits are working for Iowa.","The House of Representatives recently voted to pass a budget bill that drastically cuts America’s clean energy tax credits. I’m disappointed to see that the House advanced this legislation.

Make no mistake, these cuts will hurt Iowa if they go on to become law. Experts are already warning that these changes would raise energy costs for American households, increase pollution, and threaten growing economic investments we’ve seen in Iowa. The House passage of this bill just put these investments at risk.

Federal tax credits—designed to boost U.S. clean energy manufacturing —are working. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, Iowa has benefited from $4.3 billion in clean energy investments, 53 clean energy projects, and 13,986 clean energy jobs.

The tax credits were passed by Democrats, so they’ve been an easy target for Republican attacks. But the legislation has overwhelmingly benefited Republican-held districts—78% of the funding has gone to rural and suburban areas held by the GOP. That includes Iowa, where manufacturers like Little Sioux Corn Processors and Summit Carbon Solutions, have made major investments.

But that success story could unravel quickly. The legislation is now in the Senate’s hands, and the House passage has set them on a path toward drastic cuts.

Energy prices will rise. A study commissioned by the Clean Energy Buyers Commission concludes that rolling back these tax credits means Iowa ratepayers will endure higher electricity prices in the coming years than they would if the incentives remained in place.

Manufacturing will slow. Phasing out tax credits supporting clean energy manufacturing could hinder long-term projects like the Silver Queen Wind Farm, which would bring 500 jobs to Iowa and create a 252-megawatt wind farm. Iowans rely on wind energy for over half of our power (Iowa Environmental Council), so failing to utilize our abundant natural resources means increased reliance on out-of-state and foreign energy. This jeopardizes state jobs and energy independence.

In turn, eliminating clean vehicle tax credits could put up to 100% of planned EV plant construction and a significant portion of existing capacity at risk, according to industry analysis.

Households and local businesses will take a huge hit. Losing tax credits for home energy upgrades like rooftop solar hurts Iowans who’ve been using these tools to cut energy bills. Tax credits enable Iowans to install solar panels, save money, and even help stabilize America’s power grid. But those benefits—and the local businesses that depend on them—are in jeopardy if the Senate advances these cuts.

Encouragingly, a growing number of Republican members of Congress are vocalizing their support for the clean energy tax credits. Four Republican Senators recently sent a letter to leadership last month saying repeal would “lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.”

Keeping the clean energy tax credits would be a huge boost to Iowa’s economy over the next decade. Analysis by American Clean Power and ICF estimates that the incentives will boost Iowans’ income by $18 billion, unleash an extra $71 billion in spending, and support 22,900 full-time jobs in Iowa annually. That’s not hypothetical—that’s real money and real livelihoods for Iowans.

The numbers are clear: clean energy tax credits are working for Iowa. Undoing them now — as the House just voted to do — would be reckless and harmful. I urge Senators Grassley and Ernst to work with their colleagues in the Senate to protect these tax credits.

Some of these pollutants are precursors for ozone, which is created every day from a chemical reaction in the air between air pollution and sunlight.
In California, when coal plants closed, the rate of preterm births for those who lived near the coal plants went down by over 25%.
The PSC should require Georgia Power to have much more solar with storage and much less health-damaging methane and coal.
And just this week, news came out that Georgia Power will be asking to recover costs from Hurricane Helene next year.","The Public Service Commission’s mission statement says that it is supposed to ensure that Georgians have safe, reliable, and reasonably priced electricity. To be honest, natural (methane) gas and coal and any combustion fuel are neither safe nor reasonable cost. Methane gas is not actually natural, it is a fossil fuel just as coal and oil are fossil fuels. There is an entire scientific article in the prestigious medical journal, the New England Journal of Medicine, titled “The False Promise of Natural Gas.” This scientific article describes many of the health harms caused by natural methane gas, from production to pipelines to end use in power plants or homes. These health harms include exposure to carcinogens, air and water pollution, earthquakes, pipeline and other facility explosions, and climate change.

We know that both coal and methane gas power plants produce many kinds of air pollution, including fine particles (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and volatile organic compounds or VOCs. Some of these pollutants are precursors for ozone, which is created every day from a chemical reaction in the air between air pollution and sunlight. In addition, there are contaminants in both coal and natural gas that affect our health. Coal contaminants include many heavy metals, including lead, mercury, and arsenic, among others. Natural (methane) gas has benzene and other cyclic aromatics. All of these kinds of pollution and contaminants harm our health and damage our economy.

In the U.S., PM2.5 from fossil fuels causes 13% of all deaths, and NO2 from burning fossil fuels causes 1.6% of all deaths. Ozone causes even more deaths, and is known to cause as much progression of emphysema as smoking a pack of cigarettes every day. Ozone also triggers asthma and COPD exacerbations. In the Southeast, all of the kinds of air pollution made by coal and gas power plants put people in the hospital.

Recently, we have learned that PM2.5 damages children’s IQ, from exposure during the prenatal period through the childhood years. We know that children exposed to air pollution are more likely to have mental health problems too, either within a few days of a PM2.5 spike or even eight years after exposure to NO2 or PM2.5. We know that the kinds of air pollution that coal and methane gas power plants produce will trigger asthma attacks and can cause children to develop asthma. And we have learned that giving air filters to pregnant women who live in polluted cities improves their children’s IQ 4 years AFTER the children are born.

In California, when coal plants closed, the rate of preterm births for those who lived near the coal plants went down by over 25%.

Here in Georgia, more than two-thirds of our rivers and large lakes are contaminated with mercury to the point that the Department of Natural Resources has to publish guidelines every year about which fish need to have limited consumption, because the fish are contaminated with mercury. The vast majority of that mercury came from coal-fired power plants.

These are some of the reasons that it is clear that both coal and natural gas are not safe sources of fuel. The PSC needs to be true to its mission, and encourage safer sources of electricity production.

In addition, even though Lazard’s Levelized Cost of Energy (an energy cost analysis) shows that methane combined cycle and utility scale solar with storage appear to be in the same price range, this ignores the economic harms of reduced crop yields, work absences, and lower work productivity caused by fossil fuels, and also the enormous health costs of all the health damage from both coal and methane. Therefore it is also clear that both methane and coal are not reasonably priced, the stated costs are artificially low because they don’t include the enormous economic and health damages. It is massive cost-shifting, and Georgia residents are paying with increased taxes, increased health insurance premiums, and with our own lives.

However, it’s not all doom and gloom. There is a good solution: we can have abundant affordable electricity without all the health and economic damages. It sounds like pie-in-the-sky, but it’s true. Solar with storage is in the same price range as methane gas combined cycle, and wind with storage is less expensive. And both are quicker to build than a new gas turbine power plant. The PSC should require Georgia Power to have much more solar with storage and much less health-damaging methane and coal.

And just this week, news came out that Georgia Power will be asking to recover costs from Hurricane Helene next year. Many scientists have shown that Hurricane Helene was more damaging and carried more moisture because of climate change. Yet, while Georgia Power is asking to recover costs of damages from a climate change enhanced hurricane, they are at the same time asking to build new natural gas power plants that will make climate change worse. It doesn’t make sense, especially when we know that for about the same cost they could build solar with storage and stop making climate change worse.

Georgia has abundant sunshine that is more direct than in much of the United States. It is an abundant natural resource we can easily use without hurting people’s health or hurting our crop yields. Georgia power has abundant opportunity for utility scale solar with storage, which is the safest and most reasonable cost form of electricity that there is.

The bottom line is this: air pollution is so bad for our health and economy, that you don’t have to care about climate to want clean energy. Solar is one of Georgia’s most abundant natural resources. The PSC should be true to its mission and require Georgia Power to use more solar and wind energy with storage so that we have safe, affordable, and reliable energy.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Plant-Yates-2048x1238.jpeg,N,,2025-05-22 19:10:33.018201

The measure overturning the rule now goes to the White House, where Trump is expected to sign it, along with two other resolutions that would block California rules curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks. All three measures were approved by the Senate on Thursday and by the House earlier this month.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, and state air regulators say that what Congress is doing is illegal and they will sue to keep the rules in place.

“This is not about electric vehicles,” Newsom said at a news conference while the Senate was still voting on the measures. “This is about polluters being able to pollute more.”

California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state plans to sue over the way that Republicans passed the measures blocking the emissions rules. Senate Republicans established a narrow exception to the filibuster Wednesday to clear the way for the votes.

The GOP effort could have a profound impact on California’s longtime efforts to curb air pollution. California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends — especially because about a dozen states have already followed California’s lead. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.

Senate Democrats charged that Republicans are acting at the behest of the oil and gas industry and they say California should be able to set its own standards after obtaining waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency.

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the votes should “send a chill down the spine of legislators in every state.”

“What we have at stake is a state’s ability, it’s right to make its own laws and to protect its own citizens, without having this body overturn that right,” Schiff said.

Republicans say the phaseout of gas-powered cars, along with other waivers that California has obtained from the EPA, is costly for consumers and manufacturers, puts pressure on the nation’s energy grid and has become a de facto nationwide electric vehicle mandate.

“America cannot meet these impossible standards –- not next year, and not in 10 years,” said Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the second-ranking Republican.

Newsom announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles within 15 years as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.

The Biden administration approved the state’s waiver to implement the standards in December, a month before Trump returned to office. The California rules are stricter than a Biden-era rule that tightens emissions standards but does not require sales of electric vehicles.

Biden’s EPA said in announcing the decision that opponents of the California waivers did not meet their legal burden to show how either the EV rule or a separate measure on heavy-duty vehicles was inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.

Republicans have long criticized California’s waivers and have worked to find a way to overturn them. The Government Accountability Office said earlier this year that California’s policies are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows Congress to reject federal regulations under certain circumstances with a simple majority vote not subject to the filibuster. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that ruling, but Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., cleared the way for the votes anyway with a workaround that established a new Senate precedent.

Democrats fought those changes, which were the latest attempt to chip away at the Senate filibuster after both parties have used their majorities in the past two decades to lower the threshold for nominations. Democrats tried in 2022 to roll back the filibuster for legislation, as well, but were thwarted by members of their own caucus who disagreed with the effort.

Republicans have insisted that they would not try a similar move after regaining the majority this year. But Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the move to block California’s laws were a “point of no return” and called the Republicans “fair weather institutionalists.”

Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan was the only Democrat to support the measure to block the phaseout of gas-powered vehicles. She said in a statement after the vote that she has a “special responsibility to stand up for the more than one million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry.”

John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an auto industry association and lobby group, said there is a gap between the vehicles that car buyers are purchasing and the rules that would force a transition to electric vehicles.

“The fact is these EV sales mandates were never achievable,” Bozzella said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate voted on Thursday to block California’s first-in-the nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, moving to kill the country’s most aggressive effort to transition toward electric vehicles as President Donald Trump’s administration has doubled down on fossil fuels.

The Senate vote was largely partisan, with Democratic Sen. Slotkin of Michigan siding with Republicans due to concerns about the auto industry.

The legality of Congress's decision, given prior GAO findings, is likely to be challenged in court by California.

Congress has approved a resolution rejecting a waiver granted to California by former President Joe Biden's administration that would have allowed that state and possibly others to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars, trucks and sport-utility vehicles by 2035.

But the fight over whether Congress' decision to do so — or President Donald Trump's efforts to stop California in its effort to block the sale of vehicles with internal combustion engines as a means of reducing greenhouse gases — is legal, is just beginning.

""We intend to sue the Trump administration,"" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said at a news conference on May 22. ""This is unprecedented.""

Earlier in the day, the U.S. Senate voted 51-44 in favor of a resolution already passed in the House to turn back the Biden administration waiver granted to California by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) about a month before Biden left office this January. That waiver allows the state to move ahead with a program requiring an increasing share of new cars, trucks and SUVs sold to be zero emission or otherwise penalize automakers.

Both congressional chambers passed the resolution after Trump's new EPA head, Lee Zeldin, asked for a legislative review under a law — the Congressional Review Act, or CRA — that allows the House and Senate to reject some agency-finalized rules within 60 business days of their being notified.

The Senate vote was largely along party lines with Republicans in favor of rejecting the waiver and Democrats against doing so. The one exception was Democratic U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin, of Michigan, who voted in favor of the resolution and against the waiver, saying she was doing so because she has ""a special responsibility to stand up for the more than 1 million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry.""

Noting that several other states are also allowed to follow California's greenhouse gas waivers under amendments to the Clean Air Act, Slotkin, who was elected last year, said she has to acknowledge market forces and the reality facing the auto industry. ""As of today, not a single one of these states is anywhere near complying with California’s requirements (for sales of zero-emission vehicles) and some are even reversing course. That means car manufacturers, including the Detroit Three, will be forced to eventually stop the sale of gas-powered cars in these states or pay competitors, particularly Tesla, for credits to remain compliant.""

Automakers, through the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a Washington trade group, had argued that the California waiver and a ban on gasoline-powered new cars was not realistic in the given time frame and have long advocated for a single national standard over a patchwork of rules. Slotkin's Senate colleague from Michigan, Democrat Gary Peters, who is stepping down at the end of the current term, voted against the resolution and for the waiver.

About 23% of California's market was electric vehicles last year. The state's program calls for that to be 35% for model year 2026 vehicles and 68% by the end of the decade, despite a slowdown in sales of EVs nationally, though the resolution by Congress leaves in doubt what happens next to those targets.

Zeldin put out a statement saying the resolution, once signed by Trump, ""not only prevents California from implementing their attempt at EV mandate actions but ensures that they can never do something similar again.” Bonta, noting that California has had dozens of waivers approved under the Clean Air Act regulations, said the state would sue over the ""unlawful and unprecedented"" use of the 29-year-old CRA to upend this one.

Bonta said Trump was using the CRA unlawfully to ""penalize"" California.

With Republicans in the majority in both legislative chambers and only a simple majority required to pass a resolution overturning a rule under the CRA (rather than a 60-vote supermajority needed for most votes in the Senate), there was little doubt the resolution would pass. But there remained clear questions as to whether California's waiver, granted under provisions in the Clean Air Act, was ever intended to be subject to review under the CRA.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) had previously found that the waivers granted to California and the other states under the Clean Air Act provisions weren't reviewable under the CRA.

Neither the Senate nor the House ended up accepting that interpretation from the GAO, however, leaving in question whether the resolution, which is certain to be signed by Trump, will meet scrutiny in the courts once California and its Air Resources Board, files suit. This spring, after the House passed the resolution, Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom said, ""Our vehicles program helps clean the air for all Californians, and we’ll continue defending it.""

Newsom said at the news conference on May 22 that pollution, which California has been fighting for years even before the Clean Air Act was passed, is ""an act of theft against our kids and grandkids.""

Trump and his Republican allies have been aggressively attempting to eliminate efforts to promote the sale of electric vehicles or restrict the sale of vehicles with internal combustion engines, despite transportation sources being one of the leading contributors of greenhouse gases, which cause climate change.

Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity, a national environmental group, said the Senate vote was one to ""increase asthma, lung cancer and cardiac deaths"" as well as a ""reward (to) Big Oil and Big Auto corporations at the expense of everyday people’s health and their wallets.”

John Bozzella, president and CEO for the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, disagreed, saying, ""The fact is these EV sales mandates were never achievable. Automakers warned federal and state policymakers that reaching these EV sales targets would take a miracle, especially in the coming years when the mandates get exponentially tougher.""

“By the way, the problem really isn’t California,"" Bozzella added. ""It’s the 11 states that adopted California’s rules without the same level of readiness for EV sales requirements of this magnitude.""

“Americans are dying from climate change,” Dr. Ebi said.","The wide-ranging bill passed by the House last night would do many things: slash taxes, increase military and border spending, pare back Medicaid.

If enacted into law, it would also effectively gut the Inflation Reduction Act, the sweeping law signed by President Biden that was designed to reduce America’s planet-warming emissions and spur a domestic boom in clean energy.

A core part of the Inflation Reduction act was a series of tax credits that benefited companies working to produce clean energy and remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Those tax credits have already led many companies to increase their spending and create jobs, leading to more than $843 billion in investments announced over the last three years.

As I reported in March, a diverse coalition was seeking to protect the credits — not just Democrats and climate crusaders, but many Republicans and business groups, too. And as Brad Plumer and Lisa Friedman reported earlier this week, what was once considered by some the most important climate legislation in history had been framed by its supporters in Congress mostly in economic terms.

Among those who led the charge was Rep. Andrew Garbarino, a Republican from New York who had organized a group of fellow conservatives to try and persuade congressional leadership and the White House that the tax credits were not part of the “green new scam,” as President Trump has said.

In the end, those efforts fell flat. Under the House bill, tax credits for low-emissions electricity sources such as wind, solar, batteries and geothermal would disappear entirely, with a small exception for companies that have started construction within 60 days after the bill becomes law and finish by the end of 2028.

It leaves in place a credit for biofuels while giving oil and gas companies new opportunities to expedite regulatory approvals.

Many senators have already indicated they want to see changes in the bill, suggesting that the House version is unlikely to be the final word on the matter. And some senators have expressed support for the clean energy tax credits.

But for now at least, the future of the Inflation Reduction Act is looking bleak, marking yet another front in the Trump Administration’s broad assault on climate policy.

When it canceled $450 million in National Institutes of Health grants and contracts to Harvard University last week, the Trump administration ended those research projects, as well as dozens of others focused on the connection between climate change, the environment and public health.

The field of climate and environmental health research has grown significantly over the past three decades as the consequences of rising global temperatures have become clear. Tropical diseases like dengue fever are now showing up in unfamiliar places; more frequent wildfires have meant more wildfire smoke in the air across the United States; and deaths from heat stress are on the rise.

The impact of the cuts

The cuts, which have come on top of $2.2 billion previously frozen by the administration because of its allegations that Harvard tolerated antisemitism and race discrimination on campus, have hit the field of environmental health studies particularly hard. The N.I.H. did not respond to a request for comment.

At Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, 139 scientists have received termination notices affecting 204 contracts or grants, which is nearly all of the school’s direct federal grants, a spokeswoman said.

“This is heartbreaking for me,” said Francesca Dominici, a professor of biostatistics at Harvard who learned last week that the N.I.H. had wiped out about $10 million worth of grants for five studies she led.

“All of it, in one email, was gone,” she said.

Dr. Dominici has spearheaded some of the country’s leading research into the effects of exposure to pollution on older Americans and minority communities, which are often disproportionately exposed to toxic pollution. She has also led studies on the effects of rising temperatures resulting from climate change on children and teenagers.

Dr. Dominici, like most other professors affected by the cuts, has been scrambling to secure new funding. Even if she is successful, she said, years of work developing algorithms, analyzing them, and other research will have been lost.

“Even in the best situation, that magically these funds will come back, they’re not going to come back in time that will allow me to rescue the lab,” she said. “Lives will be lost.”

Research left unfinished

Other studies for which funding was eliminated include work on solutions to extreme heat in low-income communities and ways to bolster fish stocks in places where coral reefs are declining because of climate change.

Mary B. Rice, the director of Harvard’s Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment, was leading a clinical trial to discover whether removing noxious particles from indoor air could help people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease breathe more easily.

The $2.5 million study, funded by the N.I.H., paid for air purifiers and medical evaluations of about 160 people, mostly older men and women and all former smokers, who suffer with moderate to severe breathing difficulty.

The five-year study was in its final stretch, scheduled to finish this year. But last week Dr. Rice learned that the Trump administration has pulled the plug on the grant, and is clawing back the approximately $500,000 not yet spent.

“I can’t imagine having to pick up the phone and tell any one of our participants that we are stopping the trial early. They entrusted me and my team to be able to carry out this research,” Dr. Rice said.

She called ending the funding midway through a study unethical, and noted that millions of dollars have already been invested in the work.

Petros Koutrakis, a professor of environmental studies at Harvard who is studying the effects of air pollution, including the emissions from burn pits on soldiers deployed during the second Iraq war, said that he fears for the future of the field.

Kristie L. Ebi, a professor at the University of Washington who studies the health risks of climate change, said the field was already poorly funded. The N.I.H. finally began to put an emphasis on funding climate change research during the Biden administration, she said, and eliminating more of it could have serious consequences for public health.

“Americans are dying from climate change,” Dr. Ebi said. — Lisa Friedman

By the numbers

6.7 million hectares

Loss of pristine rainforests reached 6.7 million hectares in 2024, nearly twice as much as in 2023, researchers at the University of Maryland and the World Resources Institute said in the annual publication of “The State of the World’s Forests.”

The world lost the equivalent of 18 soccer fields of forested land every minute, the researchers estimated. For the first time since record keeping began, fires, not agriculture, were the leading cause of rainforest loss, accounting for nearly half of the destruction. — Hiroko Tabuchi",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/22/multimedia/22cli-newsletter-health-01-pzjb/22cli-newsletter-health-01-pzjb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 18:12:51.659193

Today, Senate Republicans abused the Congressional Review Act in an unlawful maneuver to overturn the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) waivers for the first of three state car and truck standards they are targeting. This has never been done in the history of the Clean Air Act and the Congressional Review Act. In the course of the vote, Republican senators pushed aside the rules of the Senate and overrode the Senate Parliamentarian, who concluded in April that the waivers are not subject to the Congressional Review Act.

“Senator Republicans abused the law and broke their own institutional rules with a reckless vote today to sideline states’ zero-emissions standards,” said Abigail Dillen, president of Earthjustice. “While our Republican leaders may try to put the horse back in the barn when it comes to electric vehicles (EVs), the world has already shifted under their feet. More than one in four cars sold in the world this year will be electric. States still hold their authority under the Clean Air Act to pass more protective tailpipe standards — and they should move quickly to shape new standards after today’s vote. We all deserve the choice to go electric, and we can’t afford to be left behind by politicians who are turning their backs on the best new technologies.”

The world is on course for more than one in four cars sold this year to be electric this year, surpassing 20 million electric vehicles. States like Colorado and California are following suit with EVs making up a quarter of new car registrations in 2024 — and their residents are gaining the clean air and economic benefits that come with the shift.

The vote today not only overrode the senate parliamentarian, but also the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which concluded in 2023 and reiterated in March of 2025 that EPA’s waivers under the Clean Air Act are not subject to the Congressional Review Act. The GAO, often called the “congressional watchdog,” is an independent agency that works for Congress, examining how taxpayer dollars are spent and providing Congress and federal agencies with fact-based information to help government work efficiently.

The stronger tailpipe standards that states choose to adopt to protect their residents provide billions in economic benefits and public health savings, and save thousands of lives from the heart and lung problems associated with tailpipe pollution. The three state standards attacked today are the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, the Advanced Clean Cars II rule, and the Heavy-duty Omnibus rule. These standards have been slated to save the public an estimated $45 billion in health costs in California alone.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/man-charging_gettyimages-1200_0.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 18:12:58.310945

In the wake of that incident, they say, nuclear energy regulation became more stringent.","In September, when Baltimore-based Constellation Energy announced plans to reopen Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island power plant – site of the worst nuclear reactor accident in U.S. history – a complex past, present and future converged.

Constellation, owner of the nuclear plant in Middletown, Pa., had signed a deal with Microsoft to supply electricity for the tech company’s data centers. The plant has been closed since 2019, after previous owner-operator Exelon failed to win a state subsidy to help the electricity the plant generated compete with cheaper natural gas.

Nuclear revival

The expected 2028 return of the Pennsylvania power plant highlights how nuclear energy is re-emerging to meet the soaring energy needs of the data centers that support artificial intelligence and cloud computing. A U.S. Department of Energy analysis of data’s energy demands shows it doubling or tripling from 2014 to 2028. And the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts overall energy consumption growing as much as 15 percent by 2050.

“We're in the midst of kind of a second nuclear revival,” says Lea Booth, an energy analyst with Washington Policy & Analysis, an international consulting firm. “The market is realizing that nuclear is clean (and) reliable, and there's a massive premium on that that previously wasn't recognized. That's powering a lot of new deals in combination with tax credits that are creating things like the restart of Three Mile Island … (and) various tech company deals with different companies for nuclear.”

Concerns over nuclear power’s safety linger, however, for anyone old enough to remember the Three Mile Island accident. Or the explosive 1986 Chernobyl incident near the now-abandoned city of Pripyat, Ukraine (then a part of the Soviet Union) – a result of flawed reactor design and operator error that killed more than 30 people, left dozens injured with radiation burns and contaminated areas of Europe beyond the fallout levels of 1945’s Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb explosions. The 2011 tsunami-triggered Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in Japan wasn’t directly responsible for any deaths, despite partial radiation releases from partial reactor meltdowns.

U.S. protests against nuclear energy surged in the 1970s. Chief arguments held by dozens of groups across a spectrum of environmental, political and health causes include fears of nuclear war, made possible by turning spent reactor fuel into weapons; terrorist attacks on nuclear plants; reactor catastrophes possibly releasing radiation; and the disposal of nuclear waste.

High-profile environmentalists such as Bill McKibben acknowledge a place for nuclear energy in an all-of-the-above approach to meeting energy demands while working to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Other voices – including Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg – see nuclear energy as a stopgap or stepping stone on the way to more renewable solutions, such as wind and solar technologies.

“I have no problem with these nuclear plans,” McKibben wrote in an October 2024 Substack post. “It took me a while, but I’ve spent the last many years urging states and nations to keep their existing nuclear power plants alive.”

Yet, he adds, “The world is installing more than a gigawatt of solar power every day, and has been for more than a year — the number continues to steadily increase. A gigawatt is about the size of a nuclear plant — an old-style nuclear power plant.”

Perception vs. fear

Nuclear energy advocates point to the facts of the Three Mile incident versus the perception and fear surrounding it. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, no nearby residents died or suffered any injuries from the radiation exposure, which was measured at lower than that of an X-ray. In the wake of that incident, they say, nuclear energy regulation became more stringent.

“We've learned how to operate (nuclear plants) to such extraordinary levels of safety that none of the triggering accidents from previous years would harm any of our nuclear plants,” says Mark Nelson, founder and managing director of Radiant Energy Group, a consulting firm.

Even after their disasters the plants at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima were all able to operate again.

As of early 2025, the U.S. had 54 operating nuclear plants with a combined 94 reactors. By 2050, the projects that the U.S. will need to triple nuclear capacity to keep up with electricity demand. While there are 65 nuclear reactors under construction worldwide, according to the World Nuclear Association, none are currently being built in the U.S., though 13 have been proposed.

Amid a wave of reactor proposals in the U.S., startups have entered the market seeking to advance nuclear technology, which Nelson says is the long way to a solution that already exists with well-proven, much-improved technology that has evolved over 70 years of the industry’s history.

“It’s a marketing problem,” Nelson says.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/10/USAT/82226120007-three-mile-island.jpg?crop=2399,1350,x0,y231&width=2399&height=1350&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-22 19:10:35.584469

House committees labored for months on the bill, which underwent late changes to win over holdouts in the Republican conference. It exceeds 1,000 pages and is titled the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” a nod to Trump himself.

READ MORE: House Republicans pull an all-nighter to pass Trump’s bill of tax breaks and program cuts

Republicans made one last round of revisions before the bill reached the House floor, boosting the state and local tax deduction to win over centrists and speeding up the work requirements in Medicaid to win over those who didn’t believe the bill did enough to curb spending.

Here’s a look at what’s in the legislative package, which is expected to undergo more changes when it goes to the Senate.

Tax cuts for individuals and businesses

Republicans look to make permanent the individual income and estate tax cuts passed in Trump’s first term, in 2017, plus enact promises he made on the 2024 campaign trail to not tax tips, overtime and interest on some auto loans.

To partially offset the lost revenue, Republicans propose repealing or phasing out more quickly the clean energy tax credits passed during Joe Biden’s presidency, helping to bring down the overall cost of the tax portion to about $3.8 trillion.

The bill includes a temporary boost in the standard deduction — a $1,000 increase for individuals, bringing it to $16,000 for individual filers, and a $2,000 boost for joint filers, bringing it to $32,000. The deduction reduces the amount of income that is actually subject to income tax.

There is also a temporary $500 increase in the child tax credit, bringing it to $2,500 for 2025 through 2028. It then returns to $2,000 and will increase to account for inflation.

The estate tax exemption rises to $15 million and is adjusted for inflation going forward.

One of the thorniest issues in negotiations had been how much to raise the state and local tax deduction, now capped at $10,000. That’s been a priority of New York lawmakers. The bill increases the “SALT” cap to $40,000 for incomes up to $500,000, with the cap phasing downward for those with higher incomes. Also, the cap and income threshold will increase 1% annually over 10 years.

Several of the provisions Trump promised in the campaign would be temporary, lasting roughly through his term in office. The tax breaks for tips, overtime and car loan interest expire at the end of 2028. That’s also the case for a $4,000 increase in the standard deduction for seniors.

Among the various business tax provisions, small businesses, including partnerships and S corporations, will be able to subtract 23% of their qualified business income from their taxes. The deduction has been 20%.

Businesses will temporarily be allowed to fully expense domestic research and development costs in the year they occur and the cost of machinery, equipment and other qualifying assets. This encourages businesses to invest in ways that enhances their productivity.

Parents and older Americans face work requirements for food assistance

House Republicans would reduce spending on food aid, what is known as the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program, by about $267 billion over 10 years.

States would shoulder 5% of benefit costs, beginning in fiscal 2028, and 75% of the administrative costs. Currently, states pay none of the benefit and half of the administration costs.

WATCH: Trump pushes GOP holdouts on Capitol Hill to support his massive domestic policy bill

Republicans also are expanding the work requirements to receive food aid. Under current law, able-bodied adults without dependents must fulfill work requirements until they are 54, and that would change under the bill to age 64.

Also, some parents are currently exempt from work requirements until their children are 18; that would change so only those caring for a dependent child under the age of 7 are exempt.

And new work requirements for Medicaid

A focal point of the package is nearly $700 billion in reduced spending in the Medicaid program, according to CBO.

To be eligible for Medicaid, there would be new “community engagement requirements” of at least 80 hours per month of work, education or service for able-bodied adults without dependents. The new requirements would begin on Dec. 31, 2026. People would also have to verify their eligibility for the program twice a year, rather than just once.

Republicans are looking to generate savings with new work requirements. But Democrats warn that millions of Americans will lose coverage.

A preliminary estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade.

No taxes on gun silencers, no money for Planned Parenthood and more

Republicans are also using the package to reward allies and disadvantage political foes.

The package would eliminate a $200 tax on gun silencers that has existed since Congress passed the National Firearms Act in 1934. The elimination of the tax is supported by the NRA.

The group Giffords, which works to reduce gun violence, said silencers make it more difficult to recognize the sound of gunfire and locate the source of gunshots, impairing the ability of law enforcement to respond to active shooters.

Republicans are also looking to prohibit Medicaid funds from going to Planned Parenthood, which provides abortion care. Democrats say defunding the organization would make it harder for millions of patients to get cancer screenings, pap tests and birth control.

‘Trump’ kids $1,000 savings accounts

The bill originally called for “MAGA” accounts, shorthand for Trump’s signature line, “Make America Great Again.” But in a last-minute revision, the bill changed the name to “Trump” accounts.

For parents or guardians who open new “Trump” accounts for their children, the federal government will contribute $1,000 for babies born between Jan. 1, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2028.

Families could add $5,000 a year, with the account holders unable to take distributions before age 18. Then, they could access up to 50% of the money to pay for higher education, training and first-time home purchases. At age 30, account holders have access to the full balance of the account for any purpose.

Funding for Trump’s mass deportation operation

The legislation would provide $46.5 billion to revive construction of Trump’s wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and more money for the deportation agenda.

There’s $4 billion to hire an additional 3,000 new Border Patrol agents as well as 5,000 new customs officers, and $2.1 billion for signing and retention bonuses. There’s also funds for 10,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and investigators.

It includes major changes to immigration policy, imposing a $1,000 fee on migrants seeking asylum — something the nation has never done, putting it on par with few others, including Australia and Iran.

Overall, the plan is to remove 1 million immigrants annually and house 100,000 people in detention centers.

More money for the Pentagon and Trump’s ‘Golden Dome’

There’s also nearly $150 billion in new money for the Defense Department and national security.

It would provide $25 billion for Trump’s “Golden Dome for America,” a long-envisioned missile defense shield, $21 billion to restock the nation’s ammunition arsenal, $34 billion to expand the naval fleet with more shipbuilding and some $5 billion for border security.

It also includes $9 billion for servicemember quality of life-related issues, including housing, health care and special pay.

Tax on university endowments and overhaul of student loans

A wholesale revamping of the student loan program is key to the legislation, providing $330 billion in budget cuts and savings.

The proposal would replace all existing student loan repayment plans with just two: a standard option with monthly payments spread out over 10 to 25 years and a “repayment assistance” plan that is generally less generous than those it would replace.

Among other changes, the bill would repeal Biden-era regulations that made it easier for borrowers to get loans canceled if their colleges defrauded them or closed suddenly.

There would be a tax increase, up to 21%, on some university endowments.

More drilling, mining on public lands

To generate revenue, one section would allow increased leasing of public lands for drilling, mining and logging while clearing the path for more development by speeding up government approvals.

Royalty rates paid by companies to extract oil, gas and coal would be cut, reversing Biden’s attempts to curb fossil fuels to help address climate change.

While the bill does not fully repeal the IRA as many Republicans want, it adjusts timelines and complicates qualifications in ways that will all but end federal support for certain technologies like electric vehicles and batteries and make most low-carbon hydrogen and many renewables projects infeasible. Technologies like carbon capture and storage (CCS) appear relatively safe for now.

The final vote was 215-214.

""Today the House has passed generational, truly nation-shaping legislation to reduce spending and permanently lower taxes for families and job creators, secure the border, unleash American energy dominance, restore peace through strength and make government work more efficiently and effectively for all Americans,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said after the vote. ""House Democrats voted against all of that.""

The legislation aims to satisfy competing demands from fiscal hawks looking to reduce the deficit to blue state Republicans looking to lock in more favorable taxes for their constituents.

The Thursday vote followed a day of near-constant negotiations within the GOP. The talks included a White House meeting between Trump, Johnson and several holdouts and skeptics.

Trump celebrated the vote in a Thursday morning post on his social media site, Truth Social.

""This is arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country!"" Trump wrote before detailing some of elements of the bill. ""Great job by Speaker Mike Johnson, and the House Leadership, and thank you to every Republican who voted YES on this Historic Bill! Now, it's time for our friends in the United States Senate to get to work, and send this Bill to my desk AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! There is no time to waste.""

Johnson entered the vote needing near unanimous support from his members for the bill to pass. House passage is one step in a lengthy process. Republicans still face more challenges in the Senate where lawmakers have already signaled reservations about key elements of the plan.

The sweeping piece of legislation runs more than 1,000 pages long. Here's a brief look at some of the key elements inside the latest version:

Extending the Trump tax cuts

The Republican plan calls for roughly $3.8 trillion in tax cuts — the bulk of which would come by extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts. Those cuts are due to expire at the end of the year, so without an extension, most households would see their taxes go up.

No taxes on tips or overtime

The bill includes temporary changes designed to make good on several of Trump's campaign pledges, including no taxes on overtime earned between 2026 and 2028. The plan would also allow Americans to deduct interest on car loans — but only if the car is made in the U.S. It would increase the child tax credit to $2,500 until 2028 — but only for people with Social Security numbers. After that, it would drop to $2,000 and grow with inflation. It would allow for a higher standard deduction through 2028, and to deliver on Trump's pledge not to tax Social Security benefits, the bill would allow for an extra $4,000 deduction for people over the age of 65, but it phases out for people at higher incomes.

More SALT

One of the thorniest issues during negotiations has been the state and local tax deduction, also known as SALT. The deduction is hugely important to a small number of GOP lawmakers from blue states with high taxes, such as California and New York. The 2017 tax cuts capped the SALT deduction at $10,000. The House plan would lift the cap to $40,000 for married couples with incomes up to $500,000.

Work requirements for Medicaid

The bill includes several proposed changes to Medicaid — the joint federal/state health care program for low-income, elderly and disabled Americans. It has remained one of the most divisive issues throughout GOP negotiations, but lawmakers argue that changes introduced by the bill will bring in hundreds of billions in necessary savings through the introduction of new work requirements. Beginning at the end of 2026, childless adults without disabilities would be required to work 80 hours per month to qualify for benefits.

The legislation also zeroes in on what Republicans characterize as ""waste fraud and abuse"" within the program by shifting the enrollment period from once a year to every six months and adding additional income and residency verifications for enrolled individuals.

Changes to SNAP

The Republican legislation also outlines reforms for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, which benefits more than 40 million low-income Americans. The bill increases the amount states contribute to the program and mandates work requirements for able-bodied SNAP enrollees who don't have dependents. Independent estimates suggest these changes could result in many people losing coverage. Like with Medicaid talks, some Republican lawmakers have pushed back against massive changes to SNAP given its wide reach and the millions enrolled in the program.

Lift the debt ceiling

The House bill would raise the nation's debt limit by $4 trillion. Lifting the debt limit doesn't authorize new spending. Instead, it allows the government to pay for programs that Congress has already authorized. If the cap isn't lifted and the government can't meet its obligations, then it will be at risk of default – a scenario that economists say would be catastrophic not just for the U.S., but the global financial system as a whole. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has told Congress that without action, the U.S. will run out of money to pay its bills as soon as August, which means the clock is ticking.

Ending breaks for clean energy

One way Republicans plan to pay for the tax cuts in the bill is by dramatically scaling back many of the tax credits for clean energy passed as part of former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. The bill ends the $7,500 credit for buying an electric car, and also phases out credits for producing or investing in renewable energy sources such as solar and wind.

Beefing up border security

Changes to border enforcement and immigration policy are a key part of the spending bill. It allocates $46.5 billion toward completing Trump's border wall. It also allots $5 billion for Customs and Border Protection facilities and more than $6 billion to hire and retain more agents and officers. The legislation also invests in upgraded technology for screenings and surveillance of U.S. borders.

New immigration fees

For the first time in U.S. history, the legislation puts a price tag on applying for asylum, proposing a fee of $1,000. It's one of a handful of new or increased fees for immigration services. The bill would also create a $550 charge for work authorization applications with renewal every six months. It additionally assigns a $3,500 fee for sponsoring unaccompanied children without legal status, a $1,000 charge for undocumented individuals paroled into the U.S. and a $500 fee for those applying for temporary protected status.

A student loan overhaul

The Republican plan would cut $330 billion from the student loan system by scrapping several existing repayment options, including the Biden-era SAVE program that based payments on income and household size. It replaces them with a new, standard repayment plan and an income-based plan Republicans call their ""Repayment Assistance Plan.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8640x4860+0+450/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2f%2Ff8%2F61cf24f84d2e90024e00a1429343%2Fgettyimages-2216074866.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 18:12:42.537338

Several initiatives highlight a shift towards decentralized renewable systems such as mini grids and solar setups.

Progress is uneven due to financing gaps, bureaucratic hurdles and a lack of local technical capacity.

A quiet shift is happening across Africa, slower than some might prefer, yet equally urgent.

It’s the growing realization that renewable energy, especially when harnessed productively, transcends daily conveniences to transform livelihoods, unlocking an alternative reality.

For decades, discussions around energy in Africa have centred on access. Understandably so. Over 600 million people on the continent still lack reliable electricity. But the nuance often overlooked is that access to electricity doesn’t automatically transform lives. What people can do with that electricity, how it powers farms, workshops or small businesses, is what truly drives change.

This is the essence of the “productive use of renewable energy” and it might be one of the most underestimated levers for genuine prosperity.

“

We still think too narrowly about what “infrastructure” means.

”

Pathway to livelihoods

Mission 300, a recent initiative by the African Development Bank, the World Bank and other partners, has grasped this, launched to connect 300 million Africans to electricity by 2030.

Beyond headline numbers, however, the initiative emphasizes scaling decentralized renewable solutions such as mini grids and solar home systems. More importantly, it ensures that electricity powers more than just households.

It’s about linking energy access to economic opportunity: a cold chain for farmers, a grain mill in a remote village, a corner shop owner and a welder finally able to work beyond daylight hours.

In some places, the impact is already evident. In Nigeria, for example, via the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, several solar mini-grid projects have emerged in off-grid communities, which power rice hullers, water pumps, walk-in cold rooms and tailoring shops as well as illuminate homes.

In one pilot, a local entrepreneur tripled her income by switching her freezer from diesel to solar. Beyond energy, the impact reflects on jobs, food security and gender equity. GEAPP brings together financial capital, political delivery, venture support and innovation to reach a tipping point for energy access.

Energy transition is development

Yet, progress isn’t uniform. In Ethiopia, large-scale hydro projects coexist with communities with little to no energy access. South Africa grapples with a different energy paradox. It has an advanced grid but is hampered by ageing infrastructure and policy inertia.

The Global Energy Alliance has intervened there, funding pilot programmes focused on distributed solar energy for small enterprises and schools. Still, scaling up remains challenging.

Bureaucracy, financing gaps and sometimes a lack of local technical capacity slow the tempo.

As complex as the path seems, it underscores that Africa’s energy journey is about development, unlike wealthier nations where energy transitions often centre around carbon reduction targets.

Each solution must serve dual purposes: it must be green and catalytic, spark income, unlock markets and reduce drudgery.

One-size-fits-all models rarely work on the continent. The best approach could be a small 5-kilowatt solar setup running a mill in a rural village. At other times, it is a hybrid mini grid powering an entire agro-processing cluster.

Here is the thing. We still think too narrowly about what “infrastructure” means. Roads, bridges and ports get most attention but an ice maker powered by solar in a fishing town is infrastructure too – less glamorous and more intimate perhaps but no less transformative.

Productive use of renewable energy in practice

Financing, of course, is another stumbling block. Many local businesses that could benefit from productive-use energy simply can’t afford the upfront costs. Even where donor programmes exist, they often come with layers of complexity, including long forms and risk-averse banks. More than one entrepreneur has expressed frustration over the hurdles in accessing these grants.

Maybe the question we should be asking is, how do we make renewable energy practically useful? Not just in theory or policy papers but in the messy, everyday grind of local economies?

This is where partnerships matter and not just between donors and governments. Participation from cooperatives, informal traders and even religious groups is crucial. The people closest to the challenge often have the clearest ideas and just need tools, access and a bit of trust.

The Energizing Agriculture Project (EAP) by Rocky Mountain Institute and the Nigerian Rural Electrification Agency is a good example, with its various pilots. For example, Nigeria loses an estimated 45% of its annual food production in part due to poor storage practices.

The introduction of cold storage, via electric refrigeration, is extending the shelf-life of perishables, reducing waste and enabling producers to sell their agricultural goods and seafood for better prices.

EAP is working with cold storage providers such as Ecotutu, ColdHubs, Koolboks and mini-grid connected communities to identify cold storage needs, design scalable business models and source equipment.

If implemented at scale, this programme is expected to create and improve over 150,000 jobs, positively impact the livelihoods of nearly four million Nigerians, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1.4 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2030.

Global discussions tend to frame Africa as either a looming crisis or a market opportunity. Real prosperity is not about narratives, however. It’s about dignity, choice and the quiet power of saying, “I have what I need to build something.”",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_7u72d7Z2g7AwukluaL26SADmKpmQprvJNKUFgl2P1wM.JPG,N,,2025-05-22 18:12:34.419624

The nearly 1,100-page budget bill, also known as President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” essentially guts the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Former President Joe Biden’s signature climate law, coupled with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act), made hundreds of billions of dollars available in tax credits, loans and grants for renewable energy and low-carbon projects and initiated a clean energy boom in the U.S.

The budget bill rolls back many of the clean energy incentives. It accelerates the end of many IRA tax credits, including the technology-neutral clean electricity tax credits, to 2028.

Transferability, which enables owners of clean energy projects to sell and transfer tax credits to others in exchange for cash, is eliminated for most clean energy tax credits after 2027.

Also gone are several credits for clean vehicles, residential clean energy and commercial clean vehicles among others. The bill removes the 30% tax credit for taxpayers who install solar rooftop systems. It also rescinds unobligated funds provided by the IRA for various energy programs as many had expected.

In addition, the bill repeals and rescinds funds for programs focused on reducing emissions, encouraging states to adopt and implement greenhouse-gas and zero-emission standards for mobile sources.

Opponents argue the cuts could put energy security and jobs at risk. Proponents say eliminating the tax credits could lead to savings and potentially help lower debt as well as allow market forces to work without subsidizing certain industries.

House passage of the bill was applauded by the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA).

“IPAA is pleased that the legislation reinstates oil and natural gas lease sales for onshore and offshore federal lands and makes common sense reforms to the permitting and leasing process on federal lands,” said IPAA President and CEO Jeff Eshelman said. “IPAA members, the small businesses of the oil patch, are grateful that industry tax treatments including intangible drilling costs and percentage depletion were protected, along with carried interest deductions being preserved.”

Eshelman expressed disappointment that the Methane Emissions Reduction Program and the methane tax weren’t fully repealed. The bill includes a 10-year delay of the program.

The program aims to lower methane emissions in the oil and gas sector by providing financial support for states to help oil and gas companies eliminate methane emissions from low-producing marginal conventional wells. Funding also goes to small oil and gas operators looking to utilize methane emissions reduction technologies.

The legislation’s passage in the House came as electricity demand in the U.S. climbs along with the potential for rising emissions. Many have said all forms of energy will be needed to meet rising demand.

“If Congress does not change course, this legislation will upend an economic boom in this country that has delivered an historic American manufacturing renaissance, lower electric bills, hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs, and tens of billions of dollars of investments primarily to states that voted for President Trump,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). “This unworkable legislation is willfully ignorant of the fact that deploying solar and storage is the only way the U.S. power grid can meet the demand of American consumers, businesses, and innovation.”

In a report released May 19, SEIA said the legislation could put nearly 3,000 U.S. solar and storage factories at risk, lead to the loss of 145,000 gigawatt-hours of solar generation by 2030 and result in nearly 300,000 current and future job losses.

“It’s not too late for Congress to get this right,” she said. “The solar and storage industry is ready to get to work with the U.S. Senate on a more thoughtful and measured approach to unleashing true American energy dominance to create a brighter future for all Americans.”

The latest version of the bill “shows a worse than feared scenario,” Jefferies analysts said in a note. Residential solar third-party originators (TPOs) appeared to be unexpected targets, as they are now prohibited from earning the 48E investment tax credit.

“This comes as a surprise especially considering how favorable the initial markup was to TPOs in pushing [residential] customers to opt into lease/PPA [power purchase agreement] contracts by repealing the 25D credit,” the analysts said, warning shares of solar companies such as Sunrun and Enphase could fall. They did.

Reuters reported Sunrun led the market rout, with shares falling nearly 41% in early morning trade, SolarEdge Technologies slid nearly 26%, Enphase Energy was down 17.7% and Complete Solaria fell over 15%. Shares of Maxeon Solar fell 9%, Emeren Group was down 5.2%, JinkoSolar dipped 4.7%, while First Solar and Canadian Solar dropped 5.4% and 6.4%, respectively.

The bill passed the House with a 215-214 vote that was mostly along party lines. One representative voted present and two others didn’t vote, including one Republican who fell asleep.

Michael Carr, executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America Coalition, said “a vote for this bill was a vote to close U.S. factories and concede manufacturing jobs of the most important energy resource of the 21st century to China.”

Republicans Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio sided with Democrats in voting against the bill.

“This bill is a debt bomb ticking,” Massie said on the House floor. He added, “Under the taxing and spending levels in this bill, we’re going to rack up, the author’s say, $20 trillion of new debt over the next 10 years. I’m telling you it’s closer to $30 trillion of new debt in the next 10 years. Mr. Speaker, we’re not rearranging debt chairs on the Titanic tonight, we’re putting coal in the boiler and setting a course for the iceberg.

BP Pulse, the electric vehicle charging arm of energy and retail company BP, has partnered with restaurant chain Waffle House to bring EV chargers to select locations.

BP will install six 400 kW direct current fast charging bays at select sites, which include Waffle House locations in Texas, Florida, Georgia and other parts of the South and Southeast. The first charging sites, which will offer the two most common EV connectors, are expected to come online in 2026.

The agreement comes as BP continues to install EV chargers across its hundreds of c-store locations under the Thorntons, Amoco and TravelCenters of America banners.

Dive Insight:

BP has roughly 40,000 charge points globally. The company opened a Gigahub with 20 EV fast-charging bays last month just north of Boston Logan Airport in Massachusetts, and earlier this year debuted BP Pulse at a TravelCenters of America site, part of a plan that will add dozens more across the banner.

BP had ambitions of reaching 100,000 EV chargers globally, though recently the company has been pulling back on many of its green energy plans. In February, it announced it would reduce investments in transitional businesses like electric vehicles by about $5 billion per year, to $1.5 billion to $2 billion annually. However, in spite of that broader refocus on its oil and gas business, the company is still expanding its EV charging network.

“We’re building a robust network of ultrafast chargers across the country, and this is another example of third-party collaborations enabling access to charging co-located with convenient amenities for EV drivers,” said Sujay Sharma, CEO of BP Pulse.

On May 16, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a significant ruling in a longstanding dispute between the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over sulfur dioxide emissions compliance. The court reversed its previous position, siding with the TCEQ and vacating the EPA’s rejection of Texas’ State Implementation Plan (SIP) for sulfur dioxide under the Clean Air Act (CAA).

Crucially, the court’s updated opinion establishes a new standard for classifying areas as “unclassifiable” regarding air quality. This designation means that if the EPA’s data doesn’t “reliably support” a finding of either meeting or failing to meet air quality standards, the area must be labeled “unclassifiable.” Consequently, these areas would avoid the stricter pollution controls imposed on regions failing to meet standards. This revised definition will now be the benchmark across the 5th Circuit’s jurisdiction: Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.

Court Action

This shift followed a petition for a rehearing by industry groups. Instead of a full court rehearing, the panel opted to replace its original opinion after further legal arguments. Judge Southwick, who initially sided with the EPA, authored the new opinion, now joined by Judge Elrod, who had previously dissented.

In her earlier dissent, Judge Elrod expressed concerns that the court had given too much weight to the EPA’s air quality modeling, which led to the classification of two Texas counties as not meeting the 2010 SO2 standard of 75 parts per billion. The Trump administration had initially deemed Rusk and Panola Counties as “unclassifiable.” However, the Biden EPA, using computer modeling provided by the Sierra Club based on emissions from the Martin Lake coal plant, concluded these counties were in violation of the standards. Areas failing to meet standards must develop State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to reduce pollution, a requirement not applicable to “unclassifiable” areas.

Fifth Circuit Reasoning

In the new opinion, Judge Southwick directly addressed the EPA’s reliance on the Sierra Club’s modeling, stating, “We disagree that Sierra Club’s modeling, under these circumstances, provided a sufficient basis for EPA’s nonattainment designation.” He further clarified the court’s interpretation of the Clean Air Act: “We interpret [the Clean Air Act] as requiring EPA to designate an area as ‘unclassifiable’ if the available evidence does not allow for a meaningfully reliable determination of attainment or nonattainment. We also explained that EPA can know an area should be designated ‘unclassifiable’ when there is not much evidence, the competing evidence is too closely balanced, or the evidence is dubious.”

Applying this new test, the court found that “the evidence before EPA implicated all three categories — EPA relied solely on Sierra Club’s modeling that had conceded limitations and that was further called into question by conflicting monitoring data. Given this, EPA should have designated the areas as unclassifiable or rationally explained why an alternative designation was clear and not debatable.” The opinion concluded that “EPA seems to have forced a result on sparse and suspect evidence,” which violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and cannot withstand “searching review.”

The Loper Bright Factor

This revised opinion also reflects the impact of the Supreme Court’s 2024 ruling in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, which limited the judicial deference given to federal agencies’ interpretations of ambiguous laws, effectively overturning the Chevron doctrine. Industry groups had argued that the 5th Circuit’s initial deference to the EPA on technical matters was inconsistent with the Loper Bright ruling, which emphasizes courts’ independent interpretation of statutes.

While acknowledging the Loper Bright decision, Judge Southwick clarified that it does not eliminate all deference to agency fact-finding, noting the Supreme Court’s reliance on the APA’s provisions for reviewing factual findings. However, under its own independent review of the Clean Air Act, the 5th Circuit concluded that the law requires an “unclassifiable” designation when the available data doesn’t reliably support either attainment or nonattainment.

The court deemed two other arguments from the industry groups as no longer relevant. The first argument claimed the EPA failed to treat similar cases consistently by relying on the Sierra Club’s modeling in this instance but rejecting it in others. The court reasoned that since the EPA must re-evaluate the Texas plan, this argument is now moot. The second argument concerned the EPA’s assertion that it lacked the discretion to wait for more monitoring data. Given the time that has passed and the requirement for the EPA to reconsider the available data, the court also found this issue to be moot in the current context.

In her concurring opinion, Judge Elrod indicated ongoing concerns about the EPA’s refusal to consider the plant operator’s alternative computer model. However, she stated that under the circumstances, she would not fully disagree with the majority’s analysis on this point, noting that the EPA will be required to apply the court’s new interpretation of “unclassifiable” upon remand.

Key Takeaways

Reversal of prior holding: The Fifth Circuit had previously upheld the EPA’s disapproval of Texas’ SIP, citing noncompliance with modeling data standards. The new decision reverses that holding, finding that the EPA acted arbitrarily and capriciously in rejecting Texas’ approach.

State deference restored: The court emphasized the statutory deference owed to states under the CAA in designing SIPs. Texas’ alternative modeling approach, although nontraditional, was found to be reasonable within the framework of the law.

Impacts beyond Texas: This decision could ripple beyond Texas, potentially emboldening other states to challenge EPA SIP rejections. It also sets a precedent limiting federal intrusion in areas traditionally governed by state environmental agencies.

Industry implications: Power plants and refineries in sulfur dioxide nonattainment zones may now have a clearer regulatory pathway, potentially reducing compliance costs if states are granted wider latitude.

Next Steps

Regulated entities in Texas may want to actively monitor for TCEQ guidance updates reflecting the court’s decision and any revised SIP submissions.

Environmental counsel should assess how this decision affects ongoing or pending SIP disputes in other jurisdictions.

State regulators may reevaluate their strategies for balancing EPA expectations with localized air quality planning.

We anticipate that the EPA may seek either panel rehearing or en banc review, or appeal to the Supreme Court, though such steps are discretionary. Affected stakeholders should prepare for potential regulatory whiplash depending on further judicial developments.",https://www.mcglinchey.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/texas-1-e1714408388584.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 20:06:07.957076

The measure, which passed along largely party lines, aims to repeal a waiver granted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in December under former President Joe Biden. That waiver allowed California to require at least 80% of new vehicles sold by 2035 to be electric. The bill now heads to President Donald Trump for final approval.

If signed into law, the repeal would effectively halt California’s ability to set its own zero-emissions vehicle standards, a policy that has become a national benchmark adopted by states representing roughly one-third of the U.S. auto market.

Automakers, including General Motors, Toyota, and others, lobbied heavily against the EV sales mandate. Their industry group, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, applauded the Senate’s decision.

The Senate action follows a broader wave of federal efforts targeting EV-related regulations and incentives. On the same day, the U.S. House passed a bill to repeal the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, add a $250 annual fee on electric vehicles to support road maintenance, and eliminate emissions rules designed to push automakers toward electrification.

If upheld in court, these moves could allow automakers to postpone or cancel planned EV rollouts, citing challenges in demand and production capacity.

California’s current rules require 35% of new light-duty vehicles in model year 2026 to be zero-emission — a goal automakers say is unrealistic, especially in states where EV market share remains around 10% or lower.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CA-CARs-rule-bolcked--scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 17:14:14.019958

He said that during his time at the company, Musk was ""the product manager for the whole company.""
He added that having Musk more focused on Tesla would up its chances of beating rivals to ""the next big thing.""
Kahnert told BI that Musk and other Tesla leaders pushed to balance the ""scrappiness"" of innovating quickly with the need to convert Tesla's startup mentality into ""something that actually scales.""","Elon Musk is turning his attention back to Tesla — and apparently for the long haul. The question is whether Musk's rededication to Tesla is what the electric-car maker needs right now.

The billionaire said this week he was committed to leading Tesla for the next five years, adding he would only stop running it ""if I'm dead.""

Investors have applauded Musk's renewed commitment to Tesla, with the stock up more than 40% since he signaled he was stepping back from the Trump administration and its DOGE cost-cutting efforts.

Musk's DOGE work — and the ensuing vandalism and protests that targeted his company — had normally bullish analysts urging him to refocus on Tesla. Days after Musk announced he was stepping back from DOGE to do that, Tesla's chair denied a report it had explored replacing him as CEO.

Business Insider spoke with former employees at Musk's companies — three from Tesla, one from SpaceX — about what he's like as a business leader and what his renewed focus on Tesla means at a time when the company is suffering from falling sales, growing competition from rivals like BYD, and a critical robotaxi launch scheduled for next month.

Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.

The innovator in chief

Musk's importance to Tesla is undeniable.

Chris Walti, who led development of the Optimus humanoid robot before leaving Tesla in 2022 to found the robotics startup Mytra, said he saw how the company's flat management structure meant Musk had a larger influence over Tesla's product direction than most CEOs.

He said that during his time at the company, Musk was ""the product manager for the whole company."" ""That direction comes down, and then the engineers execute,"" he added.

Gene Berdichevsky, a former Tesla tech lead and the company's seventh employee, worked there when Musk was a major investor and board member. He said the billionaire brought a fanatical attention to detail even before he became CEO in 2008.

Berdichevsky recalled when the company was building the first prototype of its Roadster. ""We spent the afternoon after the board meeting driving it around the parking lot and getting into all the details,"" he said.

He added that having Musk more focused on Tesla would up its chances of beating rivals to ""the next big thing.""

""The revolutionary product isn't obvious when it first shows up. But I think that Elon's always pushing for something revolutionary, and you don't have to always be right, because when you are, you get really, really good outcomes,"" said Berdichevsky, who now runs the battery materials firm Sila Nanotechnologies.

Scrappiness vs scale

Tobias Kahnert, the CEO of the powertrain startup EFT Mobility, was a senior Tesla software engineer when the company was struggling to ramp up production of the Model 3.

Musk has said he slept on the factory floor as Tesla grappled with the ""production hell"" of scaling the mass-market EV.

Kahnert told BI that Musk and other Tesla leaders pushed to balance the ""scrappiness"" of innovating quickly with the need to convert Tesla's startup mentality into ""something that actually scales.""

""Even being there, you sometimes thought, 'OK, this isn't the normal way of how we would do it.' Then often it only turned out a lot later that this approach was the right one,"" he said.

Musk is famously demanding. Walti said he would get ""texts on Sunday at 3 a.m. and was expected to respond in 15 minutes.""

""That's not for everyone. Some people just get burned out,"" he said.

While Musk runs companies with a range of focuses, Tesla will benefit from him being an ""extremely good design engineer,"" said Quincy Lee, who worked at SpaceX for six years and helped roll out its Starlink satellite network.

""I've been in meetings with him, and I spent a lot of time with his executive staff,"" said Lee, who now runs the EV charging startup Electric Era.

""He's extremely good at physics, and he's really good at manufacturing. And of course, he's a good businessman, and he's able to pull all of that into a really strong set of skills,"" Lee told BI.

Difference maker or distraction?

Musk is known for pushing Tesla in ambitious new directions. But when the company's Q1 delivery figures showed it was in trouble, none of the analysts BI spoke to said it needed to take a big swing to make a comeback.

They said it should launch new models, improve its battery tech, and advertise more. The company has not launched a new vehicle since the Cybertruck in 2023, and sales of the electric pickup have underwhelmed.

Walti told BI Musk seemed ""kind of bored with just building good products that the market needs.""

""If it's not audacious, and if it's not against the grain, it feels like it doesn't personally interest him,"" he added.

""His connection with the customer 10 years ago was awesome. Elon had a really good sense of what the customer wanted. I don't know if that's the case anymore,"" Walti continued.

Tesla is racing to launch a robotaxi service in Austin next month, and Musk has said that Tesla's future lies in self-driving cars and Optimus.

Tesla has said it will also launch an affordable electric-car model this year, but has not provided details. Reuters reported in April that the new EV could be a stripped-down version of Tesla's Model Y.

Walti said that he'd like to see the company build more mass-market EVs, but added, ""Part of me is like, I don't know if Musk is the right person for the role. Not because he couldn't do a good job, but because I don't think he is genuinely excited about it.""

But Kahnert said that Musk had an ability to push through decisions that others wouldn't agree with, making him a ""differentiator"" that other carmakers lack.

He said it is hard to say whether that was what the company needed, adding it was, ""always hard, even while you are inside Tesla, to see and to acknowledge how much he benefits Tesla at times and how much he is distracting Tesla at times.""",https://i.insider.com/682e114168a292900801f05a?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-05-22 17:14:21.407747

The bill has climate implications beyond gutting clean energy incentives.","House Republicans worked to eliminate clean energy tax credits in a massive tax bill that they passed in a 215-214 vote early in the morning on Thursday, May 22, 2025. The new bill would sunset individual and business incentives that were created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, such as tax credits for electric vehicle purchases.

A large swath of the public supports such incentives. In a December 2024 survey, researchers at the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, the publisher of this site, found that 91% of liberal Democrats, 70% of moderate or conservative Democrats, 42% of liberal or moderate Republicans, and 28% of conservative Republicans support tax rebates for electric vehicles. A Yale Climate Connections analysis found that red states stood to benefit the most from the law’s incentives.

In August 2024, 18 Republican members of the House asked Speaker Mike Johnson to protect the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits. That group was led by Rep. Andrew Garbarino, a Republican from New York.

Still, President Donald Trump campaigned on the promise to “terminate” the federal government’s efforts to reduce climate-warming pollution, and on Thursday morning, his Republican colleagues in Congress largely went along with his wishes. Roll Call reported that Garbarino did not vote on the budget reconciliation bill. Two Republicans and all Democrats voted against it.

“This policy about-face couldn’t come at a worse time: Energy prices have surged 30% since 2020,” said Ari Matusiak, CEO of the nonprofit Rewiring America, in a statement. “Maintaining these tax credits gives American households an opportunity to offset these price hikes.”

Which Inflation Reduction Act incentives would end under the House bill?

When Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act, they intended the clean energy tax credits to last at least 10 years, through 2032. If the House version of the bill becomes law, the following tax credits would instead largely end on December 31, 2025.

Used clean vehicle credit andclean vehicle credit | Those who purchase a qualifying electric car are eligible for a tax credit (up to $4,000 back for a used car and $7,500 back for a new car)

Alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit | Individuals and businesses that install EV charging stations can get up to 30% (up to a maximum of $1,000 for individuals and $100,000 for businesses) off the cost of the project in the form of tax credits.

Energy efficient home improvement credit | Homeowners who make qualifying purchases like energy efficient windows, home energy audits, heat pumps, and more qualify for a tax credit worth 30% of the cost (up to $1,200 for energy-efficient property costs and certain energy-efficient home improvements, with limits on exterior doors ($250 per door and $500 total), exterior windows and skylights ($600) and home energy audits ($150). In addition, they can receive up to $2,000 per year for qualified heat pumps, water heaters, biomass stoves, or biomass boilers).

The residential clean energy credit | Individuals who purchase qualifying clean energy systems like solar panels, wind turbines, geothermal heat pumps, and battery storage for homes that they live in are eligible for a tax credit worth 30% of the costs.

Business clean energy incentives facing early termination

A number of incentives for businesses that invest in clean energy practices or industries will disappear if the Senate passes the budget reconciliation bill as-is. Since 2022, these incentives have boosted manufacturing and industries across the U.S.

Read: Clean energy generates major economic benefits, especially in red states

The tax credits businesses stand to lose at the end of 2025 if the Senate passes the bill:

Commercial clean vehicles credit | This credit gives businesses and tax-exempt organizations (like churches, universities, and other nonprofits) money back for purchasing a qualified vehicle. Businesses can get $7,500 back for a small vehicle or up to $40,000 for a large vehicle like a school bus or semitruck.

New energy-efficient home credit | Eligible contractors who build or reconstruct energy-efficient homes can get up to a $5,000 tax credit per house.

Clean hydrogen production credit | Businesses can receive a credit for each kilogram of qualified clean hydrogen produced by a taxpayer at a qualified clean hydrogen production facility.

Other incentives, including for nuclear power production and wind and solar manufacturing, will be phased out early. Projects must begin construction within 60 days of the bill becoming law and be finished by 2028 to qualify for incentives.

The bill has climate implications beyond gutting clean energy incentives. Climate journalist Emily Atkin reported that the bill is “basically a copy-paste of a secret oil industry wish-list.” Items in the bill include ending a tax on methane pollution and speeding up approval for new fossil fuel projects.

The bill also proposes major cuts to Medicaid, thus limiting access to health care for many vulnerable people, even as climate change increases health risks from weather disasters, insect-borne diseases, and extreme heat. And if passed, the bill would eliminate environmental and climate justice block grants.

The House Freedom Caucus (HFC) within the GOP conference appeared to be a key player in BBB talks, as Chairman Andy Harris of Maryland voted “present” while two other HFC members – Reps. Warren Davidson of Ohio and Thomas Massie of Kentucky voted “nay.”

The HFC was initially very concerned about the bill’s spending levels and how quickly – or not – some of the reduction measures would be implemented.

Ultimately, the HFC won out in terms of shifting Medicaid Work Requirements in the bill to take effect by 2027 rather than the originally-proposed 2029 deadline.

MIKE JOHNSON, DONALD TRUMP GET BIG BEAUTIFUL WIN AS BUDGET BILL PASSES HOUSE

On the other GOP flank, moderates and lawmakers from blue states had expressed concern over the State and Local Tax Deduction (SALT) – which helps Democrat-run state residents lessen their tax burden.

Originally, SALT was capped at $10,000, but the budget bill raised it to $30,000 for individuals earning up to $400,000.

Rep. Michael Lawler, R-N.Y., and other blue-state Republicans clashed with President Donald Trump on the matter – with the president retorting that he knew Lawler’s Rockland County district better than he did.

Lawler was seen as a winner in the budget bill’s passage, as his work – along with Long Island Republicans like Rep. Nick LaLota, secured the deduction for their constituents.

Another blue state Republican, Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York, was one of two nonvoting members – the other being Rep. David Schweikert, R-Ariz., according to the official roll.

Residents of such high-tax states as New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Maryland and California won out in that respect, ensuring that they would be able to continue to utilize SALT.

Outright winners in the bill were Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., — who saw some version of their original effort come to pass.

Trump also saw his sweeping middle- and upper-class tax cuts preserved from expiration, which in turn rendered debt-and-deficit hawks proverbial losers.

ADAM SCHIFF TELLS EPA’S LEE ZELDIN HE’LL CAUSE CANCER AFTER SHOUTFEST

Passage of the bill in the House comes as the national debt currently sits at $36,214,475,432,210.84, according to Fox Business’ National Debt Tracker. The federal deficit will grow by about $2 trillion over 10 years, according to reports, while the tax cuts’ preservation will reduce gross federal revenue.

But Medicaid and SNAP work requirements funding cuts are expected to lessen that blow.

Other winners included illegal immigration hawks, with the bill allocating billions for the Pentagon and for homeland security, including at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Energy interests also won out in the bill’s passage.

The American Petroleum Institute applauded the House for taking another step to “restore American energy dominance.”

“By preserving competitive tax policies, beginning to reverse the ‘methane fee,’ opening lease sales and advancing important progress on permitting, this historic legislation is a win for our nation’s energy future,” the group said in a statement.

Losers included Democratic leadership, as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., saw his caucus vote as a bloc, but with just shy of the partisan force necessary to block the bill.

One particularly upset “loser” in the bill’s passage was House Homeland Security Committee ranking member Bennie Thompson of Mississippi.

“You can’t shovel s—t and call it sugar,” Thompson fumed in a Thursday statement.

“This horrific bill is one of the most shameful grifts I have ever seen played on the American public,” he added.

Abortion providers also lost out via the bill, as it reportedly bans Medicaid disbursements to Planned Parenthood for one year, which could lead to decreased revenue for such organizations.

Opponents of SALT, including members of the HFC also essentially lost out, given the fact the deduction remained intact and was somewhat bolstered.

“This is not about electric vehicles,” Newsom said at a news conference while the Senate was still voting on the measures.
Senate Republicans established a narrow exception to the filibuster Wednesday to clear the way for the votes.
The California rules are stricter than a Biden-era rule that tightens emissions standards but does not require sales of electric vehicles.

The measure overturning the rule now goes to the White House, where Trump is expected to sign it, along with two other resolutions that would block California rules curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks. All three measures were approved by the Senate on Thursday and by the House earlier this month.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, and state air regulators say that what Congress is doing is illegal and they will sue to keep the rules in place.

“This is not about electric vehicles,” Newsom said at a news conference while the Senate was still voting on the measures. “This is about polluters being able to pollute more.”

California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state plans to sue over the way that Republicans passed the measures blocking the emissions rules. Senate Republicans established a narrow exception to the filibuster Wednesday to clear the way for the votes.

The GOP effort could have a profound impact on California’s longtime efforts to curb air pollution. California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends — especially because about a dozen states have already followed California’s lead. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.

Senate Democrats charged that Republicans are acting at the behest of the oil and gas industry and they say California should be able to set its own standards after obtaining waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency.

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the votes should “send a chill down the spine of legislators in every state.”

“What we have at stake is a state’s ability, it’s right to make its own laws and to protect its own citizens, without having this body overturn that right,” Schiff said.

Republicans say the phaseout of gas-powered cars, along with other waivers that California has obtained from the EPA, is costly for consumers and manufacturers, puts pressure on the nation’s energy grid and has become a de facto nationwide electric vehicle mandate.

“America cannot meet these impossible standards –- not next year, and not in 10 years,” said Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the second-ranking Republican.

Newsom announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles within 15 years as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.

The Biden administration approved the state’s waiver to implement the standards in December, a month before Trump returned to office. The California rules are stricter than a Biden-era rule that tightens emissions standards but does not require sales of electric vehicles.

Biden’s EPA said in announcing the decision that opponents of the California waivers did not meet their legal burden to show how either the EV rule or a separate measure on heavy-duty vehicles was inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.

Republicans have long criticized California’s waivers and have worked to find a way to overturn them. The Government Accountability Office said earlier this year that California’s policies are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows Congress to reject federal regulations under certain circumstances with a simple majority vote not subject to the filibuster. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that ruling, but Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., cleared the way for the votes anyway with a workaround that established a new Senate precedent.

Democrats fought those changes, which were the latest attempt to chip away at the Senate filibuster after both parties have used their majorities in the past two decades to lower the threshold for nominations. Democrats tried in 2022 to roll back the filibuster for legislation, as well, but were thwarted by members of their own caucus who disagreed with the effort.

Republicans have insisted that they would not try a similar move after regaining the majority this year. But Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the move to block California’s laws were a “point of no return” and called the Republicans “fair weather institutionalists.”

Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan was the only Democrat to support the measure to block the phaseout of gas-powered vehicles. She said in a statement after the vote that she has a “special responsibility to stand up for the more than one million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry.”

John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an auto industry association and lobby group, said there is a gap between the vehicles that car buyers are purchasing and the rules that would force a transition to electric vehicles.

“The fact is these EV sales mandates were never achievable,” Bozzella said.

However, the landscape of tax credits, subsidies, and hidden fees can often feel convoluted, leaving potential beneficiaries puzzled. This article seeks to shed light on the differences between the United States and Germany regarding EV-related tax credits and subsidies, examining who truly benefits and exploring the fine print that might influence your decisions.

The Landscape of Tax Credits in the US

In the United States, tax credits are often marketed as a windfall for those looking to invest in electric vehicles. For instance, the federal tax credit for electric vehicle buyers can amount to up to $7,500, allowing consumers to significantly reduce their tax liability. While this may seem straightforward, the reality can be quite complex.

Recent changes to tax credit structures complicate the situation further. Certain conditions, such as vehicle price limits and sourcing requirements for critical minerals, can impact eligibility. Moreover, additional fees may be incurred during the purchase process, such as for registration or local taxes, potentially offsetting the benefits of the tax credit.

The German Perspective: Subsidies Disappearing

Across the Atlantic, the German approach to incentivizing EV adoption has evolved dramatically. Initially, generous subsidies were available for electric vehicle buyers, aimed at rapidly increasing EV adoption rates. However, as the market matured, these subsidies have diminished in favor of more complex frameworks involving exemptions and additional regulations.

Currently, buyers in Germany may find themselves navigating a web of tax exemptions rather than straightforward subsidies. For example, there may be reduced registration fees for electric vehicles or exemptions from certain road taxes. However, the lack of clear communication about these changes has led to confusion among consumers, often resulting in unexpected costs or missed savings opportunities.

Exploring the Illusion of Incentives

Both the US and Germany present unique challenges for consumers trying to capitalize on tax incentives for electric vehicles. While substantial credit offerings appear to create opportunities for savings, hidden fees and intricate regulations can diminish their value.

In the US, a prospective buyer might focus on the headline-grabbing $7,500 tax credit, but fail to consider the additional costs associated with ownership, such as charging infrastructure and registration. This creates an “incentive illusion” wherein the initial benefit is overshadowed by ongoing expenses.

Likewise, in Germany, the once-simple subsidy system has evolved into an intricate web of exemptions and fine print. Consumers may mistakenly overlook crucial information regarding fees that can nullify any perceived savings from government incentives.

Who Truly Saves?

With the significant differences in the approach to tax credits and subsidies for electric vehicles between the US and Germany, one might wonder who genuinely benefits from these systems. In both countries, the key to maximizing savings lies in thorough research and an understanding of all factors involved in purchasing an EV.

Buyers in the US might need to evaluate their individual tax situations carefully, ensuring they qualify for the full credit and considering local fees that could impact total costs. Conversely, German consumers should be vigilant in understanding the shifts in subsidy structures, as the lack of transparent communication could lead to missed opportunities for savings.

Conclusion

The intricate nature of tax credits and subsidies in the US and Germany presents both opportunities and challenges for consumers. A deliberate approach, emphasizing informed decision-making and a keen eye for the fine print, can aid buyers in navigating these complexities. Ultimately, understanding the true impact of these incentives can make a substantial difference in determining the long-term financial feasibility of investing in electric vehicles, ensuring that potential buyers are not left grappling with unexpected costs or missing out on potential savings.",https://bunny-wp-pullzone-cmmd9bbmu3.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/unraveling-the-mystery-tax-credits-and-hidden-fees-in-the-us-and-germany.jpg,N,,2025-05-23 07:07:03.126742

In 2018, Vistra merged with Dynegy in a transformative $1.7 billion all-stock transaction, catapulting Vistra from a Texas-centric player to a nationwide, large, competitive power generator.
With the addition of Lotus’s gas fleet, Vistra is seeking to replicate that playbook, executing a seamless integration that delivers immediate financial and operational value.
We believe to meet this growing load, it will require increased power generation from not only new assets, but existing assets as well,” he said.
“This is consistent with what we shared last year on our Q1 results call, and now we see this dynamic playing out.” He also pointed to underutilized gas capacity as a near-term solution for meeting rising loads.","Vistra Corp. has agreed to acquire seven natural gas power plants totaling 2,557 MW from Lotus Infrastructure Partners for $1.9 billion, as part of a strategy to meet surging U.S. electricity demand and expand its competitive generation portfolio.

The deal, announced on May 15, is valued at approximately $743 per kilowatt and includes five combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plants and two combustion turbine (CT) peaking units located across PJM Interconnection (PJM), ISO New England (ISO-NE), New York Independent System Operator (NYISO), and California Independent System Operator (CAISO) markets. The largest asset is the 1,320-MW Fairless CCGT plant in Pennsylvania, followed by the 510-MW Manchester facility in Rhode Island and the 309-MW Garrison plant in Delaware. Two smaller CCGT plants—Beaver Falls (108 MW) and Syracuse (103 MW)—are situated in New York. The portfolio also includes the 158-MW Hazleton CT plant in Pennsylvania and the 49-MW Greenleaf CT facility in California.

“We are excited to announce another opportunistic expansion of our generation footprint in some of our key competitive markets,” said Vistra President and CEO Jim Burke. “We believe natural gas-fired generation will continue to play an ever-increasing role in the reliability, affordability, and flexibility of U.S. power grids for years to come. The addition of this attractive portfolio of combined cycle and peaking assets allows Vistra to serve growing power demand while exceeding our mid-teens levered return target.”

Burke emphasized the company’s track record of integrating large-scale acquisitions. “Successfully integrating fleets of generation assets is a core competency of our company. We look forward to closing the transaction and welcoming new team members to the Vistra family,” he said.

The company’s confidence stems from two recent, large-scale integrations that reshaped the company’s identity and operational platform. In 2018, Vistra merged with Dynegy in a transformative $1.7 billion all-stock transaction, catapulting Vistra from a Texas-centric player to a nationwide, large, competitive power generator. The deal expanded Vistra’s footprint into PJM, ISO-NE, NYISO, MISO, and CAISO, significantly increasing its scale and geographic reach across key deregulated markets. Operationally, the Dynegy integration enabled cost synergies, improved dispatch economics, and brought retail expertise into Vistra’s portfolio—all while maintaining a high standard of reliability.

In 2024, Vistra completed the acquisition of Energy Harbor, gaining more than 6,400 MW of zero-carbon baseload capacity through one of the nation’s largest competitive nuclear fleets. Executed under its “Vistra Vision” subsidiary, the transaction advanced the company’s strategic decarbonization goals and bolstered its clean energy credentials. It also expanded Vistra’s retail customer base and fortified its market position in key regulated and deregulated states. Industry analysts praised both integrations for their speed, operational continuity, and synergy realization.

With the addition of Lotus’s gas fleet, Vistra is seeking to replicate that playbook, executing a seamless integration that delivers immediate financial and operational value. The company will assume an existing term loan from Lotus, which is expected to cover approximately half of the $1.9 billion purchase price, and fund the remainder with cash on hand. The company has indicated that the assets will be quickly incorporated into its commercial optimization platform and managed through its centralized operations structure.

The deal comes as the U.S. power sector faces a historic surge in electricity demand, driven by the rapid expansion of data centers, artificial intelligence (AI) applications, and industrial reshoring. Several entities have projected record electricity usage in 2025 and 2026, with data centers alone accounting for a significant portion of the new load as hyperscalers ramp up capital investment to meet AI ambitions.

Earlier this month, NRG Energyunveiled a $12 billion deal to acquire LS Power’s 13-GW gas fleet and 6-GW virtual power plant platform, a move CEO Larry Coben said “meaningfully increases the number of sites available to support large loads in data centers.” In January, Constellation Energy announced the $26.6 billion purchase of Calpine Corp., gaining a vast gas-fired fleet to complement its nuclear base and adding $2 billion annually in projected free cash flow. Private equity has also joined the fray: Blackstone Energy Transition Partners acquired the 774-MW Potomac Energy Center in Loudoun County, Virginia, for $1 billion, citing its proximity to a major data center hub. Separately, Blackstone Infrastructure struck an $11.5 billion deal to acquire TXNM Energy, a regulated utility, reflecting rising investor appetite for grid modernization and stable earnings amid sectoral transformation.

Experts suggest the mergers and acquisitions surge is also being prompted by a growing urgency to secure dispatchable capacity in an increasingly constrained development environment. At the same time, rising inflation, supply chain bottlenecks, and lengthy permitting processes have made new builds more expensive and slower to execute. Activity is also being driven by policy shifts. The re-election of Donald Trump has signaled a policy environment more favorable to fossil fuels and natural gas infrastructure, even as renewables and nuclear continue to attract long-term investment.

During Vistra’s May 7 earnings call, Burke noted, “While there has been a bit of turbulence the last few months in the macro environment, the administration is prioritizing AI and attempting to find ways to unlock America’s leadership in this area. Hyperscalers have continued to affirm or even increase their capital expenditure (CapEx) investment levels with respect to data center investments. We believe to meet this growing load, it will require increased power generation from not only new assets, but existing assets as well,” he said.

The company’s strategic outlook is anchored in four priorities: maintaining a diversified generation portfolio, leveraging an integrated commercial-retail model, executing disciplined capital allocation, and expanding its clean energy footprint. Vistra has returned $6.3 billion to shareholders since 2021 and expects to return another $2 billion through 2026 via share repurchases and dividends.

Vistra is also advancing growth across multiple fronts. It holds queue positions for two peaking plants—Permian 1 and 2—at a cost of $1,000/kW, well below current market estimates. On the decarbonization side, the company is completing 600 MW of contracted solar at its Oak Hill and Pulaski sites and mobilizing its Newton battery project in Illinois. Nuclear uprate feasibility studies are also underway, potentially adding 10% to the fleet’s capacity by the early 2030s.

Burke emphasized that accelerating electricity demand—particularly from data centers—is both real and enduring. “We continue to believe the actual level of load growth will compound annually in a low to mid single digits range through 2030 across our markets,” he said. “This is consistent with what we shared last year on our Q1 results call, and now we see this dynamic playing out.”

He also pointed to underutilized gas capacity as a near-term solution for meeting rising loads. “Our large CCGT fleet with nearly 20 GW of total capacity, which currently operates at average utilization rates of approximately 55% to 60%, can run at substantially higher capacity factors, improving grid utilization and lowering unit costs for customers,” he said. “Our approximately two GW of simple cycle peakers have the quick start capabilities to ramp up as load materializes, further contributing to grid reliability,” he said.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/odessa-ector-powerplant-2017.png,N,,2025-05-22 18:12:47.710081

A marathon session that began Wednesday resulted in 1,100-plus page legislation that curbs billions of dollars in spending across food assistance, student loans, Medicaid and action to address climate change.

The bill, which now heads to the Senate, repeals or phases out more quickly clean energy tax credits passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act during former President Joe Biden’s term. Biden’s climate law has been considered monumental for the clean energy transition, but the House bill effectively renders moot much of the law’s incentives for renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Clean energy advocates said the bill walks back the largest government investment in clean energy in history.

“In a bid to cut taxes for billionaires and provide a grab bag of goodies to Big Oil, the majority in the House took a sledgehammer to clean energy tax credits and to the protection of our public lands,” said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“These credits are delivering billions of dollars in new investments in homegrown American energy — creating jobs, lowering energy costs and addressing the climate crisis that is fueling floods, fires and heat waves,” Goldfuss said.

President Donald Trump celebrated the bill’s passage, calling it “arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country.” Trump appealed to the Senate to pass the measure as soon as possible and send it to his desk.

The Senate hopes to wrap up its version by early July. At least four Republican senators, led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have urged continuation of energy tax credits, including support for traditional and renewable energy sources. Republican-led states and Congressional districts have benefited from billions of dollars in clean energy manufacturing investments spurred by the Biden-era subsidies.

Full-scale repeal of current credits “could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,” the senators said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.

“A wholesale repeal, or the termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing … job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy,” the senators wrote in the April 9 letter. The letter was also signed by GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas.

In a win for House moderates and some Western lawmakers, the House bill strips language that would have allowed the sale of hundreds of thousands acres of public lands in Utah and Nevada. Opponents argued the sales would have opened the door for more oil and gas drilling.

What was gutted in the bill

The House bill takes an axe to tax credits for rooftop solar installments and eliminates electric vehicle tax credits after 2025, with a one-year exception for EVs manufactured by automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 cars that qualified for the credit.

Credits for solar and electric vehicles, which reduce harmful emissions, help to boost demand for the technologies and drive down their cost.

House Republicans also tightened tax credit restrictions for projects associated with foreign entities, including China — an added blow to domestic clean energy expansion since China dominates much of the supply chain.

The bill slashes a three-year phase-down schedule previously proposed, and instead cuts off projects that don’t start construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage. Those projects would also have to start operating before 2029.

“This bill threatens the clean energy industry at a time when it’s proving to be not only economically beneficial — lowering costs, creating jobs and fueling local economies — but also essential to America’s energy future,” said Andrew Reagan, president of Clean Energy for America, an industry group.

The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry, applauded the bill as a step to “restore American energy dominance.”

“By preserving competitive tax policies, opening lease sales” for oil and gas drilling and advancing permitting reforms, the legislation “is a win for our nation’s energy future,” API President Mike Sommers said in a statement.

No sale of public lands

At the behest of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke and some other Republicans, lawmakers stripped a provision that would have sold or transferred about 460,000 acres (186,155 hectares) of federal land in Nevada and Utah to local governments or private entities.

The proposal exposed sharp divisions between Western Republicans who say the federal government controls too much of their states and others such as Zinke, a former Interior secretary in Trump’s first term whose state is protective of access to lands for hunting and recreation.

“At the heart of the matter is that public land that’s in the federal estate belongs to everybody,” Zinke told The Associated Press Thursday. “To suggest that you’re going to sell land to pay off the debt, I think that’s misguided and, quite frankly, disingenuous.”

The land sales had been inserted in the bill following a late-night committee vote, despite earlier pledges from Republican leaders that the sales were off the table.

Supporters said they would generate revenue and ease growth pressures by creating room for more and cheaper housing in booming Western cities such as Las Vegas, Reno, Nevada, and St. George, Utah. Those communities are hemmed in by federal property, which makes up 80% of the land in Nevada and 63% in Utah.

A spokesperson for Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, who sponsored the bid to sell federal lands in his state, said his office was “exploring all options” to make the transfers happen.

Housing advocates had cautioned federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing, and some of the parcels to be sold were far from developed areas.

Tracy Stone-Manning, president of the Wilderness Society and a former director of the Bureau of Land Management under Biden, said she appreciated Zinke’s work to prevent the public lands sale.

But she said the bill was still a “big giveaway” to the private sector. “By opening hundreds of millions of acres to drilling, mining and logging to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, this bill harms the tens of millions of people who like to hike, recreate or find solace in the outdoors,” she said.

Trump targets Biden’s climate policy

At the same time the bill slashes support for clean energy, it paves the way for oil, gas and coal.

Through the bill, natural gas pipeline developers can pay a $10 million fee for expedited permitting, and applicants for a potential liquefied natural gas export site can pay a $1 million fee to be deemed in the “public interest,” circumventing what is usually a regulatory challenge.

said that with this vote, Republicans ""violated the plain text of the Congressional Review Act, changed the Clean Air Act, and broke the filibuster.""
""The Congressional Review Act establishes a process around the filibuster, and the Senate is merely using the CRA as it was designed,"" says Baskt.
""To stress, the entire issue is narrow in scope and limited to CRA resolutions, which are distinct from regular legislative business.
While Senate Republicans might be within their legal rights to move forward with the CRA, it could start a dangerous precedent.","As the House of Representatives has been debating its one big, beautiful bill this week, the Senate has been considering a contentious vote of its own.

On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R–S.D.) said that the Senate would move forward with a vote over three Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions—a law that allows Congress to overturn federal rules with a simple majority—to rescind air pollution regulations in California.

Under the Clean Air Act, states are not allowed to set their own vehicle air pollution standards, except California, which must request a waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) before implementing new rules. While states can't set their own rules, they are allowed to adopt California's and, as of 2025, 17 states and the District of Columbia have done so.

In the final days of the Biden administration, the EPA granted California exemptions for a rule that requires 100 percent of car sales in the state to come from zero-emission vehicles by 2035 and two others that set strict emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles.

On Thursday, the Senate voted 51–44 to overturn these EPA waivers. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D–Mich.) was the only Democrat to vote with Republicans, but identical measures recently passed the House of Representatives with broader bipartisan support.

While Republican opposition to the waivers is not surprising, the use of the CRA has stoked a debate about Senate rules which could have implications for future policymaking.

In March, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) said these waivers were not rules ""for purposes of CRA"" and thus the CRA could not be used to overturn California's regulations. Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough, the nonpartisan official in charge of interpreting Senate rules, deferred to the GAO and ruled that these resolutions would need to pass with 60 votes.

Senate Republicans still moved forward and were able to pass the CRA resolutions with a simple majority by ""effectively kicking the question about what qualifies under the Congressional Review Act back to the Senate to determine,"" reports Politico.

The Senate has overruled the parliamentarian only a handful of times. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D–R.I.) said that with this vote, Republicans ""violated the plain text of the Congressional Review Act, changed the Clean Air Act, and broke the filibuster.""

Darren Baskt, director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), disagrees, telling Reason, ""This whole issue is about some Senators wanting to ban gas-powered cars. The procedural argument has been a desperate ploy to ensure California and its blue state allies can reshape the nation's car and truck industry.""

CEI recently sent a letter co-authored by Baskt to the Senate, which argued that the CRA is exempt from the filibuster and the parliamentarian was never authorized to interpret these resolutions in the first place.

""The Congressional Review Act establishes a process around the filibuster, and the Senate is merely using the CRA as it was designed,"" says Baskt. ""To stress, the entire issue is narrow in scope and limited to CRA resolutions, which are distinct from regular legislative business. It is not an attack on the filibuster, and if it were, I'd be objecting to the action.""

Philip Rossetti, a senior fellow at the R Street Institute, tells Reason that ""if the CRA can't be used on a waiver then Congress' role in overseeing regulations would be substantially lessened."" For instance, the executive branch could begin to issue waivers instead of federal rules to skirt CRA oversight.

While Senate Republicans might be within their legal rights to move forward with the CRA, it could start a dangerous precedent. In 2021, MacDonough nixed the Democrat's plan to include a federal minimum wage increase in the American Rescue Plan. If the parliamentarian's word doesn't matter (or matters less), what's to stop Democrats from attaching unrelated policies to large spending bills in the future?

There are also other ways to overturn California's waivers without using the CRA. The president could use the Administrative Procedures Act to claw back the waivers, which would take about a year to complete. But ""that's a big concern because affected industries need to know sooner rather than later if they need to make investments today to comply with future regulatory requirements,"" according to Rossetti.

Ultimately, the issue stems ""from the fact that the president has a lot of regulatory power, and Congress has very little oversight,"" says Rossetti. For instance, former President Joe Biden was able to ""implement almost two trillion dollars of regulatory costs without needing any buy-in from the public.""

While E.V. mandates are harmful and expensive, it's worth wondering if Republicans made the right decision overturning these waivers through the CRA and if the decision will hurt them in the future.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/05/ibpremiumthree965387-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 18:12:54.556592

President Donald Trump celebrated the bill’s passage, calling it “arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country.” Trump appealed to the Senate to pass the measure as soon as possible and send it to his desk.

The Senate hopes to wrap up its version by early July. At least four Republican senators, led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have urged continuation of energy tax credits, including support for traditional and renewable energy sources. Republican-led states and Congressional districts have benefited from billions of dollars in clean energy manufacturing investments spurred by the Biden-era subsidies.

Full-scale repeal of current credits ""could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,'' the senators said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.

""A wholesale repeal, or the termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing ... job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy,” the senators wrote in the April 9 letter. The letter was also signed by GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas.

In a win for House moderates and some Western lawmakers, the House bill strips language that would have allowed the sale of hundreds of thousands acres of public lands in Utah and Nevada. Opponents argued the sales would have opened the door for more oil and gas drilling.

The House bill takes an axe to tax credits for rooftop solar installments and eliminates electric vehicle tax credits after 2025, with a one-year exception for EVs manufactured by automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 cars that qualified for the credit.

Credits for solar and electric vehicles, which reduce harmful emissions, help to boost demand for the technologies and drive down their cost.

House Republicans also tightened tax credit restrictions for projects associated with foreign entities, including China — an added blow to domestic clean energy expansion since China dominates much of the supply chain.

The bill slashes a three-year phase-down schedule previously proposed, and instead cuts off projects that don’t start construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage. Those projects would also have to start operating before 2029.

“This bill threatens the clean energy industry at a time when it’s proving to be not only economically beneficial — lowering costs, creating jobs and fueling local economies — but also essential to America’s energy future,"" said Andrew Reagan, president of Clean Energy for America, an industry group.

The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry, applauded the bill as a step to “restore American energy dominance.”

“By preserving competitive tax policies, opening lease sales” for oil and gas drilling and advancing permitting reforms, the legislation “is a win for our nation’s energy future,” API President Mike Sommers said in a statement.

At the behest of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke and some other Republicans, lawmakers stripped a provision that would have sold or transferred about 460,000 acres (186,155 hectares) of federal land in Nevada and Utah to local governments or private entities.

The proposal exposed sharp divisions between Western Republicans who say the federal government controls too much of their states and others such as Zinke, a former Interior secretary in Trump's first term whose state is protective of access to lands for hunting and recreation.

“Once the land is sold, we will never get it back,” Zinke said after the provision’s removal. ”Public access, sportsmanship, grazing tourism — our entire Montanan way of life is connected to our public lands.”

The land sales had been inserted in the bill following a late-night committee vote, despite earlier pledges from Republican leaders that land sales were off the table.

Supporters said the sales would generate revenue and ease growth pressures by creating room for more and cheaper housing in booming Western cities such as Las Vegas, Reno, Nevada, and St. George, Utah. Those communities are hemmed in by federal property, which makes up 80% of the land in Nevada and 63% in Utah.

A spokesperson for Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, who sponsored the bid to sell federal lands in his state, said his office was “exploring all options” to make the transfers happen.

Housing advocates had cautioned federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing, and some of the parcels to be sold were far from developed areas.

Tracy Stone-Manning, president of the Wilderness Society and a former director of the Bureau of Land Management under Biden, said she appreciated Zinke’s work to prevent the public lands sale.

But she said the bill was still a “big giveaway” to the private sector. “By opening hundreds of millions of acres to drilling, mining and logging to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, this bill harms the tens of millions of people who like to hike, recreate or find solace in the outdoors,” she said.

At the same time the bill slashes support for clean energy, it paves the way for oil, gas and coal.

Through the bill, natural gas pipeline developers can pay a $10 million fee for expedited permitting, and applicants for a potential liquefied natural gas export site can pay a $1 million fee to be deemed in the “public interest,” circumventing what is usually a regulatory challenge.

CARB Chair Liane Randolph

California’s clean air authority

Since the Clean Air Act was adopted in 1970, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has granted California more than 100 waivers for its clean air and climate efforts. California has always demonstrated that its standards are feasible, and that manufacturers have enough lead time to develop the technology to meet them. It has done so for every waiver it has submitted.

Although California standards have dramatically improved air quality, the state’s conditions, including its geography and air pollution challenges, mean continued progress on reducing vehicle emissions is required to meet national air quality standards, state requirements, and address climate change. Five of the ten cities with the worst air pollution nationwide are in California. Ten million Californians in the San Joaquin Valley and Los Angeles air basins currently live under what is known as “severe nonattainment” conditions for ozone. People in these areas suffer unusually high rates of asthma and cardiopulmonary disease. Zero-emission vehicles are a critical part of the plan to protect Californians.

Waivers work

California’s vehicle rules have directly resulted in the development of major technological advances that address vehicle emissions. As a result, in terms of smog-forming pollution the average new car sold in California – and nationwide – is more than 99 percent cleaner than a car from the 1970s.

Stephen Smith and Chris Carnevale

The major Republican bill passed this morning by the U.S. House of Representatives aims to decimate the incentives and tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), our nation’s largest climate and clean energy legislation, passed in 2022 under the Biden Administration.

If this bill comes to fruition, it will raise everyone’s energy costs, take away hundreds of thousands of clean energy workers’ livelihoods, and leave the environment more polluted.

Here in the Southeast, our households, neighbors, friends, and family members will be particularly hard hit by the negative effects of this bill, as it repeals policies supporting major economic development projects in our region, while also leaving electric utilities unable to meet growing electricity demand.

The version of the bill passed this morning by the full House kept all of the same problems of the dangerous draft text that was unveiled last week, and was actually made WORSE last night. The bill will repeal the availability of tax credits for clean energy and transportation, which are the primary federal policy drivers of clean energy deployment. Their repeal will have harmful effects for consumers and businesses and will devastate some industries.

This version of the House bill is the worst case scenario for clean energy growth, environmental and human health protections, and United States competitiveness in the 21st century, with devastating impacts on middle class consumers. Worst of all, citizens across the Southeast will be hit hardest as this version of the bill destroys multiple growth industries in our region, including battery manufacturing, electric vehicles production, and renewable energy manufacturing and supply chain industries.

The bill runs counter to the administration’s stated goals of expanding energy production by undercutting the fastest-growing energy resources – solar, wind, and battery storage – while unrealistically expecting fossil fuels like coal and methane to meet all expanding load growth. It forces consumers to pay more for energy by destroying the energy efficiency tax credits and slowing the adoption of electric vehicles. Collectively, it cedes the technology playing field to China for advanced automobiles and clean energy while completely ignoring the science of climate disruption gripping our planet today.

Devastation for Southeast Industries

The House bill would devastate key areas of economic growth in the Southeast, putting a bullseye on vehicle and battery manufacturing, which has led to historic economic development trends in Southeastern states in recent years. Between North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, companies have announced more than $73 billion in private investment into the clean energy industry supply chain, and more than 92,000 new clean energy jobs, under the current tax credit laws, which the House Republicans’ bill seeks to undo.

The bill in Congress would repeal the tax credits that incentivize purchasing electric vehicles and repeal federal vehicle emissions standards, which, taken together, could reduce sales of electric vehicles by 40% in 2030. According to experts, this would put as much as 100% of planned construction and expansion of U.S. electric vehicle assembly and half of existing assembly capacity at risk of cancellation or closure, and could put 29-72% of battery cell manufacturing capacity currently operating or online by the end of 2025 at risk of closure, in addition to 100% of other planned facilities.

The Economic Impact on Consumers

One underappreciated fact of the clean energy tax credits in IRA is that they lower energy prices for all Americans, not just the taxpayers who claim the credits. When tax credits, like those in IRA, incentivize consumers to switch to electric vehicles, demand for gasoline decreases, and with lower demand comes lower prices at the pump for all non-electric drivers. The version of the new bill passed by the House would raise energy costs for consumers on multiple fronts: higher prices for electricity, higher gasoline prices at the pump, and higher prices for methane gas, often erroneously referred to as “natural” gas.

Southeast States Hit Hard

Multiple expert firms have modeled the impact of repealing clean energy and transportation tax credits, and they have unanimously found that household energy bills will increase. For example, one analysis found that average household energy costs would rise by $110-$180 in 2030, growing to $275-$400 by 2035.

Another study looked at state-by-state impacts and found that the Southeast would be very hard hit by rising energy costs, with North Carolinians, South Carolinians, and Tennesseans facing 10-15% higher prices for residential customers in 2026 and 2029, and commercial and industrial customers in these states paying 15-22% higher electricity prices in 2026 and 2029. Increased energy costs for businesses will make them less competitive globally.

The price for gasoline that consumers pay at the pump would increase by 5-15 cents per gallon.

Clearly, the implications for our region and the nation are dire. We’ll take a deeper dive in an upcoming article, but at this juncture, as the bill moves to the Senate, it’s also helpful to consider recent analysis discussed on the Heatmap News ‘Shift Key’ podcast with guests Robinson Meyer and Jesse Jenkins. Highlights include:

Economic Impact on Consumers

The Republican House bill would significantly increase energy costs for American households and businesses

Average household energy costs would rise by $110-$180 in 2030, growing to $275-$400 by 2035

The bill effectively functions as a “backdoor gas tax” – removing EV incentives increases gasoline demand and prices by an estimated $0.05-$0.15 per gallon

Industrial electricity rates would increase 7-12% by 2035, making American businesses less competitive globally

Devastating Impact on the Southeast’s “Battery Belt”

The bill would particularly harm the Southeast, where massive battery and EV manufacturing investments are concentrated in states like Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky

Jenkins specifically notes this “battery boom” is happening “in mostly Republican districts”

The 40% reduction in EV sales would make most planned battery manufacturing capacity “redundant” – meaning factories would be “idled or have to be repurposed to build internal combustion cars”

Investments in “new product lines and new assembly lines and robotics, and everything else would be wasted”

The region has also seen significant growth in manufacturing electricity demand as part of the broader “Battery Belt” development

This represents a particularly stark political irony – Republican-led legislation undermining major industrial investments in Republican states

Emissions and Climate Impact

Dismantling current policies would increase greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 500 million tons by 2030, rising to over 1 billion tons by 2035

This represents a massive reversal – US energy emissions are currently about 5 gigatons total

The bill would slow but not halt the energy transition, reverting the US to close to pre-IRA emission levels

Major increases come from repealing EPA power plant regulations and clean electricity tax credits

Power Sector Consequences

The bill threatens America’s ability to meet surging electricity demand, particularly from data centers and AI development

In the near term, emissions would actually increase as coal plants ramp up to meet demand that clean energy can no longer fill

Solar and wind deployment would collapse after initial momentum, unable to keep pace with demand growth

This creates higher electricity prices despite lower overall electricity usage

Manufacturing and Jobs Impact

The bill would “decimate” the emerging US battery manufacturing sector, making most planned capacity additions redundant

About 8 million fewer electric vehicles would be sold by 2030, undermining the entire EV supply chain

This contradicts the Trump administration’s goals of building domestic critical mineral capacity, as it destroys downstream demand

Policy Mechanisms

The House bill operates through several mechanisms:

Ending IRA tax credits by 2026 (much more aggressive than initially expected)

Repealing EPA emissions regulations on power plants, transportation, and methane

Including “poison pill” foreign entity of concern clauses that make remaining tax credits practically unusable

Rescinding unspent grant funding from federal agencies

In summary, the House bill is much more aggressive than many expected, approaching full repeal rather than surgical modifications. It comes at a particularly bad time as electricity demand is surging due to data centers, manufacturing, and electrification, and Republican moderates who might have opposed these cuts have largely failed to mount effective resistance.

Sales of electric cars have undergone a bumpy road, taking off in the post-pandemic years, but they did not increase last year.","This story was originally published by CalMatters. Sign up for their newsletters.

The U.S. Senate voted to block California’s landmark mandate phasing out gas-powered cars, dealing a substantial blow to the state’s aggressive transition to electric vehicles.

The decision to revoke a waiver that the Biden administration granted to California could upend the state’s decades-long efforts and authority to clean up its air pollution — the worst in the nation — and reduce greenhouse gases that cause climate change.

The move by the Senate — following a vote in the House last month — sets the stage for what is likely to become a high-stakes legal and political battle between California and the Trump administration.

Republicans in the Senate and some Democrats in the House who voted in favor of blocking California’s electric car mandate said it is costly and impractical, and prevents consumers from making their own choices.

But Democrats in the Senate who voted against it, including California’s Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff, said the tactic used by Senate Republicans is illegal and that the state’s mandate is vital to cleaning up polluted air.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has made the adoption of zero-emission cars and trucks a top priority, has denounced such a move by Congress, vowing that “zero-emission vehicles are here to stay.”

“The United States Senate has a choice: Cede American car-industry dominance to China and clog the lungs of our children, or follow decades of precedent and uphold the clean air policies that Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon fought so hard for,” Newsom said in a statement on Tuesday, before today’s vote.

Under California’s mandate, 35% of new 2026 model cars sold in the state must be zero-emissions, ramping up to 68% in 2030 and 100% in 2035. It builds on decades of tightening emissions standards for cars sold in the state.

California officials may now have to rely, at least temporarily, on voluntary efforts to clean up cars and trucks in order to meet federal health standards for smog and soot. For instance, state officials could offer financial incentives or rebates to persuade manufacturers to make electric cars and consumers to buy them. The state, however, faces a $12 billion deficit.

Culminating a late-night, marathon session on Wednesday, the Senate vote highlights the growing political division over electric vehicle and air pollution policy as concerns over cost, charging infrastructure and accessibility prevent many consumers from buying them, even in California, which leads the nation in sales.

For almost 60 years, California’s standards for vehicle emissions have been central to cleaning up the air, particularly in the smoggy Los Angeles basin and San Joaquin Valley. Vehicles are still the largest sources of smog-forming gases and fine particles of soot, which can cause respiratory disorders, heart attacks and other serious and deadly health problems.

Because of its highly polluted air and large population, Congress gave California the power to set its own, more stringent vehicle standards under the 1967 Clean Air Act. But before those standards can take effect, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency must grant the state a waiver for each one.

Before today, over the past six decades, the EPA and Congress have never blocked any of California’s dozens of car and truck rules. Eleven other states and Washington, D.C. have already adopted a version of California’s electric car mandate, according to the Air Resources Board.

“This is a major blow to the decades-long public health protections delivered under the Clean Air Act,” said Will Barrett, the American Lung Association’s senior director for nationwide clean air advocacy. “It is more important than ever that California and all other states…continue to cut tailpipe pollution through homegrown, health-protective policies.”

Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, of Wyoming, said Republicans reversed a highly unpopular move by the Biden administration.

“They were losers going out the door and they said ‘we’re coming after you — the American people — with our leftist dreams,’ ” Barrasso said. “This is a whole new meaning in California of fantasy land…America can’t meet these impossible standards, not next year, not in 10 years, and the American people don’t want to meet those standards.”

Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia, called California’s zero-emission standards for both cars and diesel trucks extreme and a threat to the economy. “I want to be clear, I have no problem with electric vehicles. Consumers should be able to purchase the vehicle of their choice, but I do have a big problem with electric vehicle mandates that replace the will of the consumer and the will of the government,” she said on the Senate floor on Wednesday night.

The Senators mostly voted along party lines. Fifty-one senators voted to rescind the electric car mandate waiver, while 44 voted against it. Some Democrats joined Republicans in voting for it.

“I wonder if any other member of this chamber grew up like I did, where on a pretty regular basis, we would be sent home from grade school because of the intensity and dangers of smog that settled over the San Fernando Valley, the city of Los Angeles,” Padilla said during a Senate session on Tuesday, ahead of the vote.

Schiff said on X Wednesday night that Senate Republicans are “doing the bidding of the oil industry,” after Trump promised to help them if they donated $1 billion to his campaign. He said it will mean “Californians and others will be breathing dirtier air, as will others around the country.”

The Senate today also plans to vote on blocking two other California rules approved by Biden’s EPA. One is the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, which was enacted in 2020 and requires manufacturers to meet ramped-up targets for zero-emission heavy and medium-duty trucks for 2024 through 2035. The other is a regulation reducing nitrogen oxides — a key ingredient of smog — emitted by trucks and buses.

President Donald Trump has long opposed California’s unique authority to set its own limits on emissions from cars and trucks. On his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order that aimed to eliminate federal and state electric car regulations and subsidies and restore “consumer choice in vehicles.”

“Trump and his congressional allies have declared war on the environment and this is the first major legislative battle,” said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign.

The Senate action follows an April 30 vote in the U.S. House of Representatives that shocked environmentalists because 35 Democrats joined Republicans to block California’s electric car mandate.

Included weretwo California House Democrats, both of whom represent districts in the smoggiest part of the state: Rep. Lou Correa of the 46th District in northern Orange County, and newly elected Rep. George Whitesides, from the 27th District in northern Los Angeles County.

“As Americans, we all want to do our part to protect the environment. As a lawmaker, my primary job is to listen to my neighbors and respect their choices to do what is best for their families and their circumstances. That means protecting consumers’ rights to drive whatever vehicle makes sense for them and their pocketbooks,” Correa said in an emailed statement.

California’s mandate has come under fire from auto dealerships and some car manufacturers who once were more in line with the goals of aggressively requiring more sales. Sales of electric cars have undergone a bumpy road, taking off in the post-pandemic years, but they did not increase last year.

About 23% of all new cars sold in California were zero emissions during the first three months of this year, compared to 25% for all of 2024 and 2023, mostly because of a drop in Tesla sales. Californians own 2.2 million zero-emission cars; about 150 models are now sold in the state, 40% more than a year ago, according to the California Energy Commission.

John Bozzella, CEO of an alliance of automakers, in a statement earlier this month welcomed the move by Congress, saying it would “prevent the inevitable jobs and manufacturing fallout from these unachievable regulations.” The Biden administration’s EPA granted the waivers for California’s electric car mandate and nitrogen oxides truck rule late last year, and for the zero-emission truck rule in March 2023. Under the federal Clean Air Act, the EPA can only legally reject a waiver if it’s “arbitrary or capricious,” unnecessary for addressing air pollution or technologically infeasible due to inadequate lead time.

“Congress voted decades ago to allow California, with the nation’s most smog-choked cities, to adopt stronger vehicle air pollution standards,” Becker, a clean-air advocate, said. “This vote will set a dangerous precedent of overturning state law protecting tens of millions in California and 11 other states that have adopted its strong clean air protections.”

The Senate’s votes could set up a legal challenge from the Newsom administration. Experts say the state could sue claiming improper use of the Congressional Review Act.

That law is meant to allow a new administration to revoke rules recently enacted by the previous administration. But it applies only to regulations, and experts say the waivers are not regulations so they cannot be revoked by Congress. In addition, the three waivers are already in effect, and one was issued more than two years ago, outside the time limits of the review act.

The U.S. Senate’s Parliamentarian and the Government Accountability Office said Congress cannot review Clean Air Act waivers. The Senate voted to evade their Parliamentarian’s ruling in a 51-46 party line, procedural decision on Wednesday night.

UCLA law professor Ann Carlson said Congress is violating its longstanding practices. She called the decision “totally norm-busting.”

“We’re just in a completely new territory,” she said. Congress “seems to be willing to use a statute that doesn’t apply, which is highly unusual. We’ve never seen this before.”

Carlson said by using the Congressional Review Act, lawmakers are seeking to move fast — bypassing the courts and a potential filibuster.

During the first Trump administration, California sued to reverse other actions that blocked air pollution regulations for cars.

Combined, the three regulations are designed to eliminate tons of soot and gases from cars and diesel trucks that pollute California’s air by requiring manufacturers to switch to cleaner vehicle technologies.

The stakes are high: The state still has some of the worst air pollution in the country, and failure to meet federal health standards for smog and soot could trigger economic penalties, including the loss of highway funding. People in low-income communities of color are particularly exposed to the unhealthiest air.

California is also considered a leader on climate policy, and zero-emission trucks and cars are critical to meeting its targets to phase out nearly all fossil fuels to achieve carbon-neutrality by 2045, which are mandated by state law.

Congress’ repeal of the rules follows an earlier blow to California’s efforts to clean the air. Days before Trump’s inauguration, the state Air Resources Board abandoned two of its groundbreaking standards because Trump’s EPA was unlikely to grant waivers for them.

One of them would have amped up California’s earlier zero-emission truck rule by ending the sale of new diesel trucks in 2036 and requiring large companies to convert their fleets to electric or hydrogen models by 2042.","https://www.desertsun.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/12/06/PPAS/76809657007-rivian-jtnp.jpg?crop=2999,1687,x0,y0&width=2999&height=1687&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-22 17:13:27.862297

A marathon session that began Wednesday resulted in 1,100-plus page legislation that curbs billions of dollars in spending across food assistance, student loans, Medicaid and action to address climate change.

The bill, which now heads to the Senate, repeals or phases out more quickly clean energy tax credits passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act during former President Joe Biden's term. Biden’s climate law has been considered monumental for the clean energy transition, but the House bill effectively renders moot much of the law's incentives for renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Clean energy advocates said the bill walks back the largest government investment in clean energy in history.

“In a bid to cut taxes for billionaires and provide a grab bag of goodies to Big Oil, the majority in the House took a sledgehammer to clean energy tax credits and to the protection of our public lands,"" said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“These credits are delivering billions of dollars in new investments in homegrown American energy -- creating jobs, lowering energy costs and addressing the climate crisis that is fueling floods, fires and heat waves,'' Goldfuss said.

President Donald Trump celebrated the bill’s passage, calling it “arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country.” Trump appealed to the Senate to pass the measure as soon as possible and send it to his desk.

The Senate hopes to wrap up its version by early July. At least four Republican senators, led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have urged continuation of energy tax credits, including support for traditional and renewable energy sources. Republican-led states and Congressional districts have benefited from billions of dollars in clean energy manufacturing investments spurred by the Biden-era subsidies.

Full-scale repeal of current credits ""could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,'' the senators said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.

""A wholesale repeal, or the termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing ... job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy,” the senators wrote in the April 9 letter. The letter was also signed by GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas.

In a win for House moderates and some Western lawmakers, the House bill strips language that would have allowed the sale of hundreds of thousands acres of public lands in Utah and Nevada. Opponents argued the sales would have opened the door for more oil and gas drilling.

What was gutted in the bill

The House bill takes an axe to tax credits for rooftop solar installments and eliminates electric vehicle tax credits after 2025, with a one-year exception for EVs manufactured by automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 cars that qualified for the credit.

Credits for solar and electric vehicles, which reduce harmful emissions, help to boost demand for the technologies and drive down their cost.

House Republicans also tightened tax credit restrictions for projects associated with foreign entities, including China — an added blow to domestic clean energy expansion since China dominates much of the supply chain.

The bill slashes a three-year phase-down schedule previously proposed, and instead cuts off projects that don’t start construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage. Those projects would also have to start operating before 2029.

“This bill threatens the clean energy industry at a time when it’s proving to be not only economically beneficial — lowering costs, creating jobs and fueling local economies — but also essential to America’s energy future,"" said Andrew Reagan, president of Clean Energy for America, an industry group.

The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry, applauded the bill as a step to “restore American energy dominance.”

“By preserving competitive tax policies, opening lease sales” for oil and gas drilling and advancing permitting reforms, the legislation “is a win for our nation’s energy future,” API President Mike Sommers said in a statement.

No sale of public lands

At the behest of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke and some other Republicans, lawmakers stripped a provision that would have sold or transferred about 460,000 acres (186,155 hectares) of federal land in Nevada and Utah to local governments or private entities.

The proposal exposed sharp divisions between Western Republicans who say the federal government controls too much of their states and others such as Zinke, a former Interior secretary in Trump’s first term whose state is protective of access to lands for hunting and recreation.

“Once the land is sold, we will never get it back,” Zinke said after the provision’s removal. ”Public access, sportsmanship, grazing tourism — our entire Montanan way of life is connected to our public lands.”

The land sales had been inserted in the bill following a late-night committee vote, despite earlier pledges from Republican leaders that land sales were off the table.

Supporters said the sales would generate revenue and ease growth pressures by creating room for more and cheaper housing in booming Western cities such as Las Vegas, Reno, Nevada, and St. George, Utah. Those communities are hemmed in by federal property, which makes up 80% of the land in Nevada and 63% in Utah.

A spokesperson for Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, who sponsored the bid to sell federal lands in his state, said his office was “exploring all options” to make the transfers happen.

Housing advocates had cautioned federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing, and some of the parcels to be sold were far from developed areas.

Tracy Stone-Manning, president of the Wilderness Society and a former director of the Bureau of Land Management under Biden, said she appreciated Zinke’s work to prevent the public lands sale.

But she said the bill was still a “big giveaway” to the private sector. “By opening hundreds of millions of acres to drilling, mining and logging to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, this bill harms the tens of millions of people who like to hike, recreate or find solace in the outdoors,” she said.

Trump targets Biden's climate policy

At the same time the bill slashes support for clean energy, it paves the way for oil, gas and coal.

Through the bill, natural gas pipeline developers can pay a $10 million fee for expedited permitting, and applicants for a potential liquefied natural gas export site can pay a $1 million fee to be deemed in the “public interest,” circumventing what is usually a regulatory challenge.

Battery aging myth vs practice

Tuesday, June 3

10:45 – 11:15 a.m.

Room C5 - Track B

Speaker: Markus Hackmann, Managing Director at P3 Automotive GmbH

Moderator: Tjark Ingber, Battery Materials Expert – Technical Consulting at P3 Automotive GmbH

Are electric vehicle batteries really destined to age rapidly and lose their value? This in-depth study dives into the data to break down common misconceptions about EV battery degradation. Despite claims of swift capacity loss, an analysis of over 7,000 EVs reveals a striking reality: most batteries tested retain more than 85% of their original capacity even after reaching an impressive 300,000 kilometers on the road, far outperforming common expectations.

Thanks to continuous advances in battery chemistry, thermal management, and battery management systems, manufacturers have gained confidence in the longevity of EV batteries and therefore extend warranties substantially. This reliability reassures consumers, knowing that their investment in an EV is solid and likely to sustain value long-term.

But the story doesn't end when the battery's life on the road ends. Many of these batteries retain significant residual value, finding second lives as stationary energy storage or being recycled to recover valuable materials like lithium and nickel. This not only provides economic benefits but also supports a sustainable lifecycle for critical resources, reinforcing consumer trust and driving the transition to electromobility with a clear focus on both performance and environmental impact.

Advancing battery technology: Standardizing battery management systems for cost efficiency & enhanced safety

Tuesday, June 3

11:45 a.m. – 12:15 p.m.

Room C5 - Track B

Speaker: Maik Naumann, Manager RD EE SW Engineering at Webasto Roof & Components SE

Moderator: Tjark Ingber, Battery Materials Expert – Technical Consulting at P3 Automotive GmbH

Battery Management Systems (BMS) are crucial for the safe and reliable operation of high-voltage battery systems and play a pivotal role in the evolving battery market. Despite the high-cost competitiveness of battery systems, BMS often receive less focus compared to battery cells. However, they offer significant cost-saving potential, as the primary cost driver is the volume of units produced rather than material costs.

This presentation will provide insights into the concept of a generic BMS and identify components that can be standardized. It will explore the potential benefits of standardization, including cost savings, improved efficiency, and enhanced safety. Additionally, it will discuss the challenges and considerations involved in developing a standardized BMS, such as ensuring compatibility with various battery chemistries and applications and meeting stringent safety and performance requirements.

Cell to chassis, a disruptive approach to e-mobility platform design

Tuesday, June 3

12:15 – 12:45 p.m.

Room C5 - Track B

Speaker: Tjark Ingber, Battery Materials Expert – Technical Consulting at P3 Automotive GmbH

Moderator: James Finn, Head of International Sales at CATL Intelligent Technology Shanghai

Recent developments in battery technology have led to a remarkable increase in cell-level reliability which in turn has facilitated the move to Cell to Chassis architectures in vehicle design. Structurally integrating the battery pack into the BIW leads to a more robust platform that can absorb significantly more impact energy leading to a simplified top hat design and facilitating the decoupling of the platform from the tophat.

This decoupling allows for the design of an independent platform that can be delivered as an autonomous rolling chassis with the tophat simply bolted on as the last stage of the production process. In this way, OEMs can focus on customer-facing design and functionality freeing them of the significant time and investment required for chassis design and integration. This will facilitate a complete rethinking of automotive design and manufacturing processes that have governed vehicle production for the last century.

Battery recycling at a crossroads: Trends, regulations & strategic insights

Signed into law in August 2022, Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) aimed to reduce government spending, lower prescription drug costs, and combat climate change.

Biden introduced tax breaks to stimulate energy-efficient homes and the adoption of electrified vehicles by American consumers.

Consumers were offered up to $7,500 on a new EV and up to $4,000 on an used one. The break was also available when leasing.

The act made the tax breaks available until 2032, however, the incentives will now be eliminated after 2025, according to the bill passed by the Republican majority (215 votes in favor and 214 against).

The proposal initially included a special rule to keep the $7,500 in place for new EVs until the end of 2026 — which was the rule applied before Biden’s term.

The U.S. has offered tax credits for electric vehicle buyers since 2008, when President George W. Bush introduced a $3,400 credit for the first 60,000 vehicles sold by each manufacturer.

In 2009, President Barack Obama expanded the credit to $7,500 and raised the cap to 200,000 vehicles per manufacturer.

After reaching that limit, the credit gradually phased out over six quarters until it ended entirely. As of 2021, Tesla and General Motors are the only reaching that ceiling

But that’s not the only bad stuff that’s in the bill – it will also inflate your electricity costs and threaten a recent boom in solar installations that is helping to grow domestic energy production and feed power-hungry data centers for AI.

The tax bill eliminates popular solar credits that had helped American homeowners to save money on their electricity bills. The main credit in question is the 30% residential solar tax credit, often known as the Investment Tax Credit (ITC).

The credit for homeowners would be sunset at the end of this year, if the bill passes the Senate. The commercial credit would sunset more slowly, but faster than the current law.

Advertisement - scroll for more content

Not only does the ITC help homeowners to save thousands of dollars while cutting their electricity bill, it also helps overall electricity costs, even for those who don’t have home solar.

The republican bill will raise your electricity costs

The Clean Energy Buyers Association released a report earlier this year showing how repealing solar credit would raise the average American’s electricity bills by 7% by 2026, the equivalent of a $110 yearly increase. And for businesses, electricity bills will increase by about 10% – higher costs that will then be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for consumer goods.

The credits had been helping to fuel a boom in US energy installations. In the first months of this year, 98% of new US electrical generation capacity came from wind and solar, as a result of how relatively quick and easy it is to install wind and solar projects as compared to other generation methods.

It’s particularly important for the US to add more electrical generation capacity at the moment, because two electricity-hungry industries are rapidly scaling up: AI and electric cars.

The US needs more electricity, and fast

Electric cars actually save energy compared to gas cars, and are 4-6x more efficient per unit energy. However, since gas cars aren’t fueled by electricity, energy delivery will have to shift away from gasoline and towards electrical distribution.

So more electrical generation capacity needs to be added in order to unlock the potential energy efficiency gains (and thus cost savings) from fleet electrification.

AI isn’t quite so energy-saving. An AI search uses 30x more energy than a traditional search, and gives less accurate results.

Despite this, US tech companies and the government consider it important to develop AI rapidly, in order to be on the cutting edge of technology.

So, there has been a massive expansion of data centers in the US, and those data centers need electricity to run. It has contributed to global shortages of electricity and increased rates.

Many of these data centers are trying to find green sources of energy in order to offset their wasteful overuse of resources, or at least to greenwash it. So companies have been installing solar, wind, or investigating the possibility of small modular nuclear reactors, which are highly energetic and also zero-carbon, but much more expensive than renewables.

And solar, as mentioned above, is a rapidly deployable electricity generation method, and can often leverage already underutilized space (i.e. rooftops) to help confront today’s energy challenges.

The bill surrenders both points to China

On both of these points, EVs and AI, cutting solar installations will only help to cede ground to China.

By disincentivizing a generation method that can be deployed rapidly, it will make it more difficult to electrify the US fleet, which means US manufacturers will probably spend less focus on EVs (more on that here).

This is not happening in China, which is rapidly transforming its car industry to confront the transition to EVs, and recently became the world’s largest auto exporter due to intransigence from the rest of the world’s auto industry (and through the West handing wins to China with ill-considered policy).

Also, China is rapidly advancing its own AI tech, which it says is more efficient than ours (but that may not be true). Making electricity more expensive for companies, and making it harder for companies to install the generation capacity they need to fuel their data centers, will only serve to choke the industry compared to its international competitors.

Solar industry responds

The Solar Energy Industry of America responded, with similar points that we’ve brought up here.

“If Congress does not change course, this legislation will upend an economic boom in this country that has delivered an historic American manufacturing renaissance, lower electric bills, hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs, and tens of billions of dollars of investments primarily to states that voted for President Trump.

“This unworkable legislation is willfully ignorant of the fact that deploying solar and storage is the only way the U.S. power grid can meet the demand of American consumers, businesses, and innovation. If this bill becomes law, America will effectively surrender the AI race to China and communities nationwide will face blackouts.

“But that’s not all: Americans’ electric bills will soar. Hundreds of factories will close. Hundreds of billions of dollars in local investments will vanish. Hundreds of thousands of people will lose their jobs. Families will lose the freedom to control their energy costs. And our electric grid will be destabilized.

“It’s not too late for Congress to get this right. The solar and storage industry is ready to get to work with the U.S. Senate on a more thoughtful and measured approach to unleashing true American energy dominance to create a brighter future for all Americans.”

-Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA)

This can change, if the Senate has a spine

From here, the tax bill goes on to the Senate, where it could be modified to take out these poison pills that inflate costs for Americans and threaten US competitiveness globally. The Senate is often though of as a more deliberative body which can tamp down on the excesses of the House, though it failed to do so in another republican anti-clean-air effort today.

If you have a republican Senator, it might be worth letting them know that you support lower electricity costs and keeping America competitive, and therefore that you oppose the anti-solar measures in this bill.

The argument could be made stronger in states that have received significant investment for battery plants, which are important for grid and home storage as backup for solar systems. Battery projects are particularly popular in states like Georgia, North Carolina, and others along the burgeoning US “battery belt”.

To make a comment,, you can find your Senator on Congress’ website, and then search for the contact form on your Senator’s website to get in contact with them.

Of course, if you have a Democratic Senator, it’s also worth letting them know that you oppose the tax bill, just in case a few of them decide to jump ranks and join the republicans in harming America. We certainly hope they don’t, and are encouraged by the fact that every Democrat in the House made the right decision here, but anything could happen.

If the rooftop solar credit is going away, it means you could have only until the end of this year to install rooftop solar on your home, before republicans raise the cost of doing so by an average of ~$10,000. So if you want to go solar, get started now, because these things take time and the system needs to be active before you file for the credit.

To make sure you find a trusted, reliable solar installer near you that offers competitive pricing, check out EnergySage, a free service that makes it easy for you to go solar. It has hundreds of pre-vetted solar installers competing for your business, ensuring you get high-quality solutions and save 20-30% compared to going it alone.

The measure overturning the rule now goes to the White House, where Trump is expected to sign it, along with two other resolutions that would block California rules curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks. All three measures were approved by the Senate on Thursday and by the House earlier this month.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, and state air regulators say that what Congress is doing is illegal and they will sue to keep the rules in place.

“This is not about electric vehicles,” Newsom said at a news conference while the Senate was still voting on the measures. “This is about polluters being able to pollute more.”

California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state plans to sue over the way that Republicans passed the measures blocking the emissions rules. Senate Republicans established a narrow exception to the filibuster Wednesday to clear the way for the votes.

The GOP effort could have a profound impact on California’s longtime efforts to curb air pollution. California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends — especially because about a dozen states have already followed California’s lead. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.

Senate Democrats charged that Republicans are acting at the behest of the oil and gas industry and they say California should be able to set its own standards after obtaining waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency.

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the votes should “send a chill down the spine of legislators in every state.”

“What we have at stake is a state’s ability, it’s right to make its own laws and to protect its own citizens, without having this body overturn that right,” Schiff said.

Republicans say the phaseout of gas-powered cars, along with other waivers that California has obtained from the EPA, is costly for consumers and manufacturers, puts pressure on the nation’s energy grid and has become a de facto nationwide electric vehicle mandate.

“America cannot meet these impossible standards –- not next year, and not in 10 years,” said Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the second-ranking Republican.

Newsom announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles within 15 years as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.

The Biden administration approved the state’s waiver to implement the standards in December, a month before Trump returned to office. The California rules are stricter than a Biden-era rule that tightens emissions standards but does not require sales of electric vehicles.

Biden’s EPA said in announcing the decision that opponents of the California waivers did not meet their legal burden to show how either the EV rule or a separate measure on heavy-duty vehicles was inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.

Republicans have long criticized California’s waivers and have worked to find a way to overturn them. The Government Accountability Office said earlier this year that California’s policies are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows Congress to reject federal regulations under certain circumstances with a simple majority vote not subject to the filibuster. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that ruling, but Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., cleared the way for the votes anyway with a workaround that established a new Senate precedent.

Democrats fought those changes, which were the latest attempt to chip away at the Senate filibuster after both parties have used their majorities in the past two decades to lower the threshold for nominations. Democrats tried in 2022 to roll back the filibuster for legislation, as well, but were thwarted by members of their own caucus who disagreed with the effort.

Republicans have insisted that they would not try a similar move after regaining the majority this year. But Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the move to block California’s laws were a “point of no return” and called the Republicans “fair weather institutionalists.”

Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan was the only Democrat to support the measure to block the phaseout of gas-powered vehicles. She said in a statement after the vote that she has a “special responsibility to stand up for the more than one million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry.”

John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an auto industry association and lobby group, said there is a gap between the vehicles that car buyers are purchasing and the rules that would force a transition to electric vehicles.

“The fact is these EV sales mandates were never achievable,” Bozzella said.

""The waivers in question allow California to implement a stringent electric vehicle mandate, which - given California's size and the fact that a number of other states have signed on to California's mandate - would end up not just affecting the state of California, but the whole country,"" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., before the vote.

Newsom, a Democrat, announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles within 15 years as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.

Biden's EPA said in announcing the decision that opponents of the California waivers did not meet their legal burden to show how either the EV rule or a separate measure on heavy-duty vehicles was inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.

Through a series of votes on Wednesday, Republicans set a new precedent for the Senate to reject the state EPA waivers with a simple majority vote, as opposed to the 60 vote threshold on legislation that is subject to a filibuster. The votes were a workaround that enabled them to hold the votes after the Senate parliamentarian agreed with the Government Accountability Office that California's policies are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows Congress to reject federal regulations under certain circumstances.

The US was already woefully behind China and other developed nations in terms of clean energy investments.","Once Donald Trump won office for a second time, the writing was on the wall.

Trump ran on many messages, most of them confusing and contradictory, but one of his loudest and clearest messages was to end President Joe Biden’s “EV mandate.” It made no difference there never was a mandate, just a series of policies designed to encourage car companies to make more zero-emission vehicles and consumers to buy them — Trump was gunning for EVs.

As soon as he took office, he started signing a flurry of executive orders laying out exactly how he would start dismantling Biden’s legacy. And chief among them was an order to eliminate all of his predecessor’s electric vehicle policies, including weakening Biden’s tailpipe pollution rules.

But the orders were never going to be enough. It would take an act of Congress to unwind all the many tax credits and incentives designed to spur the sale of EVs by making them more affordable to a broader swath of the population.

So today, Congressional Republicans got to work. The House passed a bill to end the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits for clean energy, including the $7,500 EV tax credit. And the Senate voted — some would say “illegally” — to revoke California’s ability to set its own tailpipe emission rules, which are also followed by 17 other states and the District of Columbia.

Under the House proposal, most automakers would lose the EV tax credit right away — although those manufacturers who have yet to sell 200,000 EVs would get to keep the credit until the end of 2026. The bill would also eliminate the $4,000 tax credit for used EV purchases. And it would kill incentives for companies building solar, wind, and battery storage projects.

But wait, there’s more! If you already own an EV, the House bill would levy an annual $250 tax on your vehicle to help pay for road and infrastructure improvements. (Hybrid owners would have to cough up $100.) Internal combustion vehicle owners typically pay for road repairs through the federal gas tax of 18.4 cents per gallon — which, it should be noted, has remained exactly the same since October 1, 1993.

The House passed a bill to end the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits for clean energy, including the $7,500 EV tax credit

I understand the need for EV owners to pay for road repairs, but a flat tax is widely viewed by many smart people as the most regressive way to do it. The gas tax works because its a usage fee: the more you drive, the more gas you use, the more you pay into the Highway Trust Fund for repairs and improvements. A flat tax, which charges everyone the same regardless of usage, is much less desirable from a public benefits perspective.

A lot can still change as the bill now heads to the Senate for reconciliation. But it’s not looking good for our intrepid EV industry. Some lobbyists and advocates were holding out hope that Republicans with major clean energy projects in their district would push back against the attempt to kneecap the IRA. But as Heatmaps’ Matthew Zeitlin notes, the clean energy supporters were always the weakest faction amid a fractious GOP.

Where it goes from here is probably pretty bleak. The US was already woefully behind China and other developed nations in terms of clean energy investments. And now its likely to fall even further behind, perhaps permanently so. Major projects that were expected to take advantage of the federal incentives are now likely to die on the vine. That means fewer clean energy jobs, most of which were to be located in Republican-leaning districts.

It’s really a baffling political decision. Republicans are determined to cut off their own nose to spite their face, all because Trump ran on a false message of ending an EV mandate that never existed. In fact, Biden’s tailpipe emission rules were written in a way that acknowledges how passenger electric cars, specifically Tesla, have distorted the market thanks to their runaway success. So they crafted the rules so that passenger cars wouldn’t have to increase their miles-per-gallon numbers as rapidly as light trucks, as noted by Jalopnik’s Matthew Debord.

Whatever happens, the EV industry will persist. Automakers have poured billions of dollars into the shift to electric power, and they don’t want to let those investments go to waste. The focus should now be on the development of truly affordable EVs that can help spur mass adoption, as well as local infrastructure improvements to encourage more cycling and walking. But without hugely influential incentives from the federal government, it will be an uphill battle — spewing pollution and worsening the environment along the way.",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24533944/STK437_Electric_Vehicle_charge_EV.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-05-22 17:12:33.615987

The bill narrowly passed the House with opposition from all Democrats and two Republicans, and now heads to the Senate for consideration.

Key provisions of the bill include cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, stricter immigration enforcement, and adjustments to clean energy tax credits.

The bill faces further hurdles in the Senate and must be finalized before the August debt ceiling deadline.

Californians could see major changes to Medi-Cal, food stamps, border security, and taxes under a sweeping Republican bill that passed the U.S. House early on May 22.

The proposal, which President Donald Trump has dubbed the ""big, beautiful bill,"" would enact Trump's major campaign promises like eliminating taxes on workers' tips and overtime, and is likely to be one of the most significant pieces of legislation that will be passed during his second term in the Oval Office.

It passed the House 215-214, with all Democrats and two Republicans — Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio — voting against it after a marathon all-night debate. Republicans had only three 'no' votes to spare in the closely-divided House.

The ""big, beautiful bill"" still has a long way to go before it becomes law.

The bill will next go to the Senate, which has already made clear that it plans to make changes. If that happens, the two chambers would still have to hash out the details capable of winning majority votes before they can send it to Trump's desk to be signed into law.

Big Beautiful Bill tax cuts to have acute impacts on Californians

Trump's proposal will directly affect Californians in lower tax brackets.

""Here's the truth,"" California Rep. Nancy Pelosi posted on X, ""they’re slashing Medicaid and ripping health care from those who need it most to fund tax breaks for billionaires who need it least.""

She and many others who oppose the ""big, beautiful bill"" call it ""Robin Hood in reverse.""

CalFresh benefits

The bill would cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by 30%, CNBC reported, reducing the program's federal funding by about $300 billion through 2034.

SNAP provides food assistance to more than 2.8 million households in California under the CalFresh program, meaning proposed cuts in the ""big, beautiful bill"" would significantly impact lower-income Californians who rely on CalFresh, including 1.8 million children.

Food assistance eligibility will also be limited to citizens and lawful permanent residents under Trump's proposal, and prevent future presidential administrations from increasing benefits without Congressional approval.

Cuts to Medi-Cal

The House-passed resolution would cut nearly $700 billion from Medicaid.

California receives a staggering $134.9 billion in federal aid for Medi-Cal healthcare services, of which 15 million low-income Californians utilize, including 41% of children, 49% of adults with disabilities, and 41% of people living in nursing homes.

The legislation would bar Medi-Cal from funding services at clinics that also perform abortions, such as Planned Parenthood, USA Today reported, and discourage states from using their own funds to provide coverage to undocumented children.

Riverside Rep. Paul Ruiz said California will either need to raise taxes or shift funds from other programs to supplement the cuts to Medi-Cal, greatly impacting the state's fiscal budget.

Clean energy tax credits

In last-minute changes to the bill, Republicans also sped up the timelines for phasing out key clean energy tax credits.

The president is outspoken in opposing electric vehicle infrastructure funding, which has resulted in a multistate lawsuit spearheaded by Gov. Newsom, accusing President Trump of ""unlawfully"" withholding funds that would reduce toxic pollution, expand access to clean vehicles, and create thousands of green jobs.

The ""big, beautiful bill"" would end tax credits that help lower the cost of electric vehicles, energy-efficient appliances, rooftop solar, and insulation, CNN reported.

According to data from the California Energy Commission, the sales of new zero-emission vehicles have soared 1022% over the past 10 years, with one in four new cars sold in California being zero-emission.

Included in the proposed bill is a cut to California's incentivized grants and rebates for low-income Californians to purchase electric vehicles through the Clean Cars 4 All program, including up to $7,500 in federal tax credit for purchasing zero-emission vehicles.

Tougher illegal immigration crack-downs

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, there were roughly 2.6 million undocumented immigrants in California in 2022.

The White House states that the ""big, beautiful bill"" will empower Immigration and Customs Enforcement to deport the ""millions of illegal immigrants that entered under Joe Biden.""

The big bill included the $40,000 SALT reduction bill that raises both the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000 for taxpayers making more than $500,000 a year.

SALT refers to the ability to deduct taxes paid to state and local governments from an individual’s federal tax bill. This amount was previously capped at $10,000 by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but would now be increased under the ""big, beautiful bill.""

The increased cap may prove beneficial to Californians struggling with higher costs of housing, USA Today reports. The Property tax relief may be one means of easing the burden, even as some observers say taxpayers across the country shouldn’t be on the hook for decisions made in other states and localities.

The clock is ticking: Treasury Sec. Scott Bessent warned that the U.S. is likely to hit the debt ceiling in August and urged lawmakers to finalize changes to the ""big, beautiful bill,"" which raises the debt ceiling by $4 trillion, before leaving for their summer recess at the end of July.

One of those is Capture Automotive, which a decade ago began supplying vehicles to clients that wanted to inspect new models for a few months at a time. Part of The Tamaroff Group in Southfield, which has been selling vehicles of multiple brands in metro Detroit since 1969, Capture Automotive was a classic case of listening and reacting to the needs of the marketplace.

“We were doing this for about a year when I asked this guy to explain the business model to me,” says Eric Frehsée, president of The Tamaroff Group. “It seemed like a good business, so we gave it a try.”

Capture Automotive started with one employee working out of the back of Tamaroff’s Nissan showroom and has since expanded to 12 employees. Today, the team deals with thousands of vehicles each year and operates out of a 10,000-square-foot former dealership service center on the Tamaroff lot.

The building houses 6,000 square feet of fleet garage space, a 1,500-square-foot studio, and 2,500 square feet of office space.

“I love the brands we represent (through the Tamaroff dealerships), but I love all cars, and I love technology,” Frehsée says. “For me, starting this business was an opportunity to have the ability to touch, feel, and smell every single product that’s out there.”

According to Frehsée, the Capture Automotive business has changed quite a bit in recent years.

“When we started, there was some heavy-duty benchmarking on transmissions, and engines and suspensions,” he says. “Now, it’s more technology they’re testing.

“Let’s say they’re benchmarking the time it takes for the navigation screen to turn on and populate when you hit the start button on a new vehicle. They might want to test 10 different vehicles, benchmark all that data, then try to beat that.”

The push toward electric vehicles, which might be changing with the new presidential administration, has caused the biggest change in Capture Automotive’s operations.

“The last three years were focused on EV,” Freh-sée explains. “It used to be 90 percent ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles. Now, it’s 90 percent EVs as all of the OEMs are moving toward BEVs (battery electric vehicles) and hybrids.”

Looking ahead, what does the future hold for Capture Automotive?

“OEMs and suppliers are always going to need cars,” Frehsée says. “The market is evolving. Consumers are evolving. Technology in cars is very important to consumers. All these safety features (including) autonomous driving and adaptive cruise control are still being integrated into vehicles.”

Frehsée says automotive timelines are evolving faster than ever. Life cycles used to be five or six years. Now, minor model changes turn into major model changes in a much shorter period of time.

“The future depends on how the market moves or doesn’t move toward BEVs,” he says. “Either way, we’ll continue to see more testing.”",https://cdn.dbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2025/05/IMG_9108.cx_.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 16:10:53.644283

SALT refers to the ability to deduct taxes paid to state and local governments from an individual’s federal tax bill.","The U.S. House passed a sweeping Republican bill, backed by President Trump, that proposes significant changes to taxes, Medi-Cal, food stamps, and border security.

The bill narrowly passed the House with opposition from all Democrats and two Republicans, and now heads to the Senate for consideration.

Key provisions of the bill include cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, stricter immigration enforcement, and adjustments to clean energy tax credits.

The bill faces further hurdles in the Senate and must be finalized before the August debt ceiling deadline.

Californians could see major changes to Medi-Cal, food stamps, border security, and taxes under a sweeping Republican bill that passed the U.S. House early on May 22.

The proposal, which President Donald Trump has dubbed the ""big, beautiful bill,"" would enact Trump's major campaign promises like eliminating taxes on workers' tips and overtime, and is likely to be one of the most significant pieces of legislation that will be passed during his second term in the Oval Office.

It passed the House 215-214, with all Democrats and two Republicans — Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio — voting against it after a marathon all-night debate. Republicans had only three 'no' votes to spare in the closely-divided House.

The ""big, beautiful bill"" still has a long way to go before it becomes law.

The bill will next go to the Senate, which has already made clear that it plans to make changes. If that happens, the two chambers would still have to hash out the details capable of winning majority votes before they can send it to Trump's desk to be signed into law.

Big Beautiful Bill tax cuts to have acute impacts on Californians

Trump's proposal will directly affect Californians in lower tax brackets.

""Here's the truth,"" California Rep. Nancy Pelosi posted on X, ""they’re slashing Medicaid and ripping health care from those who need it most to fund tax breaks for billionaires who need it least.""

She and many others who oppose the ""big, beautiful bill"" call it ""Robin Hood in reverse.""

CalFresh benefits

The bill would cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by 30%, CNBC reported, reducing the program's federal funding by about $300 billion through 2034.

SNAP provides food assistance to more than 2.8 million households in California under the CalFresh program, meaning proposed cuts in the ""big, beautiful bill"" would significantly impact lower-income Californians who rely on CalFresh, including 1.8 million children.

Food assistance eligibility will also be limited to citizens and lawful permanent residents under Trump's proposal, and prevent future presidential administrations from increasing benefits without Congressional approval.

Cuts to Medi-Cal

The House-passed resolution would cut nearly $700 billion from Medicaid.

California receives a staggering $134.9 billion in federal aid for Medi-Cal healthcare services, of which 15 million low-income Californians utilize, including 41% of children, 49% of adults with disabilities, and 41% of people living in nursing homes.

The legislation would bar Medi-Cal from funding services at clinics that also perform abortions, such as Planned Parenthood, USA Today reported, and discourage states from using their own funds to provide coverage to undocumented children.

Riverside Rep. Paul Ruiz said California will either need to raise taxes or shift funds from other programs to supplement the cuts to Medi-Cal, greatly impacting the state's fiscal budget.

Clean energy tax credits

In last-minute changes to the bill, Republicans also sped up the timelines for phasing out key clean energy tax credits.

The president is outspoken in opposing electric vehicle infrastructure funding, which has resulted in a multistate lawsuit spearheaded by Gov. Newsom, accusing President Trump of ""unlawfully"" withholding funds that would reduce toxic pollution, expand access to clean vehicles, and create thousands of green jobs.

The ""big, beautiful bill"" would end tax credits that help lower the cost of electric vehicles, energy-efficient appliances, rooftop solar, and insulation, CNN reported.

According to data from the California Energy Commission, the sales of new zero-emission vehicles have soared 1022% over the past 10 years, with one in four new cars sold in California being zero-emission.

Included in the proposed bill is a cut to California's incentivized grants and rebates for low-income Californians to purchase electric vehicles through the Clean Cars 4 All program, including up to $7,500 in federal tax credit for purchasing zero-emission vehicles.

Tougher illegal immigration crack-downs

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, there were roughly 2.6 million undocumented immigrants in California in 2022.

The White House states that the ""big, beautiful bill"" will empower Immigration and Customs Enforcement to deport the ""millions of illegal immigrants that entered under Joe Biden."" It will also ensure illegal immigrants do not receive food stamps or Medicaid, tax money undocumented immigrants send out of the country, and will ""permanently secure the border.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The House budget bill that narrowly passed in an early morning vote on Thursday would effectively put the brakes on a clean energy production boom in the United States spurred by subsidies enacted in 2022.

Republican lawmakers’ “one big beautiful bill” to carry out President Donald Trump’s plan to cut taxes and boost spending on the military and border enforcement would end Biden-era tax credits for clean energy projects years sooner than planned in an earlier draft, rendering them unusable for most companies.

“We and many others had expected the first bill to be the worst version: This was wrong,” Roth Capital clean energy analyst Philip Shen wrote in a note to clients.

Shares of clean energy companies tanked following the vote. Project developers and manufacturers that benefit from the subsidies said the rollback would shutter factories, kill jobs and increase electricity costs for U.S. households.

“If Congress does not change course, this legislation will upend an economic boom in this country that has delivered an historic American manufacturing renaissance, lower electric bills, hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs, and tens of billions of dollars of investments primarily to states that voted for President Trump,” Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a statement.

Energy analysts at the Rhodium Group said their preliminary review of the bill found the changes could raise household energy costs by 7%.

Solar, wind and battery storage are expected to account for 93% of new U.S. electric capacity this year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The American Petroleum Institute praised the bill for “preserving competitive tax policies,” as well as opening up more oil lease sales and eliminating Biden administration policies such as its fee on methane emissions for the oil and gas industry.

REPUBLICAN DISTRICTS BENEFIT

Clean energy groups voiced dismay that the budget proposal passed with the support of over two dozen Republican representatives who had urged House leaders to preserve key Inflation Reduction Act provisions because their districts have benefited from clean energy and manufacturing investments.

As of August 2024, more than half of all IRA-backed projects were in Republican House districts, according to an analysis last year by E2, a firm that advocates for pro-environment economic policies.

“Despite many reassurances that Members support domestic manufacturing, a vote for this bill was a vote to close U.S. factories and concede manufacturing jobs of the most important energy resource of the 21st century to China,” said Michael Carr, executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers For America Coalition.

The changes to a committee proposal from last week would advance by three years an end-date for the use of clean electricity tax credits for wind, solar and battery storage projects to 2028 and require projects to begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage, according to a summary.

It would also have a chilling effect on residential solar by preventing companies that lease solar panels from claiming a key tax credit. A tax credit for homeowners that own their own panels will also be eliminated.

Shares of Sunrun, the top U.S. solar leasing company, were down 38% in afternoon trade.

The House bill also eliminates the “transferability” of tax credits that enabled developers to sell their tax credits and use the funds to finance project construction, a feature that made it easier to get them running. Some nuclear energy projects are exempted.

It also strengthened restrictions on the use of tax credits for any project backed by Chinese companies or using materials produced in China under a provision targeting “foreign entities of concern.” China dominates all aspects of the clean energy supply chain and the restrictions effectively eliminate the ability of most projects to claim the credits.

House leadership had initially promised to carefully reform the credits, not end them.

“This isn’t a scalpel, it’s a meat cleaver, and it will hurt us all,” said Heather O’Neill, president of clean energy lobby group Advanced Energy United.

A marathon session that began Wednesday resulted in 1,100-plus page legislation that curbs billions of dollars in spending across food assistance, student loans, Medicaid and action to address climate change.

The bill, which now heads to the Senate, repeals or phases out more quickly clean energy tax credits passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act during former President Joe Biden's term. Biden’s climate law has been considered monumental for the clean energy transition, but the House bill effectively renders moot much of the law's incentives for renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Clean energy advocates said the bill walks back the largest government investment in clean energy in history.

“In a bid to cut taxes for billionaires and provide a grab bag of goodies to Big Oil, the majority in the House took a sledgehammer to clean energy tax credits and to the protection of our public lands,"" said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“These credits are delivering billions of dollars in new investments in homegrown American energy -- creating jobs, lowering energy costs and addressing the climate crisis that is fueling floods, fires and heat waves,'' Goldfuss said.

President Donald Trump celebrated the bill’s passage, calling it “arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country.” Trump appealed to the Senate to pass the measure as soon as possible and send it to his desk.

The Senate hopes to wrap up its version by the Fourth of July holiday. At least four Republican senators, led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have urged continuation of energy tax credits, including support for traditional and renewable energy sources. Republican-led states and Congressional districts have benefited from billions of dollars in clean energy manufacturing investments spurred by the Biden-era subsidies.

Full-scale repeal of current credits ""could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,'' the senators said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota.

""A wholesale repeal, or the termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy,” the senators wrote in the April 9 letter. The letter was also signed by GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas.

In a win for House moderates and some Western lawmakers, the House bill strips language that would have allowed the sale of hundreds of thousands acres of public lands in Utah and Nevada. Opponents argued the sales would have opened the door for more oil and gas drilling.

The House bill takes an axe to tax credits for rooftop solar installments and eliminates electric vehicle tax credits after 2025, with a one-year exception for EVs manufactured by automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 cars that qualified for the credit.

Credits for solar and electric vehicles, which reduce harmful emissions, help to boost demand for the technologies and drive down their cost.

House Republicans also tightened tax credit restrictions for projects associated with foreign entities, including China — an added blow to domestic clean energy expansion since China dominates much of the supply chain.

The bill slashes a three-year phase-down schedule previously proposed, and instead cuts off projects that don’t start construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage. Those projects would also have to start operating before 2029.

“This bill threatens the clean energy industry at a time when it’s proving to be not only economically beneficial — lowering costs, creating jobs and fueling local economies — but also essential to America’s energy future,"" said Andrew Reagan, president of Clean Energy for America, an industry group.

At the behest of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke and some other Republicans, lawmakers stripped a provision that would have sold or transferred about 460,000 acres (186,155 hectares) of federal land in Nevada and Utah to local governments or private entities.

The proposal exposed sharp divisions between Western Republicans who say the federal government controls too much of their states and others such as Zinke, a former Interior secretary in Trump’s first term whose state is protective of access to lands for hunting and recreation.

“Once the land is sold, we will never get it back,” Zinke said after the provision’s removal. ”Public access, sportsmanship, grazing tourism — our entire Montanan way of life is connected to our public lands.”

The land sales had been inserted in an early version of the bill following a late-night committee vote, despite earlier pledges from Republican leaders that land sales were off the table.

Supporters said the sales would generate revenue and ease growth pressures by creating room for more and cheaper housing in booming Western cities such as Las Vegas, Reno, Nevada and St. George, Utah. Those communities are hemmed in by federal property, which makes up 80% of the land in Nevada and 63% in Utah. Some states in the Midwest and East have 1% or less federal land by comparison.

A spokesperson for Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, who sponsored the bid to sell federal lands in his state, said his office was “exploring all options” to make the transfers happen.

Housing advocates had cautioned federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing, and some of the parcels to be sold were far from developed areas.

Tracy Stone-Manning, president of the Wilderness Society and a former director of the Bureau of Land Management Bureau under Biden, said she appreciated Zinke’s work to prevent the public lands sale.

But she added that the bill was still a “big giveaway” to the private sector. “By opening hundreds of millions of acres to drilling, mining and logging to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, this bill harms the tens of millions of people who like to hike, recreate or find solace in the outdoors,” she said.

At the same time the bill slashes support for clean energy, it paves the way for oil, gas and coal.

Through the bill, natural gas pipeline developers can pay a $10 million fee for expedited permitting, and applicants for a potential liquefied natural gas export site can pay a $1 million fee to be deemed in the “public interest,” circumventing what is usually a regulatory challenge.

Lawmakers in Washington are moving to block a landmark California law that would have banned the sale of petrol-only cars in the state by 2035.

The Senate followed the House in voting to effectively kill the law, nullifying a waiver granted to the state that had allowed it to set stricter auto emissions standards than those set by the federal government.

The vote is a win for Republicans, energy firms and carmakers. It's a blow to Democrats and environmental groups, which saw the rule as a key step to addressing pollution and climate change.

President Donald Trump is expected to sign the measure, likely setting the stage for a legal battle.

""This federal government overreach is illogical, politically motivated and it comes at the expense of Californian's lives and livelihoods,"" said California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who said the state would sue over the move.

Trump had previously attacked California's plan to phase out gas cars, which, in part because of the state's size, was expected to have significant influence over the wider car industry in the US.

Roughly a dozen other states, including New York, Massachusetts, Colorado and New Mexico had intended to follow the California rules, representing more than a third of the car market, according to the industry.

Electric vehicles, including hybrids, represented about 10% of new car sales in the US, compared with roughly 30% in the UK last year, according to the International Energy Agency.

In the UK, the government has put forward a plan to phase out sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030.

In the US, critics had argued that the standards - which included the requirement that electric cars make up 35% of new car sales in 2026 - were unachievable.

Carmakers had argued that a related credit scheme - in which manufacturers earned and traded credits for selling electric vehicles - would result in car companies having to buy credits from Tesla, a leading manufacturer of electric vehicles. If they had to buy credits to meet a legal requirement, it would hinder their ability to invest in producing their own electric cars, the makers argued.

""The concerns were about the mandate – not the technology,"" said carmaker lobby group president John Bozzella of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation.

But the Natural Resources Defense Council said halting the standards made ""no sense"".

""They reduce costs for drivers, boost domestic manufacturing, improve air quality, and help address the climate crisis,"" president Manish Bapna said.

""If other states don't like California's approach, they don't need to follow it—but federal lawmakers shouldn't be intervening to block states from providing cleaner air and a healthier environment.""

California, where electric cars made up about a quarter of new car sales last year, has received waivers from the EPA to establish stricter standards for decades, in order to address the state's long-running air quality issues.

Trump in his first term moved to strip California of its powers, setting off a legal battle that fizzled out when former President Joe Biden won the 2020 election.

Congress has historically stayed out of the fight.

Both the Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian, who is charged with interpreting Senate rules, said Congress was not following proper procedure to repeal the rule.

The leader of the Democrats in the Senate had accused Republicans of using a ""nuclear option"" to block the waiver, implying it could take similar steps against other agency rules.

But even though the provisions aren’t as strict for new nuclear projects to qualify, the bill still sets unrealistic goals.","House Republicans advanced a sweeping spending package that would roll back Biden-era tax credits for renewable energy projects. If the bill passes the Senate and makes it to President Donald Trump’s desk to sign, it could deal a serious blow to renewables, new nuclear technologies, and clean energy manufacturing across the US.

The rollbacks would undo much of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which Democrats touted as the biggest investment in climate and clean energy initiatives. Losing these tax credits would slow efforts to build out enough new energy sources to meet rising electricity demand, as well as previous commitments the US has made on the international stage to help stop the climate crisis.

“This package is really economic malpractice,” says Brad Townsend, vice president for policy and outreach at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES). The bill that the House ultimately passed was even harsher on clean energy than a draft released last week. “The original version was bad. This version is worse.”

“This package is really economic malpractice.”

Based on the previous draft, C2ES and research firm Greenline Insights estimated that restrictions on which projects would be eligible for tax credits would cost hundreds of billions of dollars in lost GDP. An updated bill released overnight and passed early this morning could lead to even larger losses if the Senate ultimately passes it as-is.

Notably, the bill stipulates that projects must start construction within 60 days of it being enacted and placed in service by the end of 2028 in order to qualify for clean energy tax credits.

That would effectively make it impossible for new projects to qualify, given the long lead times needed to secure permits and financing before starting construction. During remarks on the Senate floor this morning, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) called the provision a “clean job kill switch.”

“It’s one of the most devastating things added at the last minute in this bill snuck in the dark of night. And we in the Senate — and I hope our Republican colleagues will join us in this — are going to fight this every step of the way,” he said.

Nearly 977,000 jobs and $177 billion in GDP would have been lost as a result of requirements in the previous draft that stipulated that projects be placed in service by 2029 to qualify for credits, according to C2ES and Greenline Insights. Again, that draft was less stringent than the text that ultimately passed.

The bill seemingly includes a carveout for nuclear energy industry, to which some GOP members, including Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, have ties. Wright dialed into a meeting with Republican lawmakers on Wednesday night to discuss the tax credits, Politico reported. The bill subsequently says that new nuclear reactors would only have to commence construction by 2028 in order to qualify. But even though the provisions aren’t as strict for new nuclear projects to qualify, the bill still sets unrealistic goals. Next-generation nuclear reactors aren’t expected to be ready to deploy commercially until the 2030s.

The bill also ends an IRA policy that allowed renewable projects to transfer credits to one another, dealing another economic blow to developers outside of nuclear energy. It disqualifies projects owned by or receiving “material assistance from prohibited foreign entities.” Those restrictions are essentially unworkable, according to clean energy advocates and industry experts — considering that clean energy supply chains are still concentrated in China and that it could bar developers with investors from other countries. Restrictions on the involvement of foreign entities alone could lead to $237 billion in lost GDP, Greenline Insights and C2ES previously estimated.

Ironically, Republican districts stood to benefit the most from IRA incentives for new solar and wind farms and factories. Investments were concentrated in rural areas, and 73 percent of manufacturing facilities for clean power components are in red states, according to a recent industry report from the American Clean Power Association.

“Texas in particular is going to be hammered by the package as written,” Townsend says. His organization’s analysis found that Texas would lose the most jobs — more than 170,000 — from tax credit restrictions initially proposed in the bill.

“Texas in particular is going to be hammered.”

Fortunately, solar and wind power are already cheaper sources of electricity than fossil fuels in many cases and have been making steady gains in the US for decades thanks to falling costs. To be sure, developers now have to contend with new challenges posed by Trump’s tariff regime. But the industry has managed to make progress — now providing more than 20 percent of the US electricity mix — despite years of on-again, off-again credits prior to the IRA codifying incentives in a way that offered more long-term certainty for the industry.

What the tax credits in the IRA were supposed to help accomplish, however, was a dramatic ramp-up of carbon-free energy needed to stop the climate crisis. The IRA was expected to slash US greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 40 percent from peak levels by the end of the decade, according to independent analyses. That nearly got the nation to the goal that former President Joe Biden committed to under the 2015 Paris Agreement, which was cutting pollution by at least 50 percent by 2030. And since the US is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions historically than any other country, the decisions that Congress makes now have consequences for the planet.

Trump, of course, has called climate change a hoax despite mountains of evidence showing how emissions from fossil fuels exacerbate floods, storms, droughts, fires, and other climate disasters.

Aside from worsening weather events putting pressure on the US’ aging power grid, the country is also grappling with a sudden rise in electricity demand from new AI data centers, crypto mining, electric vehicles, and increased domestic manufacturing. Electricity demand could grow by 25 percent by 2030, according to one forecast published this week by consulting firm ICF. By slowing the deployment of clean energy, the repeal of IRA incentives would lead to more pollution and raise household energy costs by up to 7 percent by 2035, according to a recent analysis by research firm Rhodium Group.

The Senate now has to wrangle with the entirety of Trump’s so-called “big, beautiful bill.” It also includes proposals to extend and expand income tax cuts, increase military spending, fund mass deportations, impose new restrictions on Medicaid and food assistance programs, and more. Even though the Republican-controlled Senate is likely to fall in line with Trump’s agenda, there’s still time for proposals in the bill to evolve.

In its current version, “Americans’ electric bills will soar. Hundreds of factories will close. Hundreds of billions of dollars in local investments will vanish. Hundreds of thousands of people will lose their jobs,” Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), said in a press statement. But, Hopper added, “it’s not too late for Congress to get this right. The solar and [energy] storage industry is ready to get to work with the US Senate on a more thoughtful and measured approach.”",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/STK438_CLIMATE_CHANGE_E.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-05-22 16:09:15.600189

Sincerely, Tom Gilbert President Pennsylvania Environmental Council","On Tuesday, May 20, PEC President Tom Gilbert wrote to members of the Pennsylvania delegation, urging them to defend clean energy programs and the EPA’s budget as lawmakers consider cuts that would have direct impacts on Pennsylvanians.

Dear Senators and Representatives:

I am writing on behalf of the Pennsylvania Environmental Council (PEC) urging you to oppose cuts to clean energy funding and incentive programs funded through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), as well as the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) budget.

Since 1970, PEC has been working to protect and restore Pennsylvania’s environment by working directly with partners from business, industry, labor, and communities. We support an ‘all of the above’ energy transition that includes a wide range of pathways including renewables, nuclear, carbon and methane capture, geothermal, and more. We also support development of technologies like storage, transmission infrastructure improvement, energy efficiency, and distributed generation. All of these technologies make our grid more diverse and resilient, help consumers and businesses save money, and create new jobs.

Pennsylvania and American competitiveness are predicated not just on what we’re doing today, but how we’re preparing for tomorrow. Innovation is fundamental, particularly in Pennsylvania. Our businesses and industry are striving to improve efficiencies and stay viable in markets where metrics like embedded emissions in manufactured goods are inescapable. Pennsylvania’s traditional dominance in industry is well known, but it’s also rooted in older practices and technologies that now must compete on new playing fields.

For example, nearly $400 million in funding approved under the IRA for the new RISE PA industrial decarbonization grant program is in jeopardy. The loss of these funds would impede the ability of industries in Pennsylvania to adopt new technologies that make them more competitive while reducing harmful emissions.

Reporting has shown that, based on the IRA’s programs, companies have planned to invest more than $843 billion in improvements and new build projects across the country. We need this investment in all areas of Pennsylvania. That critical investment, including the creation of jobs and local tax benefits, however, is thrown into jeopardy if cuts are made to the IRA. And it will impact all Pennsylvanians. Multiple analyses (Energy Innovation, CEBA and Rhodium Group, as examples) find that elimination of these programs would quickly raise energy costs for residential and business consumers.

We are also deeply concerned about the proposed cuts to the budget for the EPA, which would jeopardize $120 million in federal funding to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection including basic support for Air Quality, Water Quality, Safe Drinking Water, Radiation Protection, Storage Tanks, and related grants to support programs and projects in communities that literally save lives. Whether proactively addressing flooding, plugging abandoned oil and gas wells, or sustaining our state’s hazardous sites program, this funding is essential to programs that protect Pennsylvanians.

Our state cannot lead without moving forward. We should not cede progress made with investments that have already proved beneficial to our state many times over, and that are poised to accelerate those returns in the years to come. Retreating will imperil economic growth, environmental improvement, and job opportunities for current and future Pennsylvanians.

Again, we ask that you oppose any proposed cuts to these programs. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Tom Gilbert

Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee.","Among the changes secured by hardliners, the bill would weaken the clean electricity investment and production tax credits in a way that clean energy developers say could make them largely unusable.

House Republicans escalated their effort to gut Democrats’ clean energy tax credits, releasing updated text Wednesday night of their mega-reconciliation bill that would eviscerate former President Joe Biden’s trademark climate law despite resistance from moderates within their own party.

The revised bill expected to receive a floor vote — likely Thursday — contains language pushed by hard-line conservatives speeding up the phaseout of tax credits after they protested the Ways and Means Committee’s draft that was already set to severely restrict the subsidies. The amended language was released after President Donald Trump went to Capitol Hill to warn lawmakers in his party not to vote against the bill.

Among the changes secured by hard-liners, the bill would weaken the clean electricity investment and production tax credits in a way that clean energy developers say could make them largely unusable.

Democrats designed those credits to benefit all forms of carbon-free energy sources, but conservatives argued they were mostly helping wind and solar — technologies that they say are mature and no longer need credits.

In a bid to back shovel-ready projects, the changes would require projects to ""commence construction"" within 60 days of the bill’s enactment to qualify for tax credits and be placed in service by the end of 2028.

But in a small win for moderates, Republicans did soften rollbacks of credits for advanced nuclear reactors, a technology favored by the Trump administration that is not ready to be deployed at large scale. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a big proponent of nuclear, phoned into a meeting with GOP lawmakers Wednesday night.

While still subject to the 2028 phaseout, nuclear developers would be able to access investment and production tax credits when they start construction on a plant — instead of when they begin delivering energy — giving them more time to earn subsidies.

“We need to have a long enough period of time where investors feel like it’s adequate or else we’re gonna just scare them all away and things won’t happen,” said Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.), who led a push among some Republicans to preserve incentives for nuclear power. “Once you get the first few built it will really allow the industry to take off.”

Existing nuclear reactors also got an extended lifeline as a production tax credit now phases out at the end of 2031, instead of at the start of 2029 under the Ways and Means’ proposal.

The text also takes further aim at provisions allowing companies to transfer tax credits to a buyer in exchange for cash — an option known as transferability. The updated draft would only allow the practice for nuclear energy, per an email summarizing the changes sent by GOP leadership.

Rollbacks to other credits — such as the tax credits for electric vehicles and restrictions on Chinese involvement in projects that companies have deemed all but unworkable — remained largely the same as the text approved by Ways and Means last week.

The text also targeted wind and solar power by limiting certain investments in leasing arrangements for those technologies.

The long-delayed release of the updated text of the reconciliation bill now sets up a dramatic confrontation on the House floor between conservatives who see the bill as their best shot to stop the tax credits from extending beyond Trump’s presidency and moderates who worry about jeopardizing planned projects in their districts.

“I don't think anyone wants to pull the rug out from people, businesses, and investors who were counting on the federal government’s fulfillment of its promise. But you also don’t want the tax credits to go beyond a point to where they can be extended into the future and in some cases beyond President Trump’s term,” said Budget Committee Chair Jodey Arrington (R-Texas).

So far, only one of the moderates, Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.), has not committed to voting for the bill on the House floor over concerns about the gutting of the IRA.

“These things I'm hearing could end up killing a lot of projects that have been announced all over the country,” Garbarino said Wednesday night after meeting with Speaker Mike Johnson alongside other moderates.

GOP members that back the clean energy credits are hoping that Senate Republicans will live up their pledges to ease some of the rollbacks once the full package of tax cuts, border security and energy measures moves to the upper chamber.

“Historically the Senate has always been the saucer for the teacup that cools the tea,” Newhouse said. “They’ll have their mark on it. We’ll work with them closely.”

Democrats, meanwhile, challenged House Republicans to do more to defend the clean energy credits by voting down the bill on the floor, citing projections showing that cutting the subsidies will raise energy prices and cost manufacturing jobs mostly in red states.

“It’s showtime for those Republicans who have said that they support these clean energy incentives,” said Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee.

Public lands out: House Republican leaders also removed contentious language that would have sold small tracts of public land for development across two states.

The measure pushed by Reps. Mark Amodei of Nevada and Celeste Maloy of Utah involving sales in their states drew fierce opposition from Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.), who declared the issue a redline for him since his state is predominantly made up of public lands.

Zinke, Trump’s former Interior secretary, argued it was inappropriate to consider a policy issue like land sales in a reconciliation bill that is intended to deal with budget-related matters, and took exception to how Amodei and Maloy introduced their proposal as an amendment late into a Natural Resources Committee markup.

“The bill skipped the public process,” Zinke said. “It should have never gotten into reconciliation to begin with.”

Amodei and Maloy saw the partisan budget process as an opportunity to sell the lands to generate government revenue and build affordable housing. Amodei took exception to Zinke’s protests against sales that wouldn’t affect his state.

“We ran it knowing we were going to take some fire,” Amodei said. “It was a deal in two states that he is not affiliated with.”

Also removed from the bill were several sections that would have rescinded resource management plans issued by the Biden administration that restricted fossil fuel production and mining on some federal lands in favor of conservation.

For all of the effort and discussion about environmental permit reform, it is notable that this effort has barely even started.","President Trump came into office pledging to speed up federal environmental permitting, and he has issued a series of executive orders that touch on some aspect of expediting environmental reviews. Those executive orders include the following:

Executive Order 14156, Declaring a National Energy Emergency (Jan. 20, 2025)

Executive Order 14154, Unleashing American Energy (Jan. 20, 2025)

Executive Order 14153, Unleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Potential (Jan. 20, 2025)

Executive Order 14192, Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation (Jan. 31, 2025)

Executive Order 14219, Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the President’s “Department of Government Efficiency” Deregulatory Initiative (Feb. 19, 2025)

Presidential Memorandum, Updating Permitting Technology for the 21st Century (Apr. 15, 2025)

These permitting-related executive orders generally mix substantive and procedural goals — for example, seeking to eliminate requirements on the private sector while at the same time accelerating permit reviews. The substantive aspects of these orders are some of the most contentious in the new administration and have driven much of the public discussion. However, the idea that federal environmental reviews should move more quickly (even if all of the substantive requirements are the same) is one that enjoys broad support.

As a group, the Trump administration’s permitting-related orders are an ambitious and concerted effort to speed up federal environmental reviews. Rather than pursuing a single approach to reforming permitting systems, the orders call for a variety of different strategies to deal with the pace of agency permitting. Those strategies include avoiding or eliminating procedural requirements that lengthen permit reviews, decentralizing review procedures among agencies, increasing the use of technology in permit reviews, reducing agency staff and expenditures, and simply ordering agency staff to act more quickly. These strategies could be complementary in some circumstances but contradictory in others.

This paper addresses the permitting-related orders as a group and analyzes them for their likely effect on environmental permit reform, specifically, the speed at which agencies act on applications for permits and approvals. Some of the strategies may speed up environmental reviews by eliminating certain procedures or streamlining the mechanics of agency reviews. Other efforts may slow permit reviews by creating uncertainty and undermining reform efforts through staffing and budget cuts. This paper identifies the various strategies represented in these permitting-related orders and then assesses which ones have the greatest potential to achieve the goal of speeding up federal environmental reviews.[1]

The Deregulation and Decentralization Strategy: Eliminate Governmentwide Regulations So That Agencies Can Follow Different and Simpler Procedures

One of the administration’s most important strategies to speed up permit reviews is to eliminate regulations that require lengthy analyses of environmental effects before the issuance of permits. The prime example of this strategy is Executive Order 14154, “Unleashing American Energy” (Jan. 20, 2025), which orders the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to rescind regulations that provide governmentwide procedures for evaluating environmental impacts pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).[2] In their place, individual agencies must follow their own NEPA regulations, which generally impose fewer procedural requirements.[3] Since individual agencies’ NEPA regulations generally incorporate by reference the now-rescinded CEQ regulations,[4] the agencies have been directed to update their regulations and have been given guidance to reduce the types of effects that are analyzed.[5]

Environmental reviews conducted pursuant to NEPA often are the most time-consuming aspect of federal permit reviews, so speeding up NEPA reviews should shorten the time by which agencies act on permit applications. Executive Order 14154 appears based on the belief that NEPA reviews take a long time due to the detailed procedures established in the CEQ regulations, so eliminating those regulations should make NEPA reviews faster. This strategy also may be based on the belief that it will be harder for third parties to block project approvals based on NEPA if there are fewer requirements for NEPA reviews set forth in regulations.

It remains to be seen whether this strategy will speed or slow NEPA reviews. The CEQ regulations have governed NEPA procedures for decades and have been the basis of many important judicial decisions, so rescinding those regulations creates a great deal of uncertainty regarding how agencies should act moving forward. Historically, legal uncertainty leads to delays while agencies figure out how to proceed or promulgate new regulations or guidance, and while courts evaluate the sufficiency of new procedures. In addition, a decentralized process that has different procedures for different agencies seems destined to delay projects that need approvals from more than one federal agency. This strategy could actually slow down NEPA reviews in the short term, but if the administration is right that most delays are caused by detailed CEQ regulations, then it might speed up NEPA reviews in the long term.

This effort to revise agency NEPA regulations also may be affected by other strategies of the administration. In its first few months, the administration has prioritized reducing agency staff and cutting budgets. Revising regulations is a time-consuming process that requires significant investment in staff time, so this process may take even longer if there are fewer people available to work on it.

The Short Cut Strategy: Permit Projects Using Alternative Procedures Provided in Existing Regulations

Another primary strategy pursued in the executive orders is to direct agency staff to use alternative procedures provided for in existing regulations to fast-track permit reviews. The best example of this strategy is Executive Order 14156, “Declaring a National Energy Emergency” (Jan. 20, 2025), which declares an emergency related to energy projects and orders agencies to use fast-track procedures to quickly approve certain energy projects.[6] This strategy is founded on the belief that permit approvals take so long because typical environmental review procedures are too time-consuming.

This strategy relies on existing regulations to allow permit approvals before all environmental analysis is complete. Several regulations have provisions that allow agencies to act quickly on permit applications in emergencies, including Clean Water Act section 404 permitting regulations, Endangered Species Act consultation regulations, and NEPA regulations.[7] These regulations generally define “emergency” to be some exigent circumstance that requires action prior to the time necessary to comply with normal review procedures, and then allow agencies to use nonstandard procedures to review the project.[8] In practice, this means that agencies shorten time frames for some steps of the permit review (e.g., public notice and comment), and conduct other steps of the environmental review after the project has been approved (e.g., full analysis of environmental impacts).[9]

The logic behind this strategy appears to be to bypass the most time-consuming permit procedures by using the emergency authorities found in the regulations. The administration also may believe that the president’s finding of a national energy emergency may be effectively unreviewable in court challenges, because it is not an agency action.[10]

This strategy likely will speed up permit approvals for a group of permit applicants. However, on its face it will not speed reviews of all permit applications because it only applies to certain energy projects. This strategy also only speeds up permit reviews as long as there is an emergency (which presumably is not forever), so its effect will be time-limited. It also makes no fundamental improvements to permitting procedures to speed the process across the board. Projects approved based on emergency procedures also may be vulnerable to lawsuits claiming that the presidential declaration does not meet the definition of an emergency in the regulations. For the agencies, there also may be a long-term risk that courts will question the legality of using nonstandard emergency procedures on a regular basis, which could make these authorities less effective in real emergencies in the future. Taken together, this approach may yield short-term results for some projects but will result in no lasting changes that would speed up environmental reviews in general.

The Technology Strategy: Use Computer Software to Simplify and Speed Reviews

Another strategy being pursued by the administration is to require agencies to update their software and technology to speed up the consideration of permit applications. In 2023, Congress directed CEQ to submit a report “on the potential for online and digital technologies to address delays in reviews” under NEPA.[11] CEQ under the Biden administration submitted the report to Congress last year that recommended “taking interim steps to improve existing [agency] systems and enable interoperability of those systems,” with the ultimate plan to develop “a unified NEPA and permitting experience.”[12]

The Trump administration has now taken the next step and issued the presidential memorandum, “Updating Permitting Technology for the 21st Century” (Apr. 15, 2025). This memorandum requires federal agencies to “make maximum use of technology in environmental review and permitting processes,” by (among other things) “eliminat[ing] the use of paper-based application and review processes,” “modernizing the technology used for Federal permitting and environmental review processes for infrastructure projects,” creating “an initial data and technology standard for permit applications and reviews,” and “creating a unified interagency permitting and environmental review data system.”[13] Perhaps more importantly, the memorandum requires CEQ to “establish and lead an interagency Permitting Innovation Center that will design and test prototype tools that could be implemented pursuant to the Permitting Technology Action Plan for NEPA reviews and other environmental permits and authorizations.”[14]

A technology-based strategy is based on the reality that the process by which agencies review permit applications is heavily based on individual staff review of papers and documents. Since the regulatory requirements are complex, and projects themselves can be technically complex, it is hard for individual permit reviewers to quickly determine and focus on the issues that matter. Better use of software and technology, and standardization of systems to review permit applications, has the potential to greatly speed up the mechanics of environmental reviews, which could accelerate the time at which agencies act on permit applications. In addition, since agencies often conduct the same type of reviews in different ways, adopting a single technical standard could make permitting processes much faster. The creation of the Permitting Innovation Center also could result in major long-term improvements, because there may need to be substantial trial-and-error efforts to actually speed up permit reviews.

Of all the Trump administration’s actions that touch on permit reform, this presidential memorandum seems most likely to speed up agency reviews in general over the long term. It is the only strategy that is based on bipartisan direction from Congress, and therefore it likely will have the most staying power in a future presidential administration. It also attempts to institutionalize innovation related to permitting, which should allow for new ideas to be tried in the future. The devil is in the details, however, so success will turn on how effectively agencies design and use the new software and technology. The administration will have to maintain a sustained focus on making the nuts and bolts of permit reviews more efficient and speedier, and it remains to be seen whether the administration will see these efforts through.

The implementation of the presidential memorandum will be undercut to some extent by some of the other executive orders. Designing and implementing new software and technology requires staff time and money, so the administration’s staff reductions and budget cuts may starve this initiative of the resources that it needs to succeed. Also, the goal to standardize the technology used for permit reviews across agencies runs counter to the decentralization of the most important component of permit reviews, NEPA. There is an irony that CEQ is being tasked with coordinating and speeding environmental permit reviews among all federal agencies at the same time that its authority to bind agencies through regulations has been taken away.

The DOGE Strategy: Reduce Agency Staff and Funding, and Demand More From Employees

Perhaps the highest profile administration strategy to date related to regulatory agencies has been to reduce the number of agency employees, demand more of the remaining employees, and to cut budgets and contracts. The highest profile effort in this vein has been the work of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has gone into agencies and cut as many employees as possible and frozen many contracts with third parties.[15] There have been other similar efforts since then, with agencies now proposing staff and program cuts in their budgets for the next fiscal year.[16] Some new agency leaders have also asked their staff to move more quickly in their environmental reviews.[17]

These efforts to cut agency staff and funding are at least in part a strategy related to permit reform. Trump has described the problem of slow environmental reviews to be the fault of government “bureaucrats,” and getting rid of the bureaucrats is a way to get rid of the problem.

The administration may believe that shaking up the agencies may motivate staff to move more quickly on permit reviews and make people more open to changing how they do business. However, these disruptive efforts likely will have a broad negative effect on permit reform efforts. All of the other reform strategies rely on having agency staff and funding available to revise regulations, conduct faster environmental reviews, and design and implement new software and technology. The lack of staff can also be a direct roadblock to some permits being issued: for example, if the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service no longer has enough employees to consult with action agencies when required by the Endangered Species Act, then action agencies are limited in their ability to issue permits. Moreover, many federal environmental permits are issued by state agencies pursuant to delegation, and cuts to the federal grants that pay for this work by state agencies will only slow down permitting more. The DOGE strategy therefore is likely to be a net negative for efforts to speed up federal environmental reviews and approvals.

The Traditional Strategy: Revise Regulations and Propose Statutory Changes to Speed Permit Review

The most obvious way to achieve lasting improvements in federal environmental permitting is to revise the regulations that establish review procedures and to recommend statutory changes to Congress. The reason that federal agencies issue permits and conduct environmental reviews is because Congress passed laws that require the agencies to do so. If the permitting process is not working, then Congress in theory can change the laws. Until that happens, the administration can try to streamline the regulations that implement those statutes. The process of revising regulations takes time, but once they are implemented, the changes stay in place for at least some period of time until a subsequent administration makes further revisions.

So far, the administration has proposed no changes to the environmental laws, leaving the debate about permit reform to Congress. The administration also has proposed few changes to the regulations that establish permit review procedures (the primary exception being the changes to NEPA regulations). These proposals may come eventually, but until they do, there will be little fundamental improvement in the federal environmental permitting process.

In fairness to the administration, changes to environmental regulations usually are challenged and sometimes are overturned by courts. Even those regulations that survive legal challenge may be repealed by the next administration, which is what happened to many of the regulatory changes enacted in the first Trump administration. However, that does not change the fact that the best way to reform a statutory and regulatory process is to fix the statutes and regulations themselves. For all of the effort and discussion about environmental permit reform, it is notable that this effort has barely even started.

Conclusion

Never in modern times has one administration initiated so many efforts in such a short time aimed at speeding up federal environmental reviews and permits. Some of the highest profile efforts may only have limited, short-term effect, because they target only certain types of projects and are dependent on a declaration of an emergency. The efforts with the most potential for far-reaching effects (e.g., improving the use of technology and revisions to statutes and regulations) will need time to implement and evaluate. Given the variety of different strategies being followed by this administration at the same time, in several years we may look back at these various efforts as a grand experiment to determine which strategies are most effective and the wisdom of trying everything all at once.

The Trump administration will need to initiate a formal notice-and-comment rulemaking in order to proceed with modification or revocation of the GHG endangerment finding.","On March 12, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans to reconsider EPA’s 2009 endangerment finding for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, along with all regulations and actions that rely on the finding. This process was initiated pursuant to an executive order issued by President Trump on the first day of his second term in which he called for review of the “legality and continuing applicability” of the 2009 endangerment finding. However, as this blog post explains, the endangerment finding rests on an unassailable scientific foundation. It also rests on Supreme Court precedent, Massachusetts v. EPA, that required EPA to make a science-based determination on the effects of GHG emissions.

The 2009 endangerment finding has played a foundational role in Clean Air Act regulation of GHG emissions from both mobile and stationary sources. In the original finding, issued in 2009, EPA concluded that six GHGs— carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)— threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations. EPA also made a separate “cause-or-contribute” finding in which it determined that U.S. motor vehicles contribute to GHG pollution that threatens public health and welfare.

The 2009 finding was referenced in subsequent endangerment and cause-or-contribute findings for other source categories, including power plants, oil and natural gas operations, and aircraft. With each successive rulemaking, EPA acknowledged that the evidence of endangerment had grown stronger over time due to the increasing severity of climate change, new observational evidence of climate impacts, and advances in scientific understanding of how climate change affects public health and welfare.

The Trump administration has not yet issued a public proposal for modifying or revoking the endangerment finding, but Administrator Zeldin’s announcement and the accompanying EPA Press Release provide insights on how the administration may seek to justify its revocation. In his remarks, Zeldin focused on the costs imposed by GHG regulations. However, both the text of the Clean Air Act and prior case law make it clear that EPA cannot consider costs when making scientific determinations regarding the effect of air pollutants on public health and welfare. The Supreme Court explicitly held in Massachusetts v. EPA that EPA’s obligation was to make a “scientific judgment” as to “whether greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change” and that it was impermissible for EPA to base its decision on policy rationales that are “divorced from the statutory text.” Thus, it is difficult to imagine how the Trump administration could justify revocation based on costs.

The press release suggests another possible rationale for revocation. It asserts that the 2009 finding is characterized by “significant uncertainties in the science and assumptions” and that the methodology used to evaluate endangerment was “flawed and unorthodox” because:

“Contrary to popular belief, the Endangerment Finding did not directly find that carbon dioxide emissions from U.S. cars endanger public welfare. Instead, the Finding looks at a combination of emissions of six different gases—and cars don’t even omit all six. It then creatively added multiple leaps, arguing that the combined six gases contribute some mysterious amount above zero to climate change and that climate change creates some mysterious amount of endangerment above zero to public health.”

These statements suggest that the Trump administration may take direct aim at the scientific basis for the endangerment finding.

There are two components to the Trump administration’s claims here. First, there is the suggestion that GHGs should not have been grouped together in the endangerment finding. This is not a compelling rationale for revocation, as the decision to group GHGs was within EPA’s statutory discretion. The Clean Air Act explicitly defines an air pollutant as “any air pollution agent or combination of such agents” and there is precedent for grouping pollutants with similar effects together (see, e.g., 65 Fed. Reg. 35430). There is also a pragmatic rationale for grouping GHGs, since they are all radiative forcing agents that contribute to the same environmental problem (climate change). Granted, EPA may have discretion to group GHGs differently in a modified endangerment finding, but it would need to give a reasoned explanation for doing so. Even if EPA were to evaluate GHGs as separate pollutants, there would still a scientific basis for finding that individual GHGs cause endangerment through contributions to radiative forcing.

Second, the Trump administration has asserted that the endangerment finding relies on logical leaps and does not include sufficient information about the magnitude of harmful impacts attributable to CO2 and other GHG emissions. These assertions overlook the considerable body of scientific evidence that was compiled in support of the 2009 endangerment finding, as well as the scientific knowledge that has been generated in the sixteen years since then and which provides overwhelming support for the conclusion that GHG emissions endanger public health and welfare. The Trump administration’s assertions also ignore legal precedent in which courts have recognized the validity of climate science and the serious harms associated with climate change, including the Supreme Court’s standing analysis in Massachusetts v. EPA (finding that the “harms associated with climate change are serious and well recognized” and “widely shared” across the United States). Federal and state courts have issued similar findings in more recent decisions such as 350 Montana v. Haaland (Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, 2022) (discussing “dozens of sobering and unchallenged observations” regarding the harmful effects of climate change) and Held v. State (Montana Supreme Court, 2024) (“climate change is causing serious and irreversible harms to the environment in Montana”).

For the 2009 endangerment finding, EPA issued a technical support document that contains several hundred pages of information about the relationship between GHG emissions and climate change, the ways in which climate change affects public health and welfare, and the contribution of motor vehicle emissions to those effects. It identifies many harmful impacts that are attributable to climate change, including sea level rise, increases in the severity and frequency of extreme events, agricultural impacts, ecosystem impacts, and more. Although the document identifies areas of uncertainty – for example, regarding the attribution of hurricanes to climate change – the existence of such uncertainty does not undermine the ultimate conclusion that GHG emissions endanger public health and welfare. This is because there are so many independent lines of evidence supporting that conclusion (e.g., hundreds of different climate variables monitored by different instruments and different entities all pointing towards the central role of human activities in climate change as well as multitude of harmful effects attributable to climate change).

The 2009 endangerment finding was upheld by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in Coalition for Responsible Regulation v. EPA (2012). The court noted that EPA had reasonably relied on peer-reviewed assessments from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), and the National Research Council (NRC) which synthesized thousands of individual studies on climate change, and had amassed “substantial record evidence” of harms attributable to anthropogenic GHG emissions. The court also rejected the argument that the existence of some scientific uncertainty would warrant invalidation of the endangerment finding. As the court noted, the Clean Air Act only requires a finding that the air pollution at issue “may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.” 42 U.S.C. § 7521(a)(1). The court held that this requires a “precautionary, forward-looking scientific judgment” about the risks of GHG emissions.

Since 2009, the evidentiary basis for endangerment from GHG emissions has only grown stronger (see, e.g., Duffy et al. 2019). The IPCC concluded in its latest assessment that anthropogenic GHG emissions “unequivocally” cause climate change, resulting in pervasive and harmful impacts across the world, many of which have been attributed to climate change with high or very high scientific confidence. For example, the IPCC found that it is an “established fact” that anthropogenic climate forcing is causing changes in the frequency and/or intensity of weather and climate extremes, particularly extreme heat events. The Fifth National Climate Assessment (NCA5) contained more detail about the specific ways in which climate change is adversely affecting the United States. NCA5 found “the effects of human-caused climate change are already far reaching and worsening across every region of the United States” including climate-related extreme events, climate-related shocks to agriculture and other economic sectors, and disproportionate impacts on vulnerable groups and communities.

Due to advances in attribution methodologies, it is also now possible to quantify specific harmful impacts attributable to specific emission sources. For example, Callahan and Mankin (2025) demonstrate how climate models and economic damage functions can be used to calculate heat-related losses attributable to GHG emissions from certain fossil fuel companies’ products. Researchers have also developed techniques for quantifying the contribution of emissions to physical impacts such as sea level rise and extreme heat, and impacts such as mortality from extreme heat. These end-to-end attribution methodologies could be used to estimate damages and harmful impacts attributable to emissions from motor vehicles and other source categories for which EPA has issued GHG emissions controls. The social cost of carbon and other GHGs could also be used for this purpose, although those metrics are currently under attack by the Trump administration as well. The topic of end-to-end attribution and damage estimation was one of the issues discussed at the Columbia University conference on “Attribution Science and Climate Law” held in January 2025. A summary of the conference proceedings is available here.

There is also a growing body of research on health impact attribution that further supports the endangerment finding. A recent issue of Nature Climate Change featured several studies on the health effects of climate-driven changes in physical phenomena such as heat wave and wildfires. These studies show that it is possible, in some instances, to quantify impacts such as mortality from increased smoke and extreme heat (see, e.g., Yoen Park et al., 2024). These estimates can be tailored to the United States – for example, Khatana et al. (2024) estimated that by mid-century (2036-2065), heat-related cardiovascular deaths in the U.S. could rise by up to 233 percent as climate change intensifies the frequency, duration, and severity of extreme heat. Researchers have also published meta-assessments of health impacts attributable to climate change, most notably the annual reports issued by the Lancet Countdown on Climate Change and Human Health.

The Trump administration will need to initiate a formal notice-and-comment rulemaking in order to proceed with modification or revocation of the GHG endangerment finding. It is unlikely that the administration will make a good faith effort to compile the best available science on this topic, but civil society members can use the comment process to ensure that relevant scientific resources are included in the administrative record for the rulemaking.",https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/files/2025/05/maxim-tolchinskiy-W3y2crFkVIs-unsplash-scaled-e1690993106658-1024x539-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 18:13:17.757115
,Congress,2025-05-22 18:58:02+00:00,NPR,Congress moves to loosen toxic air pollution rules - NPR,Alejandra Borunda,,,,,https://www.npr.org/2025/05/22/nx-s1-5405619/air-pollution-rollback-congress,"Congress has voted to undo a Clean Air Act regulation that strictly controls the amount of toxic air pollutants emitted by many industrial facilities like oil refineries, chemical plants, and steel mills.
""What that will mean for Americans is more hazardous air pollution across the country,"" says John Walke, an environmental health expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group.
In a December open letter to president-elect Trump, the group had called for a review of EPA's rules regarding hazardous air pollutants, calling them ""technically unachievable and economically infeasible.""
The policy intended to keep toxic air pollution levels not just lower, but as low as possible.
""It's so important to keep a focus on the total amount of toxic air pollution that the people who live there are breathing, and not just on the individual sources level of pollution,"" he says.","Congress has voted to undo a Clean Air Act regulation that strictly controls the amount of toxic air pollutants emitted by many industrial facilities like oil refineries, chemical plants, and steel mills.

The decision represents the first time since the creation of the landmark environmental law that Congress has rolled back its environmental protections.

Environmental groups and public health advocates condemned the vote, saying the rollback could cause higher pollution and harm human health.

""What that will mean for Americans is more hazardous air pollution across the country,"" says John Walke, an environmental health expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group.

""These are pollutants that cause cancer and birth defects and brain damage,"" Walke says.

The vote targets a rule finalized late in the Biden administration, which re-imposed tight regulations on facilities that emit seven so-called ""super pollutants"" like mercury, a dangerous form of lead, and dioxins. The rules regulating those seven pollutants, along with more than 180 others, were first imposed in the 1990s, but were rolled back during the first Trump administration.

The House approved the resolution early Thursday morning, following a Senate vote in favor of changing the rule earlier this month. Under the Congressional Review Act, lawmakers can review EPA regulations within a short window after their implementation and reverse them with a simple majority vote. President Trump has signaled he is likely to sign the bill when it arrives on his desk.

The move is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to roll back environmental and public health regulations. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced in March that he intends to re-evaluate other regulations like the one Congress just voted to change, which is related to a section of the Clean Air Act that deals with Hazardous Air Pollutants.

The agency, Zeldin says, is embarking on the ""biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history,"" which he says is meant to lower the cost of operating businesses in the U.S. while fulfilling the agency's core mission of protecting the environment. Zeldin also aims to target other parts of the Clean Air Act, like the rules regulating mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants and the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

Industry groups like the National Association of Manufacturers welcomed Congress's decision. In a December open letter to president-elect Trump, the group had called for a review of EPA's rules regarding hazardous air pollutants, calling them ""technically unachievable and economically infeasible.""

""By eliminating the misguided ""Once-in, Always-in"" rule, we can reduce compliance costs for manufacturers while incentivizing better environmental outcomes,"" says Chris Phalen, vice president of domestic policy at NAM.

But environmental and public health experts warn the change could result in higher pollution levels in communities that neighbor industrial facilities like ""oil refineries, chemical plants, coke ovens, aluminum plants, lead smelters, things of that nature. We call it the worst of the worst list,"" says Walke. The facilities are largely concentrated in parts of the country with high industrial activity, like the Gulf Coast and parts of Appalachia.

""Once in, always in""

The rule concerns the regulation of seven particularly hazardous air pollutants like dioxins and mercury. Such pollutants move through the air but also accumulate in soil, dust, and people's bodies; several are known to cause cancer, neurological issues, and birth defects even at very low exposure levels.

Rules regulating those seven air toxic pollutants, along with more than 180 others, have been in place since 1990 when Congress passed a major amendment to the Clean Air Act that greatly increased its specific regulatory powers. It tasked EPA with tightly regulating what it called ""major sources"" of dangerous air pollutants—facilities that emitted more than 25 tons (50,000 pounds) of the hazardous pollutants a year, or 10 tons of any single one. Facilities that emitted less pollution, called ""area sources,"" would be much more lightly controlled.

The regulation Congress targeted concerns which facilities count as ""major sources.""

Since the 1990s, EPA's policy has stipulated that any ""major source"" would remain categorized as such, even if it cut pollution levels to below the certain thresholds—a policy known as ""Once in, always in."" The policy intended to keep toxic air pollution levels not just lower, but as low as possible.

But under the first Trump administration, the EPA allowed major sources to re-categorize if they had reduced their dangerous emissions. Last year, the EPA under Biden undid part of that change, once again expanding the number of facilities covered.

Since the rule change is relatively recent, Republicans in Congress could now challenge it using the Congressional Review Act. The result would be a more durable change to the law. Under the rules of the CRA, ""EPA can no longer do a similar rule or a rule that is substantially similar,"" says Carrie Jenks, an environmental law expert at Harvard University. To revisit the HAP rule once again, EPA would have to come up with a new, different argument for why to keep major sources classified as major.

The advocacy group EarthJustice estimated that the change would allow roughly 1,800 industrial facilities, like steel mills or chemical factories, to apply to be taken off the ""major sources"" list.

Pollution risks

Exposure to even small levels of the seven super-toxins is so dangerous, say environmental and public health experts, that releasing major sources from the strict regulations and controls under the ""major sources"" framework could lead to higher levels of pollution exposure in nearby communities.

""Picture some of the communities in the industrial Midwest, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio or along the Gulf in Texas and Louisiana,"" where there are many emitters of toxic air pollutants concentrated in one area, says former Biden-era assistant EPA administrator Joseph Goffman.

Even if each of them were below their individual emissions limit, the total amount of pollution in the air nearby would be high, he explains. The more stringent regulations, he says, help to keep that total amount of pollution low — and safer for people nearby.

Ultimately, what matters to human health is not how much each facility emits but how much is released altogether in a specific region, Goffman says — and the EPA's more strict regulations intended to keep that overall level low.

""It's so important to keep a focus on the total amount of toxic air pollution that the people who live there are breathing, and not just on the individual sources level of pollution,"" he says.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2121x1193+0+122/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc8%2Fe9%2Fefa10fa24df8ae0968c91a32f7e3%2Fgettyimages-1143338898.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 16:09:52.045648

Celeste Maloy’s proposal to sell off nearly 11,500 acres of public land in southwestern Utah was shot down this week after receiving bipartisan pushback in Congress.

Celeste Maloy’s proposal to sell off nearly 11,500 acres of public land in southwestern Utah was shot down this week after receiving bipartisan pushback in Congress.

The proposal, which identified parcels owned by the Bureau of Land Management to sell to Washington and Beaver counties, the Washington County Water Conservancy District and the city of St. George, was included by Maloy as part of Congress’ budget package.

But on Wednesday evening, Montana Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke, who previously said selling public lands is a line he would not cross, rallied support from a bipartisan group of lawmakers to strip Maloy’s proposal from the budget bill during a House Rules Committee meeting.

Maloy’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday morning.

Officials eye airport expansion, reservoirs and new roads under Maloy’s proposed public land sale

Maloy, in an earlier statement, said the land would help the southwest corner of the state expand water, transportation and housing infrastructure, as the region deals with rapid population growth. St. George was eying an airport expansion; the Washington County Water Conservancy District had plans to build a new reservoir; Washington County was looking to widen some existing roads.

Maloy’s amendment identified a total of 70 parcels to be sold in Utah. The proposal had a far greater impact on Nevada, with Republican Rep. Mark Amodei earmarking nearly 450,000 acres for disposal in his state.

The proposal received broad criticism from environmental groups and public land advocates, who said the bill lacked language mandating what the land would be used for. They argued there was nothing stopping the governments from purchasing the land, then using it for something other than the originally stated purpose. And some of the land abutted rivers and popular recreation areas, including Zion National Park, prompting concerns over access and environmental harm.

The proposal also had its critics in Congress, on both sides of the isle, including Zinke, who called it his “San Juan Hill,” referring to a famous Spanish-American War battle.

“I do not support the widespread sale or transfer of public lands. Once the land is sold, we will never get it back. God isn’t creating more land,” Zinke said in a news release on Wednesday.

Environmental groups celebrated the decision, issuing a flurry of statements and reactions.

Travis Hammill, the Washington D.C. director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, said Maloy is the “latest in a long list of politicians with the bad idea to try and sell off public lands.”

“The through line of those failed efforts is this: love of public lands transcends geography and political party. Americans don’t want to see these lands sold off and time and time again have risen up to make their voices heard,” Hammill said.

Kyle Roerink executive director of the Great Basin Water Network, said Zinke’s move to tank the disposal “sends a strong message to lawmakers of all stripes: We can never break the public trust and the Colorado River for billionaire tax breaks.”

Others noted the bipartisan opposition to the amendment, including Patrick Donnelly, Great Basin director for the Center for Biological Diversity, who called the attempt “appalling” and “Gilded Age-level stuff.”

“Republicans’ public lands fire sale was so greedy even their own caucus wouldn’t support it,” Donnelly said in an emailed statement. “I hope people remember it the next time Republicans try to pretend they care about public lands.”

According to the amendment’s text, about 70 parcels were identified to be sold off to four entities, at market value. Consider:

U.S. House Republicans push through massive tax and spending bill slashing Medicaid

Washington County would have been allowed to purchase 23 parcels covering about 6,492 acres.

The Washington County Water Conservancy District would have been allowed to purchase 22 parcels amounting to about 4,375 acres.

St. George would have been allowed to purchase 23 parcels amounting to about 520 acres.

Beaver County would have been allowed to purchase three parcels amounting to roughly 62 acres.

The amendment was a small part of what President Donald Trump has called the “big, beautiful bill” that has been in the works for months. The bill extends Trump’s 2017 tax law, cuts steps out of the energy permitting process, increases defense and border security spending, and makes substantial changes to Medicaid.

The Congressional Review Act explicitly excludes rules of “particular applicability” from its disapprovals process.
The Government Accountability Office has stated on two separate occasions since 2023 that California’s waivers are not subject to Congressional Review Act disapproval resolutions since they aren’t rules but rather adjudicatory orders.
Why not have the Congressional Review Act apply to those, as well?” These aren’t just far-off theoretical possibilities.
The Congressional Review Act is an obscure law that most people probably don’t realize exists.","The GOP might have just blown up the Senate on behalf of the fossil fuel industry. But that would be oversimplifying things, so bear with me. On Wednesday, the Senate voted on a series of procedural measures to establish that Congress could use the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, to “disapprove” a handful of waivers the Environmental Protection Act had granted to California last year, waivers that allow the state to set its own vehicle emission standards. Never mind that the Senate parliamentarian and Government Accountability Office had both said that Senate Republicans could do no such thing with the CRA. On Thursday, the Senate accordingly voted to rescind those waivers.

Even for those who closely follow federal environmental regulations, this week’s Senate mishegoss is a bit confusing. What is clear is that Republicans’ decision to steamroll over ordinary procedure could have sweeping consequences for California, the U.S. auto industry, and the Senate itself. In the coming years, it might also cost the party dearly.

Here’s an abbreviated overview of how Thursday’s vote happened. The federal government has, over several decades, granted California more than 100 waivers to set its own motor vehicle emissions standards. That’s because, when the government began drafting national vehicle emissions standards in 1967, California had already established its own benchmarks. While the Clean Air Act generally preempts states from setting their own rules for vehicle emissions, Congress concluded at the time that California had “demonstrated compelling and extraordinary circumstances sufficiently different from the Nation as a whole” that justified more stringent rules.

That’s not because California in the 1960s was particularly environmentalist—after all, that very same decade, it made Ronald Reagan its governor. Rather, it’s because its air quality was particularly bad. To this day, California’s heavy dependence on cars and its sizable industry make it smoggy; parts of the state have some of the country’s worst air quality. The transportation sector there—including commercial trucks and passenger vehicles—is responsible for 80 percent of smog-forming nitrous oxide pollution and 50 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions.

Owing to the Golden State’s particular situation, the Clean Air Act established a process by which the state can request exemptions (“waivers”) from the EPA. Amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1990 permitted other states to adopt California’s vehicle emissions rules, as well. Those have generally been approved by Republican and Democratic administrations alike, albeit with some protests along the way. George W. Bush’s administration, for instance, rejected California’s request to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles in 2008; the request was then approved the next year by the Obama administration. During Trump’s first term, the EPA went through standard administrative procedures to revoke a previous approval.

The Biden administration approved waivers for California’s Advanced Clean Car II program, the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, and the Omnibus Nox rule, to limit ozone pollution from trucks. These regulations—especially provisions to phase out the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035—have sparked outrage from the fossil fuel interests that have the ear of Trumpworld, including automakers and oil and gas companies, which donated generously to his campaign. Red-state attorneys general and industry groups sued over California’s clean car rules last year, and the Supreme Court has signaled that it’ll hear their case. The oil industry doesn’t like California’s Clean Air Act powers “because most clean vehicles use less gas, and they want to sell more gas,” explained Dan Becker, the director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign. “The auto industry doesn’t like it because they don’t want to make clean vehicles. They want to make gas guzzlers.”

In recent weeks, General Motors, which initially supported California’s clean car rules, urged its white-collar employees to contact their senators with scripted talking points about how they “are not aligned with market realities” and “pose a serious threat to our business.” In all, oil and gas companies, automakers, car dealers, and right-wing groups have spent more than $10 million lobbying lawmakers to claw back California’s waivers. The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers—a trade association for oil refiners, including Chevron and ExxonMobil—has been running a seven-figure campaign along the same lines, featuring targeted ad buys in Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Carolina, Texas, and Washington.

Those investments have paid off. Rather than going through the standard, somewhat lengthy process to withdraw California’s approvals, as the first Trump administration did, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin proposed doing so with the Congressional Review Act. Since 1996, the CRA has allowed governments to rescind federal rules put in place during the last six months of the previous administration. So-called CRA disapproval resolutions can be passed through the Senate with a simple majority rather than the 60 votes that are typically required to push bills through that body. They also aren’t subject to judicial review, and prevent “substantially similar” rules from being published in the future. The problem for Republicans is that the waiver approvals in question aren’t themselves rules but rather administrative actions. They also apply specifically to California and whatever states also choose to adopt the rules the EPA approves. The Congressional Review Act explicitly excludes rules of “particular applicability” from its disapprovals process.

From a legal perspective, none of this is controversial. The Government Accountability Office has stated on two separate occasions since 2023 that California’s waivers are not subject to Congressional Review Act disapproval resolutions since they aren’t rules but rather adjudicatory orders. The GAO added that even if the waiver were to satisfy the legal definition of a rule, “it would be considered a rule of particular applicability and, therefore, would still not be subject to CRA’s submission requirement because of CRA’s exclusions.” The Senate parliamentarian—the nonpartisan referee for congressional procedure—came to the same conclusion. None of that stopped House Republicans (and 35 Democrats in that chamber) from voting to advance the disapproval push to the Senate earlier this month.

In deciding to ignore the Senate parliamentarian and rescind California’s waivers with a simple majority vote, Senate Republicans have indeed gone “nuclear,” although they are attempting to dress it up as something else. Senate Majority Leader John Thune argued in January that overriding the parliamentarian’s guidance would be “akin to killing the filibuster.” He’s repeatedly insisted that the fight over California’s waivers from the EPA is just that, and “not about destroying Senate procedure or any other hysterical claim Democrats are making.” Several members of his own caucus, however—including Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins—were themselves wary of a direct confrontation with the parliamentarian and eroding the filibuster. Thune won them over by setting up a series of complicated procedural votes that would pose the confrontation indirectly instead, putting the question of whether California’s waivers are indeed eligible for disapproval using the CRA in front of the Senate rather than relying on the parliamentarian’s decision.

The fact remains that California’s waivers are not widely applicable rules, and CRA disapproval resolutions are meant only to rescind widely applicable rules—not “adjudicatory orders.” Republicans opted to ignore the GAO and the parliamentarian and seem to have opened the floodgates for what can be accomplished using the Congressional Review Act and, by extension, a filibuster-proof simple majority vote. California, meanwhile, could lose its strongest tools for meeting federal air quality regulations; the 11 other states that have signed onto its rule will revert back to following national standards. California’s inability to meet those could leave it open to sanctions from the EPA, including disruptions to its federal highway funding. “This is a prime example of how procedure and the intricacies of congressional workings can have real impacts on the planet, and it’s devastating,” Becker said. “By not allowing California to protect its people from auto pollution, air in California will get more poisonous and more deadly for kids.”

Freed to call all manner of administrative actions into question, the GOP, Becker said, is likely to “get a bad case of bloodlust and look around to see what else the Heritage Foundation and Project 2025 have put in the index for elimination.” Everything from vaccine and contraceptive approvals to broadcast licenses for media outlets that are critical of Trump could be on the chopping block, as California’s Senator Alex Padilla has argued. Should Democrats take back the government, they’d in turn have an easier time undoing the Trump administration’s actions, such as corporate merger approvals, and accomplishing more of their legislative priorities with a simple majority.

While California Attorney General Rob Bonta and others are likely to fight the disapprovals in court, CRA actions are typically insulated from legal challenges. “There’s a very open question about what happens if you apply it to things the act doesn’t cover,” said Ann Carlson, the Shirley Shapiro professor of environmental law at UCLA, who served as chief counsel and acting administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from 2021 to 2024. She reasoned, when we spoke on Wednesday, that lawsuits against this particular usage of the CRA may be able to proceed given the circumstances, but it’s too soon to tell what will happen. “If it’s insulated from judicial review,” Carlson added, “Congress can apply the CRA seemingly to anything: a license renewal, a permit, a court settlement that DOJ enters into. Why not have the Congressional Review Act apply to those, as well?”

These aren’t just far-off theoretical possibilities. Just before the Senate vote, Republicans passed their “one big, beautiful bill” through the House. In addition to gutting Medicaid, repealing large parts of the Inflation Reduction Act, and lowering taxes for the wealthy, that package includes provisions to throw out fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards put in place by the Biden administration and institute a 10-year moratorium on state-level AI regulation. Bills passed through budget reconciliation, however—and by a simple majority—have to relate to raising or spending revenue, or changing the debt limit; those parts don’t. House Republicans, who aren’t subject to those rules, may have included those sections expecting them to be stripped out by the Senate. They still could be, but the Senate has just proved its willingness to bend the rules.

“If you ignore the parliamentarian on this question,” Carlson said of the Senate’s vote on California’s waivers, “you might see reconciliation bills turn into Christmas trees with all sorts of provisions that aren’t related to revenue or the budget.”

Intentionally or not, Republicans and their donors picked a clever vehicle by which to grant themselves—and Democrats—more power under the Congressional Review Act. California’s motor vehicle regulations are a relatively niche topic, even among committed climate wonks. The Congressional Review Act is an obscure law that most people probably don’t realize exists. Whatever small number of Americans pay attention to Congress have probably been tracking budget negotiations. The barrier to entry for understanding the importance of what the Senate just did is exceedingly high. Having successfully stuck it to California, maybe the GOP will now dutifully follow the GAO and the parliamentarian’s guidance on budget reconciliation and not include any sweeping, extraneous language to overturn federal regulations or prevent states from regulating the AI developers that donate generously to them. Maybe they won’t see today’s vote as a permission slip to go hunting for actions they don’t like or find creative ways to sneak more of their legislative goals into measures that only require a simple majority of votes to pass. But they’ve certainly made all of that—and a fundamental transformation of the Senate—seem a lot more likely.",https://images.newrepublic.com/42c4f97a62bcea341509be524122bb7e7bb6c384.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg,N,,2025-05-22 17:13:33.151841

A marathon session that began Wednesday resulted in 1,100-plus page legislation that curbs billions of dollars in spending across food assistance, student loans, Medicaid and action to address climate change.

The bill, which now heads to the Senate, repeals or phases out more quickly clean energy tax credits passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act during former President Joe Biden’s term. Biden’s climate law has been considered monumental for the clean energy transition, but the House bill effectively renders moot much of the law’s incentives for renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Clean energy advocates said the bill walks back the largest government investment in clean energy in history.

“In a bid to cut taxes for billionaires and provide a grab bag of goodies to Big Oil, the majority in the House took a sledgehammer to clean energy tax credits and to the protection of our public lands,” said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“These credits are delivering billions of dollars in new investments in homegrown American energy — creating jobs, lowering energy costs and addressing the climate crisis that is fueling floods, fires and heat waves,” Goldfuss said.

President Donald Trump celebrated the bill’s passage, calling it “arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country.” Trump appealed to the Senate to pass the measure as soon as possible and send it to his desk.

The Senate hopes to wrap up its version by the Fourth of July holiday. At least four Republican senators, led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have urged continuation of energy tax credits, including support for traditional and renewable energy sources. Republican-led states and Congressional districts have benefited from billions of dollars in clean energy manufacturing investments spurred by the Biden-era subsidies.

Full-scale repeal of current credits “could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,” the senators said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota.

“A wholesale repeal, or the termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy,” the senators wrote in the April 9 letter. The letter was also signed by GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas.

In a win for House moderates and some Western lawmakers, the House bill strips language that would have allowed the sale of hundreds of thousands acres of public lands in Utah and Nevada. Opponents argued the sales would have opened the door for more oil and gas drilling.

What was gutted in the bill

The House bill takes an axe to tax credits for rooftop solar installments and eliminates electric vehicle tax credits after 2025, with a one-year exception for EVs manufactured by automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 cars that qualified for the credit.

Credits for solar and electric vehicles, which reduce harmful emissions, help to boost demand for the technologies and drive down their cost.

House Republicans also tightened tax credit restrictions for projects associated with foreign entities, including China — an added blow to domestic clean energy expansion since China dominates much of the supply chain.

The bill slashes a three-year phase-down schedule previously proposed, and instead cuts off projects that don’t start construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage. Those projects would also have to start operating before 2029.

“This bill threatens the clean energy industry at a time when it’s proving to be not only economically beneficial — lowering costs, creating jobs and fueling local economies — but also essential to America’s energy future,” said Andrew Reagan, president of Clean Energy for America, an industry group.

No sale of public lands

At the behest of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke and some other Republicans, lawmakers stripped a provision that would have sold or transferred about 460,000 acres (186,155 hectares) of federal land in Nevada and Utah to local governments or private entities.

The proposal exposed sharp divisions between Western Republicans who say the federal government controls too much of their states and others such as Zinke, a former Interior secretary in Trump’s first term whose state is protective of access to lands for hunting and recreation.

“Once the land is sold, we will never get it back,” Zinke said after the provision’s removal. ”Public access, sportsmanship, grazing tourism — our entire Montanan way of life is connected to our public lands.”

The land sales had been inserted in an early version of the bill following a late-night committee vote, despite earlier pledges from Republican leaders that land sales were off the table.

Supporters said the sales would generate revenue and ease growth pressures by creating room for more and cheaper housing in booming Western cities such as Las Vegas, Reno, Nevada and St. George, Utah. Those communities are hemmed in by federal property, which makes up 80% of the land in Nevada and 63% in Utah. Some states in the Midwest and East have 1% or less federal land by comparison.

A spokesperson for Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, who sponsored the bid to sell federal lands in his state, said his office was “exploring all options” to make the transfers happen.

Housing advocates had cautioned federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing, and some of the parcels to be sold were far from developed areas.

Tracy Stone-Manning, president of the Wilderness Society and a former director of the Bureau of Land Management Bureau under Biden, said she appreciated Zinke’s work to prevent the public lands sale.

But she added that the bill was still a “big giveaway” to the private sector. “By opening hundreds of millions of acres to drilling, mining and logging to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, this bill harms the tens of millions of people who like to hike, recreate or find solace in the outdoors,” she said.

Trump targets Biden’s climate policy

At the same time the bill slashes support for clean energy, it paves the way for oil, gas and coal.

Through the bill, natural gas pipeline developers can pay a $10 million fee for expedited permitting, and applicants for a potential liquefied natural gas export site can pay a $1 million fee to be deemed in the “public interest,” circumventing what is usually a regulatory challenge.

This will be groundbreaking as it will be the first time that Tesla vehicles will operate on public roads without anyone in the driver’s seat.","The United States House of Representatives passed President Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” by a vote of 215 to 214 on Thursday, effectively bringing an end to many EV subsidy programs, like the $7,500 tax credit, by the end of this year.

The bill will not only eliminate the $7,500 credit on new EV purchases, but also the $4,000 credit given on the purchase of used electric vehicles, and a $1,000 credit on the installation of Level 2 chargers. It will also impact solar subsidies that help generate clean energy in a residential setting.

EVs would also be subject to a $250 road use fee.

All of these things sound like negatives — truly because they are. Those who are not in a financial position to buy an EV this year, even with the tax credit, might not be able to afford them in the coming years either, unless manufacturers are able to bring pricing to a level that is more accessible to consumers.

In theory, President Trump’s focus on bringing manufacturing back to America would bring prices down, but it won’t happen overnight. Companies will take many years to completely bring manufacturing and part sourcing to the United States.

However, Tesla could feel some positives from this bill, and it all comes down to timing. Of course, in the long term, it wouldn’t be great for the company, especially if it did not have two things going on right now: a slightly lagging delivery pace and the introduction of affordable models.

Tax Credit Sunsetting Advantage

Sunsetting the $7,500 tax credit means one thing: those who have been in limbo over buying an EV from Tesla are going to have to make a decision on whether they want to buy this year and still have access to the credit, or test their luck and hope for price reductions.

More than likely, those who have been on the fence will be willing to pull the trigger this year, and Tesla will definitely gain some sales from this fact alone. Other automakers will, too.

This could help offset Tesla’s slow start to the year, which has been caused by the changeover of production lines of the Model Y across each of its factories globally.

Affordable Models

Tesla said earlier this year that it will roll out affordable models in the first half of 2025. These cars are expected to be around the $30,000 mark, but the company has not shed any true information on what they will cost.

Elon Musk has sent a stern warning to Tesla vandals, doubters, and attackers, who have subjected the company and its owners to political violence through arson and other modes of retaliation.

Over the past few months, Tesla showrooms and vehicles have been hit with numerous attacks from those who have opposed Musk and his political involvement with the Trump Administration. Although Musk has stepped back from his role within government significantly since the start of May, the company is still looked at as a political target.

While the White House has put a clear-cut line on the acts, calling them domestic terrorism and holding those responsible for the damage they have done, there are still numerous and daily instances of keying cars or worse.

Yesterday, Musk continued to send stern warnings to those who oppose Tesla and choose to handle their distaste for the company with violence and vandalism. In a Bloomberg interview at the Qatar Economic Forum, Musk was asked if he took what has happened to Tesla “over the past few months personally.”

Musk replied simply but sternly: “Yes.”

He went on to say that not only will those who vandalized the company and its products owned by consumers be held to the fullest extent of the law, but also those who fund it.

Musk also said during a CNBC interview yesterday that very few people buy a company’s products because of the CEO’s political beliefs, and many people do not even know where those CEOs stand on various social issues.

Although Musk has gone out of his way to be transparent about his beliefs, he has a valid point. He obviously felt that, because of his influence, he held a duty to uphold American values and protect what he felt was an attack on free speech and human rights.

Disagreeing with Musk and his political stances is totally reasonable, but damaging products that consumers bought from his companies is not impacting him directly. Instead, it is making consumers’ lives more difficult.

United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) Secretary Sean Duffy recently visited Tesla’s Gigafactory Texas complex, where he toured the factory’s production lines and spoke with CEO Elon Musk. In a video posted following his Giga Texas visit, Duffy noted that he believes there should be a national standard for autonomous vehicles in the United States.

Duffy’s Giga Texas Visit

As could be seen in videos of his Giga Texas visit, the Transportation Secretary seemed to appreciate the work Tesla has been doing to put the United States in the forefront of innovation. “Tesla is one of the many companies helping our country reach new heights. USDOT will be right there all the way to make sure Americans stay safe,” Duffy wrote in a post on X.

He also praised Tesla for its autonomous vehicle program, highlighting that “We need American companies to keep innovating so we can outcompete the rest of the world.”

National Standard

While speaking with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the Transportation Secretary stated that other autonomous ride-hailing companies have been lobbying for a national standard for self-driving cars. Musk shared the sentiment, stating that “It’d be wonderful for the United States to have a national set of rules for autonomous driving as opposed to 50 independent sets of rules on a state-by-state rules basis.”

Duffy agreed with the CEO’s point, stating that, “You can’t have 50 different rules for 50 different states. You need one standard.” He also noted that the Transportation Department has asked autonomous vehicle companies to submit data. By doing so, the USDOT could develop a standard for the entire United States, allowing self-driving cars to operate in a manner that is natural and safe.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk just revealed more details about the company’s June Robotaxi launch, which will kick off in Austin.

As of right now, Tesla is still set to push out the first Robotaxi rides in Austin, Texas, in early June. These vehicles will be in short supply at first, as Musk says the company is purposely rolling out the fleet in a slow and controlled fashion to prioritize safety. There will be ten vehicles in the Robotaxi fleet to start.

Tesla Robotaxi deemed a total failure by media — even though it hasn’t been released

However, in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday afternoon, Musk also revealed some other new details, including where in Austin the vehicles will be able to go, how many Robotaxis we could see on public roads within a few months, and other information regarding Tesla’s Full Self-Driving suite.

A Controlled Rollout

Tesla has maintained for a few months now that the Robotaxi fleet will be comprised of between 10 and 20 Model Y vehicles in Austin.

The Cybercab, which was unveiled by the company last October, will not be available initially, as those cars will likely be produced in 2026.

Musk said during the CNBC interview that Tesla is doing a low-yield trial at first to initiate a safety-first mentality. It is important for Tesla to launch the Robotaxi fleet in a small manner to keep things in check, at least at first.

As confidence builds and the accuracy of the fleet is ensured, more vehicles will be added to the fleet.

Musk believes there will be 1,000 Robotaxis on the road “in a few months.”

Geofenced to Certain Austin Areas

Tesla will be launching the Robotaxi program in a geofenced fashion that gives the company the ability to control where it goes. Musk says that the areas the Robotaxis will be able to travel to are among the safest neighborhoods and areas in Austin.

This is yet another safety protocol that will ensure the initial riders are not put in dangerous neighborhoods.

Some might be disappointed to hear this because of Tesla’s spoken confidence regarding Robotaxi, but the initial rollout does need to be controlled for safety reasons. An accident or incident of any kind that would put riders’ lives in danger would be catastrophic.

No Driver, No Problem

As the company has rolled out an employee-only version of the Robotaxi program in Austin and the San Francisco Bay Area, some wondered whether the rides would be driverless, as these initial trials for Tesla workers were not. Employee rides featured a human in the driver’s seat to ensure safety.

Tesla says it has launched ride-hailing Robotaxi teaser to employees only

The company did not report whether there were any interventions or not, but it did state that the vehicles traveled over 15,000 miles through 1,500 trips.

Musk confirmed during the interview that there will be no driver in the vehicle when the Robotaxi program launches in June. This will be groundbreaking as it will be the first time that Tesla vehicles will operate on public roads without anyone in the driver’s seat.

Full Self-Driving Licensing

For more than a year, Tesla has indicated that it is in talks with another major automaker regarding the licensing of Full Self-Driving. Many speculated that the company was Ford, but neither it nor Tesla confirmed this.

Musk said today that Tesla has been in touch with “a number of automakers” that have inquired about licensing FSD. Tesla has yet to sign any deal to do so.",https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Elon-Musk-Trump-Tesla-White-House-1-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 15:12:34.433837

Power Maine Forward news release

AUGUSTA, ME – More than a hundred Mainers gathered at the State House on Thursday to remind lawmakers that clean energy creates jobs and reduces costs for working families. The supporters of clean energy lined the halls of the State House before session began, and gathered for a news conference later in the morning with a unified message that investing in clean energy is simply the right thing to do.

“We know that investing in solar energy is the right thing to do,” said Brayden House, a third-year solar electrician apprentice. “To me, and hundreds of people like me, solar energy is more than just the right thing to do. It is a job. It’s a career. It’s the ability to live and work in Maine. And while I’ve been fortunate, working on clean energy sites throughout the region, times are uncertain for others. We’ve seen funding at the federal level with clean energy tax credits have been thrown into uncertainty. This uncertainty has resulted in layoffs here in Maine – both union jobs and non-union jobs. We need an environment that supports good jobs, good benefits, and strong opportunities — and we should all be in this together.”

The group gathered in support of three bills:

LD 1868, which expands the Renewable Portfolio Standard to 90 percent by 2040 and could lower household energy costs by up to $1,300 per year;

LD 1270, which establishes a cabinet-level Department of Energy in Maine; and

LD 1949, which creates new fairness and affordability standards for utilities.

“My company has a 20MW project in Sanford, which is employing Mainers,” said Dale Knapp, Head of Development with Walden Renewables. “We have more than 100 people working on that project and at least 80 percent of those workers are Maine people. These are skilled tradespeople, timber harvesters, civil operators, electricians, and the list goes on and on. And this is just one of our projects. We are one developer talking about one project in this instance. The multiplier effect is very real, and when we talk about supporting clean energy projects, we are talking about supporting careers for thousands and thousands of our fellow Maine residents and Maine families. It is simply the right thing to do.”

Solar customers were also on hand, speaking of their own experiences with investments made in clean energy based on promises. Those customers say that if the promises aren’t kept, it erodes trust with Maine people.

“The State of Maine has made it clear that they want us, as consumers, to use renewable energy,” said Leslie Geissinger of Jay, a rooftop solar customer and landowner for a community solar project in Livermore Falls. “We believe in the need for renewable energy and its value for Maine residents and the Maine economy. We count on solar lease payments as part of our farm and household income. It supports our children’s college education. So we, in good faith, put up our own investments with the promise of a program existing to support it. If that program is determined to need some adjustments, so be it. But to pull the rug out from under us is just plain wrong. While some changes might be warranted to certain aspects, we must move forward with clean energy goals rather than adopt an approach that significantly erodes every part of the existing programs. That will further erode trust in our elected body while hurting Mainers.”

Several clean energy bills are before the Legislature this session — some that advance Maine’s energy goals, and others that would retroactively change the rules. For those who have already made investments based on state policies, supporters say now is the time to move forward in good faith.

“We hear it a lot: investing in clean energy is the right thing to do,” said Eliza Donoghue, executive director of the Maine Renewable Energy Association (MREA). “We hear it a lot, because it’s true. Investments in clean energy have proven to help hardworking Mainers save money. These investments have proven to help hardworking Mainers stay working. And these investments have proven to give us and our children and grandchildren a greater chance at a cleaner, healthier future. Wind and solar are more abundant, reliable and affordable than expensive and polluting fossil fuels. If we truly want clean energy made here in Maine, we already have the infrastructure and know-how. It’s time to refine what needs refining — and move forward with a clean future for the people of Maine.”",https://www.nrcm.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Power-Maine-Forward-2025-Group-Photo-Stoomey_NRCM.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 15:11:16.581466

On Passage of the budget reconciliation bill by the U.S. House of Representatives:

“America can lead the world in the advanced energy economy, but only if we play to win. The budget reconciliation bill that just passed the House does the opposite—threatening to pull the plug on U.S. clean energy manufacturing and deployment just as it is ramping up. The cost will be measured in shuttered factories, lost jobs, and missed opportunities in communities around the country.

“Energy and manufacturing tax credits are driving deployment and investment in a wide range of zero-carbon energy sources including advanced geothermal, nuclear power, and renewables like wind and solar. Gutting those credits will raise prices for businesses and households and choke off electricity supply just at the moment when energy demand is booming.

“As the package reaches the Senate, C2ES will continue to provide policymakers the information and analysis they need to understand the enormous economic opportunity at stake – one we can’t afford to walk away from.”

C2ES released an analysis of the economic and jobs impacts of the House revisions to energy and manufacturing tax credits. Read the analysis here.

A marathon session that began Wednesday resulted in 1,100-plus page legislation that curbs billions of dollars in spending across food assistance, student loans, Medicaid and action to address climate change.

The bill, which now heads to the Senate, repeals or phases out more quickly clean energy tax credits passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act during former President Joe Biden’s term. Biden’s climate law has been considered monumental for the clean energy transition, but the House bill effectively renders moot much of the law’s incentives for renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Clean energy advocates said the bill walks back the largest government investment in clean energy in history.

“In a bid to cut taxes for billionaires and provide a grab bag of goodies to Big Oil, the majority in the House took a sledgehammer to clean energy tax credits and to the protection of our public lands,” said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“These credits are delivering billions of dollars in new investments in homegrown American energy — creating jobs, lowering energy costs and addressing the climate crisis that is fueling floods, fires and heat waves,” Goldfuss said.

President Donald Trump celebrated the bill’s passage, calling it “arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country.” Trump appealed to the Senate to pass the measure as soon as possible and send it to his desk.

The Senate hopes to wrap up its version by the Fourth of July holiday. At least four Republican senators, led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have urged continuation of energy tax credits, including support for traditional and renewable energy sources. Republican-led states and Congressional districts have benefited from billions of dollars in clean energy manufacturing investments spurred by the Biden-era subsidies.

Full-scale repeal of current credits “could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,” the senators said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota.

“A wholesale repeal, or the termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy,” the senators wrote in the April 9 letter. The letter was also signed by GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas.

In a win for House moderates and some Western lawmakers, the House bill strips language that would have allowed the sale of hundreds of thousands acres of public lands in Utah and Nevada. Opponents argued the sales would have opened the door for more oil and gas drilling.

What was gutted in the bill

The House bill takes an axe to tax credits for rooftop solar installments and eliminates electric vehicle tax credits after 2025, with a one-year exception for EVs manufactured by automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 cars that qualified for the credit.

Credits for solar and electric vehicles, which reduce harmful emissions, help to boost demand for the technologies and drive down their cost.

House Republicans also tightened tax credit restrictions for projects associated with foreign entities, including China — an added blow to domestic clean energy expansion since China dominates much of the supply chain.

The bill slashes a three-year phase-down schedule previously proposed, and instead cuts off projects that don’t start construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage. Those projects would also have to start operating before 2029.

“This bill threatens the clean energy industry at a time when it’s proving to be not only economically beneficial — lowering costs, creating jobs and fueling local economies — but also essential to America’s energy future,” said Andrew Reagan, president of Clean Energy for America, an industry group.

No sale of public lands

At the behest of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke and some other Republicans, lawmakers stripped a provision that would have sold or transferred about 460,000 acres (186,155 hectares) of federal land in Nevada and Utah to local governments or private entities.

The proposal exposed sharp divisions between Western Republicans who say the federal government controls too much of their states and others such as Zinke, a former Interior secretary in Trump’s first term whose state is protective of access to lands for hunting and recreation.

“Once the land is sold, we will never get it back,” Zinke said after the provision’s removal. ”Public access, sportsmanship, grazing tourism — our entire Montanan way of life is connected to our public lands.”

The land sales had been inserted in an early version of the bill following a late-night committee vote, despite earlier pledges from Republican leaders that land sales were off the table.

Supporters said the sales would generate revenue and ease growth pressures by creating room for more and cheaper housing in booming Western cities such as Las Vegas, Reno, Nevada and St. George, Utah. Those communities are hemmed in by federal property, which makes up 80% of the land in Nevada and 63% in Utah. Some states in the Midwest and East have 1% or less federal land by comparison.

A spokesperson for Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, who sponsored the bid to sell federal lands in his state, said his office was “exploring all options” to make the transfers happen.

Housing advocates had cautioned federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing, and some of the parcels to be sold were far from developed areas.

Tracy Stone-Manning, president of the Wilderness Society and a former director of the Bureau of Land Management Bureau under Biden, said she appreciated Zinke’s work to prevent the public lands sale.

But she added that the bill was still a “big giveaway” to the private sector. “By opening hundreds of millions of acres to drilling, mining and logging to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, this bill harms the tens of millions of people who like to hike, recreate or find solace in the outdoors,” she said.

Trump targets Biden’s climate policy

At the same time the bill slashes support for clean energy, it paves the way for oil, gas and coal.

Through the bill, natural gas pipeline developers can pay a $10 million fee for expedited permitting, and applicants for a potential liquefied natural gas export site can pay a $1 million fee to be deemed in the “public interest,” circumventing what is usually a regulatory challenge.

The Senate hopes to wrap up its version by the Fourth of July holiday. At least four Republican senators, led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have urged continuation of energy tax credits, including support for traditional and renewable energy sources. Republican-led states and Congressional districts have benefited from billions of dollars in clean energy manufacturing investments spurred by the Biden-era subsidies.

Full-scale repeal of current credits ""could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,'' the senators said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota.

""A wholesale repeal, or the termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy,” the senators wrote in the April 9 letter.

Credits for solar and electric vehicles, which reduce harmful emissions, help to boost demand for the technologies and drive down their cost.

House Republicans also tightened tax credit restrictions for projects associated with foreign entities, including China — an added blow to domestic clean energy expansion since China dominates much of the supply chain.

The bill slashes a three-year phase-down schedule previously proposed, and instead cuts off projects that don’t start construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage. Those projects would also have to start operating before 2029.

At the behest of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke and some other Republicans, lawmakers stripped a provision that would have sold or transferred about 460,000 acres (186,155 hectares) of federal land in Nevada and Utah to local governments or private entities.

The proposal exposed sharp divisions between Western Republicans who say the federal government controls too much of their states and others such as Zinke, a former Interior secretary in Trump’s first term whose state is protective of access to lands for hunting and recreation.

“Once the land is sold, we will never get it back,” Zinke said after the provision’s removal. ”Public access, sportsmanship, grazing tourism — our entire Montanan way of life is connected to our public lands.”

The land sales had been inserted in an early version of the bill following a late-night committee vote, despite earlier pledges from Republican leaders that land sales were off the table.

Supporters said the sales would generate revenue and ease growth pressures by creating room for more and cheaper housing in booming Western cities such as Las Vegas, Reno, Nevada and St. George, Utah. Those communities are hemmed in by federal property, which makes up 80% of the land in Nevada and 63% in Utah. Some states in the Midwest and East have 1% or less federal land by comparison.

A spokesperson for Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, who sponsored the bid to sell federal lands in his state, said his office was “exploring all options” to make the transfers happen.

Housing advocates had cautioned federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing, and some of the parcels to be sold were far from developed areas.

Tracy Stone-Manning, president of the Wilderness Society and a former director of the Bureau of Land Management Bureau under Biden, said she appreciated Zinke’s work to prevent the public lands sale.

But she added that the bill was still a “big giveaway” to the private sector. “By opening hundreds of millions of acres to drilling, mining and logging to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, this bill harms the tens of millions of people who like to hike, recreate or find solace in the outdoors,” she said.

At the same time the bill slashes support for clean energy, it paves the way for oil, gas and coal.

Through the bill, natural gas pipeline developers can pay a $10 million fee for expedited permitting, and applicants for a potential liquefied natural gas export site can pay a $1 million fee to be deemed in the “public interest,” circumventing what is usually a regulatory challenge.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed by House Republicans early Thursday would gut clean energy tax credits that Democrats approved three years ago while supporting increased mining, drilling and other traditional energy production.

Given these factors, our view remains unchanged that the Senate will act as a significant moderating force for many of the energy and manufacturing credits, and their changes will be much lighter in touch.","Following an intense week of negotiations among Republicans, the House passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act this morning on a party line vote of 215-214-1. The legislation passed with several last-minute modifications, including tighter restrictions on certain clean energy and manufacturing credits.

The Senate is now poised to act to craft their own version of the legislation, and we anticipate they will take a significantly different approach. More on that below.

House update

While the updated House bill significantly narrows the scope of several credits — particularly for non-nuclear participants in the tech-neutral electricity incentive — transferability was treated more favorably in the new proposal. Transferability was fully restored for both the tech-neutral and nuclear credits for the duration the credits are available. In the draft from the Ways & Means Committee, transferability was proposed to be repealed for projects that did not begin construction within 2 years of enactment. Advanced manufacturing production (45X), clean fuels (45Z), and carbon sequestration (45Q) are still subject to limitation on transferability after 2027 in the draft legislation.

A summary of the key changes:

Tech-neutral tax credit repeal timeline significantly altered (with a nuclear carveout).

At the behest of the House Freedom Caucus, the new text repeals §45Y and §48E tech-neutral electricity credits for projects beginning construction more than 60 days after enactment.

Projects that begin construction within 60 days must also be placed-in-service by December 31, 2028 to remain eligible for the credit.

The previously proposed 2029-2031 credit phasedown is now eliminated.

Eligible nuclear projects tech-neutral credit are exempted from the new 60-day requirement, and instead must only comply with the 2028 placed-in-service requirement.

Transferability is fully restored for the more limited tech-neutral credits.

A more generous credit for existing nuclear projects.

The revised legislation offers a more beneficial treatment of the §45U credit than the Ways and Means bill, extending the credit at its full value through 2031.

The legislation originally proposed a three-year phasedown.

Transferability is fully restored through the duration of the §45U credit through 2031.

The Ways and Means proposal eliminated §45U transferability after 2027.

Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions moved up to 2026.

The previous restrictions largely went into effect January 1, 2027.

This language is widely seen by experts to be unworkable.

Negative treatment of residential solar leases.

The new legislation specifically eliminates the credit for leased residential solar installations beginning January 1, 2025.

48C remains untouched

48C remains eligible for transfer, as well.

Senate outlook

Senate Republicans are expected to return from Memorial Day recess during the week of June 2 and begin writing their own version of the legislation. Given the legislation includes a debt limit increase, the Senate is compelled to act ahead of the “X” date, which the Treasury Department currently projects the U.S. will hit by mid-August. Beyond the energy provisions discussed here, the Senate will also need to grapple with cuts to Medicaid and a much higher cap on State and Local Tax (SALT) deductions. Neither set of provisions is popular in the chamber.

Importantly, multiple Senate Republicans have continued to voice their concern with making major changes to the energy and manufacturing tax credits. Following last week’s release of the Ways and Means Committee text (which provided more favorable treatment to a number of credits than the modified text passed today), numerous Republican Senators — representing both the moderate and conservative wings of their party — said significant revisions must be made to secure their support, including:

Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) indicated that there would need to be changes to save the jobs created by the credits

Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) said that the tech-neutral energy credits should have longer phase-outs to support emerging technology

Senator John Hoeven (R-ND) similarly said he expected the Senate to change the credit provisions

Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) said Senate Republicans would take “a more cautious and conscientious approach” to the credits, arguing that they should preserve the job creation and investment that came from the credits

Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) said he expects most, if not all, of the energy and manufacturing tax credits provisions to change, following previous public statements supporting the preservation of transferability

It is worth noting that, historically, the House version of a reconciliation bill represents the biggest change to law, with the Senate playing the role of narrowing the approach. A good recent example was the initial House-passed version of what eventually became the Inflation Reduction Act. The House version — initially dubbed Build Back Better — cost nearly $2 trillion and made sweeping investments in social programs, healthcare, education, and housing in addition to clean energy and manufacturing. The Senate passed a much smaller package, where moderates raised concerns about inflationary effects, cost, and the scope of the programs. It was later reworked into the IRA, which passed in August 2022 with a narrower focus on climate, healthcare, and deficit reduction.

Conclusion

As the House was moving towards passage of legislation estimated to add roughly $3 trillion to the national debt, yesterday's spike in the treasury yields — and resulting reaction by the equity markets — underscored policymaking does not occur in a vacuum and could create further pressure on the Senate to significantly limit the scope of the bill.

Given these factors, our view remains unchanged that the Senate will act as a significant moderating force for many of the energy and manufacturing credits, and their changes will be much lighter in touch. Moreover, support for transferability remains strong and we believe that it will emerge largely in place in any potential enacted law.

Please note, this is a fluid situation and any analysis is subject to change. We will continue to monitor developments and provide timely updates as the legislative process unfolds.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64e46c9ca980cf228bbbbf55/682f37c92ba2e42a374b29c2_adam-michael-szuscik-P8P-P0x7RkI-unsplash%20-%20meta.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 15:11:25.012248

The letter was also signed by GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas.

In a win for House moderates and some Western lawmakers, the House bill strips language that would have allowed the sale of hundreds of thousands acres of public lands in Utah and Nevada. Opponents argued the sales would have opened the door for more oil and gas drilling.

What was gutted in the bill

The House bill takes an axe to tax credits for rooftop solar installments and eliminates electric vehicle tax credits after 2025, with a one-year exception for EVs manufactured by automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 cars that qualified for the credit.

Credits for solar and electric vehicles, which reduce harmful emissions, help to boost demand for the technologies and drive down their cost.

House Republicans also tightened tax credit restrictions for projects associated with foreign entities, including China — an added blow to domestic clean energy expansion since China dominates much of the supply chain.

The bill slashes a three-year phase-down schedule previously proposed, and instead cuts off projects that don’t start construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage. Those projects would also have to start operating before 2029.

“This bill threatens the clean energy industry at a time when it’s proving to be not only economically beneficial — lowering costs, creating jobs and fueling local economies — but also essential to America’s energy future,” said Andrew Reagan, president of Clean Energy for America, an industry group.

The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry, applauded the bill as a step to “restore American energy dominance.”

“By preserving competitive tax policies, opening lease sales” for oil and gas drilling and advancing permitting reforms, the legislation “is a win for our nation’s energy future,” API President Mike Sommers said in a statement.

No sale of public lands

At the behest of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke and some other Republicans, lawmakers stripped a provision that would have sold or transferred about 460,000 acres (186,155 hectares) of federal land in Nevada and Utah to local governments or private entities.

The proposal exposed sharp divisions between Western Republicans who say the federal government controls too much of their states and others such as Zinke, a former Interior secretary in Trump’s first term whose state is protective of access to lands for hunting and recreation.

“Once the land is sold, we will never get it back,” Zinke said after the provision’s removal. ”Public access, sportsmanship, grazing tourism — our entire Montanan way of life is connected to our public lands.”

The land sales had been inserted in the bill following a late-night committee vote, despite earlier pledges from Republican leaders that land sales were off the table.

Supporters said the sales would generate revenue and ease growth pressures by creating room for more and cheaper housing in booming Western cities such as Las Vegas, Reno, Nevada, and St. George, Utah. Those communities are hemmed in by federal property, which makes up 80% of the land in Nevada and 63% in Utah.

A spokesperson for Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, who sponsored the bid to sell federal lands in his state, said his office was “exploring all options” to make the transfers happen.

Housing advocates had cautioned federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing, and some of the parcels to be sold were far from developed areas.

Tracy Stone-Manning, president of the Wilderness Society and a former director of the Bureau of Land Management under Biden, said she appreciated Zinke’s work to prevent the public lands sale.

But she said the bill was still a “big giveaway” to the private sector. “By opening hundreds of millions of acres to drilling, mining and logging to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, this bill harms the tens of millions of people who like to hike, recreate or find solace in the outdoors,” she said.

Trump targets Biden’s climate policy

At the same time the bill slashes support for clean energy, it paves the way for oil, gas and coal.

Through the bill, natural gas pipeline developers can pay a $10 million fee for expedited permitting, and applicants for a potential liquefied natural gas export site can pay a $1 million fee to be deemed in the “public interest,” circumventing what is usually a regulatory challenge.

A marathon session that began Wednesday resulted in 1,100-plus page legislation that curbs billions of dollars in spending across food assistance, student loans, Medicaid and action to address climate change.

The bill, which now heads to the Senate, repeals or phases out more quickly clean energy tax credits passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act during former President Joe Biden’s term. Biden’s climate law has been considered monumental for the clean energy transition, but the House bill effectively renders moot much of the law’s incentives for renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Clean energy advocates said the bill walks back the largest government investment in clean energy in history.

“In a bid to cut taxes for billionaires and provide a grab bag of goodies to Big Oil, the majority in the House took a sledgehammer to clean energy tax credits and to the protection of our public lands,” said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“These credits are delivering billions of dollars in new investments in homegrown American energy — creating jobs, lowering energy costs and addressing the climate crisis that is fueling floods, fires and heat waves,” Goldfuss said.

President Donald Trump celebrated the bill’s passage, calling it “arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country.” Trump appealed to the Senate to pass the measure as soon as possible and send it to his desk.

The Senate hopes to wrap up its version by early July. At least four Republican senators, led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have urged continuation of energy tax credits, including support for traditional and renewable energy sources. Republican-led states and Congressional districts have benefited from billions of dollars in clean energy manufacturing investments spurred by the Biden-era subsidies.

Full-scale repeal of current credits “could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,” the senators said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.

“A wholesale repeal, or the termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing … job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy,” the senators wrote in the April 9 letter. The letter was also signed by GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas.

In a win for House moderates and some Western lawmakers, the House bill strips language that would have allowed the sale of hundreds of thousands acres of public lands in Utah and Nevada. Opponents argued the sales would have opened the door for more oil and gas drilling.

What was gutted in the bill

The House bill takes an axe to tax credits for rooftop solar installments and eliminates electric vehicle tax credits after 2025, with a one-year exception for EVs manufactured by automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 cars that qualified for the credit.

Credits for solar and electric vehicles, which reduce harmful emissions, help to boost demand for the technologies and drive down their cost.

House Republicans also tightened tax credit restrictions for projects associated with foreign entities, including China — an added blow to domestic clean energy expansion since China dominates much of the supply chain.

The bill slashes a three-year phase-down schedule previously proposed, and instead cuts off projects that don’t start construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage. Those projects would also have to start operating before 2029.

“This bill threatens the clean energy industry at a time when it’s proving to be not only economically beneficial — lowering costs, creating jobs and fueling local economies — but also essential to America’s energy future,” said Andrew Reagan, president of Clean Energy for America, an industry group.

The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry, applauded the bill as a step to “restore American energy dominance.”

“By preserving competitive tax policies, opening lease sales” for oil and gas drilling and advancing permitting reforms, the legislation “is a win for our nation’s energy future,” API President Mike Sommers said in a statement.

No sale of public lands

At the behest of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke and some other Republicans, lawmakers stripped a provision that would have sold or transferred about 460,000 acres (186,155 hectares) of federal land in Nevada and Utah to local governments or private entities.

The proposal exposed sharp divisions between Western Republicans who say the federal government controls too much of their states and others such as Zinke, a former Interior secretary in Trump’s first term whose state is protective of access to lands for hunting and recreation.

“Once the land is sold, we will never get it back,” Zinke said after the provision’s removal. ”Public access, sportsmanship, grazing tourism — our entire Montanan way of life is connected to our public lands.”

However, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.)","The Senate voted Thursday to axe California’s phaseout of new gas-powered cars, making a controversial move to sidestep the parliamentarian in the process.

The vote was 51-44, and the measure now heads to President Trump’s desk; he is expected to sign it.

The move is a massive one for the U.S. vehicle market and for the planet, as automakers would no longer have to work toward an electric-only future in California and the 11 other states that have adopted its rule.

But it also has significance regarding Senate procedure, as the upper chamber moved to circumvent a ruling from its parliamentarian finding that it could not vote down the measure with just a simple majority.

What the Senate actually overturned is not the California mandate itself, but the Biden administration’s approval of the Golden State’s policy.

The parliamentarian determined that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approval was not subject to a congressional maneuver that allowed it to evade the filibuster’s 60-vote threshold.

Both the House and Senate have voted to axe federal approval of California’s standard using the Congressional Review Act (CRA), which allows Congress to strike down recently approved regulations with a simple majority.

But the Senate parliamentarian and Congress’s Government Accountability Office (GAO) have found that the Biden administration EPA’s decision is not subject to the act because it is a waiver, not a regulation.

However, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) held a series of procedural votes Wednesday night that aimed to sidestep the parliamentarian’s ruling.

In particular, he raised “points of order” that allowed the Senate to vote for itself on whether EPA waivers are subject to be overturned by the CRA.

“When the Senate is facing a novel situation like this one … it is appropriate for the Senate to speak as a body to the question, something the Senate does when questions over applications of the rules arise,” Thune said during a floor speech.

In response, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) reiterated that the waiver is not a rule.

“What was unprecedented was for the House to send over a document, claiming, falsely according to the parliamentarian, that the waiver is in fact a rule under the CRA and to blame the GAO or the parliamentarian for that is to mistake the referee from the player that committed the foul.”

“The foul here is pretending that a waiver is a rule and both the GAO and the parliamentarian independently blew the whistle on that foul.”

Democrats this week have accused their Republican colleagues of “going nuclear” — arguing that ignoring the parliamentarian’s decision undercuts the filibuster — under which most Senate legislation requires 60 votes to pass.

The Clean Air Act allows California to set stricter-than-federal standards for vehicular pollution, with EPA approval, due to its historic smog problems. In 2022, the state said it would ban new sales of gas-powered cars by 2035.

The Biden administration approved that rule in December.

Republicans celebrated the elimination of the rule — arguing that they were preserving consumers’ ability to drive whatever vehicle they want.

“Washington bureaucrats will not dictate the vehicles we can drive in Wyoming or across America. Republicans rejected the Democrats’ delusional dream of banning gas-powered vehicles forever. We rejected their effort to force-feed electric vehicles to every single American,” said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) in a written statement.

Democrats disagreed, arguing that the move would lead to more pollution.

“Today’s vote will leave millions of Californians with dirtier air for generations to come,” said Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) in a writtne statement. “Every state should prepare to have their own policies targeted in the years to come. Today, it was California’s ability to set its own air quality standards. Tomorrow, it will be another state’s program, grant, or law.”

They took to Capitol Hill to showcase the economic, energy, and geopolitical benefits of the tax credits in 100 meetings with GOP lawmakers and the White House.

Clean energy tax credits have a long history of bipartisan support.","Ceres issued the following statement after today’s early-morning vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on a budget reconciliation bill that severely curtails clean economy tax credits and incentives.

“The legislation passed today by the U.S. House of Representatives would raise taxes on American advanced manufacturing and energy production, while introducing uncertainty and red tape that freezes investment in key sectors. It is unfortunate the bill passed in this unworkable form, all but eliminating clean economy incentives, even as leading companies in communities across the country warned about the severe impacts to energy affordability, job growth, and U.S. global competitiveness,” said Zach Friedman, senior director of federal policy, Ceres. “Businesses need policy certainty as they invest and plan to reshore jobs and supply chains and build critical infrastructure. Unless redone, this legislation will raise prices across the country, resulting in less energy and more scarcity. It is the equivalent of waving the white flag of surrender to China and other countries for investment in strategic core industries including AI, critical minerals, batteries, autos, energy, steel, and aluminum, and it will threaten our economic, energy, and national security.

The legislation also includes provisions to defund and delay the Methane Emissions Reduction Program and the Waste Emissions Charge, both of which aim to reduce waste and bring more gas to the market. Ceres issued a statement early this year emphasizing the importance of these programs to help U.S. oil and gas producers control highly potent methane pollution and stay competitive in global markets that are seeking transparency on methane pollution.

“As this legislation moves forward, we are grateful to members of Congress from both parties and chambers who have expressed concerns about cutting these incentives. We are excited to work with business leaders and the Senate in the weeks ahead on legislation that achieves our shared national goals of energy dominance, affordability, and domestic manufacturing growth so that America can compete and win against China and other countries in this century’s most important industries,” added Friedman.

Ceres has long worked with businesses and investors across the economy in support of maintaining clean energy tax credits and other federal programs, with an active advocacy role in this year’s budget reconciliation negotiations. In March, 80 leading businesses and investors joined Ceres’ flagship advocacy event LEAD on a Clean Economy 2025, including Carrier, Danone, DHL, dsm-firmenich, Ecolab, Ford Motor Co., Heirloom Carbon, HASI, Holcim, IKEA US, Lucid, Lutron, Michelin, Schneider Electric, and Siemens. They took to Capitol Hill to showcase the economic, energy, and geopolitical benefits of the tax credits in 100 meetings with GOP lawmakers and the White House. Companies returned to Capitol Hill for follow-up meetings in April and May, and plan to engage in further meetings with the Senate in June.

Amid the advocacy meetings, many key Republican lawmakers have publicly indicated support for maintaining clean energy tax credits. In April, four GOP members of the U.S. Senate issued their own letter cautioning against repealing tax credits that boost U.S. manufacturing, reduce energy prices, and provide policy certainty for businesses.

Clean energy tax credits have a long history of bipartisan support. Since they were extended and expanded by Congress in 2022, the private sector has capitalized on the long-term policy certainty by investing more than $420 billion into about 750 clean energy projects in the U.S., creating more than 400,000 jobs. Most of the benefits – including new factories, jobs, restored domestic supply chains, and affordable domestically produced electricity – are accruing in states and districts represented by Republicans in Congress.

Air testing by community groups can fill gaps in monitoring programs conducted by industry and state regulators, advocates say, and provide real-time alerts when accidents happen.
Several community groups said in a complaint in Louisiana federal court on Thursday that the law's ""onerous restrictions"" violate their rights to free speech and to petition the government.
""I'm not sure how regulating community air monitoring programs 'violates their constitutional rights,'"" Murril said in a statement to NPR.
""We've asked people, can you give us an example of where community air monitoring data has been misused in a government enforcement case?","Community groups in Louisiana have filed a federal lawsuit alleging a state law that regulates air-pollution monitoring violates their constitutional rights.

Private organizations have been using low-cost air sensors to detect toxic pollution from the state's refineries and chemical plants. The testing, some of which has been funded by the Environmental Protection Agency, serves as a critical line of defense, environmental and public health advocates say, especially for residents of an industrial corridor in Louisiana known as Cancer Alley. Air testing by community groups can fill gaps in monitoring programs conducted by industry and state regulators, advocates say, and provide real-time alerts when accidents happen.

Last year, Louisiana lawmakers put new requirements on those community testing activities. The law says that for community groups to allege violations of environmental rules, they have to use federally-approved monitoring equipment, and it sets restrictions for analyzing and sharing the data.

Several community groups said in a complaint in Louisiana federal court on Thursday that the law's ""onerous restrictions"" violate their rights to free speech and to petition the government.

""This is just an obvious attempt to keep citizen groups from doing any monitoring,"" says David Bookbinder, a lawyer for the plaintiffs and the director of law and policy at the Environmental Integrity Project, which helps frontline communities push for tough environmental standards.

""The impact has been muzzling — groups either stopping doing monitoring, not starting to do monitoring that they wanted to do or no longer publishing results,"" Bookbinder says.

The community groups' free-speech claims are based on Louisiana's alleged restrictions on ""publicly discussing, advocating for cleanup action, or warning people about potentially dangerous air pollution"" when it's detected using air monitors that don't meet federal standards, according to the Environmental Integrity Project.

Jo Banner, co-director of The Descendants Project, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, says the new law has made it harder to take action against polluters.

""We are prepared to just keep moving forward with the work that we've been doing and trying our best to communicate that to the public,"" Banner says. She adds, ""If we have [data] that is alarming, our community needs to know for their own safety.""

Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said she'll fight the lawsuit. ""I'm not sure how regulating community air monitoring programs 'violates their constitutional rights,'"" Murril said in a statement to NPR.

The state's Department of Environmental Quality declined to comment on pending litigation. The bill's sponsor, Republican Sen. Eddie Lambert, didn't respond to messages seeking comment.

The air-monitoring law, which had bipartisan support, says the intent is to ensure the public gets ""accurate air quality information.""

David Cresson, chief executive of the Louisiana Chemical Association, said in a statement that the air-monitoring law doesn't prevent community groups from collecting or sharing data. ""What this law clarifies is that if air monitoring data is going to be used to trigger regulatory enforcement, penalties, or as the sole source for a lawsuit, it must meet the same EPA-approved standards already required of industry and government agencies,"" Cresson said.

Critics say ambiguities in the law are part of the problem

George Wyeth, a visiting scholar at the Environmental Law Institute, says the law is still concerning. For example, if community groups detect high levels of certain pollutants in their area and suggest there's been an environmental violation, it's unclear if that would break the new law. It's also unclear, Wyeth says, what groups have to do when they analyze and communicate air-pollution data to comply with the law.

""If I were a community member, I wouldn't know what some of these [requirements] meant, and I would probably just stay away from it,"" says Wyeth, a former EPA lawyer who isn't involved in the lawsuit.

Kentucky recently enacted a law that's similar to Louisiana's.

Those laws were passed following several years during which community groups conducted more air monitoring as lower-cost testing equipment became widely available, says Jay Benforado, board chair of the Association for Advancing Participatory Sciences, which isn't involved in the Louisiana lawsuit.

However, Benforado says it's unclear if there's an actual problem that needs solving by passing laws like those in Louisiana and Kentucky. ""We've asked people, can you give us an example of where community air monitoring data has been misused in a government enforcement case? And we haven't come across any examples,"" he says.

Banner of The Descendants Project says the Louisiana law effectively labels groups like hers as ""troublemakers.""

""If you want to see bipartisan cooperation, you should look to Louisiana and the way that we invite industry to come in, and the dangers that communities face,"" Banner says. ""And both sides, all sides, support this.""

Democratic state lawmakers who represent Banner's district didn't respond to a message seeking comment.

""It is the job of our regulatory agencies to protect us, to protect our air, to protect our health. And if that standard is not being met and people are going out to do it by themselves, that seems to be indicating that there's a problem at that first step,"" says Peter DeCarlo, an atmospheric chemist at Johns Hopkins University who has studied air pollution in Louisiana.

DeCarlo was part of a team of researchers that found the toxic gas ethylene oxide in parts of Louisiana at levels that were significantly higher than EPA estimates for the region. That suggests residents there face much greater cancer risks than previously thought, DeCarlo says.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4756x2675+0+314/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3e%2Ff3%2Ff9061fd24cdd9b45625d6d5aae77%2Fap19337772764695.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 18:13:20.254261

The measure overturning the rule now goes to the White House, where Trump is expected to sign it, along with two other resolutions that would block California rules curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks. All three measures were approved by the Senate on Thursday and by the House earlier this month.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, and state air regulators say that what Congress is doing is illegal and they will sue to keep the rules in place.

“This is not about electric vehicles,” Newsom said at a news conference while the Senate was still voting on the measures. “This is about polluters being able to pollute more.”

California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state plans to sue over the way that Republicans passed the measures blocking the emissions rules. Senate Republicans established a narrow exception to the filibuster Wednesday to clear the way for the votes.

The GOP effort could have a profound impact on California’s longtime efforts to curb air pollution. California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends — especially because about a dozen states have already followed California's lead. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.

Senate Democrats charged that Republicans are acting at the behest of the oil and gas industry and they say California should be able to set its own standards after obtaining waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency.

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the votes should “send a chill down the spine of legislators in every state.""

“What we have at stake is a state’s ability, it’s right to make its own laws and to protect its own citizens, without having this body overturn that right,” Schiff said.

Republicans say the phaseout of gas-powered cars, along with other waivers that California has obtained from the EPA, is costly for consumers and manufacturers, puts pressure on the nation’s energy grid and has become a de facto nationwide electric vehicle mandate.

“America cannot meet these impossible standards –- not next year, and not in 10 years,” said Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the second-ranking Republican.

Newsom announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles within 15 years as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.

The Biden administration approved the state’s waiver to implement the standards in December, a month before Trump returned to office. The California rules are stricter than a Biden-era rule that tightens emissions standards but does not require sales of electric vehicles.

Biden’s EPA said in announcing the decision that opponents of the California waivers did not meet their legal burden to show how either the EV rule or a separate measure on heavy-duty vehicles was inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.

Republicans have long criticized California's waivers and have worked to find a way to overturn them. The Government Accountability Office said earlier this year that California’s policies are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows Congress to reject federal regulations under certain circumstances with a simple majority vote not subject to the filibuster. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that ruling, but Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., cleared the way for the votes anyway with a workaround that established a new Senate precedent.

Democrats fought those changes, which were the latest attempt to chip away at the Senate filibuster after both parties have used their majorities in the past two decades to lower the threshold for nominations. Democrats tried in 2022 to roll back the filibuster for legislation, as well, but were thwarted by members of their own caucus who disagreed with the effort.

Republicans have insisted that they would not try a similar move after regaining the majority this year. But Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the move to block California’s laws were a “point of no return” and called the Republicans “fair weather institutionalists.”

Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan was the only Democrat to support the measure to block the phaseout of gas-powered vehicles. She said in a statement after the vote that she has a “special responsibility to stand up for the more than one million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry.”

John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an auto industry association and lobby group, said there is a gap between the vehicles that car buyers are purchasing and the rules that would force a transition to electric vehicles.

“The fact is these EV sales mandates were never achievable,"" Bozzella said.

The Republican-led Senate revoked a waiver instituted under then-president Joe Biden that allowed the Golden State to set aside national pollution standards for cars and set its own more stringent regulations.

But the Senate's rubber stamp of a House-passed bill is likely to be challenged in court, setting up a battle royale between California's left-leaning government and President Donald Trump.

California Governor Gavin Newsom warned Trump's Republicans ahead of the vote against action that would ""cede American car-industry dominance to China and clog the lungs of our children.""

The West Coast state's San Joaquin Valley and its biggest city, Los Angeles, historically tolerated persistent smog before decades of efforts to clean up the worst air pollution in the country.

Part of that push was a mandate ensuring that a third of new 2026 model cars sold in the state must be zero-emission, rising to two-thirds in 2030 and 100 percent in 2035.

Republicans in Washington argue that this is costly, unworkable and anathema to consumer choice.

""California got special permission from the Biden administration to ban gas-powered cars. Because of their market share, this would impact the entire nation,"" said right-wing Utah Senator Mike Lee.

""But Gavin Newsom doesn't get to ruin 49 other states.""

Republicans argue that the Congressional Review Act gives them the right to overturn California's carve-out on a simple majority vote.

But Democrats say Thursday's move was illegal, as nonpartisan watchdogs including the Government Accountability Office and the Senate Parliamentarian said the CRA could not be applied to waivers.

The Senate has only overruled its parliamentarian a handful of times in since the role was launched in the 1930s.

Trump harshly criticized electric vehicles (EVs) as he sought reelection, despite significant federal funding allocated to projects in Republican districts, where thousands of jobs are expected to be created.

He took aim at the sector as part of his flurry of executive orders on his first day in office in a bid to ensure what he called a ""level"" playing field for gasoline-powered motors.

But he has not been consistent in his opposition -- even taking time out of his schedule to promote former right-hand man Elon Musk's prestige EV company Tesla at the White House.

US EV sales reached 1.3 million units last year, up 7.3 percent from 2023, according to Cox Automotive's Kelley Blue Book, but automakers have recently scaled back investments, pointing to slowing demand growth.

Newsom, a Democrat, announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles within 15 years as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector.
The California rules are stricter than a Biden-era rule that tightens emissions standards but does not require sales of electric vehicles.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate voted on Thursday to block California’s first-in-the nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, moving to kill the country's most aggressive effort to transition toward electric vehicles as President Donald Trump’s administration has doubled down on fossil fuels.

The measure overturning the rule now goes to the White House, where Trump is expected to sign it, along with a second one to block rules curbing tailpipe emissions from medium and heavy-duty vehicles. The Senate was also poised to pass a third measure later Thursday to overturn rules on smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks. All three were approved by the House earlier this month.

The GOP effort, which comes after Senate Republicans established a new exception to the filibuster, could have a profound impact on California’s longtime efforts to curb air pollution. California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends, especially because about a dozen states follow California's lead. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, and state air regulators say that what Congress is doing is illegal and they will likely sue to keep the rules in place. Senate Democrats charged that Republicans are acting at the behest of the oil and gas industry and they say California should be able to set its own standards after obtaining waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency.

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the votes should “send a chill down the spine of legislators in every state.""

“What we have at stake is also a state’s ability, it’s right to make its own laws and to protect its own citizens, without having this body overturn that right,” Schiff said.

Republicans say the phaseout of gas-powered cars, along with other waivers that California has obtained from the EPA, is costly for consumers and manufacturers, puts pressure on the nation’s energy grid and has become a de facto nationwide electric vehicle mandate.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said ahead of the votes that the waivers would “end up not just affecting the state of California, but the whole country,” especially as around a dozen states have already followed California’s lead.

Newsom, a Democrat, announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles within 15 years as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.

The Biden administration approved the state’s waiver to implement the standards in December, a month before Trump returned to office. The California rules are stricter than a Biden-era rule that tightens emissions standards but does not require sales of electric vehicles.

The 10 Oldest U.S. Presidents

Biden’s EPA said in announcing the decision that opponents of the California waivers did not meet their legal burden to show how either the EV rule or a separate measure on heavy-duty vehicles was inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.

Republicans have long criticized California's waivers and have worked to find a way to overturn them. The Government Accountability Office said earlier this year that California’s policies are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows Congress to reject federal regulations under certain circumstances with a simple majority vote not subject to the filibuster. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that ruling, but Republicans created a procedural workaround through a series of votes on Wednesday that established a new Senate precedent and cleared the way for the vote.

Democrats fought the changes, which were the latest attempt to chip away at the Senate filibuster after both parties have used their majorities in the past two decades to lower the threshold for nominations.

This marks the second consecutive year of a two-month increase, according to S&P Global Mobility. Vehicle registrations reached over 16 million in 2024, the first time since 2019. That growth did not offset the rising number of older vehicles.

Vehicle registrations surpassed 16 million in 2024 for the first time since 2019. This was not enough to offset the growing volume of aged vehicles as vehicles in operation grew to 289 million with a steady 4.5% scrappage rate. Passenger cars dropped below 100 million for the first time since the 1970s, according to S&P Global Mobility’s research.

“Passenger cars are continuing a steady decline toward equilibrium as consumer preference shifts to light trucks,” said Todd Campau. “The vehicle fleet continues to demonstrate impressive resilience even as it faces stress from high new and used prices and economic uncertainty.”

The average passenger car age climbed to 14.5 years. Light trucks showed gradual growth in average age, reaching 11.9 years.

Regional Differences in Vehicle Aging

Northern Plains, Northwest, and Southern states report higher-than-average vehicle ages. Montana leads with a vehicle age over five years higher than average.

States like Mississippi, North Dakota, and D.C. show accelerating vehicle aging. Colorado and Hawaii show slower increases in average vehicle age.

“The macro trend for average age may not correlate with what consumers see in their community,” said Campau. “Aging rates can vary significantly from region to region.”

Electric Vehicle Age Trends and Hybrid Shifts

Battery Electric Vehicles now face upward pressure on average age for the first time in years. BEV sales growth has slowed, which contributes to the aging trend. The average BEV age remains low at 3.7 years in 2024.

This growth matches the broader vehicle market trend and supports tracking Electric Vehicle Age Trends going forward.

Plug-In Hybrid average age remains flat at 4.9 years. Traditional Hybrids decreased in average age from 6.9 years to 6.4 in one year.

“Consumer preference currently is favoring hybrid and plugin hybrid options over fully battery electric vehicles to a large extent,” said Campau. “Driving average age to flat or even negative for those propulsion types.

“Alternative propulsion average age will continue to depend heavily on consumer sentiment for the next several years. As they continue to build overall share in the vehicle fleet.”

Aftermarket Opportunities as Fleet Expands

New and used vehicle prices remain high across the U.S. The national fleet grew to 289 million in 2024, up 3 million. These trends will expand opportunities in the aftermarket.

First, a bill passed by the U.S. House this morning moves to end the Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits for clean energy, including electric-vehicle tax credits. Then the U.S. Senate voted to end a so-called waiver that allows California to set its own emissions standards, which are followed by more than a dozen other states and sought to regulate all-electric new car sales by 2035.

The House vote was for Trump's ""One, Big, Beautiful Bill,"" which would enact sweeping tax cuts and dramatically reduce federal spending. Those cuts end the $7,500 tax credits used to purchase or lease new EVs, although it provides an exception for cars from manufacturers that have not sold 200,000 EVs placed in service by the end of 2026.

It also ends tax credits for home refueling infrastructure, kills the $4,000 tax credit for used EVs and plug-in hybrids, and kills the tax credit that subsidized the production of solar energy components, wind energy components, battery components and inverters.

The bill also makes it more expensive to own an EV, instituting a new ""Car Tax"" for EV and hybrid owners to the tune of $250 and $100, respectively.

Provisions of the House bill may be excluded as it heads to the Senate. However, EV and clean-energy advocates were quick to say that repealing the IRA's provisions at this level would effectively hand the future of power over to China, which is already significantly ahead on EVs, battery power and solar production.

Ben Prochazka, the executive director of the nonprofit Electrification Coalition, said that the House bill will also heavily impact jobs in the U.S. Clean-energy jobs, including in the EV and battery space, have largely been concentrated in red and purple states.

“The bill passed by the House this morning takes a sledgehammer to the U.S. EV industry and undermines efforts to build robust, secure and reliable access to critical minerals,"" Prochazka said. ""Removing these credits would pull the rug out from under the auto industry and other industries related to EVs at a critical time, immediately putting American jobs at risk.""

Albert Gore III, the executive director of the nonprofit Zero-Emission Transportation Association (ZETA), concurred in a similar statement.

""A vote to dismantle that now is not just a policy misstep but a signal that the United States is retreating from its goal to be competitive with China in the battery and mineral sector,"" Gore said. ""If this bill is enacted into law as currently written, members of Congress should not be surprised when critical mineral mining and refining projects stall and billions in manufacturing investments evaporate in states that have worked hard to attract these jobs and economic opportunities.""

There was much speculation as to how Republican members of Congress would vote on the bill, given how many of them have EV-related projects in their districts. Earlier this year, for example, Georgia Rep. Buddy Carter—whose district includes Hyundai's new electric and hybrid Metaplant—told InsideEVs that Congress should not take a ""sledgehammer"" to the IRA to avoid putting investments like that at risk.

However, Carter voted today with his colleagues to pass the bill. ""“This is a once-in-a-generation bill that will unlock President Trump’s full domestic agenda, which Georgians voted for overwhelmingly back in November,"" Carter said in a statement. ""Will they stand with the people of Georgia by preventing the largest tax hike in American history, or will they bend the knee to Chuck Schumer by siding with the liberal elites?”

The continent’s longtime electric favorite was overtaken by Chinese company BYD in April, which sold 7,231 fully electric cars compared to Tesla’s 1,165, according to data from Jato Dynamics.

It’s a major boon for the Chinese electric vehicle company, which only began selling cars in Norway and the Netherlands in late 2022. But Musk’s recent support for Donald Trump and the U.S. president’s far-right, government-destroying policies has influenced buyers, leading to boycotts at home and abroad that have drastically affected Tesla’s margins.

“This is a watershed moment for Europe’s car market, particularly when you consider that Tesla has led the European battery electric vehicle market for years, while BYD only officially began operations beyond Norway and the Netherlands in late 2022,” Felipe Munoz, global analyst at Jato Dynamics, told the Financial Times.

Tesla historically attracted a more liberal consumer base with its electric vehicles, but since Musk went “dark MAGA,” that same base has soured on the tech billionaire and his products. That’s proven especially true in some of Europe’s stronger economies, such as Germany, which has seen Tesla sales in the country fall by more than 70 percent in the beginning of the year, reported Bloomberg. Sales in China—where Tesla has two major factories—similarly plummeted, falling by 49 percent in February.

Musk, however, has brushed off the volatility. Speaking with Bloomberg at the Qatar Economic Forum on Tuesday, the world’s richest man pointed to Tesla’s rising stock as evidence that bullish investors were likely to ignore his political activism.

“We’ve lost some sales perhaps on the left, but we’ve gained them on the right. The sales numbers at this point are strong and we see no problem with demand,” the Tesla CEO said. “The stock wouldn’t be trading near all-time highs if things weren’t in good shape, they’re fine, don’t worry about it.”

Republicans narrowly passed Donald Trump’s sweeping budget reconciliation bill through the House Wednesday night, including a last-minute provision that would not require gun owners to register the purchase of silencers.

Georgia Representative Andrew Clyde had already ensured the elimination of a $200 transfer tax on gun silencers. But during negotiations Wednesday, he was able to add another provision altogether removing silencers from the regulatory purview of the National Firearms Act, which imposes taxes on the manufacture, distribution, and import of weapons, according to Politico.

The last-minute addition would strike another $200 tax on the manufacture of gun silencers. But by removing silencers from the purview of the National Firearms Act, lawmakers said that the change also had eliminated the NFA’s registration requirement with the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives.

“The question I have is, this was not in the bill that we were marking up. So, whose vote was bought with this provision that silencers will no longer need to be registered with the ATF or subject to background check purchasers?” asked Colorado Representative Joe Neguse on the House floor Wednesday night.

“What member was on the fence about this bill, and then went to Republican leadership and said, ‘I know you’re eliminating the tax on silencers but if you can just eliminate all regulation on silencers, I will vote for this bill?’”

Georgia Representative Austin Scott claimed that silencers’ exception from ATF registry did not mean that purchasers would not be subject to background checks. Scott, who argued in support of the provision, seemed confused about what it was actually about. He said it was about suppressors, rather than silencers—but that was incorrect.

When a person attempts to buy a firearm, they must complete an ATF form, and the seller then relays information to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation website. The NICS staff then performs a check to see whether the buyer has a criminal record or is in any way ineligible to purchase the firearm.

If the purchaser is not required to fill out a form with the ATF to purchase a silencer, it’s not clear how a background check would still be completed.

“Quite frankly, what is in the reconciliation bill does more to support assassins than it does American families,” said Massachusetts Representative Jim McGovern.

There was some laughter in the hall.

“Yeah, well you know what? Talk to law enforcement, talk to people who have been victims of gun violence,” McGovern continued. “I know you think it’s funny, but I don’t.”

Over a dozen officials within the Trump administration conveniently sold off their shares just days before their president crippled the stock market with his sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs, according to ProPublica.

Attorney General Pam Bondi sold up to $5 million in her Trump Media shares on Liberation Day. One State Department official sold $50,000 in shares two days before. A White House lawyer sold off shares in nine different companies in February, the day before Trump announced tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy sold shares in nearly 36 companies on February 11, two days before Trump teased his Liberation Day reciprocal tariffs. In each of the more than dozen instances, someone high up within the Trump administration sold off large amounts of their stock market shares right before Trump tanked the stock market, and some even bought a similar amount of shares back at much lower prices shortly after.

There is no direct proof that these officials had nonpublic information about policies that would impact the stock market before everyone else, but the administration has clearly created an environment in which the potential for insider trading is incredibly high. And even if this administration isn’t insider trading, it’s doing an awful job at keeping up appearances. Trump himself posted in April, “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT,” a mere four hours before announcing a 90-day pause on most retaliatory tariffs except for those on China, yet another market-shocking announcement that caused stocks to shoot up.

“Trump is creating giant market fluctuations with his on-again, off-again tariffs. These constant gyrations in policy provide dangerous opportunities for insider trading,” Senator Adam Schiff wrote on X at the time. “Who in the administration knew about Trump’s latest tariff flip flop ahead of time? Did anyone buy or sell stocks, and profit at the public’s expense? I’m writing to the White House—the public has a right to know.”

While Republicans managed to pass their budget bill through the House Thursday morning, one GOP representative was not happy, calling it a “debt bomb ticking.”

Representative Thomas Massie warned his colleagues, still debating in the middle of the night, that he couldn’t vote for a bill that would cut taxes and increase spending.

“I’d love to stand here and tell the American people, we can cut your taxes and we can increase spending and everything’s going to be just fine. But I can’t do that because I’m here to deliver a dose of reality,” Massie said. “This bill dramatically increases deficits in the near term but promises our government will be fiscally responsible five years from now.

“Where have we heard that before? How do you bind a future Congress to these promises? This bill is a debt bomb ticking,” added the Kentucky congressmen, known for his libertarian views. Massie was one of two Republican “no” votes on the bill, along with Representative Warren Davidson of Ohio. One Republican, Representative Andy Harris of Maryland, voted “present.” Every Democrat voted against the bill.

Massie hammered the bill, warning that “very soon, the government will be paying $16,000 of interest, interest alone, per U.S. family,” and that the national debt would skyrocket up to $30 trillion over the next 10 years.

“Congress can do funny math, fantasy math, if it wants,” Massie added. “But bond investors don’t.

“We’re not rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic tonight. We’re putting coal in the boiler and setting a course for the iceberg,” he added, to applause from other members in the room.

In one final message, Massie laid into his colleagues and his party, saying, “If something is beautiful, you don’t do it after midnight.”

Throughout the budget reconciliation process, Massie has warned that he wouldn’t support the bill, even taking attacks from Donald Trump, who threatened to have him “voted … out of office” on Tuesday. While the GOP passed the bill without him, Trump is known for holding grudges, and could turn most of the Republican Party against Massie in the near future.

More on this terrible bill:

House Republicans passed Trump’s “big, beautiful” spending bill by just one vote early Thursday morning.

After hours of deliberation, the bill passed 215–214, an incredibly slim margin that highlights the lack of political cohesion within the GOP. Two Republican representatives—Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio—voted with the Democrats.

The bill will include even more funding for the military and more funding for Trump’s border crackdown, while slashing crucial programs like Medicaid, Medicare, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and also repealing clean energy credits put in place by the Biden administration. Up to 15 million Americans will be uninsured by 2034 due to the bill’s cuts, and 7.6 million will be at risk of losing Medicaid, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.

“What we’re going to do here this morning is truly historic, and it will make all the difference in the daily lives of hardworking Americans.… To put it simply, this bill gets Americans back to winning again, and it’s been a long time coming,” Speaker Mike Johnson said, in a floor speech prior to the vote.

Democrats are accusing the GOP of pushing the anti-working-class bill “under the cover of darkness.”

“Here’s what it will mean for the American people,” Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said, prior to the vote. “Children will get hurt. Women will get hurt. Older Americans who rely on Medicaid for nursing home care and for home care will get hurt. People with disabilities who rely on Medicaid to survive, will get hurt. Hospitals in your districts will close. Nursing homes will shut down. And people will die.”

More on this disaster of a bill:

Elon Musk’s shouting match with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent might have been the final nail in the coffin for the tech billionaire’s four-month stint in the White House, but it came after months of bubbling frustration at Musk’s “chain-saw” approach to dismantling the federal government.

Musk and Bessent exploded at each other in April when Musk attempted to force through his pick to lead the IRS—Gary Shapley—behind Bessent’s back. (Musk eventually lost this battle—Shapley lasted less than 72 hours before Bessent tapped Michael Faulkender to replace him.)

“Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!” a typically mild-mannered Bessent was heard shouting after Musk as they charged down the halls of the West Wing.

“The fight had started outside the Oval Office; it continued past the Roosevelt Room and toward the chief of staff’s office, and then barreled around the corner to the national security adviser’s warren,” The Atlantic reported Wednesday.

But the gossip-worthy feud was just one of many that occurred between Musk and Trumpworld 2.0’s prominent members.

In March, Musk walked into what he understood to be an ambush, facing heated backlash from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. Donald Trump had arranged the volatile meeting: “Bring them all in here, and we’ll have at it,” Trump said, according to The Atlantic. The advisers were frustrated with what they felt was Musk overstepping into their agencies.

Musk’s tenure wasn’t a total failure, according to former federal employees. He had managed to force out some of the federal workforce and shutter agencies (while “traumatizing the employees who remain,” The Atlantic reported). But ultimately, his Department of Government Efficiency’s Silicon Valley, hacking-and-slashing approach to reshaping the government failed to make bureaucracy more efficient. And some of his haphazardly introduced policies, such as requiring federal employees to submit weekly bullet-pointed progress reports, have quietly fallen by the wayside.

“He had some missteps in all of these agencies, which would have been fine because everyone acknowledges that when you’re moving fast and breaking things, not everything is going to go right. But it’s different when you do that and you don’t even have the buy-in of the agency you’re setting on fire,” one outside Trump adviser told The Atlantic.

Another adviser was a little more blunt. “How many people were fired because they didn’t send in their three things a week or whatever the fuck it was?” the adviser said anonymously. “I think that everyone is ready to move on from this part of the administration.”

And even those still on Musk’s side now see that a different approach would have been more effective at advancing the administration’s goals.

“In retrospect,” Matt Calkins, the CEO of Appian, a Virginia-based company that provides software for the federal government, told The Atlantic, “it wasn’t nearly as much as we needed, and we probably didn’t need the chain saw. We needed the chisel.”

Musk’s unceremonious exit from government followed widespread reports that several senior Trump officials practically hated the tech billionaire, finding him abrasive, unfunny, and pompous—with some describing Musk as the “most irritating person” they’d “ever had to deal with.”

“I have been in the same room with Elon, and he always tries to be funny. And he’s not funny. Like, at all,” a senior Trump official told Rolling Stone last month. “He makes these jokes and little asides and smiles and then looks almost hurt if you don’t lap up his humor. I keep using the word ‘annoying’; a lot of people who have to deal with him do. But the word doesn’t do the situation justice. Elon just thinks he’s smarter than everyone else in the room and acts like it, even when it’s clear he doesn’t know what he’s talking about.”",https://images.newrepublic.com/63f786998ef30787187c5135d378eceeadaa690f.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg,N,,2025-05-22 15:12:59.759545

Chevrolet just bestowed upon the Silverado EV a heavy new trim option. The brawny, off-road-focused Trail Boss trim—long a favorite among gas-powered truck fans—joins the electric lineup for 2026. For anyone who felt the Silverado EV was missing a little truck under all that tech, this one’s for you.

In order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from Chevrolet.

Trail Boss Comes To A New Land

Trail Boss has always been Chevy’s answer to rough trails and steep hills. It debuted on the gas-powered Silverado back in 2019 and has been a hot seller since. Now, GM is electrifying that hot trim. “Adding Trail Boss to Silverado EV gives customers an option that builds on our strong truck pedigree, high electric range, and off-road capability,” said Chevy VP Scott Bell.

The 2026 Silverado EV Trail Boss starts delivering this summer, and if you’re into off-roading, there’s a lot to like. Ground clearance jumps by 24% over the base Silverado EV thanks to a 2-inch lift, and a unique coil suspension system with something called “hydraulic rebound control” gives it a composed ride on weird and technical terrain. It wears beefy 35-inch all-terrains on exclusive 18-inch wheels, and includes a high-approach front fascia, red tow hooks, and trim-specific badging. It looks the part and acts like it.

2026 Silverado EV Trail Boss Performance

Performance? Yeah, it’s got that too. Up to a teeth-rattling 725 horsepower and 775 lb-ft of torque are available if you stretch to the Max battery pack, and the extended-range model tows 12,500 pounds with 2,100 pounds of payload. For comparison, that’s more than the Ford F-150 Lightning Pro, which puts it squarely in Raptor territory for muscle, all without burning a drop of fuel.

There’s Also Something Called Sidewinder Mode

And then there’s Sidewinder mode, a low-speed trick that turns all four wheels in the same direction to let the Trail Boss move diagonally. It’s a party trick, sure, but it also makes crawling over rocks or sliding into a tight garage spot surprisingly easy. Assuming tricks like this don’t cause more problems than they solve, when combined with Terrain mode, Off-Road mode, and 4-Wheel Steer, this isn’t just a street truck in hiking boots; it’s a real-deal tech-powered off-roader.

Trail Boss Interior

Inside the truck, Chevy didn’t go wild, but the Trail Boss gets a few unique interior touches, plus a bank of auxiliary switches ready for winches or lights — unfortunately, Chevy didn't provide interior images of the Trail Boss. And yes, it still features the big 17.7-inch center screen, paired with an 11-inch driver display, even on the base Work Truck for 2026.

It Ain’t Cheap

Prices start at $72,095 for the Trail Boss with the extended-range battery. A Max battery version is also available for $88,695, bringing more power and nearly 480 miles of range. Not cheap, but considering the capability and the fact that Chevy has dropped the limited RST launch trim, the Trail Boss is now the EV lineup’s flagship.",https://static1.topspeedimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2026-chevrolet-silverado-ev-trail-boss.jpeg,N,,2025-05-22 17:14:27.792224

US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax package will raise prices for all types of energy, risk hundreds of thousands of jobs, and cut GDP by $1tn during the next eight years, say analysts.

The House of Representatives passed the 1,000-page bill by a single vote on May 22. It will now proceed to the Senate, with a July 4 deadline for reaching the president’s desk.

The bumper bill includes various tax breaks for corporations and upper-to-middle class households, and will reportedly add more than $3.3bn to the US national debt. To pay for this, the government will cut many of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy programmes.

It proposes ending most electric vehicle tax credits this year and all by the end of 2026, phasing out clean energy tax credits by 2032 and terminating residential efficiency credits by the end of 2025.

But while much attention has focused on the clean energy cuts, the bill could harm American energy and growth across the board, says research company Energy Innovation.

It would increase cumulative energy costs for all US households by more than $16bn by 2030, even if oil and gas production rises and fossil fuel prices fall as a result, says Energy Innovation.

These changes “create near-term impacts that persist over time”, adds the company, risking more than 830,000 jobs in 2030. This would result in a cumulative GDP decrease of more than $1tn by 2034.

“The IRA was arguably the single largest policy action taken anywhere in the world, and today the House has largely repealed that,” Manish Bapna, president and chief executive of the Natural Resources Defense Council, tells Sustainable Views. “I don’t anticipate a drop [in clean energy] in absolute terms, but growth will taper off. No policy is better than inconsistent policy.”

Clean energy warns of investment collapse

These losses in investment and jobs come in addition to the $10.9bn in cancelled clean energy and technology projects the US has already racked up this year, as companies attempt to navigate tariff chaos, the freezing of IRA grants and loans, and a regulatory environment undergoing major upheaval.

Renewable energy is undoubtedly the heaviest hit sector, and the share price of solar and wind companies fell in the hours following the vote.

Eighty-four per cent of investor respondents to a March survey by the American Council on Renewable Energy said they would scale back their investments if tax credits are repealed.

American Clean Power Association CEO Jason Grumet said in a statement that “there is a sensible way to phase down clean energy incentives”, but a sudden policy shift will wreak havoc on energy prices, workers and local economies across the country.

Meeting growing demand

Grumet pointed out that more than 90 per cent of electricity added to the grid in 2023 came from “the clean sources threatened by this legislation”.

While the Trump administration acknowledges increasing power demand — driven in large part by the growth of artificial intelligence — his executive orders so far have focused on boosting production of oil and gas, and even coal.

According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, however, there is no realistic path to meeting growing electricity demand without a major scale-up of solar power.

Yet the bill’s changes to technology-neutral production tax credits will significantly slow deployment of new electricity-generating capacity just as demand is growing, says Energy Innovation. Its analysis projects a decrease in total new electricity capacity by 114 gigawatts by 2030, which would push up electricity costs by up to 50 per cent by 2035.

Fossil fuels stay quiet

Renewables companies have not been the only IRA beneficiaries. According to professional services company Baker Tilly, the IRA gave oil and gas entities access to nearly $500bn in new federal funding and tax credits — for renewables, but also for carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel.

While CCS receives sharp criticism from environmentalists for being costly and unproven, these credits have been widely used by fossil fuel companies and remain untouched in the current bill.

This makes CCS “the biggest winner” of the reconciliation bill, says Wood Mackenzie research analyst Rohan Dighe.

Chevron, ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum have used the IRA’s CCS credits, with Exxon also using IRA credits to pursue “low-carbon hydrogen projects”.

Exxon CEO Darren Woods said in 2024 that he is “very supportive” of the IRA, which has “especially benefited” his company. Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub said in 2022 that the IRA is “a net positive bill for us”.

However, conventional energy companies have been reluctant to comment on the reconciliation bill. BP, Occidental and Shell declined to comment “on a rapidly evolving process”. Other energy companies, including Exxon, did not respond to Sustainable Views’ request for comment.

Meanwhile, an American Petroleum Institute spokesperson points to a number of statements the association has published as the bill has progressed, in which its president and CEO, Mike Sommers, praises legislation “to ensure a smart regulatory framework for expanded American energy development” and that “supports American energy leadership”.

Justin Bibb, mayor of Cleveland, Ohio, says more businesses from across the economy should have been speaking up in support of the IRA. This is particularly true because “private sector pressure goes a lot further under this administration”, he tells Sustainable Views.

While local efforts to pursue clean energy projects will continue, “there is no substitute for federal investment in these projects at the state and local level”, Bibb says. “I will keep making the case to my delegates in the Senate and the House that if we want to see Ohio grow, we have to keep these tax credits in place.”",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/493039c3-bf9f-4ae1-85e0-9d7cbb6703d7.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 14:18:37.515515

Yet, despite the significant economic, health, and environmental benefits of EVs, they remain shrouded in misinformation and partisan rhetoric.

It’s not surprising that funding needed to expand access to EVs and EV charging would be a target of the current Trump administration.

Recent actions by the administration undermine a multiyear effort to expand the national electric vehicle charging network. Early in the Trump administration, the Federal Highway Administration indefinitely “suspended” the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program, a $5 billion national initiative to build electric vehicle charging stations along major highway corridors, undermining years of work and planning.

Who loses

There are no winners here. Without these funds, rural communities that are already falling behind in the transition to electric vehicles will be left further behind. Areas already designated charging deserts will remain just that.

Suspending the program delays critical investments, widens infrastructure disparities, and sends the message that taxpayers who’ve been left behind the longest will be the last to benefit.

Omega Wilson, co-director at CleanAIRE NC

In 2021, Congress voted on a bipartisan basis to provide billions of dollars in guaranteed federal funding to expand the availability and reliability of EV charging. The NEVI program is at the heart of this effort, as a cornerstone for closing the charging gap. Without NEVI, progress toward a connected network of charging stations will stall — leaving many communities behind at a pivotal moment for EV adoption.

Southern states — like every other state in the country — have spent the last few years planning and preparing to roll out this program, only to face the threat of the federal government pulling the plug just as they’re poised to move forward with key sections of the interstate EV charging network. Now, more than half a billion dollars promised to states where SELC operates hangs in the balance — jeopardizing years of planning and progress, and leaving communities with broken promises and a stalled transition to the charging network they were counting on.

On May 7, 16 states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, arguing that the Federal Highway Administration and U.S. Department of Transportation acted unlawfully and in violation of the Constitution when they indefinitely froze the NEVI Formula Program.

Now SELC (representing Plug in America, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, CleanAIRE NC, and the West End Revitalization Association), Sierra Club, Earthjustice (representing Climate Solutions), and NRDC have joined that fight, intervening in a May 22 legal filing.

“Our clients are joining this challenge because the administration’s unlawful and indefinite freeze of the NEVI funding puts too much at stake,” said Senior Attorney Megan Kimball. “Halting the NEVI program directly undermines our progress toward clean, reliable transportation choices — especially in rural and underserved communities across the Southeast, where EV infrastructure is still catching up and communities are depending on this investment to close the gap.”

Pumping the brakes on clean transportation

Transportation is the leading source of climate pollution in the U.S., and halting the NEVI program will stall critical progress in shifting drivers toward cleaner, electric vehicles. Without a reliable and accessible charging network, drivers are less likely to make the switch to EVs, especially in areas where charging options are already limited.

“We’ve spent years working to accelerate transportation electrification across the South — where clean mobility is critical for climate, health, and economic opportunity,” said Stephen Smith, Executive Director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. “The NEVI Program is one of the most practical tools we have to help states build reliable, accessible EV charging where it’s needed most. Suspending it puts hard-won progress at risk and leaves Southern communities without the resources to lead in the transition to clean energy.”

Attacks from all sides

The attacks on EVs and clean transportation aren’t just coming out of D.C. Politicians in several states have continued to oppose commonsense efforts that make it easier for drivers to choose an EV:

In Virginia, after three years of failed efforts to repeal the legislative directive that Virginia implement Clean Cars standards through the General Assembly, last summer Governor Glenn Youngkin illegally announced that he would end the state’s participation in program that would substantially cut tailpipe pollution.

In North Carolina, lawmakers quietly inserted a budget provision blocking the state from adopting cleaner vehicle standards — denying residents the health and environmental benefits of reduced tailpipe pollution, without public debate or accountability.

States across the country are imposing punitive EV fees — often higher than what gas drivers pay in fuel taxes. These excessive fees discourage EV adoption and penalize drivers choosing cleaner, more sustainable options, sending a contradictory message about the region’s commitment to modernizing transportation and reducing pollution.

Trip Pollard leads SELC’s Land and Community program and reiterates that all of these actions are taking the South in the wrong direction.

Electrifying transportation offers tremendous economic, health, and environmental benefits.

Trip Pollard, Leader of SELC’s Land and Community program

“There is a critical need for the South, and really the entire country, to curb carbon emissions and other tailpipe pollution, increase access to EVs and charging, and move the auto industry into the future,” added Pollard. “None of that can be achieved by scrapping EV policies and adding hurdles to consumer purchase of cleaner vehicles.”

Come together, right now

EVs are here to stay, and reliable access to EV charging should be available to everyone, no matter where they live or travel.

Omega Wilson, co-director at CleanAIRE NC, sums it up best when he said, “For decades, communities like ours in Alamance County, North Carolina, have been denied access to basic public health infrastructure. The NEVI Program offered a real chance to change that—with public investment in EV charging that finally included rural Black and Brown neighborhoods.”

But it requires all nonfederal labs still using the compound to implement strict workplace safety measures between May and October of this year. The first deadline, which passed on May 5, requires labs to measure workers’ initial exposure levels.

Under the May 20 proposal, labs would instead need to implement these requirements between November 2026 and May 2027.

Shortly after the initial rule was finalized, several lab safety professionals told C&EN that the short timeline could pose considerable challenges, particularly to smaller institutions with fewer resources. In its announcement of the possible extension, the EPA says it heard similar concerns from labs associated with universities and local governments.

“EPA’s proposal would avoid disrupting important environmental monitoring and associated activities, while these non-federal labs work to comply with the rule’s new requirements,” the agency says.

According to the EPA, the current compliance deadlines will remain in effect until the proposal is finalized, but enforcing them will be a low priority for the agency.

For Kristi Ohr, assistant director of academic safety at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the possible extension doesn’t make much of a difference for her institution, which “have had full provisions of the program implemented for some time now.”

Meanwhile, Laura Dwyer, the chemistry lab coordinator at the University of Mount Union, says that the news comes as a welcome surprise to the main research lab that uses methylene chloride on her campus. The researchers now have more time to figure out if they’ll need to implement additional exposure controls for experiments that use larger amounts of the solvent, Dwyer says.

Ohr and Dwyer both say they’re glad to see the EPA responding to the feedback it has received from labs.

As part of the proposal, the agency is also planning to review additional information about the costs of exposure monitoring and other barriers to compliance. The EPA will be accepting comments for 30 days after the proposal is published in the Federal Register.

The extension announcement comes as the EPA battles two petitions asking courts to review the methylene chloride rule—one brought forth by two Texas-based paint companies and the other by the Sierra Club, an environmental advocacy group. The two petitions have since been consolidated by the court, with oral arguments scheduled for June 3.

In a court document filed last week, the EPA said it will defend some parts of the regulation, but “will no longer defend the position on the single risk determination and personal protective equipment issues.”

The former refers to a decision made during the Joe Biden administration that chose to weigh the risk of a compound across multiple uses instead of making individual risk determinations for each use of a chemical. The latter refers to the EPA’s approach to base the risk determination of methylene chloride on what the exposure levels would be if users were to wear no personal protective equipment.","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/EPA-Methylene-Chloride-Rule-Update---84831?$responsive$&wid=700&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2",N,,2025-05-22 15:12:17.755063

The Senate was planning to vote Thursday on two other Congressional Review Act resolutions to block other California vehicle emissions rules by scrapping Biden-era EPA waivers.

The action comes after Senate Republicans took procedural steps Wednesday to defy the chamber’s parliamentarian, who had agreed with the Government Accountability Office in saying the waivers were not rules to be repealed under the CRA.

Slotkin joined her Democratic colleagues in opposing the GOP’s procedural maneuvers but ended up voting against the most contentious of California’s transportation rules.

“Today, I voted to prevent California and the states that follow its standard from effectively banning gas-powered cars by 2035,” Slotkin said in a statement.

“Michigan is the auto capital of the world, and as Michigan’s U.S. Senator, I have a special responsibility to stand up for the more than one million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry.”

The Congressional Review Act allows lawmakers and the president to repeal newly issued rules by simple majority. The Trump EPA submitted the waivers as rules so Congress could repeal them.

The Clean Air Act gives California leeway to enact tougher emissions standards than the federal government, as long as they receive permission. Michigan’s other Democratic senator, Gary Peters, voted against the resolution.

Slotkin, a former House member, promised during her Senate campaign that she would oppose any EV mandate. “What you drive is your call,” she said in one ad.

Democrats have been urging Senate Republicans against defying GAO and the parliamentarian. They forced a series of protest votes Wednesday to thwart the GOP’s plans.

“What you’re really doing here is for the fossil fuel industry, going nuclear, overruling the Senate parliamentarian, to accomplish a legislative task to amend, basically, the Congressional Review Act,” said Environment and Public Works ranking member Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.).

“The fossil fuel industry hates this clean air standard because it sells less gasoline in the states where the clean air standard is there.”

Senate Environment and Public Works Chair Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) helped persuade colleagues — including GOP moderates concerned about defying the parliamentarian — to pull the trigger.

“The decision to limit consumer choice, increase car prices, and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs was made by California, and approved by a federal administration that had already been rejected by the American voters,” Capito said in a floor speech.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/ed/5e/74c47ec54621b3693795e66b3158/hegseth-confirmation-23846.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 14:20:06.252659

“Trucking is an industry of innovators.","Washington — The American Trucking Associations is calling today’s votes in the U.S. Senate nullifying California’s electric-vehicle mandate a “monumental victory” for the trucking industry, common sense, and consumers everywhere.

“California is the breeding ground of all bad public policy, and it’s long past time that our nation’s leadership in Washington stop abdicating its responsibility to unelected, cubicle-dwelling bureaucrats in Sacramento who have no understanding of the real world and how it works. Today’s Senate action sends a resounding message nationwide that this is not the United States of California, nor will it ever be,” said ATA President and CEO Chris Spear. “We appreciate the leadership of President Trump, EPA Administration Zeldin, and leaders in Congress who listened to our concerns and acted decisively to reverse this destructive rulemaking, which would have decimated our industry and unleashed a torrent of economic pain on the American families and businesses that we serve.”

Last month, ATA sent a letter urging Republican congressional leaders in the House and Senate to vote on two resolutions that will undo damaging regulations set by California and prevent the Golden State from setting de facto national vehicle policies. The House has already adopted the resolutions, leaving the Senate as the final hurdle necessary to clear these measures for the President’s signature.

The resolution that passed the Senate today was championed by Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Nebraska). It will revoke an EPA waiver that allowed California and other states to enforce its Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT) regulation. ACT, which has been adopted by 11 states, requires medium- and heavy-duty truck manufacturers to sell increasing percentages of zero-emission vehicles from 2024-2035.

Soon, the Senate is expected to advance another resolution championed by Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Oklahoma) that will revoke an EPA waiver that allowed California and other states to enforce its Low NOx Omnibus rule. This rule, which has been adopted by 10 states, imposes stringent emissions standards on new truck sales.

Both mandates are untethered from reality and would have been extraordinarily costly to fully implement. Even states that adopted the standards are acknowledging reality by scaling back and delaying implementation.

Trucks today produce 99% fewer nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate matter emissions than those on the road decades ago, and new trucks cut carbon emissions by over 40 percent compared to a truck manufactured in 2010. As a result, 60 of today’s trucks emit what just one truck did in 1988.

“Trucking is an industry of innovators.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate voted on Thursday to block California’s first-in-the nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, moving to kill the country’s most aggressive effort to transition toward electric vehicles as President Donald Trump’s administration has doubled down on fossil fuels.

The measure overturning the rule now goes to the White House, where Trump is expected to sign it, along with a second one to block rules curbing tailpipe emissions from medium and heavy-duty vehicles. The Senate was also poised to pass a third measure later Thursday to overturn rules on smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks. All three were approved by the House earlier this month.

The GOP effort, which comes after Senate Republicans established a new exception to the filibuster, could have a profound impact on California’s longtime efforts to curb air pollution. California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends, especially because about a dozen states follow California’s lead. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, and state air regulators say that what Congress is doing is illegal and they will likely sue to keep the rules in place. Senate Democrats charged that Republicans are acting at the behest of the oil and gas industry and they say California should be able to set its own standards after obtaining waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency.

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the votes should “send a chill down the spine of legislators in every state.”

“What we have at stake is also a state’s ability, it’s right to make its own laws and to protect its own citizens, without having this body overturn that right,” Schiff said.

Republicans say the phaseout of gas-powered cars, along with other waivers that California has obtained from the EPA, is costly for consumers and manufacturers, puts pressure on the nation’s energy grid and has become a de facto nationwide electric vehicle mandate.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said ahead of the votes that the waivers would “end up not just affecting the state of California, but the whole country,” especially as around a dozen states have already followed California’s lead.

Newsom, a Democrat, announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles within 15 years as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.

The Biden administration approved the state’s waiver to implement the standards in December, a month before Trump returned to office. The California rules are stricter than a Biden-era rule that tightens emissions standards but does not require sales of electric vehicles.

Biden’s EPA said in announcing the decision that opponents of the California waivers did not meet their legal burden to show how either the EV rule or a separate measure on heavy-duty vehicles was inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.

Republicans have long criticized California’s waivers and have worked to find a way to overturn them. The Government Accountability Office said earlier this year that California’s policies are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows Congress to reject federal regulations under certain circumstances with a simple majority vote not subject to the filibuster. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that ruling, but Republicans created a procedural workaround through a series of votes on Wednesday that established a new Senate precedent and cleared the way for the vote.

Democrats fought the changes, which were the latest attempt to chip away at the Senate filibuster after both parties have used their majorities in the past two decades to lower the threshold for nominations. Democrats tried in 2022 to roll back the filibuster for legislation, as well, but were thwarted by members of their own caucus who disagreed with the effort.

Republicans have insisted that they would not try a similar move after regaining the majority this year. But Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the move to block California’s laws were a “point of no return” and called the Republicans “fair weather institutionalists.”

Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan was the only Democrat to support the measure to block the phaseout of gas-powered vehicles. She said in a statement after the vote that she has a “special responsibility to stand up for the more than one million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry.”

John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an auto industry association and lobby group, said there is a gap between the vehicles that car buyers are purchasing and the rules that would force a transition to electric vehicles.

“The fact is these EV sales mandates were never achievable,” Bozzella said.

Last Updated on:

The California Energy Commission (CEC) recently published some very interesting EV sales information. Zach already wrote an article about it.

I reached out to the CEC to ask some questions to get its perspective on what is happening in the Golden State. What jumped out in the answers was something of a stunning fact. There are about 178,549 EV charging ports in California. I never knew the total number of CA gas stations, so I looked today, thinking it must be a pretty big number. Turns out its only about 15,000 gas stations or less, depending on what source you use.

So, California has way, way more EV charging ports than gas stations and will continue to add many more EV chargers. Additionally, the 178,549 EV charging ports total does not include the estimated 700,000 EV charging ports in homes.

The more fair comparison would be EV charging ports to gas nozzles. So, how many gas nozzles in CA? About 120,000, but there are still far more EV charging ports than that in CA. And, there are more EV charging ports being added regularly.

It is very obvious to anyone who follows sustainable transportation that there is a relationship between electric vehicle adoption and charging infrastructure. California has the most EV chargers of any US state and the most electric vehicles. EV sales are supported by the presence of charging infrastructure. There’s another stunning fact bolded and italicized below in the answers about how the vast majority of Californians live rather close to an EV charger.

CEC staff answered the following questions for CleanTechnica.

Despite market disruptions, how are California ZEV sales remaining steady?

Consumers are buoyed by more choices and are feeling confident in California’s growing ZEV infrastructure. 94% of Californians live within 10 minutes of an EV charger. The California Energy Commission (CEC) is deploying funds to further expand the state’s charger network and ensure that EV charging is reliable, affordable and accessible to all Californians.

In Q1 2025, CA non-Tesla electric vehicle (EV) registrations grew by 14%. What drove this growth?

The EV market is diversifying in California, with 147 EV models available in Q1, up from 105 models in Q1 of last year. What drove this diversification?

For both of these questions, I’ll direct you to Liane Randolph’s quote in our press release: “California’s clean vehicle market continues to show strong sales, and we are undeterred by this period of limited growth, which is a normal, anticipated part of the technology adoption cycle. The data shows nearly 1 in 4 new car shoppers are still choosing zero-emission models which is encouraging given current economic uncertainty,” said CARB Chair Liane Randolph. “While one manufacturer notably dropped in sales, other manufacturers’ sales collectively increased by 14%. From spacious SUVs to sporty sedans, automakers are delivering desirable options across every segment, and many new offerings are experiencing encouraging consumer uptake. Despite political headwinds domestically, zero-emission vehicles are the future internationally because they’re fast, fun and cheaper to fuel and maintain. America will not be left behind.”

How many public and private EV chargers are operating in California?

As of February 2025, there are 178,549 public and shared private electric vehicle chargers in California. Out of the 178,549 EV chargers installed in the state, 162,178 are Level 2 chargers and 16,971 are fast chargers. In addition to the public network, the CEC estimates that more than 700,000 Level 2 chargers are installed statewide in single-family homes.

How many electric vehicles are operating in California?

As of the end of 2024, there were 1,899,831 light-duty ZEVs in California, 1,453,994 of which are battery-electric.

What incentives are available in California for residents to buy EVs?

Grants and rebates for thousands of dollars are available for low-income Californians to purchase EVs. Learn more at ClimateAction.ca.gov or ElectricForAll.org.

If the federal EV tax credits are repealed, might the state of California take action to keep its own going or expand them?

The CEC has no comment at the time.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RS-3.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 15:11:08.054669

The work started through a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) GAIN voucher and contributed to Elementl’s recent agreement with Google to prepare three U.S. sites for advanced nuclear deployment.

Each site would have at least 600 megawatts of capacity and would likely be used to power large-scale data centers.

Data Centers, Nuclear Energy and Siting

Nuclear energy can provide around-the-clock abundant and reliable electricity, making it an attractive solution to meet rising energy demand from AI and data centers. However, the process for siting nuclear power plants can be complicated and time intensive.

As part of its recently announced agreement with Elementl, Google will provide early-stage capital to develop three sites for advanced reactor projects with final technology selection and site confirmation pending further development milestones.

Elementl uses a proprietary, multi-criteria siting framework to assess dozens of candidate locations for advanced reactor deployment across the United States—enabling faster, lower-risk project development.

The company leveraged ORNL’s OR-SAGE siting tool to further enhance its in-house methodology, adding additional rigor and geospatial precision to its early-stage development process.

Elementl and ORNL’s collaboration was catalyzed by a 2022 GAIN voucher award, which provided access to the nation’s national laboratory complex and expertise to help overcome technological and commercialization challenges.

“This voucher allowed us to accelerate critical pre-development work that would otherwise take years to replicate on our own,” said David Faherty, Elementl co-founder and Chief Commercial Officer. “ORNL’s OR-SAGE platform gives us a data-driven foundation to screen regional siting options efficiently and allows our team to layer in our own project-specific criteria with greater speed and confidence.”

What’s Next?

Elementl will continue the evaluation of potential technology, engineering, procurement and construction activities, as well as other project partners. The company will prioritize sites for accelerated development, with an option for Google to take the commercial offtake at a later final investment decision.

The company will continue to leverage their work with ORNL to expedite the siting of nuclear power projects in the United States to deliver more affordable, reliable and secure power.

Separate from the Elementl announcement, Google already has an agreement in place with Kairos Power to deploy 500 MW of nuclear capacity by 2035.

Kairos Power recently began nuclear construction on its Hermes reactor, which is one of several advanced reactor projects being supported by DOE.

The low-power reactor will be used to inform its commercial fluoride salt-cooled high temperature reactor anticipated to be deployed in the early 2030s.

The Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) plays a critical role in connecting emerging developers like Elementl with national laboratory resources and expertise.

The Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), NASA’s top climate monitoring lab located above the diner made famous by Seinfeld, will close after nearly 60 years due to an executive order reviewing federal leases.

About 130 scientists are being forced to work remotely without a clear plan for relocation, as the administration seeks to slash NASA’s Earth science funding by 50%.

Despite the building’s modest lease and recent multimillion-dollar renovations, the shutdown appears driven more by ideology than cost-saving, sparking concern among former and current GISS scientists.

Key quote:

“They are trying to kill the messenger with the bad news, it’s crazy.”

— Dr. James Hansen, former director of GISS

Why this matters:

Climate science doesn’t happen in a vacuum — it needs infrastructure, continuity, and institutional support. GISS has played a critical role in shaping our understanding of global warming, from building the first climate models to documenting the accelerating pace of planetary heating. Its closure threatens not just a symbolic center of climate research, but the very mechanisms by which we monitor and respond to environmental change. Shuttering this lab sends a message that scientific expertise, especially in politically sensitive areas like climate, can be sidelined.

In short:

Senate Republicans bypassed the usual 60-vote threshold to push through a resolution overturning U.S. Environmental Protection Agency waivers that permit California to impose stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal rules.

The maneuver invoked the Congressional Review Act in a “novel” way, despite objections from the Senate parliamentarian and the Government Accountability Office, who said the act did not apply to the California waivers.

Democrats argued the move undermines Senate procedure and states’ rights, accusing Republicans of favoring the fossil fuel industry and setting a dangerous precedent for future legislative fights.

California’s aggressive clean air policies have long set the pace for national vehicle emissions standards. Nearly a dozen other states follow its lead, making its rules de facto national benchmarks. Blocking California’s authority would not only reshape how climate policy is made in the U.S., but could also stall the transition away from fossil fuels in the transportation sector—one of the nation’s biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions.

In short:

The Interior Department will assess a request by Impossible Metals to mine nearly 30,000 square miles of seabed in U.S. territorial waters off American Samoa.

The move follows President Trump’s April executive order pushing federal agencies to expedite seabed mining permits, even in contested international waters.

Environmental and legal pushback continues, as critics say unilateral U.S. action violates international norms and risks deep-sea ecosystems that are poorly understood.

Key quote:

“As soon as the executive order came out, that very much directed the different groups to accelerate and prioritize deep-sea mining.”

— Oliver Gunasekara, CEO of Impossible Metals

Why this matters:

Deep-sea mining offers access to minerals like cobalt, nickel, and manganese — critical for electric vehicles, renewable energy, and defense technologies — but at potentially high environmental costs. These ecosystems, found thousands of feet below the ocean’s surface, remain largely unexplored and may host ancient life forms uniquely adapted to extreme pressure and darkness. Disrupting the seabed to extract mineral nodules could irreversibly damage fragile habitats and threaten species not yet studied by science. Moreover, sediment plumes and noise pollution from mining operations may ripple through the marine food chain.

While most countries await international consensus through the United Nations-backed International Seabed Authority, the U.S. — which never ratified the Law of the Sea treaty — is pushing ahead unilaterally. American Samoa, with limited political representation and a history of environmental vulnerability, stands at the intersection of global power, corporate ambition, and Indigenous rights.

In short:

An EF-3 tornado with 150-mph winds struck St. Louis on May 16, killing five people and destroying hundreds of structures, including historic Black-owned businesses.

Despite known gaps in emergency siren coverage and digital alert systems, no warnings reached many residents; half of North City heard no sirens, and many lacked smartphone access to modern notification platforms.

The Trump administration recently cut nearly $1 billion from Federal Emergency Management Agency programs intended for disaster resilience in Black and low-income neighborhoods and is actively attempting to dismantle the agency.

Key quote:

“We were giving people water not because they didn’t have pipes, but because they couldn’t afford it before the tornado.”

— Antoine White, rapper and organizer with HandsUp United

Why this matters:

Tornadoes don’t discriminate, but the systems meant to protect people from them often do. When a tornado ripped through St. Louis, it revealed how decades of racial segregation, underinvestment, and neglect put Black neighborhoods at greater risk. In places like North City, where emergency sirens failed and internet access is scarce, residents had no warning. The federal response was slow to arrive, just weeks after the government slashed funding designed to build safer infrastructure in vulnerable communities. These are not isolated incidents. Studies show that Black counties receive significantly less disaster preparedness funding, face higher insurance premiums, and suffer more damage during storms — even when weather conditions are identical. As climate change intensifies weather extremes, the disparity in who gets help and who doesn’t is widening.

In short:

UN climate chief Simon Stiell said clear climate policies can drive economic recovery and investment, pointing to recent droughts in Panama that disrupted global trade as a sign of worsening instability.

Rich nations face pressure to deliver promised climate finance, but funding gaps loom large after the U.S. pulled back from the Paris agreement and slashed foreign aid under President Trump.

A coalition of 80+ organizations urged the UK to boost climate finance through taxes on fossil fuels and luxury emissions, arguing public support is strong and action is a matter of global justice.

Key quote:

“Famine is back, and the role of global heating cannot be ignored.”

— Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change

Why this matters:

Climate-driven disruptions to trade, food supply, and infrastructure are no longer distant warnings — they’re reshaping the global economy now. The UN climate chief’s comments underscore how worsening droughts, like those hitting the Panama Canal choke off supply chains and inflate food prices, pushing millions toward hunger. Poorer nations, which have contributed least to global warming, are hit hardest and are struggling to build resilience without sufficient international help. Climate finance was designed to address this injustice, but promises made by wealthy countries are evaporating under new political leadership and shrinking aid budgets.

In short:

Glacial retreat in Alaska and British Columbia is transforming cold, sediment-choked rivers into clearer, warmer streams and lakes that could support expanding salmon populations in the decades to come.

At the same time, mining companies are rapidly staking claims in these newly exposed landscapes, fueled by record gold prices and high demand for copper, raising alarm among Indigenous groups and fisheries advocates.

Though new salmon habitat could emerge across nearly 4,000 miles of river by century’s end, much of it lies near existing or proposed mining sites, including projects without formal consent from downstream communities.

Key quote:

Are critical minerals “more critical than our lives? More critical than the fish?”

— Richard Peterson, president of the Tlingit and Haida government

Why this matters:

The race for minerals and the reshaping of ecosystems due to melting glaciers is a collision of environmental consequence and economic ambition. Salmon, already facing pressures from warming seas and dwindling freshwater flows, may find refuge in glacial waters that are now becoming more hospitable as ice recedes. But these same landscapes are becoming targets for mining companies lured by copper and gold, often aided by government subsidies. For Indigenous communities in Alaska and Canada, this trade-off is especially fraught: Salmon are both a vital food source and a cultural touchstone. As exploration moves into sensitive watersheds, calls are growing for stricter regulations, cross-border agreements, and Indigenous consent. Yet with glacial landscapes transforming faster than environmental policies can adapt, the outcome could determine whether these new salmon habitats become ecological lifelines or casualties of industrial expansion.

In short:

Pope Leo XIV, formerly Robert Prevost, has a history of environmental engagement, including partnerships with Indigenous and interfaith rainforest initiatives during his tenure in Latin America.

In past public remarks, he criticized exploitative interpretations of biblical dominion over nature, emphasized the need for reciprocity with the environment, and called for ethical scrutiny of new technologies.

His chosen papal name references Pope Leo XIII, whose 1891 encyclical launched modern Catholic social teaching, suggesting a similar commitment to confronting today’s economic and ecological crises.

Key quote:

""The great command that Jesus taught is to love your neighbor as yourself. We can't do that anymore without caring for creation, because the damage done to creation is undermining the well being of the neighbor.""

— Erin Lothes, environmental theologian with the Laudato Si’ Movement

Why this matters:

As climate disasters grow more frequent and severe, many faith leaders are amplifying calls to care for the Earth not just as a moral duty, but as a spiritual imperative. Pope Leo XIV, as an American with direct experience in Latin American environmental issues, is uniquely positioned to bridge cultural divides on climate discourse. His background also allows him to speak persuasively to industrialized nations most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions. Faith-based advocacy has already pushed companies, governments, and communities toward renewable energy and conservation. By embracing ecological values as central to Catholic teaching, the new pope could invigorate grassroots and institutional efforts alike.

Every single Democratic member of the House voted against the bill.

This legislation introduces provisions that would effectively kill the job-creating investments in the Inflation Reduction Act by rendering the law’s tax credits for clean energy and advanced manufacturing unusable and sunsetting them early. Recently released modeling from Energy Innovation found that the Republican bill would cost Americans more than 830,000 jobs for just the year of 2030, and 720,000 jobs for just the year 2035. These numbers do not account for the likely cancellations of planned clean energy manufacturing facilities.

“These clean energy tax credits have been a game changer for communities across the nation, including in the districts of the Republican representatives,” said BlueGreen Alliance Executive Director Jason Walsh. “The GOP caved to the MAGA extremists in their party so they could screw over America’s workers to stuff the pockets of billionaires.”

Additional research suggests killing the credits will increase costs for American families. Other harmful provisions include:

Repealing the Clean Vehicle Tax Credits;

Repealing the Clean Hydrogen Tax Credit;

Clawing back unspent funds for air quality monitoring in schools, clean manufacturing, state and community energy programs, and electric grid upgrades;

Defunding and delaying the Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP), which reduces pollution and protects the health of workers and communities;

Clawing back all unspent Inflation Reduction Act funds, including many provisions that would have lowered energy bills, created jobs, and reduced pollution; and

Attacks on additional Inflation Reduction Act programs and initiatives.

“Every single Republican that said they were going to stand up for jobs in their districts either voted for this atrocity or didn’t vote,” said Walsh. “These folks just voted to kill good-paying jobs and huge private investment in their hometowns.”

In March, a group of Republican Representatives, led by Rep. Andrew Garbarino (NY-2), penned a letter calling for the protection of the tax credits. Those Representatives are: Reps. Juan Ciscomani (AZ-6), David Valadao (CA-22), Young Kim (CA-40), Earl “Buddy” Carter (GA-1), Mariannette Miller-Meeks (IA-1), Erin Houchin (IN-9), Don Bacon (NE-2), Thomas Kean, Jr. (NJ-7), Mark Amodei (NV-2), Nick LaLota (NY-1), Michael Lawler (NY-17), David Joyce (OH-14), Jennifer Kiggans (VA-2), Vince Fong (CA-20), Jeff Hurd (CO-3), Gabe Evans (CO-8), John James (MI-10), Ryan Mackenzie (PA-7), Rob Bresnahan (PA-8), Dan Newhouse (WA-4). While Garbarino himself did not show up for last night’s vote, all the other signers voted for the bill.

,Kentucky Environment,2025-05-22 17:12:39+00:00,KGOU,Community groups say Louisiana is trying to stop them from monitoring air pollution - KGOU,Michael Copley,,,,,https://www.kgou.org/science-technology-and-environment/2025-05-22/community-groups-say-louisiana-is-trying-to-stop-them-from-monitoring-air-pollution,"Community groups in Louisiana have filed a federal lawsuit alleging a state law that regulates air-pollution monitoring violates their constitutional rights.
Air testing by community groups can fill gaps in monitoring programs conducted by industry and state regulators, advocates say, and provide real-time alerts when accidents happen.
Several community groups said in a complaint in Louisiana federal court on Thursday that the law's ""onerous restrictions"" violate their rights to free speech and to petition the government.
""I'm not sure how regulating community air monitoring programs 'violates their constitutional rights,'"" Murril said in a statement to NPR.
""We've asked people, can you give us an example of where community air monitoring data has been misused in a government enforcement case?","Community groups in Louisiana have filed a federal lawsuit alleging a state law that regulates air-pollution monitoring violates their constitutional rights.

Private organizations have been using low-cost air sensors to detect toxic pollution from the state's refineries and chemical plants. The testing, some of which has been funded by the Environmental Protection Agency, serves as a critical line of defense, environmental and public health advocates say, especially for residents of an industrial corridor in Louisiana known as Cancer Alley. Air testing by community groups can fill gaps in monitoring programs conducted by industry and state regulators, advocates say, and provide real-time alerts when accidents happen.

Last year, Louisiana lawmakers put new requirements on those community testing activities. The law says that for community groups to allege violations of environmental rules, they have to use federally-approved monitoring equipment, and it sets restrictions for analyzing and sharing the data.

Several community groups said in a complaint in Louisiana federal court on Thursday that the law's ""onerous restrictions"" violate their rights to free speech and to petition the government.

""This is just an obvious attempt to keep citizen groups from doing any monitoring,"" says David Bookbinder, a lawyer for the plaintiffs and the director of law and policy at the Environmental Integrity Project, which helps frontline communities push for tough environmental standards.

""The impact has been muzzling — groups either stopping doing monitoring, not starting to do monitoring that they wanted to do or no longer publishing results,"" Bookbinder says.

The community groups' free-speech claims are based on Louisiana's alleged restrictions on ""publicly discussing, advocating for cleanup action, or warning people about potentially dangerous air pollution"" when it's detected using air monitors that don't meet federal standards, according to the Environmental Integrity Project.

Jo Banner, co-director of The Descendants Project, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, says the new law has made it harder to take action against polluters.

""We are prepared to just keep moving forward with the work that we've been doing and trying our best to communicate that to the public,"" Banner says. She adds, ""If we have [data] that is alarming, our community needs to know for their own safety.""

Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said she'll fight the lawsuit. ""I'm not sure how regulating community air monitoring programs 'violates their constitutional rights,'"" Murril said in a statement to NPR.

The state's Department of Environmental Quality declined to comment on pending litigation. The bill's sponsor, Republican Sen. Eddie Lambert, didn't respond to messages seeking comment.

The air-monitoring law, which had bipartisan support, says the intent is to ensure the public gets ""accurate air quality information.""

David Cresson, chief executive of the Louisiana Chemical Association, said in a statement that the air-monitoring law doesn't prevent community groups from collecting or sharing data. ""What this law clarifies is that if air monitoring data is going to be used to trigger regulatory enforcement, penalties, or as the sole source for a lawsuit, it must meet the same EPA-approved standards already required of industry and government agencies,"" Cresson said.

Critics say ambiguities in the law are part of the problem

George Wyeth, a visiting scholar at the Environmental Law Institute, says the law is still concerning. For example, if community groups detect high levels of certain pollutants in their area and suggest there's been an environmental violation, it's unclear if that would break the new law. It's also unclear, Wyeth says, what groups have to do when they analyze and communicate air-pollution data to comply with the law.

""If I were a community member, I wouldn't know what some of these [requirements] meant, and I would probably just stay away from it,"" says Wyeth, a former EPA lawyer who isn't involved in the lawsuit.

Kentucky recently enacted a law that's similar to Louisiana's.

Those laws were passed following several years during which community groups conducted more air monitoring as lower-cost testing equipment became widely available, says Jay Benforado, board chair of the Association for Advancing Participatory Sciences, which isn't involved in the Louisiana lawsuit.

However, Benforado says it's unclear if there's an actual problem that needs solving by passing laws like those in Louisiana and Kentucky. ""We've asked people, can you give us an example of where community air monitoring data has been misused in a government enforcement case? And we haven't come across any examples,"" he says.

Banner of The Descendants Project says the Louisiana law effectively labels groups like hers as ""troublemakers.""

""If you want to see bipartisan cooperation, you should look to Louisiana and the way that we invite industry to come in, and the dangers that communities face,"" Banner says. ""And both sides, all sides, support this.""

Democratic state lawmakers who represent Banner's district didn't respond to a message seeking comment.

""It is the job of our regulatory agencies to protect us, to protect our air, to protect our health. And if that standard is not being met and people are going out to do it by themselves, that seems to be indicating that there's a problem at that first step,"" says Peter DeCarlo, an atmospheric chemist at Johns Hopkins University who has studied air pollution in Louisiana.

DeCarlo was part of a team of researchers that found the toxic gas ethylene oxide in parts of Louisiana at levels that were significantly higher than EPA estimates for the region. That suggests residents there face much greater cancer risks than previously thought, DeCarlo says.

""Now, there's retaliation against community groups for going out and trying to figure out what's going on in their air,"" DeCarlo says, ""and if they're being impacted, and how they're being impacted.""
